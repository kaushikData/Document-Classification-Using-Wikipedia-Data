The '''Anglia Building Society''' in the [[United Kingdom]] was originally formed by the merger of the Northampton Town and County and Leicestershire [[building societies]] in 1966. In 1987, it merged with [[Nationwide Building Society]], becoming '''Nationwide Anglia Building Society''' before reverting to the Nationwide name in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutuals.fsa.gov.uk/SocietyDetails.aspx?Number=355&amp;Suffix=B Mutuals Public Register] (No. 355B) Financial Services Authority (retrieved 17 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Northampton Town and County ===
The Northampton Town and County Freehold Land Society was formed in 1848, later becoming Northampton Town and County Benefit Building Society. In 1950, the Wellingborough Town and District Permanent Benefit Building Society transferred engagements and in 1953, it became simply Northampton Town and County Building Society. This Society absorbed a number of other societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsa.org.uk/docs/consumerpdfs/yearbooknamechangepart1.pdf Extract from Building Societies Yearbook 2009/10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109054139/http://www.bsa.org.uk/docs/consumerpdfs/yearbooknamechangepart1.pdf |date=2013-11-09 }} (p.154) Building Societies Association (retrieved 17 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be confused with Hinckley Permanent, which on merger with Rugby Provident became [[Hinckley and Rugby Building Society]] in 1983 or the unconnected Leicester Building Society, which on merger with Alliance Building Society became [[Alliance and Leicester]] in 1984&lt;/ref&gt; This merged with the Northampton Town and County in 1966, to form the Anglia. The new Society, headquartered in [[Northampton]], absorbed a number of other societies.

===Hastings and Thanet===
In 1978, the Society transferred its engagements to the Hastings and Thanet Building Society, itself formed by the merger of the Hastings Permanent and [[Isle of Thanet]] building societies in 1951, becoming for a short time '''Anglia Hastings and Thanet Building Society'''.  In 1979, the Grimsby Building Society transferred engagements and in 1980, it once again became known as Anglia Building Society.

==Life==
Born to free parents in [[Havana]], Medina received elementary school education before working as a tailor. Work at the [[Tacón Theater]] introduced him to Havana's literary and theatrical scene, and he befriended the Afro-Cuban poets [[Gabriel de la Concepción Valdés]] and [[Juan Francisco Manzano]]. In 1842 he helped found ''El Faro'', Havana's first newspaper for people of color. Pursuing an education, Medina qualified as an elementary schoolteacher in 1850. He founded a school for people of color, Nuestra Señora de los Desamparados (Our Lady of the Abandoned), and directed it until 1878. In 1856 he and [[Anselmo Font]] founded the first black Cuban literary journal, ''El Rocio'', although only one issue was published.&lt;ref name="AppiahGates2005"/&gt;

The '''Art Renewal Center''' ('''ARC''') is a non-profit, educational organization, which hosts an online museum dedicated to realist art.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=sWeMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=art+renewal+center&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie4u7_nOjZAhVQd6wKHcoKDOQQ6AEIYDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=art%20renewal%20center|title=Master Narratives and their Discontents|last=Elkins|first=James|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781135872571|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARC was founded by [[New Jersey]] businessman and art collector Fred Ross.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/08/20/Gifted-artist-Bouguereau-s-work-controversial-more-than-a-century-after-his-death/stories/200708200191|title=Gifted artist?

Particular emphasis is given to nineteenth-century [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], who is represented by more than 226 images on the site; Ross says that Bouguereau's work is accessed twice as often as any other artist on the site.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
The Art Renewal Center is devoted to the rehabilitation of late nineteenth-century academic painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zzMrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Art+Renewal+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1u7WW5urZAhVK_4MKHdVTDr44ChDoAQg1MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Art%20Renewal%20Center%22|title=The Art and Thought of John La Farge: Picturing Authenticity in Gilded Age America|last=Kresser|first=Katie|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781351546461|location=|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross feels that there has been a "concerted and relentless effort to disparage, denigrate and obliterate the reputations, names and brilliance of the academic artistic masters of the late 19th century." The Art Renewal Center is intended as a platform for Ross and his supporters to "extol the virtues of academic artists and castigate nearly everything associated with modern art."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ARC describes itself as offering "responsible views opposing that of the current art establishment".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Bouguereau Nymphs and Satyr MMA cr.jpg|thumb|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], ''Nymphs and Satyr'', 1873, [[Clark Art Institute]]]]
Ross is a strong admirer of Adolphe Bouguereau's work. In 2002 he spoke to the New York Society of Portrait Artists and described the impression made on him in the Clark Art Institute (Williamstown, Massachusetts) by Bouguereau's {{convert|8.5|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} painting, ''Nymphs and Satyr'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Frozen in place, gawking with my mouth agape, cold chills careening up and down my spine, I was virtually gripped as if by a spell that had been cast. Years of undergraduate courses and another 60 credits post-graduate in art, and I had never heard [Bouguereau's] name. Who was he? Was he important? Anyone who could have done this must surely be deserving of the highest accolades in the art world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/08/20/Gifted-artist-Bouguereau-s-work-controversial-more-than-a-century-after-his-death/stories/200708200191|title=Gifted artist?

==Reception==
Artist and blogger [[Mark Vallen]] stated on his web site that the ARC assertions "are not incorrect when noting the follies of modern art, but their total rejection of it is beyond the pale and thoroughly reactionary." Vallen was critical of Bouguereau: "Bouguereau's strength was his dedication to the craft of painting, and his technical mastery of oil painting can't be denied. If today's artists knew but a fraction of the painting skills possessed and employed by Bouguereau, they would be better off. Nevertheless, Bouguereau was also imprisoned by his extremely conservative vision of what painting could be—and that was his greatest weakness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Asian Americans]] have been involved in the [[entertainment industry]] since the first half of the 19th century, when [[Chang and Eng Bunker]] (the original "[[Siamese Twins]]") became naturalized citizens.&lt;ref name="faizhao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faizhao.blogdriver.com/faizhao/521445.html |title=We Are Siamese Twins-Fai的分裂生活 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222182830/http://faizhao.blogdriver.com/faizhao/521445.html |archivedate=2007-12-22 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting roles in [[television]], [[film]], and [[theater]] were relatively few, and many available roles were for narrow, stereotypical characters. Early Asian American actors such as [[Sessue Hayakawa]], [[Anna May Wong]], and [[Bruce Lee]] encountered a movie-making culture that wanted to cast them as caricatures. Or like actress [[Merle Oberon]] who hid her heritage so she wouldn't have been discriminated by Hollywood's racist laws.

Bruce Lee abandoned [[Hollywood]] in the early 1970s and achieved worldwide fame in [[Hong Kong]]. On another level, frustrated with the limited opportunities given to them, seven Asian American actors formed [[East West Players]] (EWP), a [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Asian American theater]] company, in 1965, to produce their own shows, and the company continues today.

Bruce Lee has made a substantial impact with martial arts and entertainment.  He claimed to not fit into the established martial arts scene in San Francisco when he arrived in 1959.  Lee encountered a diverse group of martial artists within the bay area who held a similar philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walters|first=Jared|date=2017|title=Striking Distance: Bruce Lee and the Dawn of Martial Arts in America|url=|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=44|pages=527-528|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee signed a two-film contract, eventually bringing his family over to Hong Kong as well.  Towards the end of 1972, Lee was a major movie star in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/bruce-lee-9542095|title=Bruce Lee|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, young Asian American comedians and filmmakers have also found an outlet on [[YouTube]] and the Internet, allowing them to gain a strong and loyal fanbase. Notable YouTubers include comedians such as [[Nigahiga|Ryan Higa]], [[Kevin Wu]],  entertainers such as Dan Chan and [[Christine Gambito]]; musicians such as [[MC Jin]], [[Far East Movement]], [[Sam Tsui]], [[David Choi]], and [[Kina Grannis]]; and the filmmaking group [[Wong Fu Productions]]. These entertainers have gained notable followings, mainly with young Asian American students, through solo and collaborative videos, short films and tours.

Additionally, other Asian American artists have broken out into mainstream audiences beyond the Asian American community. Those include artists such as [[Bruno Mars]], [[Darren Criss]], and [[The Slants]].

[[Chang and Eng Bunker]] had a stable career in entertainment.&lt;ref name="faizhao" /&gt;
Cheng and Eng Buker were conjoined twins who rose to popularity known as the "Siamese Twins" in the 19th century. They were born in 1811 in a village sixty miles from Bangkok. Cheng and Eng were conjoined at the chest at birth, thus starting their career as a human spectacle. They were gawked at in their own country before coming to America at age eighteen. Touring city to city, they were well received, giving performances that featured their unique physiognomy and also highlighted their distinctive wit and innate intelligence. After ten years, at the age of twenty-eight, Chang and Eng retired and decided to settle down in Wilkes County in western North Carolina where they also adopted the surname "Bunker." In North Carolina, they married sisters Sarah Ann and Adelaide yates and began their lives as southern gentlemen by managing their individual households, plantations, and slaves. The former Siamese Twins from the countryside outside of Bangkok became the wealthiest men in the county and the patriarchs of two large families (between the two, there were twenty-one children). When need be, they returned to touring in order to accumulate more funds. In 1873, both Chang and Eng passed away at age sixty-two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edspmu&amp;AN=edspmu.S2325689316100319&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite few Asian/Asian-American entertainers in the 19th century, many entertainment platforms attempt to depict accurate occurrences in 19th century Asia, such as Dunhuang Performative Arts company and their performances exhibiting the journey of the Silk Road in "Dunhuang, My Dreamland." The show portrays Daoist priest Wang Yuanlu in accurate garb and performed by an appropriate actor, Chen Yizong. The playwright sets the stage at the Dunhunag Magao Caves which was historically important for travelers along the Silk Road, especially Buddhist monks from India and central Asia while on their journey to Chang'an (now Xi'an). Among meditations, the caves were used to reference the monastery's texts and records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=2b77d225-63bc-442f-8789-b6cceb49cf6a@sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=4203&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=118830577&amp;db=ufh] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna May Wong]] was the first actor of Asian descent to be the leading star of an American television series when she starred on the television series ''[[The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anna May Wong Did It Right |first=Richard|last=Corliss |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1022536,00.html |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |date=29 January 2005 |accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Takei Sulu Star Trek.JPG|thumb|upright|George Takei as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu in the 1960s show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'']]
[[George Takei]] and [[Pat Morita]] became famous for supporting roles in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Happy Days]]''. In 1976, Morita starred on the first American sitcom centered on a person of Asian descent, ''[[Mr. T and Tina]]'' and went on to become widely known as the mentor Mr. Miyagi in ''The Karate Kid'' movies of the 1980s. Other Asian Americans from this period include [[Bruce Lee]] on ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' and [[Jack Soo]] of ''[[Barney Miller]]''.

[[Margaret Cho]], stand-up comedian and actress, had a leading role in her own comedy series ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]]'' in the 1990s. Her character was a Korean-American (as is Cho), who struggled with her family and cultural issues in San Francisco. The series included other Asian American actors such as [[Amy Hill]]. Despite being groundbreaking in prime-time television, ''All American Girl'' was cancelled after one season due to low ratings. After its run, due to the way it was handled and the pressures that were forced on her to conform to vague mainstream expectations to try to make the series a success, Cho suffered a huge psychotic break and self-disappointment that led to her drug and alcohol addiction. (It would later be revealed that female stars of even successful sitcoms go through similar trials as related by Roseanne Barr in her story for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barr |first=Roseanne |url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/upfronts/2011/roseanne-barr-2011-5/ |title=Roseanne Barr on the Lack of Change in the TV Industry – New York Magazine |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Cho has since regained popularity and success from her 2000 one-woman show ''[[I'm the One That I Want]]'' and through her current involvement on ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'' on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].

Although not an actor, Jon Gosselin has received from the reality series ''[[Kate Plus 8|Jon and Kate Plus 8]]'' sex symbol status. [[Masi Oka]] starred on the cast of the television series ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' is also the only lead actor on the series to be nominated for either an [[Emmy Award]] or [[Golden Globe Award]]. Along with Ramamurthy and Oka, [[James Kyson Lee]] also starred on ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''.

Butterfly]]'' and is the only actor to have won a Tony Award, a Drama Desk Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, among others currently stars on ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' after being featured in the series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''.

[[File:Anna May Wong - portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Anna May Wong in a [[Paramount Pictures]] publicity photo, circa 1935]]
[[Anna May Wong]] was the first Asian American to have become an international acting star.&lt;ref&gt;Gan 1995, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; She became a fashion icon during the [[silent film]] era, beginning with her success in the film ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' (1922), the first color feature to be made in Hollywood. During her career she sought roles that portrayed Chinese and Asian Americans in a positive light, but these films never became famous except for a select few such as the film ''[[Daughter of Shanghai]]'' (1937). Frustrated by being stereotyped and typecast during her career in the United States, she moved to Europe, where she appeared in many plays and films, the most notable of which was the British film ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'' (1929). She later returned to the United States in an ironic twist, at a time when American studios were searching Europe for fresh new talent, despite the fact that she is an [[Americans|American]]. She returned with promises of leading roles, but these did not come about due to racism in the United States. She eventually stopped acting in professional films and turned to stage, cabaret, [[B movie]]s, and [[anti-Japanese propaganda]] films such as ''[[Bombs Over Burma]]'' (1943) due to her being an advocacy against the [[Japan]]ese aggression in [[China]]. She was set to make her comeback with the film ''[[Flower Drum Song (film)|Flower Drum Song]]'' (1961) but was unable due to failing health. Despite a prolific career Wong's only film to have ever been a truly big success was ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932).

He became the first male sex symbol of Hollywood long before and the precursor to [[Rudolph Valentino]].&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36q95lsMQvI |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; His fame rivaled that of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref name="DukePress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/books.php3?isbn=978-0-8223-3969-4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620221945/http://www.dukeupress.edu/books.php3?isbn=978-0-8223-3969-4|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 June 2009|title=Books at Duke University Press|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldsea" /&gt; His fame began during the [[silent film]] era, leading into sound pictures in his later life. He became a film actor in a somewhat reluctant and accidental manner when the famous producer [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]] saw his theatre play ''The Typhoon'' and wanted to turn it into a silent film and when it was released the film was an instant hit. With rising stardom he was eventually offered film contract by [[Famous Players-Lasky]] now [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Silent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/people/actors/Hayakawa-Sessue.html|title=Silent Era : People|website=Silentera.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second film with the production company, ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), was a success and made him a romantic hit with U.S. female audiences. He became a leading man of [[romance film]]s, considered a heartthrob and a sex symbol; many actresses wanted to work with him in films, in which he was often cast as the exotic male Asian lover that women desired. After years of being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have, he decided to start his own production company, where he eventually made 23 films; he produced, starred in, and directed them, and contributed to their design, writing and editing. His films also influenced the way the United States viewed Asians.&lt;ref name="goldsea" /&gt; He personally chose American actress [[Marin Sais]] to appear opposite him in his films such as ''The City of Dim Faces'' and ''His Birthright''. Hayakawa's collaboration with Sais ended with the film ''Bonds of Honor'' (1919). In 1919, Hayakawa made what is generally considered one of his best films, ''[[The Dragon Painter]]''. After some bad business, he left the United States and for the next 15 years he worked in Europe and Japan where he made many popular films and plays such as the films ''The Great Prince Chan'' and the play ''Samurai'' which he performed for the king and queen of the United Kingdom at that time [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and a stage play version of ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. His fame in France came from France's fascination with anything Asian.&lt;ref name="goldsea" /&gt; In the 1930s with the rise of [[sound film|Talkies]] and growing [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|Anti-Japanese sentiment]] due to [[World War II]]. During the war, he tried to perform in Europe but eventually became trapped by the Germans and for years was not able to work as an actor until [[Humphrey Bogart]] tracked him and down and offered him a role in his film ''[[Tokyo Joe (film)|Tokyo Joe]]'' (1949) which became a hit and afterwards he did another successful film ''[[Three Came Home]]'' (1950). After the war his image in films this time was as the honorable villain which he became typecasted as and from it he starred in what is considered to be his most famous film of his entire career ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957) for which he was nominated for both an [[Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]].

In addition, his first two features, ''Pushing Hands'' and ''The Wedding Banquet'', both set in the United States, deal primarily with Taiwanese and Chinese American characters and their attempts to navigate between the demands of their ancestral traditions and contemporary American culture. ''Pushing Hands'' deals with an interracial marriage where the man, of Chinese ancestry, has brought his traditional-minded father to live with the family, which is a source of tension with his wife until they learn to appreciate one another's cultures. ''The Wedding Banquet'' is a comedy that deals with a young, prosperous Taiwanese-born gay man who lives and works in New York, and his attempts to conceal his sexual orientation from his visiting parents, who are pushing him to marry.

Wong later wrote, produced and directed horror and action films such as ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000) and the [[Jet Li]]-starring ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' (2001), and he was hired by 20th Century Fox to direct ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]'' (2009), although like other producers and crew members on that production, complained of having little creative input as the studio made all the major decisions. As part of the initial production crew on ''The X-Files'', Wong was among the most influential four writer-producers who worked closely with ''X-Files'' creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] to define the characters, plots and aesthetics of the new series (the others were [[Glen Morgan]], [[Howard Gordon]] and [[Alex Gansa]]). Wong was responsible with his longtime writing partner [[Glen Morgan]] for introducing a number of elements that defined ''The X-Files'' throughout its run. Wong co-wrote "[[Squeeze (The X-Files)|Squeeze]]," only the second ''X-Files'' episode ever produced, and the first "[[monster of the week]]" episode, which would provide a template for two thirds of the future episodes of the series; "[[Ice (The X-Files)|Ice]]," the first episode to focus centrally on the Mulder/Scully relationship as the key to its plot; "[[Beyond the Sea (The X-Files)|Beyond the Sea]]," the first episode to receive notable critical acclaim beyond the science fiction genre, the first episode with serious character development for [[Gillian Anderson]] in her role as [[Dana Scully]], and also Carter's personal favorite episode of the series; "[[E.B.E. (The X-Files)|E.B.E.]]," the first episode to introduce [[The Lone Gunmen]] trio of characters, whose popularity resulted in their own short-lived spinoff series (without Wong's participation) in 2001; "[[Tooms (The X-Files)|Tooms]]," the first episode to introduce the character of [[Walter Skinner]], Mulder and Scully's boss, who would become a more central character over the remainder of the series, and also the first episode to give a speaking part to the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]], the main nemesis of Mulder and Scully for most of the series' run; "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]," the first [[mythology of The X-Files|mythology]] episode to make use of voiceover and flashback; "[[Blood (The X-Files)|Blood]]," the first episode to include a story contribution from Glen Morgan's brother [[Darin Morgan]], who would become the most acclaimed ''X-Files'' writer and the only one to win an Emmy for his writing; "[[3 (The X-Files)|3]]," the first episode in which Mulder or Scully was involved in a sexual situation; "[[One Breath (X-Files Episode)|One Breath]]," the resolution episode for the abduction plot that was the foundation of the series' long running mythology; "[[Die Hand Die Verletzt]]," the first episode in which [[Kim Manners]], who became the series' most prolific director over its nine seasons, was brought on board to direct, being an acquaintance of Morgan and Wong from their work with Manners on previous TV series; and "[[Home (The X-Files)|Home]]," the first episode to be preceded by a warning from the network that it was intended for mature audiences only due to its disturbing content. James Wong, in his directorial debut, also directed the episode "[[Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man]]," for which he received an [[Emmy]] nomination, also becoming the first member of the series's regular writing staff (after Chris Carter) to direct an episode, as well as the only [[person of color]] to ever direct an X-Files episode. Wong's Emmy nomination for directing "Musings" made him the first Asian American to receive an Emmy nomination for directing anything on television; at that time, no Asian American and no person of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent had yet been nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for directing a film. Wong was also, along with Chris Carter (nominated a year later) the only director of an ''X-Files'' episode to be Emmy nominated for his work. As part of ''The X-Files'' main production team in 1994–1995, Wong shared the show's first [[Golden Globe Award]] win for Best Dramatic Series, and also shared its second win (''The X-Files'' would become the first series to win a Golden Globe three times) in the 1996–1997 season.

=== Painting ===
Asian American art is one of the last genres to be added to modern day collections; however, many notable painters have drawn inspiration from art techniques of Asian-origin. In the 19th century, painters like [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] and [[Van Gogh]] used various Japanese works as models for their artwork. At the same time, many Japanese painters were moving to California to blend their work with what would become new Western Techniques. Asian American art can mostly be traced back to the West Coast with artists also popping up in New York.

[[Paul Horiuchi]] was a Japanese-born American painter best known for his abstract collages of torn, hand-colored mulberry paper. Active in Seattle, he created the glass mural behind the [[Seattle Center]] amphitheater in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/File/3829|title=Horiuchi, Paul (1906-1999): Master of Collage|website=Historylink.org|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian-American [[Faris McReynolds]] is a Los Angeles-based artist and musician. [[Sueo Serisawa]] helped establish the California Impressionist style of painting. Los Angeles-based artists [[James Jean]] and [[David Choe]] have received domestic and international recognition within the [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art scene.

[[Martin Wong]] was a San Francisco and New York-based queer painter that made notable contributions to the 1980s East Village art scene. Wong was also involved with the growing New York graffiti art scene of this time and collected pieces from artists like [[Futura 2000]] and [[Keith Haring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/arts/design/graffiti-art-at-the-museum-of-the-city-of-new-york.html|title=Graffiti Art at the Museum of the City of New York|last=Johnson|first=Ken|date=2014-02-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the Japanese Internment Camps following [[WWII]] put a halt to a lot of Asian American artists. Art that resulted from this time serves as some of the only documentation of the trials and tribulations of the many Japanese Americans who were forced into camps.

[[Roger Shimomura]] is a painter and printmaker whose works combine pop culture motifs, racial stereotypes, and evocations of his childhood experiences in the Minidoka internment camp during World War II.

[[Abstract expressionism]] exploded onto the scene in the 1950s, drawing inspiration from [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael D. "Asian American Art." Asian American Art. The Michael D.

=== Sculpture ===
[[Isamu Noguchi]] was one of the most important American sculptors of the 20th century. Born in Los Angeles to a Japanese poet father and American writer mother, he spent most of his childhood in Japan, and his drew both from traditional Japanese aesthetics and international modernism. He worked many mediums, including clay, wood, and stainless steel, but is particularly associated with stone. In 1935 he began a career-long collaboration with dancer [[Martha Graham]] for whom he designed some 20 stage sets.  Major works include the Unesco headquarters peace garden in Paris, the Sunken Garden for the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and the Billy Rose Sculpture Garden for the Israeli Museum in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noguchi.org/noguchi/biography|title=Biography - The Noguchi Museum|website=Noguchi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Tsutakawa]] was a Seattle-based painter and sculptor best known for his avant-garde bronze fountain designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washington.edu/research/showcase/1947a.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304013641/http://www.washington.edu/research/showcase/1947a.html |archive-date=2017-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Gerard Tsutakawa]], who apprenticed with his father, is a contemporary Pacific Northwest sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monamuseum.org/artist/gerard-tsutakawa|title=Gerard Tsutakawa - MoNA|website=Monamuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portrayal of Asian Americans in Media ==

=== The Yellowface Trend ===
	The entertainment industry has created a negative discourse around the Asian American community, associating them, solely, with negative stereotypes such as the Dragon Lady, Fu Manchu, Charlie Chan, and foreigners. Implicit and explicit bias towards Asian Americans (AA's) leads to discrimination and thus results in an inaccurate representation and unequal employment in film, television, and society. The yellowface trend is one that is heavily impacting the employment of Asian Americans. As stated in University of San Francisco's Christina Shu Jien Chong's research journal, Yellow Facing was a go-to tactic for casting directors as early as the 1970s . Yellowface is applying makeup on a white actor or actress to make him or her appear more Asian. When a storyline cannot be changed from Asian to White, non-Asians are typically hired and then yellowface. Yellowface is a topic many believe has become obsolete, yet, in recent years, it has become more and more prominent; yet in today's society, in lieu of yellowface, casting directors are now blatantly opting for white actors and actresses over Asian American ones. The 1961 film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's ]]'' received near-universal condemnation for [[Mickey Rooney]]'s yellowface portrayal of [[I. Y. Yunioshi]]. More recently, in 2009, Justin Chatwin, a white actor, portrayed an anime character, Goku, in Dragonball: Evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1098327/|title=Dragonball: Evolution|date=10 April 2009|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Noah Ringer]], also a white actor, portrayed an Eastern Asian monk in ''[[The Last Airbender]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0938283/|title=The Last Airbender|date=1 July 2010|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]], a Mexican-American actor, portrayed a Chinese-American character, Tendo Choi, in ''[[Pacific Rim]]''.&lt;ref name="electra.lmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=118642305&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login|website=search.ebscohost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Emma Stone]], a white actress, portrayed a local Hawaiian character, Allison Ng, in ''[[Aloha (2015 film)|Aloha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1243974/|title=Aloha|date=29 May 2015|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent account of historical yellowface was in Disney on Ice's 2015 Dare to Dream production, in which Li Shang, a Chinese general from Mulan, was cast as a white male who wore a black wig and painted slanted eyes.&lt;ref name="electra.lmu.edu" /&gt; Other recent films that have whitewashed traditionally Asian characters include ''[[The Social Network]]'', ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', [[21 (2008 film)]] and ''[[Death Note (2017 film)|Death Note]]''.

=== Stereotyping of Asian Americans in Film: Dragon Lady/ Lotus Flower Dichotomy ===
[[Asian American]] characters and their representation in mainstream media, especially in the film and entertainment industry, are often one-dimensional and seriously lacking in depth. [[East Asian Americans]] in the film and media industry are often fetishized and exoticized, perpetuating damaging images of [[asian women]] as either the "[[dragon lady]]" or "[[lotus flower]]" dichotomy. An example is [[Lucy Liu]]’s dragon lady character O-Ren Ishii in ''[[Kill Bill]]'', as well as Anna May Wong's character in ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]''. According to author Kent Ono, "Usually yellow peril discourse constructs and Asian-white dialectic emphasizing the powerful, threatening potential of Asian's and Asian Americans, while simultaneously constructing whites as vulnerable, threatened, or otherwise in danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1NQ7PZhiO0sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=asian%20representation%20in%20the%20media#v=onepage&amp;q=asian%20representation%20in%20the%20media&amp;f=false|title=Asian Americans and the Media|first1=Kent A.|last1=Ono|first2=Vincent|last2=Pham|date=20 January 2009|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4273-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These limiting and offensive roles offered to Asian Americans further the US's exoticism and fetishism of Asian women, leading to terms such as "yellow fever".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=0822f2f7-74a9-454e-8dfc-69757154c022@sessionmgr4007&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4202&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=1999-00186-003&amp;db=psyh] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rosalind S. Chou in her book, "Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality", stereotypical portrayals of Asian Americans which lead to phenomenon's such as [[yellow fever]] can be particularly damaging to real life interracial relationships where she writes "it can be difficult to distinguish genuine interest from interest resting on fabricated constructions of an othered person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chou|first1=Rosalind S.|title=Asian American Sexual Politics|date=Jan 6, 2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=1-4422-0925-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Asian]] portrayal in cinema often involve "[[Karma Sutra]]" type analogies or imagery, an example being white actor [[Mike Myers]] and his role as Pitka in the movie "[[The Love Guru]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811138/|title=The Love Guru|date=20 June 2008|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Model minority ===
In The New York Times magazine in January 1966, the term "model minority" was coined by sociologist William Petersen in order to describe [[Japanese Americans]] as ethnic minorities who, despite marginalization, have achieved success in the United States. While it was first used to depict Japanese Americans, it has since evolved to characterize [[Asian Americans]] in general, specifically East Asians (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) and the South Asian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97Journal/Chu.html |title=Re-examining the Model Minority Myth: A Look at Southeast Asian Youth |date=12 December 2006 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212130042/http://www-mcnair.berkeley.edu/97Journal/Chu.html |archivedate=2006-12-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, this concept has faced major criticism from the Asian American community. According to [[Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Los Angeles]], "the misperception that Asian Americans are doing fine on their own has serious policy implications...politicians won't talk about our community's needs if they assume people don't require assistance."
This stereotype is often portrayed in media, such as television and film. Characters such as George Huang in [[Law &amp; Order: SVU]], [[Cristina Yang]] in [[Grey's Anatomy]], and [[Archie Kao]] in [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] are all examples of this.
In addition, in the second edition of her book, [https://www.amazon.com/Unraveling-Model-Minority-Stereotype-Listening-ebook/dp/B00CDAYBM8/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me= Unraveling the ''Model Minority'' Stereotype: Listening to Asian American Youth], Professor Stacy J. Lee argues that the ostensibly sterling stereotype was constructed to silence the charges of racial inequality and to delegitimize the protests of racial discrimination. Bob H. Suzuki also questions the validity of the stereotype, contending that it is only media hype, more myth than reality. Suzuki further argued that, deceptively flattering and favorable on the surface, the model minority stereotype is inaccurate, overgeneralized, and a liability for Asian Americans. The commendation of Asian Americans as a model minority implicitly denigrates other racial groups as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.natcom.org/CommCurrentsArticle.aspx?id=963|title=Perceptions of Asian American Students: Stereotypes and Effects|website=Natcom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~arezaei/ETEC444/discussion/asian.pdf |title=ss9703_21-32 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brazda lui Novac''' is a Roman ''[[limes]]'' in present-day [[Romania]], known also as '''Constantine's Wall'''.  It is believed by some historians like [[Alexandru Madgearu]] to border [[Ripa Gothica]].

The [[vallum]] of Brazda lui Novac starts from [[Drobeta]], nowadays it is visible to [[Ploiești]]. There is some evidence that the vallum eastern limit was the [[Siret River]]. The height of the vallum was 3 metres and the ditch was 2 metres deep. It is believed that the wall was raised during [[Tiberius Plautius Aelianus]]. Some historians such as [[Ioan Donat]] date the wall during the 1st century AD, others date the wall to 322 during [[Constantine I]].&lt;ref&gt;Madgearu, Alexandru (2008).

'''Contemporary ballet''' is a genre of [[dance]] that incorporates elements of [[classical ballet]] and [[modern dance]].&lt;ref name="washington ballet"&gt;{{cite web|title=ballet 101|url=http://www.washingtonballet.org/news-media/ballet-101/|website=the washington ballet|publisher=The Washington Ballet|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs classical [[ballet technique]] and in many cases classical [[pointe technique]] as well, but allows greater range of movement of the upper body and is not constrained to the rigorously defined body lines and forms found in traditional, classical ballet. Many of its attributes come from the ideas and innovations of 20th-century modern dance, including [[floor work]] and [[turn-in (dance)|turn-in]] of the legs.

==History==
[[File:G. Balanchine (young).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[George Balanchine]], a contemporary ballet pioneer]]
[[George Balanchine]]  is often considered to have been the first pioneer of contemporary ballet. However, the true origin of contemporary ballet is credited to Russian art producer Serge Diaghilev. Diaghilev wanted to bring an understanding of the arts to the general public. He created a program that combined all forms of the arts (painting, music, theater, and art) to present to the public. When this program had success in Russia, Diaghilev was inspired to bring it to a European audience by creating a new spin on classical ballet. He created Diaghilev's Russian Ballet Company, debuting the first show in 1909. However, Diaghilev was not a choreographer, he entrusted the evolvement of his creation to several well-known choreographers, one of them being George Balanchine. 

The style of dance Balanchine developed, which lies between classical ballet and today's contemporary ballet, is known by today's standards as [[neoclassical ballet]]. He used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, off-centered positions and non-traditional costumes, such as leotards, tunics and "powder puff" tutus&lt;ref name="dance magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Looseleaf|first1=Victoria|title=The story of the tutu|url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/October-2007/The-Story-of-the-Tutu|website=Dance magazine|publisher=DanceMedia, LLC|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of "pancake" tutus, to distance his work from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine invited modern dance performers such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] in to dance with his company, the [[New York City Ballet]], and he worked with modern dance choreographer [[Martha Graham]],&lt;ref name="paul taylor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Taylor Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-taylor-41059#synopsis|website=bio.|publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC.|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which expanded his exposure to modern techniques and ideas.&lt;ref name="washington ballet" /&gt; During this period, other choreographers such as John Butler and [[Glen Tetley]] began to consciously combine ballet and modern techniques in experimentation.

== Choreographers ==
One dancer who trained with Balanchine and absorbed much of this neoclassical style was [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Following Baryshnikov's appointment as artistic director of the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1980, he worked with various modern choreographers, most notably [[Twyla Tharp]].&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Terry|title=The history and style of contemporary ballet|url=https://suite.io/terry-finch/1th62sd|website=Terry Finch|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tharp choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' for ABT and Baryshnikov in 1976;&lt;ref name="tharp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegel|first1=Marcia|title=Twyla Tharp|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/tharp.html|website=Dance Heritage Coalition|publisher=Dance Heritage Coalition|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 she created ''In The Upper Room'' for her own company. Both of these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the use of [[pointe shoes]] and classically trained dancers—for their use of contemporary ballet.

Tharp also worked with The [[Joffrey Ballet]], founded in 1957 by [[Robert Joffrey]]. She choreographed ''[[Deuce Coupe]]'' for them in 1973, using pop music and a blend of modern and ballet techniques. The Joffrey Ballet continued to perform numerous contemporary pieces, many choreographed by co-founder [[Gerald Arpino]].&lt;ref name="brief history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief history of contemporary ballet|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/a-Brief-History-Of-Contemporary-Ballet-1687695.html|website=study mode|publisher=StudyMode.com|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable contemporary choreographers include [[Jorma Elo]], [[William Forsythe (choreographer)]], [[Mark Morris (choreographer)]], [[Jiri Kylian]], [[Alonzo King]], and [[Trey McIntyre]].

== Technique ==
[[File:Grace in winter, contemporary ballet.jpg|thumb|A contemporary ballet dancer]]
Contemporary ballet draws from both modern dance and classical ballet for its training methods and technique. For a dancer to be able to embody various styles the training regimen has become more diverse. In addition to classical technique, which often includes the signature speed and style of George Balanchine for American dancers, dancers study modern as well. In addition, many dancers do various forms of cross training. Pilates and yoga are often included to loosen muscles and align the body. Since the late 1920s, [[Pilates]] has been a popular form of cross training to help prevent injury, but increasingly, the [[Gyrotonic]] Expansion System is being utilized. With contemporary work, dancers' spines need to be more supple and they need to understand how to be grounded. This is in contrast to classical and neoclassical ballet where the dancers are required to "pull up" and the upper body is held. Dancers are required to first obtain classical ballet training in order to build on it with more modern technique in order to be more versatile. Despite formal training, dancers are often affected by ankle injuries, due to the high intensity footwork.

== Costumes ==
The costumes and footwear differ from any other style of dance as well. In contemporary ballet, dancers can be asked to wear pointe shoes, regular ballet shoes, or even no shoes at all. The same versatile approach goes for the music, setting, and costumes. Contemporary ballet does not require certain standards to be met. While it has more guidelines that modern dance, it does not conform to the limits of classical ballet. Classical ballet requires tutus, pointe shoes and scenery. Contemporary ballet uses different types of costumes, ranging from traditional to more modern tunic type versions. The music choices may vary as well. In Classical ballet, most often the choreography is done to classical music. In contemporary ballet, the music can range from the traditional classical music to popular music of today.

== Present Day ==
Today there are many contemporary ballet companies and choreographers all over the world. Notable companies include [[Nederlands Dans Theater]], [[Hubbard Street Dance Chicago]], [[Complexions Contemporary Ballet]], and [[Alonzo King LINES Ballet]]. Likewise, many traditionally "classical" companies also regularly perform contemporary works. Most classically trained dancers who may identify as professional ballet dancers are in fact required to be very versatile and able to perform work ranging from classical to neoclassical to contemporary ballet to modern dance. They are required to have impeccable ballet technique with a mastery of [[pointe technique]] for women, but at the same time, are being asked to be just as comfortable in ballet slippers or bare foot performing the work of modern choreographers such as [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)]] or embracing [[Gaga (dance vocabulary)]] in the work of [[Ohad Naharin]]. It is very common for ballet companies to have an official choreographer in residence to create new work—often contemporary—on the company. As well, many contemporary choreographers are commissioned to go to companies to create new work or a company will pay for the rights to perform already existing work and an official repetiteur will come to stage it. Twyla Tharp, as previously mentioned, is a highly renowned choreographer whose work is widely performed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8346">The '''''death of the novel''''' is the common name for the theoretical discussion of the declining importance of the [[novel]] as [[literary form]]. Many 20th century authors entered into the debate, often sharing their ideas in their own [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] writings.

==History==

[[File:1877-winslow-homer-the-new-novel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Winslow Homer, "The New Novel", 1877]]

The [[novel]] was well-defined by the 19th century.  In the 20th century, however, many writers began to rebel against the traditional structures imposed by this form.  This reaction against the novel caused some literary theorists to question the relevancy of the novel and even to predict its 'death.'

Some of the earliest proponents of the "death of the novel" were [[José Ortega y Gasset]], who wrote his ''Decline of the Novel'' in 1925&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/grasset.htm |title=José Ortega y Gasset |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205144836/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/grasset.htm |archivedate=5 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Benjamin]] in his 1930 review ''Krisis des Romans'' (Crisis of the Novel).&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.llc.ed.ac.uk/si1/sieg.html]: ''Döblin finds fault with the novel, since it focuses on individual characters or in its classic form of the Bildungsroman even recounts the education of the one protagonist. In his critique of the novel as genre, Döblin echoes considerations of both the literary discourse in Germany, which reflects on what has been called the 'crisis of narration', and the philosophical debate on the vanishing subject.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, contributors to the discussion included [[Gore Vidal]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[John Barth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barth]], "[[The Literature of Exhaustion]]", ''[[The Atlantic]],'' 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Sukenick]] wrote the story ''The Death of the Novel'' in 1969. In 1954, [[Wolfgang Kayser]] argued that the death of the narrator would lead to the death of the novel - a view that has since been contested by many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidenreich|first1=Rosmarin|title=The Postwar Novel in Canada: Narrative Patterns and Reader Response|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=1554587018|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdDfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]] argued that the novel would be likely to atrophy and die as a literary form if it did not advance beyond 19th century structures; this admonition led to his creation of the New Novel or [[Nouveau roman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Delahoyde|first1=Dr. Michael|title=Robbe-Grillet, Jealousy|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/20th/robbe.html|website=Washington State University|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Wolfe]] in the 1970s predicted that the [[New Journalism]] would displace the novel. [[Italo Calvino]] is considered to have turned round the question "is the novel dead?", as "is it possible to tell stories that are not novels?"&lt;ref&gt;Eugenio Bolongaro, ''Italo Calvino and the Compass of Literature'' (2003), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Cybook Opus Bookeen.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
As for causes, [[Robert B. Pippin]] connects the 'death of the novel' with the rise of [[nihilism]] in European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.sandiego.edu/video/APA/Pacific/2001/Pippin/Robert%20Pippin,%20Response%20to%20Critics.html Robert Pippin, Response to Critics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Bellow]], discussing ''[[Ravelstein]]'' which was loosely a portrait of [[Allan Bloom]], commented on a connection to the idea that ''they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/critics/reviews/0,5917,219810,00.html Ravelstein by Saul Bellow | Critics | Guardian Unlimited Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[David Foster Wallace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptwi.com/~bobkat/observer1.html], ''[[The New York Observer]]'', October 13, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; connected the 'death of the novel' with the mortality of the post-war generation of American novelists.

[[Will Self]] discussed the idea of the death of the novel, as a microcosm of the wider debate about the death of the book itself, in relation to the transition from a [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] era of printing to the post-Gutenberg era of the information age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=The novel is dead (this time it's for real)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/02/will-self-novel-dead-literary-fiction|website=The Observer|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has even questioned the longevity of the bookshelf, let alone the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=The death of the shelf|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/the-death-of-the-shelf/#.U6hl5qFLs6I|website=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological change is often identified as a major possible cause. Anxieties about the disappearance of the book, as well as the novel, have been common throughout the [[20th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = E-readers and the death of the book: Or, new media and the myth of the disappearing medium|url = http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/05/18/1461444815586984|journal = New Media &amp; Society|date = 2015-05-18|issn = 1461-4448|pages = 1461444815586984|doi = 10.1177/1461444815586984|language = en|first = Andrea|last = Ballatore|first2 = Simone|last2 = Natale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Kannberg sees the post-Gutenberg age as being one where the entire morphology of literature may transform as a result of 'hyper-literacy' and the exponential abundance of texts. He argues that there may be a rebirth of the novel, or the birth of a descendant to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kannberg|first1=Henry|title=Hyper-Literacy in the Exponential Era|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/191379578/HYPER-LITERACY-IN-THE-EXPONENTIAL-EPOCH-hypelit|website=Scribd|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar observations were made by [[Marcus du Sautoy]] who argued that technology allows for changes to books and novel-writing that are only just beginning to be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sautoy|first1=Marcus du|title=Liked the book? Try the app|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/03/marcus-du-sautoy-apps-books|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Contemporary scholars such as [[Kathleen Fitzpatrick (American academic)|Kathleen Fitzpatrick]] argue that claims of the novel's death were highly exaggerated, and that such claims often reflect anxiety about changes in the twentieth-century media landscape, as well as more submerged anxieties about social changes within the United States itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anxietyofobsolescence.com ''The Anxiety of Obsolescence: The American Novel in the Age of Television''] (Vanderbilt UP, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Salman Rushdie]], the postwar notion of the 'death of the novel' is one that has tended to exhibit certain First World assumptions based on imperialistic nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacKay|first1=Marina|title=The Cambridge Introduction to the Novel|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139493574|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNOnJkxlr3IC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dovedale by Moonlight''''' is one of five paintings by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] which uses the picturesque valley of [[Dovedale]] as its subject. These paintings were sometimes made as pairs with one showing the view by day and the other by moonlight. Wright admitted that he had not observed this scene directly, "Moon lights &amp; fire lights are but a sort of work with me for I cant with impunity go out at night and study the former, &amp; the latter I have seen but once, and at a time too, when I thought not of painting such effects."&lt;ref name=oberlin2&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M.E.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby (English Derby 1734 – 1797) Dovedale by Moonlight, ca. 1784–85|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Wright.htm|work=Modern Landscapes|publisher=Allen Memorial Art Gallert|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Study for a painting of Dovedale.jpg|thumb|left|A preparatory sketch for these paintings (now in [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]). The unusual trees are said to be ''after'' [[Alexander Cozens]]. ]]

{{main|Dovedale}}
[[Dovedale]] is a very popular [[valley|dale]] in Staffordshire and Wright's home county of [[Derbyshire]]. Admired in Wright's time, it has been owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since 1924 and made available to the many [[Peak District]] visitors.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/dovedale.html|title=Dovedale in Derbyshire and the Peak District|publisher=www.derbyshireuk.net|accessdate=21 October 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dovedale is named for the [[River Dove, Central England|River Dove]] and it is {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} long.&lt;ref name=peak&gt;{{cite web|title=Dovedale Fact Sheet|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/79235/factsheet12-dovedale.pdf|publisher=peakdistrict.gov.uk|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's paintings appear to be from nature, but in a letter of 1787 he said that he had observed moonlight and firelight only once at night and this was some time before he decided to create this series of paintings.&lt;ref name=oberlin2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=alchemist+wright+joseph#v=onepage&amp;q=alchemist%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false|pages=87–88|isbn=978-0-7100-6284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However his preparatory sketches show that he was using a mixture of studies and chance. The unusual reversal of light and shade in the trees in the sketch of Dovedale is said to be after using techniques created by the Russian born [[Alexander Cozens]]. Wright owned paintings by Cozens who taught his students to paint landscapes. He told them to create blots on paper and then use these as inspiration for the composition.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner |first=Christopher |title=The Deliberate Accident |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue21/blotsturner.htm |publisher=The Tate |accessdate=21 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903112235/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue21/blotsturner.htm |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are no known Derbyshire landscapes by Wright that are dateable before 1786. One of the problems is that many of Wright's paintings are dated by consulting Wright's accounts in his notebook. In the case of his English landscapes this has proved challenging. It is known that some of the Dovedale pictures are some of his earliest English landscapes.
Wright frequently repeated a popular subject in his paintings as he did with his [[Virgil's Tomb (Joseph Wright paintings)|Virgil's Tomb]] pictures and his [[The Blacksmith's Shop|Blacksmith's Shop]] paintings. In this case he made five very similar paintings. The version at Oberlin College was painted in 1785 to 1786 and sold to [[Edward Miller? Mundy (fl. 1786)|Edward Mundy]] of [[Shipley Hall]].&lt;ref name=oberlin&gt;{{cite web|last=Wieseman|first=M.E.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby (English Derby 1734 – 1797) Dovedale by Moonlight, ca. 1784–85|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/Wright.htm|work=Modern Landscapes|publisher=Allen Memorial Art Gallert|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college obtained it in 1951. There is a matching painting to this which is a similar view but in daylight. That painting is still in Derbyshire at [[Parwich Hall]] which is in a small village close to Dovedale.
Wright also did a daylight view of Dovedale in 1787 which he gave to the industrialist [[Josiah Wedgwood]] out of respect for his patronage on the arts. This painting is now in the [[Wedgwood Museum]].&lt;ref name=jw&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Wright (1734–97)|url=http://www.wedgwoodmuseum.org.uk/learning/discovery_packs/pack/pack/2436/chapter/2780|publisher=The Wedgwood Museum|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two other paintings of Dovedale were sold to [[Sir Brooke Boothby, 6th Baronet|Sir Brooke Boothby bt.]] of [[Ashbourne Hall]], who had helped Wright when he put on the first one-man exhibition in London.&lt;ref name="liver"&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/featuredartists/josephwrightderby/ Joseph Wright of Derby], Liverpool Museums, accessed 25 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Boothby also purchased two views of nearby Matlock, two paintings of bridges in Rome as well as an unusual 1781 portrait of himself lying by a brook holding a book by [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicolson|first=Benedict|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light, Volume 1|year=1968|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=alchemist+wright+joseph#v=onepage&amp;q=alchemist%20wright%20joseph&amp;f=false|page=127|isbn=978-0-7100-6284-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Echo and Narcissus''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]], dating from 1903. It illustrates the poem ''[[Echo and Narcissus]]'' from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.

John William Waterhouse (1847–1917) was an English painter who, because of his style and themes, has been classified as a [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]], but is more accurately described as a [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] painter{{citation needed |reason=contradicts contemporary art scholarship |date=July 2017}}.  He painted over 200 works, mainly in the [[genre]]s of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[mythology]], and of historical or literary subjects.  One of his common themes is the ''[[femme fatale]]'', the woman who ensnares a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/| title = John William Waterhouse| accessdate =22 April 2010 | publisher = jwwaterhouse.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Echo and Narcissus'' is in the genre of classical mythology.  In Ovid's version of the myth, [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] was the son of the river god [[Cephissus (mythology)|Cephissus]] and the [[nymph]] [[Liriope (nymph)|Liriope]].  His parents were told that he would live to an old age if he did not look at himself.  He rejected all the nymphs and women who fell in love with him.  One of these was the nymph [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]], who was so upset by her rejection that she withdrew from life and wasted away until all that was left was a whisper.  Her prayers were heard by the goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] who caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection.  He continued to look at his reflection until he died.  A ''[[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]]'' flower grew on the spot where he died.

The painting is in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|109.2|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|189.2|cm|in|0}}.  It forms part of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] collection in the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England, having been purchased by the museum in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1994| title = The Walker Art Gallery| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = London| place = | publisher = Scala| pages = | page = 77| id = | isbn = 1-85759-037-6| doi = | oclc = | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eclecticism''' is a kind of mixed style in the [[fine arts]]: "the borrowing of a variety of [[Art movement|style]]s from different sources and combining them" {{harv|Hume|1998|loc=5}}. Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in [[art]]: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences—mainly of elements from different historical styles in [[architecture]], [[painting]], and the [[graphic arts|graphic]] and [[decorative arts]]. In [[music]] the term used may be either [[Eclecticism in music|eclecticism]] or [[polystylism]].

==In the visual arts==
The term '''eclectic''' was first used by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] to characterize the art of the [[The Carracci|Carracci]], who incorporated in their paintings elements from the [[Renaissance]] and [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classic]]al traditions. Indeed, [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]], [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and [[Lodovico Carracci]] had tried to combine in their art [[Michelangelo]]'s line, [[Titian]]'s [[color]], [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]'s [[chiaroscuro]], and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]'s [[symmetry]] and [[wiktionary:grace|grace]]. 

In the 18th century, [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], head of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]], was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism. In the sixth of his famous academical ''Discourses'' (1774), he wrote that the painter may use the work of the ancients as a "magazine of common property, always open to the public, whence every man has a right to take what materials he pleases" {{harv|Reynolds|1775|loc=26}}.

The '''Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture''' (ESALA) is part of [[Edinburgh College of Art]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland. The school was ranked 5th in the UK in the 2013 Guardian University Guide and 4th in the Complete University Guide, for architecture. In 2016 Edinburgh ranked 3rd in the country for Architecture according to the Complete University Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?s=Architecture&amp;y=2016 |title= Complete University Guide 2016 |publisher= Complete University Guide |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1907, Edinburgh College of Art was established under the control of Scottish Education Department, after approvement of major reorganisation of Edinburgh higher art education. At the time, Edinburgh College of Art was divided into four schools: Drawing and Painting, Design and Crafts, Architecture, and Sculpture&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/about/our-vision-ethos-and-history "Our Vision, Ethos, and History"]. The University of Edinburgh. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Edinburgh_College_of_Art "Our History: Edinburgh College of Art"]. Our History, The University of Edinburgh. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. The establishment of the new School of Architecture was initially aimed for the training of architects and artists, which was supported by public subscriptions and foundations. First architecture courses were taught in 1908, in which it experienced numerous changes in teaching staff, structure, syllabus, and its role in the education of architects, in the period from 1908 until 1968. The first Head of the School of Architecture within Edinburgh College of Art was John Watson, appointed in 1908&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202272 "Scottish Architects"]. Scottish Architects. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile, The Forbes Chair of Architecture, which was a joint post with Edinburgh College of Art, was established in 1947, in which Raymond Gordon Brown was the holder of the title as well as the Head of School of Architecture within the University of Edinburgh. Between 1968 and 2004, Edinburgh College of Art enjoyed associate status and awarded degrees of Heriot-Watt University&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usfeatures/universities/eca.html "Awarding Institution"]. Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 2018-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since 2004, the University of Edinburgh became the accrediting body for Edinburgh College of Art, in which degrees and programmes obtained at Edinburgh College of Art had been validated by the University of Edinburgh. In 2009, the School of Architecture within the University of Edinburgh merged with Edinburgh College of Art’s School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture to form the Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (ESALA), and established academic federation between the two institutions. From 2009 to 2011, ESALA as a joint school was belonged to both Edinburgh College of Art and the University of Edinburgh’s School of Arts, Culture, and Environments. In 2011, Edinburgh College of Art merged with the University of Edinburgh. As the result, Edinburgh College of Art has combined with the university’s School of Art, Culture, and Environment to form a new enlarged Edinburgh College of Art within the University of Edinburgh’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourhistory.is.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Architecture "History of the School of Architecture"].

[[File:Cat guarding geese c1120 BC Egypt.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Anthropomorphism|Anthropomorphic]] cat guarding geese, Egypt, ca. 1120 [[BCE]]]]
'''Fable''' is a literary genre: a succinct [[fiction|fictional]] story, in [[prose]] or [[verse (poetry)|verse]], that features [[animal]]s, [[legendary creature]]s, [[plant]]s, inanimate objects, or forces of nature that are [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] (given human qualities, such as the ability to speak [[human language]]) and that illustrates or leads to a particular [[moral]] lesson (a "moral"), which may at the end be added explicitly as a pithy [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]&lt;!-- ''most'' of this page is too specific to serve as the only target --&gt; or [[saying]]&lt;!-- this is too much of a compendium to serve as the only target --&gt;.

A fable differs from a [[parable]] in that the latter ''excludes'' animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind.

Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished. In the [[King James Version]] of the [[New Testament]], "{{lang|grc|μῦθος}}" ("''[[mythos]]''") was rendered by the [[Translation|translators]] as "fable"&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''[[First Epistle to Timothy|First Timothy]]'', "neither give heed to fables...", and "refuse profane and old wives' fables..." (1 Tim 1:4 and 4:4, respectively).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]], the [[Epistle to Titus]] and the [[First Epistle of Peter]].&lt;ref&gt;
Strong's 3454. μύθος muthos moo’-thos; perhaps from the same as 3453 (through the idea of tuition); a tale, i.e. &lt;U&gt;fiction&lt;/U&gt; ("myth"):—fable.&lt;br /&gt;"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty." (2nd Peter 1:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who writes fables is a '''fabulist'''.

==History==
The fable is one of the most enduring forms of [[folklore|folk literature]], spread abroad, modern researchers agree,&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Märchens'' (1977), see "Fabel", "Äsopica" etc.&lt;/ref&gt; less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission. Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.

===Aesopic or Aesop's fable===
The varying corpus denoted ''Aesopica'' or ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the [[legend]]ary [[Aesop]], supposed to have been a slave in [[ancient Greece]] around 550 BCE. When [[Babrius]] set down fables from the ''Aesopica'' in verse for a [[Hellenistic]] Prince "Alexander," he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of "myth" that Aesop had introduced to the "sons of the Hellenes" had been an invention of "Syrians" from the time of "[[Ninus|Ninos]]" (personifying [[Nineveh]] to Greeks) and [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belos]] ("ruler").&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1992:121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables.&lt;ref&gt;P. W. Buckham, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Many familiar fables of Aesop include "[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]", "[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]" and "[[The Lion and the Mouse]]". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the ''[[progymnasmata]]''—training exercises in prose composition and public speaking—wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.

===Africa===
[[Oral tradition|African oral culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/atim-oton/arits-fables-kids-series_b_1001656.html |author=Atim Oton |title=Reaching African Children Through Fables and Animation |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains, and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.

[[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of [[Uncle Remus]]. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie ''[[Song of the South]]'' introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.

===India===
India has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Most of the gods are some form of animals with ideal qualities. Also, hundreds of fables were composed in [[History of India|ancient India]] during the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]], often as [[Story within a story|stories within]] [[frame story|frame stories]]. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the [[Jataka tales]]. These included [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', the ''[[Hitopadesha]]'', ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]'', and [[Syntipas]]' ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the [[Old World]]. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the "[[Perry Index]]" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist ''Jataka tales'' and some of the fables in the ''Panchatantra'' may have been influenced by similar [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Near East]]ern ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ben E. Perry, "Introduction", p. xix, in ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as [[Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa|Vyasa's]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'' also contained fables within the main story, often as [[side story|side stories]] or [[back-story]]. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights''.

===Europe===
Fables had a further long tradition through the [[Middle Ages]], and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the [[France|French]] fabulist [[Jean de La Fontaine]] (1621–1695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral — a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising [[bourgeoisie]], indeed the entire human scene of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Translations of his 12 books of fables are available online at [http://oaks.nvg.org/fontaine.html oaks.nvg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's [[John Gay]] (1685–1732);&lt;ref&gt;His two collections of 1727 and 1738 are available in one volume on Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_Y0AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+gay+++%22fables%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ChY5dZunN&amp;sig=5qBAeejDOY8U5EgxDr4Pgnw68ao&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EcNNTLKfGpL24AbX5uCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false books.google.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735–1801);&lt;ref&gt;His ''Bajki przypowiesci'' (Fables &amp; Parables, 1779) are available online at [http://literat.ug.edu.pl/ikbajk/index.htm ug.edu.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's [[:it:Lorenzo Pignotti|Lorenzo Pignotti]] (1739–1812)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CSQZlaZjE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n8Mlm8LQld&amp;sig=ubnkrD47WARSbDJKUXgNCj7_Vgo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8DhNTP-rOt3NjAeEtLDYDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole e Novelle'&amp;#39; (1785) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} and [[:it:Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi|Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi]] (1754–1827);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKoTAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pignotti+++favola&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Favole'&amp;#39; (1788) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} Serbia's [[Dositej Obradović]] (1739–1811); Spain's [[Félix María de Samaniego]] (1745–1801)&lt;ref&gt;9 books of fables are available online in Spanish at [http://amediavoz.com/samaniego.htm amediavoz.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa]] (1750–1791);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr0DAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Tom%C3%A1s+de+Iriarte+y+Oropesa+fabulas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WbHNxf22GV&amp;sig=zrfOpn4x0K8bAykQBwrXmq_zHfQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mElNTMGZO5mW4gbNyLCaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=His '&amp;#39;Fabulas Literarias'&amp;#39; are available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} France's [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]] (1755–94);&lt;ref&gt;His five books of fables are available online in French at [http://www.shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm shanaweb.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612144726/http://shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia's [[Ivan Krylov]] (1769–1844).&lt;ref&gt;5 books of fables are available online in Russian at [http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/literature/19century/krylov2.html friends-partners.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
In modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. [[Felix Salten]]'s ''[[Bambi, A Life in the Woods|Bambi]]'' (1923) is a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' — a story of a [[protagonist]]'s coming-of-age — cast in the form of a fable. [[James Thurber]] used the ancient fable style in his books ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated|Fables for Our Time]]'' (1940) and ''[[Further Fables for Our Time]]'' (1956), and in his stories "[[The Princess and the Tin Box]]" in ''The Beast in Me and Other Animals'' (1948) and "The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man" in ''Lanterns and Lances'' (1961). [[Władysław Reymont]]'s ''The Revolt'' (1922), a [[metaphor]] for the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce "equality." [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) similarly satirized [[Stalinist Communism]] in particular, and [[totalitarianism]] in general, in the guise of animal fable.

In the 21st century, the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as “western protest fables.” The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings, and elements from nature. Scia’s aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book ''[http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookPreview?bookid=atafabu_00510018&amp;route=author_Spanish&amp;lang=Spanish&amp;msg&amp;ilang=Spanish "Fábulas Peruanas"] published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values.&lt;ref&gt;Juan y Víctor Ataucuri García, "Fábulas Peruanas", Gaviota Azul Editores, Lima, 2003 {{ISBN|9972-2561-0-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greenstone''' is a common generic term for valuable, green-hued minerals and metamorphosed [[igneous rock]]s and stones which early cultures used in the fashioning of [[hardstone carving]]s such as jewelry, statuettes, ritual tools, and various other artifacts.  Greenstone artefacts may be made of [[greenschist]], [[chlorastrolite]], [[serpentine group|serpentine]], [[omphacite]], [[chrysoprase]], [[olivine]], [[nephrite]], [[chloromelanite]] among other green-hued minerals.&lt;ref&gt;See "Glossary" in Hendon &amp; Joyce (2004, p.327); also Kipfer (2000, pp.217–218).&lt;/ref&gt;  The term also includes [[jade]] and [[jadeite]], although these are perhaps more frequently identified by these latter terms.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer (2000, pp.217–218); Pool (2007, p.150)&lt;/ref&gt; The greenish hue of these rocks generally derives from the presence of minerals such as [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[hornblende]], or [[epidote]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer218"&gt;Kipfer (2000, p.218)&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenstone minerals were presumably selected for their color rather than their chemical composition. In [[archaeology]] therefore, having a loosely applied general term is at least partially influenced by the observation that ancient cultures often used and considered these various green-hued materials as interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Kipfer (2000, pp.217–218)&lt;/ref&gt;  Greenstone objects are often found very considerable distances from the source of the rock, indicating early travel or trading networks. A polished jadeite axe head in the [[British Museum]] (4000-2000 BCE) was found in [[Canterbury, Kent]] but uses stone from the Alps of Northern Italy, and objects from other parts of the world had travelled comparable distances to their findspots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1363130&amp;partid=1 British Museum], "Axe" Acq. 1901,0206.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient China and [[Mesoamerica]] have especial reputations for the prevalence and significance of greenstone (particularly jade) usage. Greenstones also figure prominently in the indigenous cultures of southeastern [[Australia]], and among the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]] (who knew greenstone as ''[[pounamu]]'').&lt;ref name="Kipfer218"/&gt;  Neolithic Europe also used greenstone, especially for prestige versions of axe tools, not made for use; comparable jade versions of tools and weapons also appeared in the [[Olmec]] and other [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] and in early Chinese civilization.

'''Haerlempjes''' refer to a specific [[genre]] of [[landscape painting]] that includes a view of [[Haarlem]] (formerly spelled ''Haerlem''). It is used most often to refer to [[Jacob van Ruisdael]]'s panoramic views of the city, but the term is derived from mentions in Haarlem archives as a type of painting included in household inventories.&lt;ref name=Haerlem&gt;'Woonplaats op een hoogte', Haerlem Jaarboek (1994), Historische Werkgroep Haerlem, pp 23-34&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diminutive]] suffix "pje" would denote a small, cabinet-sized painting, but even the largest landscapes may be referred to as ''Haerlempjes'' today.
==Background==
[[File:Situatie schets van dolhuys ten tijde van beleg van haarlem.JPG|thumb|View of Haarlem from the North during the [[siege of Haarlem]], historical print from 1628]]

In his biography of [[Albert van Ouwater]], [[Karel van Mander]] claimed that ''It is said from the mouths of the oldest painters, that landscape painting originated in Haarlem''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0186.php "Daer wort oock gheseyt en getuyght, uyt de monden der oudtste Schilders, dat te Haerlem is van oudts ontstaen, en begonnen de beste en eerste maniere van Landtschap te maken."] in Van Mander's [[Schilder-boeck]] in the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Van Mander was writing in 1604 for his Haarlem-sponsored [[Schilder-boeck]], and his was one of many initiatives to rebuild the city and glorify its history. After his book was published, the city attracted several landscape painters in the 1620s, including [[Esaias van de Velde]], [[Jan van Goyen]] and the Ruisdael brothers [[Salomon van Ruysdael|Salomon]] and [[Isaack van Ruisdael|Isaack]].

Haarlem is a bustling city today that makes up part of the [[Randstad]] area of the Netherlands, so it helps when looking at these old paintings to orient oneself according to old maps.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hobbyists love to look at older Haarlem cityscapes and pick out features such as steeples and boats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haarlemopdekaart.nl/ Website for 2014 exhibition] by North Holland Archives showing Haarlem skyline photos superimposed on a map&lt;/ref&gt; For paintings traditionally called Haerlempjes, such features have been proven to be based more on historical accuracy rather than artist fantasy.&lt;ref name=Biesboer&gt;''Topografische identificatie van een aantal Haerlempjes van Jacob van Ruisdael'', by [[Pieter Biesboer]], published in: ''Textiel aan het Spaarne : Haarlem : van linnen damast tot zijden linten'', Textielcommissie Nederland, Amsterdam, 1997 {{ISBN|978-90-800872-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though fantasy cityscapes were popular in the Netherlands throughout the 17th-century, these seem to be more often pastiches of southern harbours or italianate landscapes, rather than places that artists had conceivably visited. Today, for example, it is assumed that Jacob van Ruisdael worked in [[View of Bentheim Castle|Bentheim]] because he painted many accurate views of the castle there. However, he often painted such castle views situated in a fantasy landscape on a mountain top, though the castle is in fact situated in low rolling countryside. In Haarlem, though he painted many ''dunescapes'' of the [[Kennemerland]] area, he never turned those dunes into mountains.
==Early views of Haerlem==
Most travellers visiting Haarlem in the middle of the 17th-century were on their way from [[The Hague]] to [[Amsterdam]] and saw the city from the [[Spaarne]] river, as most intercity travel was by [[trekschuit]] or sailing ship. Thus many early cityscapes are taken from the point of view of the river traveller.

==Dunescapes==
[[File:Landscape with a Sandy Road by Jan Steen Frans Hals Museum os 2011-13.jpg|thumb|Even the genre painter [[Jan Steen]] produced some dune landscapes in Haarlem in the 1640s, though it is unknown whether he painted any ''Haerlempjes'']]
The popularity of such river-based cityscapes were offset by another type of landscape with dunes or windmills that included a Haarlem cityscape on the horizon.

==Panoramas of Haerlem==
[[File:View of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds c1665 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|''[[View of Haarlem with Bleaching Fields]],'' viewpoint somewhat higher in the air than the highest point of ''Het Kopje'', by Jacob van Ruisdael, c.1665]]
[[File:Jacob van Ruisdael - Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem.jpg|thumb|So-called ''Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem'', actually showing bleaching fields in Heemstede to the south of Haarlem, by Jacob van Ruisdael, 1670s]]
[[File:Cornelis van Noorde - View of the Kleverlaan near Bloemendaal - 1763.jpg|thumb|This watercolor from 1763 by [[Cornelis van Noorde]] shows how high the dunes of Bloemendaal used to be. This is a view of the Kleverlaan from the perspective of the Huis ter Kleef. "Clercq and Beeck", still owned by the De Clercq family a century later, is here on the left.]]
It wasn't until the 1650s that the production of the panoramic views began that were later copied by others. Perhaps the most famous is Ruisdael's view of Haarlem bleaching fields from the north-east, which is why many assumed that all Haerlempjes were painted from the same perspective, not realizing that the entire area is relatively flat and so they were painted from an imaginary point somewhere up in the air, and not from a mountaintop. There is a high dune in [[Bloemendaal]] called ''Het Kopje'' and there used to be a ridge of high dunes in [[Heemstede]] that were later slowly removed by sand-barges for use in building foundations for the mansions in the Amsterdam expansion known today as the [[Canals of Amsterdam]]. On older maps, the ''Sant-vaert'' is clearly marked where such barges once travelled. That canal still exists today and forms the modern border between Haarlem and Heemstede, and is called the ''Crayenestervaart''.

In 1997 [[Pieter Biesboer]] wrote a short article explaining the viewpoints of some of these paintings based on old maps, most notably the ''Bleaching Fields to the North-Northeast of Haarlem'' in the collection of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; This painting, despite its title, does not show Haarlem from the north at all, but shows Haarlem from the south, from an imaginary point somewhere above the old dune ridge near the street known as the ''Blekersvaart'' in Heemstede, probably close to the ''Dorstige Kuil'', an inn favored by artists in the 17th century. The church in the painting clearly shows the curved side of the choir on the right rather than the left.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; Biesboer noticed also that this painting displays many more trees, which is logical because the park [[Haarlemmerhout]] is situated there.&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

In the same article a few other paintings are mentioned, including a Ruisdael view of Haarlem bleaching fields in the collection of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], which shows the ruins of [[Huis ter Kleef]], also shown from the same perspective in a painting in the [[musée Jacquemart-André]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; He was able to trace the bleachery ''Clercq and Beeck'' situated on the Kleverlaan shown in the right foreground in this painting to one owned by [[Lucas de Clercq]], whose portrait was painted by [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt; This scene of Clercq and Beeck was painted again by Ruisdael with some more detail in the version located in the [[Mauritshuis]].&lt;ref name=Biesboer/&gt;

The painting from the Mauritshuis is the same view of Beeck and Clercq as the painting in the Rijksmuseum, while the one in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of the same general view seems between those and the one in Montreal:

Though not all of these panoramic paintings show [[bleachfield]]s, these bleacheries were often also mentioned on maps, and served as easy points of orientation for those looking down on the landscape from high dunes. Possibly some of these paintings were commissioned by the bleacheries themselves for use in Haarlem shops where goods were sold and exchanged. Lucas de Clercq lived in Haarlem during the winter and on his Clercq and Beeck estate in the summer months. Even Rembrandt made a sketch of bleaching fields, though these were only identified as such a few centuries after the fact.

The ''Haerlempjes'' seemed to become popular not only in Haarlem, but were sold everywhere, and even various books were produced containing prints of such views of Haarlem by the Roghman family and others.

'''Heroic realism''' is art used as [[propaganda]]. Examples include the [[Socialist realism]] style associated with [[Communist]] regimes, and sometimes [[Art of the Third Reich|the similar art style]] associated with [[Fascism]].  Its characteristics are [[realism (arts)|realism]] and the depiction of figures as ideal types or symbols, often with explicit rejection of [[modern art|modernism]] in art (as "[[bourgeois]]" or "[[Degenerate Art|degenerate]]").

==Purposes==
Both socialist art and Nazi art were explicitly ordered to be heroic,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;355 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were in consequence ideal rather than realistic.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;356 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroic realism designs were used to propagate the revolution in the Soviet Union during [[Lenin]]'s time. Lenin doubted that the illiterate population would understand what abstract visual images were intended to communicate. He also thought that artists, such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivists]] and [[Productivism (art)|productivists]], may have had a hidden agenda against the government.  Movements such as [[Cubism]] were denounced as bourgeois and criticized for its failure to draw on the heritage of art and for rejecting the beautiful on the grounds that it was "old",&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Sopontsinsky, ''Art in the Soviet Union: Painting, Sculpture, Graphic Arts'', p.&amp;nbsp;6 Aurora Art Publishers, Leningrad, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[proletarian culture]] had to draw on what was learned in the prior times.  The artists countered such thinking, however, by saying that the advanced art represented the advanced political ideas.

In literature, [[Maxim Gorky]] urged that one obtained realism by extracting the basic idea from reality, but by adding the potential and desirable to it, one added romantism with deep revolutionary potential.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p.&amp;nbsp;188 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:1988 CPA 6017.jpg|thumb|300px|''Worker and Kolkhoz Woman'']]
[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] understood the powerful message which could be sent through images to a primarily illiterate population. Once he was in power, posters quickly became the new medium for educating illiterate peasants on daily life—from bathing, to farming, the posters provided visual instruction on almost everything.  In 1931-2, the early emphasis on the "little man" and the anonymous laboring masses gave way to the "hero of labor", derived from the people but set apart by the scale of his deeds.&lt;ref name="overy259"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;259 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a consequence, literature filled with "positive heroes" that were sometimes tedious.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Stacy, ''Russian Literary Criticism'' p.&amp;nbsp;224 {{ISBN|0-8156-0108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, a new doctrine called [[Socialist realism]] came about. This new movement rejected the "bourgeois influence on art" and replaced it with appreciation for figurative painting, photography and new typography layouts.  Writers were explicitly enjoined to develop "heroization."&lt;ref name="overy259"/&gt;  At the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris World Fair]], [[Vera Mukhina]]'s ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'' exemplified the ideal [[New Soviet Man]], depicting a man and woman in working clothes, with his hammer and her sickle crossed, in a monumental statue with both striding forward.&lt;ref name="overy260"/&gt;

When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany in 1933, [[modern art]] was condemned as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]], and largely prohibited. The [[Nazi]]s promoted a style of art based on classical models, intended to nurture nationalism.  Heroic realism was to inculcate values of sacrifice, duty, and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Marcuse]], ''Negations'', p.&amp;nbsp;29-30 Beacon Press, Boston 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  The heroic man, who was bound to [[blood and soil]], acted rather than thought and sacrificed himself.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''Negations'', p.&amp;nbsp;2 Beacon Press, Boston 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  This particularly favored the heroic death.&lt;ref&gt;eye magazine: [http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=62&amp;fid=270 Designing heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi theory explicitly rejected "materialism", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, "realism" was a seldom used term.&lt;ref name="Adam138"&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;138 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity.&lt;ref name="Adam138" /&gt; The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;150 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with physical perfection required for the nude paintings.&lt;ref name="sontag3"&gt;[[Susan Sontag]],"[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/feb/06/fascinating-fascism/?page=3 Fascinating Fascism]"&lt;/ref&gt;  In painting, peasants were popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;132 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sculpture's monumental possibilities gave it a better expression of Nazi racial theories.&lt;ref name="Adam177"&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;177 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common image was of the nude male, expressing the ideal of the Aryan race.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;178 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arno Breker]]'s skill at this type made him Hitler's favorite sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 Caroline Fetscher, "Why Mention Arno Breker Today?", ''The Atlantic Times'', August, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083704/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Adam, ''Art of the Third Reich'' p.&amp;nbsp;188 {{ISBN|0-8109-1912-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, the physical form was to show no imperfections.&lt;ref name="sontag3"/&gt;  At the [[Paris Exposition of 1937]], [[Josef Thorak]]'s ''Comradeship'' stood outside the German pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie.&lt;ref name="overy260"&gt;[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p.&amp;nbsp;260 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dances are traditionally regional, all of them include music and recitation in local language or Sanskrit, and they represent a unity of core ideas in a diversity of styles, costumes and expression. Indian classical dance is made from India and classical dance is played by various actors.

References to dance and music are found in the vedic literature, (...)".&lt;/ref&gt; Folksy entertainment may also be performed in temple grounds or any fairground, typically in a rural setting by traveling troupes of artists; alternatively, they have been performed inside the halls of royal courts or public squares during festivals.{{Sfn|Farley P.

== Dance forms ==
The Natya Shastra mentions four ''Pravrittis'' (traditions, genres) of ancient dance-drama in vogue when it was composed – ''Avanti'' (Ujjain, central), ''Dakshinatya'' (south), ''[[Panchala|Panchali]]'' (north, west) and ''Odra-Magadhi'' (Odisha-Bihar-Bengal, east).&lt;ref name=kothari6&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sunil Kothari |author2=Avinash Pasricha |title=Odissi, Indian classical dance art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_0MAQAAMAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Marg Publications |isbn=978-81-85026-13-8 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared aspects ==
All major classical Indian dance forms include in repertoire, three categories of performance in the ''Natya Shastra''. These are ''Nritta'', ''Nritya'' and ''Natya'':&lt;ref name=meduri1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meduri |first=Avanthi |title=Bharatha Natyam-What Are You? |journal=Asian Theatre Journal |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=3–4 |doi=10.2307/1124019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The ''Nritta'' performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance.&lt;ref name=koskoff955 /&gt; The viewer is presented with pure movement, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern.&lt;ref name=meduri1 /&gt; This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.&lt;ref name="Descutner2010p45"&gt;{{cite book |author=Janet Descutner |title=Asian Dance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tCYjXOtkdgC |year=2010 |publisher=Infobase |isbn=978-1-4381-3078-1 |pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Nritya'' is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions.&lt;ref name=koskoff955&gt;{{cite book |author=Ellen Koskoff |title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73MO0eiQD_EC&amp;pg=PA955 |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-99404-0 |pages=955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''nritya'', the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The actor articulates a legend or a spiritual message. This part of the repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.&lt;ref name=meduri1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Descutner2010p45" /&gt;
* The ''Natyam'' is a play, typically a team performance,&lt;ref name=kjayakrishnan25&gt;Kavitha Jayakrishnan (2011), [https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/6356 Dancing Architecture: the parallel evolution of Bharatanātyam and South Indian Architecture], MA Thesis, Awarded by University of Waterloo, Canada, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A ''Natya'' incorporates the elements of a ''Nritya''.&lt;ref name=meduri1 /&gt;{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=33-38, 83-84, 207-214}}&lt;ref name="NettlStone1998p516"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bruno Nettl |author2=Ruth M. Stone |author3=James Porter et al |title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA516 |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1 |pages=516–521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All classical dances of India used similar symbolism and rules of gestures in ''abhinaya'' (acting). The roots of ''abhinaya'' are found in the ''Natyashastra'' text which defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, "carrying to the spectators"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}

The communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82" /&gt; In Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance:
* ''Angika'' (gestures and body language),
* ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm),
* ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry),
* ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra |title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''[[bhava]]'' (mood, psychological states).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Locus amoenus''''' ([[Latin]] for "pleasant place") is a [[literary topos]] involving an [[utopia|idealized place]] of safety or comfort. A ''locus amoenus'' is usually a beautiful, shady lawn or open woodland, or a group of idyllic islands, sometimes with connotations of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] or [[Elysium]].&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Russell, ''A History of Heaven'' (1998) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Robert Curtius]] wrote the concept's definitive formulation in his ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;E. R. Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'' (1953) p. 183-202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Maerten Ryckaert - Rocky Pastoral Landscape - WGA20594.jpg|thumb|Maerten Ryckaert, ''Rocky Pastoral Landscape'']]
A ''locus amoenus'' will have three basic elements: trees, grass, and water. Often, the garden will be in a remote place and function as a landscape of the mind. It can also be used to highlight the differences between urban and rural life or be a place of refuge from the processes of time and mortality. 

In some works, such gardens also have overtones of the regenerative powers of [[human sexuality]]&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see [https://archive.org/details/paradicesonlymap00osma   Evett, David. "Paradice's Only Map": The "Topos" of the "Locus Amoenus" and the Structure of Marvell's "Upon Appleton House." PMLA. 85.3(1970):504-513.]&lt;/ref&gt; marked out by flowers, springtime, and goddesses of love and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Classical===

The literary use of this type of setting goes back, in Western literature at least, to [[Homer]],&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Russell, ''A History of Heaven'' (1998) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and it became a staple of the [[pastoral]] works of poets such as [[Theocritus]] and [[Virgil]]. [[Horace]] (''[[Ars poetica]]'', 17) and the commentators on Virgil, such as [[Servius]], recognize that descriptions of ''loci amoeni'' have become a rhetorical commonplace.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', the function of the ''locus amoenus'' is inverted, to form the "locus terribilis". Instead of offering a respite from dangers, it is itself usually the scene of violent encounters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~zuern/demo/explication/loc/locus1.html  John David Zuern, "Locus Amoenus"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
The Middle Ages merged the classical ''locus amoenus'' with biblical imagery, as from the [[Song of Songs]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matthew of Vendôme]] provided multiple accounts of how to describe the ''locus amoenus'',&lt;ref&gt;H. Pleij, ''Dreaming of Cockaigne'' (2013) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dante]] drew on the [[Literary topos|commonplace]] for his description of the Earthly Paradise: "Here spring is endless, here all fruits are."&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Purgatory'' (1971) p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
[[File:Deverell Walter Howard A Scene from As You Like It.jpg|thumb|Characters in the Forest of Arden in Shakespeare's ''As You Like It'']]
The ''locus amoenus'' was a popular theme in the works of such Renaissance figures as [[Ariosto]] and [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Shullenberger, ''Lady in the Labyrinth'' (2008) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare]] made good use of the ''locus amoenus'' in his long poem ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cheney, ''Shakespeare, National Poet-Playwright'' (2004) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The trope also fed into his construction, in many plays, of what [[Northrop Frye]] has called the Shakespearean "green world" – a space that lies outside of city limits, a [[Liminality|liminal]] space where erotic passions can be freely explored, away from civilization and the social order – such as the Forest of Arden in ''[[As You Like It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Shurbanov, ''Shakespeare's Lyricized Drama'' (2010) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; A mysterious and dark, feminine place, as opposed to the rigid masculine civil structure, the green world can also be found featured in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''  and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.{{fact|date=September 2011}}

===Modern===
In the 20th century the ''locus amoenus'' appears in the work of [[T. S. Eliot]], as in the Rose Garden of ''[[Burnt Norton]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1973) p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]&lt;ref&gt;A. Neset, ''Arcadian Waters and Wanton Seas'' (2009) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lothlórien]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''J. R. R. Tolkien'' (2001) p. 196-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sinister doubles==
The [[Splitting (psychology)|split-off]] obverse of the ''locus amoenus'' is the apparently delectable but in fact treacherous garden, often linked to a malign sexuality, as in [[Circe]]'s palace or the Bower of Bliss in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1971) p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lou Beale''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Anna Wing]]. She made her first on-screen appearance on 19 February 1985 and departed on 26 July 1988, when the character was killed off. The character is played by [[Karen Meagher]] in the 1988 ''EastEnders'' special, ''[[CivvyStreet]]'', set during the [[Second World War]]. She appeared in 232 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2455752/EastEnders-Anna-Wing-left-5-tip-restaurant-boss-90k-will.html|title=Actress who starred as Lou Beale in EastEnders left £90,000 in her will... plus a £5 tip to a restaurant boss|last=Buchdahl|first=Ellie|date=12 October 2013|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lou Beale was the first ''EastEnders'' character to be created by series co-creator [[Tony Holland]], taking the inspiration for some of the series' earliest characters from his own London family and background.

Lou is the archetypal [[East End of London|East End]] matriarch throughout ''EastEnders''' first three years. An intimidating force within the local community, she is the dowager of [[Albert Square]]'s central family, [[The Fowler/Beale Family|the Beales and Fowlers]]. Never afraid to speak her mind, and woe betide anyone who manages to get on her wrong side, Lou has the respect of her friends and family, even if they do find her a bit of a nuisance at times.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Born in the [[East End of London|East End]] at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Lou lived in [[Walford]] all her life. She was born into a large working-class East End family, the youngest of seven siblings, and grew up with a strong sense of community spirit. In the 1930s, she fell in love with a local boy, [[Albert Beale]] (Gary Olson), and gave birth to his daughter, [[Maggie Flaherty|Maggie]] (Olivia Shanley), but had her adopted because she was born out of wedlock. By 1936, Lou and Albert had married and in 1938 moved to 45 [[Albert Square]]. They had six more children: [[Harry Beale|Harry]] ([[Aaron Mason (actor)|Aaron Mason]]), [[Ronnie Beale|Ronnie]] (Chase Marks), Dora, [[Kenny Beale|Kenny]] ([[Michael Attwell]]), and twins [[Pete Beale|Pete]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) and [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]). Albert died in 1965, and Lou remained in the same house with Pauline and her husband, [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]). Lou regularly intervened in her family's affairs, especially when she disapproved of Pete's relationship with [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Hills]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) because he had previously divorced his first wife, [[Pat Butcher|Pat]] ([[Pam St Clement]]), and she had banished her son Kenny to [[New Zealand]] in the 1960s for having an affair with Pat. Lou then watched her grandchildren [[Michelle Fowler|Michelle]] ([[Susan Tully]]), [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] ([[David Scarboro]]/[[Todd Carty]]) and [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) grow up, with Pauline, Pete, Arthur and Kathy looking after her in her old age. In one episode she claims she was one of seven children, one boy and six girls, and on Christmas Day 1987, she states she is from a family of eight, five boys and three girls.

===1985–1988===
Lou's affinity and ties with the area mean that she tends to view Albert Square as her own and thinks that gives her an excuse to intrude into people's business as she sees fit. She is great friends with [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) and [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), her lifelong neighbours. She also has a good relationship with the local [[general practitioner]], [[Dr. Harold Legg|Dr Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) and an old [[Jewish]] [[pawnbroker]] known only as [["Uncle" (EastEnders)|'Uncle']] ([[Leonard Maguire]]).

Lou has a tempestuous relationship with her children-in-law [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) and [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]), blaming Kathy for Pete's first divorce (something Lou regards as unnatural, despite her fervent dislike of Pat), and showing displeasure at Arthur's unemployment; nothing he does is ever good enough for her daughter Pauline. In February 1985, she is furious to discover that Pauline is pregnant for the third time, her family already financially crippled by Arthur's long stint of unemployment. Lou gives Pauline and Arthur the choice of an abortion, having the baby adopted or keeping the baby, but they will not be allowed to live in her house. The family try to bring her round, but she finally is won round when the family organise her a holiday in [[Clacton-on-Sea]]. Lou supports her grandson [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) choice to work in catering, which Ian's father Pete does not approve of, wanting Ian to have a more masculine career. Lou is delighted at having another grandson named [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin's]] ([[Jon Peyton Price]]), although she would have preferred him to be named Albert after her late husband. Her 16-year-old granddaughter [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) finds out she is pregnant and Lou, Pauline and Kathy discuss Michelle's options, settling on an abortion, but if Michelle wanted the baby, she could stay with Kathy's sister Stephanie, though Michelle is furious with them deciding for her. Lou collapses in late 1985, prompting Dr Legg to send Lou into hospital for some tests and she is diagnosed with angina. The family have to make changes within the household to accommodate Lou's health problems, such as moving her bedroom downstairs, however, Lou doesn't take well to the changes.
[[Image: Dot Lou Ethel ee.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Dot Cotton|Dot]], [[Ethel Skinner|Ethel]] and Lou.]]
Lou has a long-standing feud with Pat, having never forgiven her for having an affair with Kenny. Lou is plagued with mixed feelings when Kenny returns to London in 1988, after banishing him from their lives twenty years before. She has always had a difficult relationship with her son, feeling him to be "too big for the Square" and fears that Pat's revelation, that he is the true father of Pete's son [[Simon Wicks|Simon]] ([[Nick Berry]]), will tear her beloved family apart. Before his return to New Zealand, Lou manages to make amends with her estranged son, despite Pat's malicious stirring&amp;nbsp;– who later admits to Simon that [[Brian Wicks (EastEnders)|Brian Wicks]] ([[Leslie Schofield]]) is his real father after all.

In her later years, Lou is plagued with ill-health. In July 1988, she returns from a holiday in her beloved [[Leigh-on-Sea]] feeling distinctly unwell. Fearing she is dying, she takes the opportunity to announce to her nearest and dearest exactly what she thinks of them, even managing to make a truce of sorts with nemesis Pat. After gathering her clan of Beales and Fowlers around her, she has a few choice words of wisdom and encouragement for each family member. The next morning, she is discovered dead in her bed by daughter Pauline, having died peacefully in her sleep the previous night. Her friends and family mourn her death affectionately, never quite managing to forget the irreplaceable "old bag".

The youngest of seven siblings, Lou was from a large East End family herself. Only her sister [[List of EastEnders characters (1988)#Flo|Flo]] ([[Linda Robson]]) came to outlive her. In 1990, [[Harry Osborne (EastEnders)|Harry Osborne]] ([[John Boswall]]) returns to Albert Square – he had been engaged to Lou's sister, Doris, but she married Morris Miller after Harry was presumed dead in the war. In 1993, Lou's relative [[Nellie Ellis]] ([[Elizabeth Kelly]]) comes to stay with Pauline and Arthur. In 1997, it is discovered that Lou had given birth to another daughter, also fathered by Albert, who Lou had given up for adoption because she was conceived out of wedlock. Pauline, Ian and Mark travel to Ireland later that year to reunite with their long-lost family member, Maggie. In 2001, Mark names his stepdaughter [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox) after Lou. In 2015, Ian's grandson [[Louie Beale]] is also named after Lou.

==Character creation and development==

===Background===
The creators of ''EastEnders'', [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]], had always intended the programme to be primarily based around a large family "in old East-end tradition". By the 1980s, such families were on the decline in the East End. Natives had begun to emigrate out of East London to the wider area around [[Ilford]], [[Romford]], [[Chelmsford]] and [[Eastbourne]]. However, there were still some that refused to uproot and leave the area that had been home to many generations of their family.

To construct the focal family, Holland and Smith were helped considerably by Tony Holland's recollections of his own East End background.&lt;ref name="insidestory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Julia |authorlink= Julia Smith |last2=Holland |first2=Tony |authorlink2=Tony Holland |title=[[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders – The Inside Story]] |year=1987 |publisher=Book Club Associates |isbn=0-563-20601-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lou was the first ''EastEnders'' character to be created. She was based on Holland's aunt Lou Beale, one of four sisters from a large [[Walthamstow]] family.&lt;ref name="secrets"&gt;"[http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/walfordweb/article.php?id=86 EastEnders Secrets]", ''Walford web''. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Lou was mother to his cousins Peter and Pauline and married to Albert – a family set-up that would eventually be recreated on-screen and would go on to be forever hailed as the first family of ''EastEnders'', [[Beale family|the Beales and Fowlers]]. Peter Batt, who was one of the original scriptwriters of ''EastEnders'', has stated that elements of Lou Beale were based on his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/peter-batt-the-real-eastender-483971.html |title=Peter Batt: The real Eastender |work=[[The Independent]] |date=19 February 2005 |accessdate=26 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lou's original character outline as written by series creators [[Julia Smith]] and Tony Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The Inside Story]]'':"A lively 70 year old. Archetypal East-end mother-earth figure. Fat, funny, sometimes loud, often openly sentimental. An obsessive view of family...she can be a stubborn cruel "old bag" when she wants to be, sometimes keeping "atmospheres" going for months. It was always Lou's house that was used for the big family celebrations. Especially Christmas. Twenty or more people crammed into a tiny house. Five sisters wedged into a minuscule kitchen; drinking gin and orange; wearing funny hats; all wearing aprons; laughing raucously and trying to cook a huge dinner at the same time. Lou's house was also the meeting place for the family Sunday teas. Ham, or tinned salmon salad. Bread and butter. Jelly and tinned cream. And, tea...the changing face of the area (especially the immigrants) is a constant source of fear to her, but then she doesn't go out much. She prefers to be at home, or on a trip down memory lane: day trips to Southend – the Kursal, Rossi's ice-cream and a plate of cockles; one wonderful week's holiday in a caravan in Clacton; fruit picking in Essex; Christmas; weddings; street parties...She has a soft spot for her son, Pete..." (page 51).&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt;

===Casting===
The actress [[Anna Wing]], who was now 70 years old and had been acting since the late 1930s, auditioned for the role. She was so keen to play the part that she turned up for the audition clutching her birth certificate to prove she was a [[Hackney Central|Hackney]] [[greengrocer]]'s daughter and implored the producers to give her the job.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-36292-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she first read for the part Holland and Smith felt that "she overacted terribly", but on the second reading she "brought the performance down considerably".&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; There were initial fears over whether an actress of her age would have the stamina to survive ''EastEnders''' gruelling schedule, but when asked if she'd like to be in a popular soap, Wing replied "All my life I've been an actress, now I want to be a household name!"&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt;

Wing was set to appear in a stage play of ''[[Adrian Mole]]'', which would have clashed with the filming of ''EastEnders''. Julia Smith refused to offer her any leeway and informed her that she had to take a gamble — she could either turn down the play, meaning that if she failed to get the part of Lou she would have lost two jobs, or she could give up the possibility of playing Lou and accept the play.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; Wing decided to turn down the play and she was subsequently given the role of Lou.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; An early choice in the casting process, Wing had the face, voice and attitude that Tony Holland had imagined for the character.&lt;ref name="20years"&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-52269-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was told by producers to bring something from her own background to the role.&lt;ref name="gazette"&gt;"[http://wgazette.com/int-wing.html Anna Wing interview]", ''Walford Gazette''. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative, impact and progression===
Lou's fierce demeanour made an impact from the opening episode, with one of the popular press in Britain (''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper) running the headline "Enter the dragon... Lou Beale!"&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt;

Lou was a frightening matriarch who domineered over both the Beale and Fowler families and most of her neighbours in Walford as well. The character did have a softer side, most often seen when interacting with her grandchildren. She was depicted as the linchpin of the Walford community and was often first to rally around her neighbours in times of trouble, or instruct various members of her clan to do so in her stead.

She was a family orientated character, particularly opposed to change and determined to hold on to the ever-diminishing traditions of the East End.&lt;ref name="insidestory"/&gt; Most of her storylines were family based, which included various feuds, most notably with [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), the ex-wife of her son who showed up in Walford in 1986. Various scandals and hardships were thrown at the character and her family, which she stoically battled through in order to keep the close-knit family that she presided over, together. The character was also used for comedy, most regularly with the other older characters, [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) and [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), and she had a tendency to take to her bed and feign sickness if she didn't get her own way.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Her relationship with son-in-law [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) was another on-going sub-plot often used for comical effect — Lou portraying the stereotypical nagging mother-in-law and Arthur being the main protagonist for most of her displeasure, although they did share moments of closeness as well.

However, in 1988 Anna Wing began to grow disillusioned with the direction the show was going in. She felt ''EastEnders'' did not fit in with her beliefs as a [[Quaker]], commenting "We had 31 million viewers and it was shown all over the world, and I suddenly thought 'Should I be in this?'...I had a crisis of conscience." After three years playing Lou, Anna Wing asked to be written out.&lt;ref name="sexy"&gt;"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010325/ai_n14521107 EastEnders' Lou reveals sexy past]", ''Sunday Mirror''. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Wing has since revealed that creator Julia Smith was devastated when she decided to leave, commenting "she said I could have been in it for ever and ever until I popped off for real."&lt;ref name="talk"&gt;"[http://talkwalford.co.uk/ipb/lofiversion/index.php/t1734.html I STOPPED WATCHING ALBERT SQUARE.. NOW I LIKE EMMERDALE]", ''Talk Walford''. URL last accessed on 2007-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character was subsequently killed off, dying in her sleep in July 1988 after being frequently ill throughout the year. The character's final episodes were written by Tony Holland and directed by Julia Smith. Lou spent her final day arranging her affairs, seeing various members of her family, passing on advice and giving them presents and at the end of the episode she announced: "That's you lot sorted. I can go now." At the start of episode 359, Lou was found to have died peacefully in her sleep. The episode then jumped a few days later to the day of her funeral — an emotional episode, which featured Pete breaking down at Lou's graveside and ended with him proposing a toast in the Vic to absent friends and that "bloody old bag." The episode was also notable for featuring, for the first time, a train crossing the railway viaduct in Bridge Street&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; — a special-effects shot commissioned especially for the occasion. The train was actually a ten-second illusion, produced by the BBC's electronic workshop. One ''EastEnders'' official commented: "It cost an arm and a leg, but old Lou was worth it."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

Lou was a central character, who remained at the heart of the series during her time on screen and is still occasionally referred to by long-running characters in a nostalgic nod back to the show's early history. There remains, however, a certain level of uncertainty and conflicting information regarding the character's background, in particular the number of offspring she supposedly produced.

When ''EastEnders'' began in 1985, [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) and [[Pete Beale|Pete]] ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) were the only two of Lou's offspring to feature on screen. Through character dialogue in July 1985, the audience were told of the existence of four other children: Keith, Paul, Shirley and Norma — who had moved away to [[Billericay]], [[Romford]] and [[Eastbourne]] before the series began. As the series progressed, these were apparently forgotten in favour of other children and were not mentioned again.

Circa 1986, viewers were made aware of another child, [[Kenny Beale|Kenny]], who had moved away to [[New Zealand]] before 1985. In addition, the character of Lou Beale also featured heavily within a series of spin-off [[EastEnders spin-offs#Novels|''EastEnders'' novels]] by Hugh Miller, set prior to 1985 and published in 1986. Within the novelisations readers were introduced to further characters from Lou's history: sons Harry and Ronnie, a daughter Dora and siblings Elsie, Liz, Queenie and Terence. Kenny also appeared in the books. In the ''EastEnders'' novels, Harry, Dora and Ronnie moved away from home when they were in their twenties and lost contact with their mother. The Beales' fruit and veg stall on Bridge Street [[Market (place)|market]] was passed to Ronnie after his father's death, and again passed to Pete when Ronnie moved away from Walford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first= Hugh|title= EastEnders – Book One: Home Fires Burning |year=1986|publisher=Inner Circle Books|isbn=1-85018-045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first= Hugh|title=[[EastEnders spin-offs#Novels|EastEnders – Book Two: Swings and Roundabouts]] |year=1986|publisher=Inner Circle Books|isbn=1-85018-050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1988 Kenny actually appeared in ''EastEnders'' for a brief stint and in December 1988 he was also seen as a young child in ''[[CivvyStreet]]''. Harry and Ronnie also appeared in the spin-off episode, but did not feature within the television serial itself.

In 1997 another of Lou's children was introduced: [[Maggie Flaherty]] (Olivia Shanley), her eldest child, who was given up for adoption as she was born out of wedlock. Other than the already established Pete, Pauline and Kenny, Maggie remains the only sibling to appear in the on-screen serial. In 2000 an ''EastEnders'' book was published entitled ''EastEnders Who's Who''. The book pertained to the existence of Ronnie and yet another child, Maureen, who had both died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry and Dora were not mentioned in the book and neither Maureen nor Dora has been mentioned or seen on-screen, either in the serial itself or in "CivvyStreet", however Pauline recounted the story of Arthur proposing to her on her unnamed sister’s wedding day on multiple occasions while she was in the show.

'''''M.D.''''' was a short lived [[comic book]] published by [[EC Comics]] in 1955, the sixth title in its ''New Direction'' line. The bi-monthly comic was published by [[Bill Gaines]] and edited  by [[Al Feldstein]]. It lasted a total of five issues before being cancelled along with EC's other ''New Direction'' comics.

==Content==
''M.D.'' focused on medical stories, surgical practices and the day-to-day work of doctors. Each issue featured four stories, plus at least one text piece about a real-life major medical figure.

The frontispiece to the first issue set out its role:
{{cquote|This magazine, ''M.D.'', is the sixth of E.C.'s "New Direction" publications. It is dedicated to Mankind's tireless and unceasing battle against disease and to the man who fights that never-ending battle day after day after day... your Family Doctor... your M.D.

But although the M.D. is the protagonist in this magazine, he is not necessarily the hero! The ''real'' hero is the man, woman, or child who enters into the M.D.'s stirring and grim world of real medicine to seek out the help and relief his wisdom and experience can give.

This, then, is the theme of ''M.D.'' It will contain stories of ''people''... people who are helped by their Family Doctor and his associates in the Medical Profession. It will deal frankly and honestly with the diseases and misfortunes that beset people. It will deal graphically and candidly with the treatment they receive. At times, its stories will be poignant... at time they will be sad... at times they will be grim. But at all times, they will be ''true to life!''

And now, because we feel it best epitomizes the ideals of the Medical Profession, we, the editors of ''M.D.'' offer the view taken by all M.D.'s... "The Hippocratic Oath":}}
...the [[Hippocratic Oath]] was then reprinted in full.

The [[letters page]] (upon the first of which the above text appeared in lieu of early letters) was titled "The Needles", and contributors to ''M.D.'' include [[Graham Ingels]], [[Marie Severin]], [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[Reed Crandall]] and [[Carl Wessler]].

==Reprints==
''M.D.'' was reprinted as part of publisher [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]'s ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#The Complete EC Library|Complete EC Library]]'' collection, alongside ''[[Valor (EC Comics)|Valor]]'' and ''[[Impact (EC Comics)|Impact]]'' as Volume 2 of the "New Direction Part 2" slipcased set (1985). Between September 1999 and January 2000, Cochran and [[Gemstone Publishing]] reprinted the five individual issues. This complete run was later rebound, with covers included, in a single softcover ''[[Russ Cochran (publisher)#EC Annuals|EC Annual]]''.

'''Magnet Hill''' is a "Cyclops [[gravity hill|hill]]" located near [[Leh|Leh]] in [[Ladakh]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eureka4you.com/magnetichillworldwide/Leh-JK.htm|title=Magnetic Hill Leh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir|access-date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create the appearance of a hill. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOTHING MAGNETIC ABOUT MAGNETIC HILL|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/others/sci-tech/Nothing-magnetic-about-Magnetic-Hill/articleshow/48299466.cms|date=31 July 2015|access-date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other two such magnetic hills are in [[Gujarat]]. One is near [[Bhuj]] ([[Kalo Dungar|Kalo dungar]] - the black hills) and other at [[Tulsishyam|Tulsi Shyam]].

'''Music licensing''' is the [[license]]d use of [[copyright]]ed [[music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scherer|first1=Dana A.|title=Money for Something: Music Licensing in the 21st Century|date=January 19, 2016|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43984.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Music licensing is intended to ensure that the owners of copyrights on musical works are compensated for certain uses of their work. A purchaser has limited rights to use the work without a separate agreement.

==Definitions==
The following words and phrases appear in discussion of music licensing:
;license : the right, granted by the copyright holder or his/her agent, for the broadcast, recreation, or performance of a copyrighted work. Types of licensing contracts can include: 1) a flat fee for a defined period of usage, or 2) royalty payments determined by the number of copies of the work sold or the total revenues acquired as a result of its distribution. In addition to a basic fee, most music licensing agreements require additional payments to the copyright owner when the work in which it is included (movie, play) is financially successful above a certain threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rMFSUTNWRzgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=music+licensing&amp;ots=RJTlocjJkp&amp;sig=JtOtE3R0_M2oAOLUrSUOyxyWEns#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20licensing&amp;f=false |title=Kohn on music licensing - Al Kohn, Bob Kohn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2002-01-15 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;licensor : the owner of the licensed work
;licensee : the person or entity to whom the work is licensed
;performance : the public performance of a musical piece, whether live or recorded, performed by the original artist or someone else, whether the performance keeps to the original version or is adapted or changed in some manner. Playing a music CD (or tape, etc.) in public is "performing" the work. 
;broadcast : playing live or recorded works, including radio, TV, [[webcasting]], [[podcasting]], etc., to multiple listeners in a setting such as a bar or bookstore. (Using that definition and the previous one leads to phrases like 'live broadcast performance'.)
;performing rights organization : large companies that hold performance rights for copyrighted musical works. The best-known are [[ASCAP|American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI), [[SESAC|Society of European Stage Authors and Composers]] (SESAC), and La Asociación de Compositores y Editores de Música Latinoamericana (The Association of Composers and Publishers of Latin American Music, ACEMLA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acemla.com/ Retrieved 2014-12-30&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, the [[PRS for Music]], and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] for licensing recordings and music videos. The companies license public performance on a nonexclusive basis of the music they own or hold under contract using a complex weighting formula to distribute the fees to the respective rights holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/music-licensing3.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How Music Licensing Works" |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date=2003-08-22 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license may be a blanket license, but individual licenses may be negotiated.

Rights organizations sample radio and television broadcasts, offer blanket licenses to broadcasters, and investigate complaints to detect and prevent unauthorized performances.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the history of the origin and practices of ASCAP, see Jeff Lunden, Collecting Money for Songwriters, A 100-Year Tug of War, NPR (Feb. 13, 2014); https://www.npr.org/2014/02/13/275920416/collecting-money-for-songwriters-a-100-year-tug-of-war; Retrieved Jan. 5, 2015. A less flattering view of the practices of such organizations can be found in Harvey Reid, ASCAP &amp; BMI – Protectors of Artists or Shadowy Thieves? http://www.woodpecker.com/writing/essays/royalty-politics.html; Retrieved Jan. 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, ASCAP and BMI hire field agents to monitor public performances. The field agents may act as agents for the organization, negotiating a fee for a blanket license, but individuals may negotiate directly with the organization. The fee may be presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, but in case of disagreement, the fee may be appealed to the Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York.

;pre-cleared music: music that is covered under a prior agreement allowing distribution and legal use under specific circumstances. The license may be for use in film, video, television (commercials and programs), Internet, events in live venues, video games and multimedia productions.
;copyright : literally, 'the right to copy.' The owner of a [[copyright]] has five exclusive rights: reproduction (copying), preparing derivative works (adaptation), distributing copies to the public, performing the work publicly, and displaying the work in public. Prior to 1886, no effective international law of copyright existed. The first major international copyright law conventions were the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] created in 1886. In the US, for works created in 1977 and after the work is protected by copyright when it is "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," without the need to register it with the US Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §102(a)&lt;/ref&gt; A work must be registered, however, before a copyright owner may bring suit for infringement.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 411(a)&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[synchronization rights|synchronization licensing]] : the licensing of musical works to be synchronized with moving pictures as background in a motion picture, television program, video, DVD, etc.
;master use licensing: the licensing of the recording of a musical work to be performed as a soundtrack, bumper, lead-in or background to a motion picture.
;publisher : for the purposes of copyright, a publisher is the owner of the copyrighted work. It is now standard practice for songwriters of even the slightest prominence to form a publishing company as a separate legal entity to hold the rights to their work. Continued use of the, now somewhat anachronistic, term "publisher" reflects the state of media at the time of the Berne Convention, when all music distribution was done on paper as sheet music or player piano rolls.

==Broadcasting==

Broadcasting, in the context of music licensing, means the playback of recorded or live music for groups of people beyond what might be normally expected in a social setting. Legal claims are filed frequently against bookstores, bars, and live music venues that broadcast music without first obtaining a performance license.

The music broadcast in grocery stores and elevators is a service purchased from one of many organizations that offer it (the largest is [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]). Part of the fee paid for the service is used to cover licensing costs. Except in very narrowly defined circumstances, noted below under the Section 110 "small business exception," a business, restaurant, or store that plays radio broadcasts or shows TV programs in the premises does not pay a licensing fee.

Radio stations pay fees to licensing bodies for nonexclusive rights to broadcast music.  Radio stations and businesses typically pay a flat rate once a year, called a blanket license, which can vary based on the size of the audience, value of the advertising revenues, and amount and nature of music usage. As part of the license contract a radio station may conduct periodic audits of the music being played, with the audit results submitted to the licensing body.

==Home video==

Licensing issues are encountered when [[television]] shows or [[films]] using [[copyrighted]] music are released on [[DVD]] format.

When a song is cleared for usage on a TV show, historically to save money, the clearance typically applies only to television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is considered for DVD distribution to the home video market, the rights to the song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD. Most producers/production companies now include the rights for DVDs or "all media now known or hereafter devised," which assures production companies of the right to re-release without incurring additional licensing fees.

If the process of clearing the rights to the song is prohibitively expensive for the home video distributor, or clearance is refused by the copyright holders of the original song, the affected song is either replaced with a similar one, or the footage containing the copyrighted song is edited out. In a few cases, television shows, with extensive use of copyrighted music whose cost of "after-market" licensing is high, are withheld from release on DVD; notable examples include ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[Third Watch]]'' (beyond its first two seasons), and ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', some of which were eventually released after long delays. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/articles/holdup.cfm  - The "What's The Hold-up?"

== Live performance ==

With certain exceptions, live performances must be licensed. In the US, the owner of a bar, cafe, or restaurant who wants to have live music usually will obtain a blanket license from ASCAP or BMI to play musical selections which they control. If a license is obtained from one company but not the other, only the music from that company may be performed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barbusinessowner.com/public/Music-Licensing-for-Bars-and-Restaurants.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Concert Bands (ACB)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acbands.org/&lt;/ref&gt; offers a blanket license to community bands that covers both ASCAP and BMI lists. At the end of the year, the band completes a spreadsheet showing how often each song was played during the year, which the ACB submits to the rights organizations.

== Performance Licensing ==
Purchasing a copy of the sheet music for a copyrighted work does not give the purchaser the right to perform the music. A separate performance license must be obtained. Someone who listens to a piece of music and learns to play it must obtain a performance license before performing it in public in a commercial setting. A new arrangement for a copyrighted work is a derivative work.

Permission of the rights holder is required before the work may be published, copied, or performed in public. (There now may be two copyrights, one on the original work and a second copyright on the "new" material contributed by the arranger.) An arrangement of a traditional song or piece of music will be protected by copyright even if the original piece is in the public domain. Every new arrangement receives a copyright.&lt;ref&gt;ASCAP has over 40 arrangements of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata under license, and nearly 80 versions of Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Harvey Reid, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions to the requirement for a performance license. One set of exceptions come under the [[Fair use]] doctrine. Another set of exceptions are situations covered under Section 110 of the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110 and http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair use exemption ===

The fair use exemption is an ill-defined, fact-based doctrine, decided by courts on a case-by-case basis. It has very limited applicability in the area of music performance and makes a weak defense in an infringement case. The use of a copyrighted work "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright." &lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 107&lt;/ref&gt; There is no way in which the public, unlicensed performance of an entire piece of music can be brought under the protection of Section 107. In spite of folk wisdom to the contrary, there is no "three second rule" for copying or sampling recorded music. There is no rule that "four notes" can be copied without penalty. Instances under the fair use exception might include criticism or comment. Criticism need not be negative: if a jazz soloist quotes a phrase from a well-known solo by another player, it might be viewed as an homage.&lt;ref&gt;However, see Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., 585 F.3d 267 (6th Cir. 2009), in which the court rejected the "fair use" argument that the use of music sampling was an "homage" to the original recording.&lt;/ref&gt; Music sampling has been aggressively pursued by copyright holders as a form of "free riding" but might be interpreted as a transformative use.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Rinkerman, Sampling Unleashed? Migrating Visual Art Fair Use Principles Into the Music Space. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2540345. Accessed Jan. 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Section 110 exemptions ===

Section 110 sets out eleven situations in which performance of a work, including broadcast, "are not infringements of copyright" &lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110; available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110&lt;/ref&gt; The major exemptions are outlined in paragraphs 1 to 5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 cover face-to-face instruction, or "distance learning," in non-profit educational settings. Paragraph 3 applies to performance or display in religious settings as part of a worship service. Paragraph 4 applies to non-dramatic literary or musical works (but not plays or video) performed by non-profit groups such as a community band or orchestra. Paragraph 5 is the "small business" exemption.

A performance license need not be obtained if the work is performed or displayed "by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational institution."&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

A film shown as part of a fundraiser, or a film series might not qualify as "face-to-face teaching activities." Instruction given to corporate or government employees would not qualify as a "nonprofit educational institution."

Paragraph 2 creates a similar exemption for distance learning. A work may be performed or displayed through transmission to students enrolled in a course, or to government employees as part of their duties, without requiring a performance license.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C.§ 110(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption does not apply to works produced and sold for online distance learning. The performance or display must be made under the direction of the instructor and directly related to, and in aid of, what is being taught: it cannot be used as a pretext for transmission of other works. Nondramatic literary or musical works may be performed in their entirety. For other works, such as display of a film or painting, the performance must be "reasonable and limited." The exemption applies only to distance learning that is part of scheduled classes. Works that are simply posted by an instructor would not be protected. The educational institution must meet certain additional conditions. It must provide information to faculty, students, and relevant staff members describing US copyright law and promoting compliance. For digital transmissions, the institution must take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized retention or further distribution of copies of the work such as not interfering with any technological means the copyright owner may have used to prevent copying.

Paragraph 3 creates an exemption for performance of nondramatic literary works, musical works, or dramatico-musical works of a religious nature, or display of a work, as part of religious services at a place of worship or religious assembly.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. 110 § 110(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 110 (4) creates an exemption for non-profit groups for performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work (but not a play or an opera) if four conditions are met:
	1) the work may be performed but may not be transmitted to the public,
	2) none of the performers, organizers, or promoters are paid,
	3) there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and,
	4) there is no admission charge, ''or'', after deducting for reasonable expenses the proceeds are used exclusively for educational, religious, or charitable purposes.
	The last condition may not be met if the copyright owner has objected by serving written notice to the performing organization which conforms to requirements outlined in the statute.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(4)((B)(i through iii)&lt;/ref&gt; A performance by a non-profit may be recorded and the recording may be privately shared.  But posting the recording on a public service such as YouTube constitutes "transmission" within the terms of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The recording is "transmitted" when it is posted, whether or not anyone ever plays it.&lt;ref&gt;In re Cellco Partnership, SDNY 2009, 663 F.Supp.2d 363, 92 USPQ 2d 1113.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not a trivial consideration.  Popular cell phone apps, such as Shazam, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.shazam.com/ Last checked 10/17/17.&lt;/ref&gt; and other readily available programs make it possible to automate identification of music posted on public sites.

Paragraph 5 is the "small business exemption," which allows bars, cafes, and restaurants to play the radio or show television programming as "background" in their business. It does not authorize playing recorded music such as using a CD player, or live musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(5); Todd B. Tatelman, Copyright Law’s ‘Small Business Exception": Public Performance Exemptions for Certain Establishments. CRS Report RS21107, http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/rs21107.pdf, updated December 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption covers reception of a public transmission on a single receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in the home if no direct charge is made and the performance is not further transmitted to the public. Very specific limitations are outlined in the statute, such as number of loudspeakers permitted and square footage of the establishment.

A governmental body, or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization, may perform nondramatic musical works in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair without obtaining a performance license.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(6)&lt;/ref&gt;

A public vending establishment may perform nondramatic musical works to promote the sale of copies of the work if there is no admission charge. The performance may not be transmitted beyond the immediate area the sale occurs.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(7)&lt;/ref&gt;

A nondramatic literary work may be performed or transmitted to blind persons or other handicapped persons who are unable to read normal printed material, or to deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable to hear the aural signals accompanying a transmission of visual signals if the performance is made without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and the transmission is made through the facilities of a governmental body, a non-commercial educational broadcast station, a "subcarrier" of an FM broadcast station or a cable system.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(8)&lt;/ref&gt;

A single performance of a dramatic literary work may be transmitted specifically for the blind or other handicapped persons if the work was published at least 10 years before the date of the performance, there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and the transmission is made through an FM radio subcarrier as defined in paragraph 8.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §110(9)&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work in the course of a social function organized and promoted by a nonprofit veterans’ organization or a nonprofit fraternal organization is exempt. Social functions of college or university sororities or fraternities are not included under the exemption unless the social function is held solely to raise funds for a specific charitable purpose.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(10)&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 11 permits muting or skipping limited portions of the audio or video portions of a motion picture which is transmitted to a household for private viewing. Creating or providing a computer program which facilitates muting or skipping is also permitted, provided no alteration is made in the content, and provided no fixed copy of the altered version is created.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(11)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Happy Birthday to You"==
The song "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" is one of the best known songs in the world and generated over $2 million in royalties each year for its purported copyright owners even though the copyright has now been ruled invalid.  In September 2015, a judge ruled that the copyright was invalid, and on February 8, 2016, [[Warner/Chappell Music]]  agreed to settle a class action lawsuit brought to challenge these fees. After mediation, Warner will pay more than $14 million to the "thousands of people and entities" who had paid licensing fees to use the song since 1949, plus $4.6 million to attorneys for the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021216/happy-birthday-you-belongs-everyone-now.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASCAP and Girl Scouts==
In 1995,  [http://www.ascap.com/ The American Society of Composers(ASCAP)] ordered [[American Camp Association|The American Camping Association]] to pay royalties for campfire songs sung at any of their 2300 camps. Girl Scout camps were included in the request, but only a small number of Girl Scout camps actually paid the $250 agreed upon yearly fee. The ''New York Times'' reported, "Among the 256 Girl Scout camps on its list, 16 did."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-1"/&gt; In March 1996, ASCAP sent letters to the Girl Scouts to pay copy right fees for campfire songs written or published by ASCAP sung in "public performance."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-2"/&gt; ASCAP  expected to be paid license fees for any of the  4 million songs included list sung publicly.

The songs on this list include "Puff the Magic Dragon" and "This Land is your land."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

In August 1996, The ''Wall Street Journal'' published a frontpage article, "Ascap Cautions the Girl Scouts: Don't Sing 'God Bless America,'" describing the scene at Diablo Day Camp in [[Lafayette, California]], as a troupe of Girl Scouts danced to the ''[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]'' in silence for fear of copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; A public relations situation for ASCAP occurred, as the video performance of Girl Scouts silently dancing made its way onto mainstream news.

ASCAP confronted the Girl Scouts because of the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], which established that any song used in public performance would be able to receive royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins III|first1=Julien H.|title=When in Doubt, Do Without: Licensing Public Performances By nonprofit Camping or Volunteer Service Organizations Under Federal Copyright Law|journal=Washington University Law Review|date=1997|volume=75|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' describes the law as this: "The law defines a public performance as 'where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.'"

ASCAP quickly sent a press statement claiming that it never intended on receiving royalties and ''has never brought nor threatened to bring suit against the Girl Scouts.''&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; ASCAP promised to reimburse any Girl Scout camp for the royalty fees that they may have paid. It was also reported that "in 1940 [[Irving Berlin]] had donated all future royalties from "God Bless America" to the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts." &lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

By September 1996, Girl Scout executives in New York said they believed "this unfortunate situation is resolved."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-2"/&gt;

==Plot==
The ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' is searching a [[binary star|binary star system]] in an effort to find the ''USS Brattain'', a [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] science vessel which went missing a month previous. The crew locates the ship but the ''Brattain'' is derelict, and all the crew are dead save one: the ship's [[Betazoid]] science adviser, Andrus Hagan, who is discovered hiding in a room just off the bridge. Hagan has somehow survived, but he has been shaken by the experience and is in a profound [[Catatonia|catatonic state]]. Counselor [[Deanna Troi]] tries to use her telepathy to contact Hagan. Meanwhile, [[Geordi La Forge]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] set to work repairing the ''Brattain'' but discover that although everything is in working order, the ship still fails to move. Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] determines that all of the ''Brattain''{{'}}s crew died at each other's hands. That night onward, Troi has trouble sleeping, encountering the same dream in which she levitates and drifts in the direction of a mysterious voice repeating, "Eyes in the dark, one moon circles". Troi starts to believe Hagan was influenced by the same dream.

Four days later, with the investigation stalled, [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] decides that the time has come to move on, but the crew find the ship also stalled like the ''Brattain''. Data discovers that both ships are trapped in a spatial phenomenon known as a "Tyken's Rift", and they can only escape through the force of a tremendous explosion. However, as they work at determining how to create this explosion, the crew starts becoming irritable and experiences hallucinations. Dr. Crusher realizes that everyone, but Troi, has failed to achieve [[R.E.M. sleep]] since entering the rift, leading to their current state. As violence begins to erupt around the ship, Picard assigns Data, who does not sleep or dream and is therefore unaffected, as acting Captain.

Data eventually attempts to use a pulse from the [[Navigational deflector|deflector]] aimed at the center of the rift to create the explosion, but this fails to produce any effect. As Data looks for other solutions with Troi, Troi gets an idea that her dreams of "eyes in the dark, one moon circling" is a description of a [[hydrogen atom]]. Data and Troi work out that there must be another ship from a psychic race trapped on the other side of the rift who is aware of their presence but looking for hydrogen to create an explosion. Troi goes to sleep to contact the other species through the dream, while Data vents hydrogen into the rift. An explosion soon occurs, and both the ''Enterprise'' and the alien ship are freed. As the crew recovers, Data returns the ship to Picard, but not before ordering everyone to get some sleep.

==Production==
The episode was intended as a vehicle for [[Marina Sirtis]], however she disliked it due to her fear of heights and the requirement that she be strapped into a flying harness.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWBfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT202&amp;dq=%22star+trek%22+%22night+terrors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1xpjCgcHTAhVI8mMKHawoCI0Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22star%20trek%22%20%22night%20terrors%22&amp;f=false|title=Star Trek FAQ 2.0 (Unofficial and Unauthorized): Everything Left to Know About the Next Generation, the Movies, and Beyond|last=Clark|first=Mark|date=2013-06-01|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480355002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTifVpk6cekC&amp;pg=PT198&amp;lpg=PT198&amp;dq=marina+sirtis+harness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VY11MI2XGC&amp;sig=PkuKEEbXi84deF_V4ANGtrG4aDY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj09-_018zTAhVQyWMKHQgGC2UQ6AEIVTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=marina%20sirtis%20harness&amp;f=false|title=The Next Generation Companion: Star Trek The Next Generation|last=Nemecek|first=Larry|date=2012-09-25|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781471106798|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tor /&gt;

The model used for the USS ''Brattain'' is the same as was used for the USS ''Reliant'' in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. The ship is occasionally referred to as the USS ''Brittain'' due to a spelling error on the exterior of the model.&lt;ref name=encyc /&gt;

==Reception==
[[TechRepublic]] placed the episode in its list of "The five worst Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/geekend/the-five-worst-star-trek-the-next-generation-episodes-ever/|title=The five worst Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes EVER! - TechRepublic|website=TechRepublic|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zack Handlen of [[The A.V. Club]] noted that the episode "...lacked that mild twist at the end to make it memorable" but also that "This kind of episode is really the meat-and-potatoes of this sort of show, so it's impressive to realize that TNG has gotten to the point where delivering the expected is no longer entirely satisfactory".&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt; According to James Hunt of [[Den of Geek]] "It’s not completely incompetent, but it’s hard to imagine anyone loving this episode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-the-next-generation/37180/revisiting-star-trek-tng-night-terrors|title=Revisiting Star Trek TNG: Night Terrors|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en|first=James|last=Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is an overview and topical guide to architecture:

'''[[Architecture]]''' &amp;ndash; the process and the product of designing and constructing buildings. Architectural works with a certain indefinable combination of design quality and external circumstances may become cultural symbols and / or be considered works of art.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== What ''type'' of thing is architecture? ==
Architecture can be described as all of the following:

* [[Academic discipline]] &amp;ndash; focused study in one academic field or profession. A discipline incorporates expertise, people, projects, communities, challenges, studies, inquiry, and research areas that are strongly associated with the given discipline.
* [[Building]]s &amp;ndash; buildings and similar structures, the product of architecture, are referred to as architecture.
* One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, architecture is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Architecture is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
* [[Science]] &amp;ndash; systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.A science is a branch of science, or a discipline of science. It's a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself.
** [[Applied science]] &amp;ndash; branch of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications, such as technology or inventions.

===Definitions of architecture===

== Buildings ==

Although not all buildings are architecture, the term encompasses a huge range of building types, as summarised in the following list pages:

* [[List of building types]]
* [[List of buildings and structures]]
* [[List of human habitation forms]]

==Building construction==
* [[Building design]]

===Materials===

* [[Materiality (architecture)]]
* [[Building material]]
* [[List of building materials]]

===Structural elements===

:''Refer to: '' [[:Category:Architectural elements|Category: Architectural elements]]

* [[Arch]] &amp;ndash; a curved structure, often made up blocks or bricks, spanning across an opening and supporting the  weight of structure above. Works by transferring vertical loads into [[Compression member|compression]] forces. There are many arch shapes including semicircular, segmental, parabolic, pointed (gothic), three-point and flat arches.
* [[Beam (structure)]] &amp;ndash; a straight structural member, typically wood or steel, capable of [[Span (architecture)|spanning]] from one support to another and supporting the weight of structure above. Works by resisting [[bending]] forces.
* [[Buttress]] &amp;ndash; a short section of masonry built at right angles to a wall, to resist lateral forces.
* [[Cantilever]] &amp;ndash; a projecting structure without visible means of support at the projecting end.
* [[Column]] or pillar &amp;ndash; a relatively slender structural element, typically circular, square or polygonal in plan, that bears the weight of the structure above.
* [[Dome]] &amp;ndash; a roof structure, typically [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemispherical]], constructed in a similar way to an arch. The plan shape may be circular, elliptical or polygonal, and the cross section shape can vary in the same ways as an arch.
* [[Door]]way &amp;ndash; opening in a wall, typically rectangular, providing means of access, usually with a gate or door to provide security and weather protection.
* [[Facade]] &amp;ndash;  an exterior face of a building, especially the front.
* [[Foundation (engineering)|Foundation]] or footing &amp;ndash; solid base usually below ground, upon which buildings and other structures are built. Works by spreading vertical loads over a sufficient area to ensure the structure will not subside.
* [[Lintel]] &amp;ndash; a structural member spanning across the top of an opening. Unlike a beam, a lintel spans a relatively short distance which can be spanned by single block of stone of sufficient depth. Concrete, timber and steel lintels are also used in different types of construction.
* [[Pier (architecture)]] &amp;ndash; loadbearing structure similar to a column, but more massive.
* [[Truss]] &amp;ndash; a structure spanning in the same way as a beam, but using materials more efficiently by using [[triangulation]] to create a rigid structure. Typically timber or steel, used to support a pitched roof.
* [[Vault (architecture)]] &amp;ndash; a curved masonry structure spanning in the same way as an arch, forming either a roof or support for a floor above.
* [[Wall]] &amp;ndash; a linear structure enclosing the exterior of an area or building, or subdividing an internal space. A wall may be [[Load-bearing wall|loadbearing]] or non-loadbearing.
* [[Window]] &amp;ndash; an opening in a wall, typically rectangular, providing light and ventilation. Usually but not always [[Architectural glass|glazed]].

==Architectural education==

[[Professional requirements for architects]] &amp;ndash; Students undertake specific [[vocational training]] in order to qualify as a professional architects. Training typically consists of one or more university degrees and a period of practical experience. In some countries, it is illegal to use the title ''architect'' without accredited qualifications. In the United Kingdom the [[Architects Registration Board]] exists solely to regulate membership of the profession, and the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] is an umbrella organisation covering all the organisations fulfilling a similar role in the United States. Architectural education can involve degree types that do not directly result in licensing, such as Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Bachelor of Arts in Architecture, or a research PhD in Architecture. Some of the qualifications specific to architectural licensing include:

* [[Bachelor of Architecture]] (B.Arch.) &amp;ndash; undergraduate academic degree designed to satisfy the academic component of professional accreditation bodies, to be followed by a period of practical training prior to professional examination and registration.
* [[Master of Architecture]] (M.Arch.) &amp;ndash; professional degree in architecture, qualifying the graduate to move through the various stages of professional accreditation (internship, exams) that result in receiving a license.
* [[Doctor of Architecture]] (D.Arch) &amp;ndash; doctoral degree in the field of architecture, that can be completed after either a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch), Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree or, in some cases, another degree.

== Architectural practice ==

* [[Architectural drawing]] or architect's drawing - a technical drawing of a building or building project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13566">{{Culture of Panama}}
'''Panamanian literature''' comprises the whole of literary works written in [[Panama]]. The first literature relating to Panama can be dated to 1535, with a modern literary movement appearing from the mid-19th century onwards

== Early literature ==
Panamanian historian and essayist Rodrigo Miró (1912-1996) cites [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]] as being the author of the first Panamanian literary work, the story of a character named ''Andrea de la Roca'', which was published as part of the "Historia General y Natural de Las Indias" (1535). 

The first literature from Panamanian born authors comes from the 17th century with the title of "''Llanto de Panamá a la muerte de don Enrique Enríquez''" (Crying from Panama at the Death of Don Enrique Enríquez). Although this anthology was formed during the Colony, most of the poems in it were written by authors born in Panama. 

A modern literary movement appeared in Panama from the mid-19th century onwards.

==Poetry==

===During the Colony===
Rodrigo Miró in his "Itinerario de la Poesía en Panamá" (Poetry Itinerary in Panama) talks about various Spanish authors: Mateo Rosas de Oquendo, author of an autobiographic romance; Juan de Miramontes y Zuázola, author of "Armas Antárticas" (Antarctic Weapons); Juan de Páramo y Cepeda, author of "Alteraciones del Dariel" (Dariel Alterations); and others. Also, in this period arose the author of "La Política del Mundo" (World Politics), Víctor de la Guardia y Ayala. "La Política del Mundo" is a "stage play" that was performed for the first time in 1809.&lt;ref name="Miró 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last= Miró |first= Rodrigo |title= Itinerario de la Poesía en Panamá |publisher= Autoridad del Canal de Panamá |year= 1999 |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Víctor de la Guardia y Ayala is that he was born in [[Panama]], contrary to others that came from [[Spain]] and, for this reason, for a while he was considered the "first Panamanian poet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Martínez Ortega |first= Aristides |title= Las generaciones de poetas panameños |publisher= Universidad de Panamá |year= 1992 |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the discovery of some manuscripts which come from the 17th century caused the revision of this idea, because the first reference from this period which indicates a written production by Panamanian authors (in other words, born in Panama) dates from 1638 and it is an anthology called "''Llanto de Panamá a la muerte de don Enrique Enríquez''" (Crying from Panama at the Death of Don Enrique Enríquez). This anthology groups works written for the death of Enrique Enríquez, governor of [[Panama]]. It was edited for the first time in [[Madrid]] (1642) and its author was Mateo Ribera (Panamanian); also he wrote many poems in this work. Although most of "Llanto de Panamá"´s poems were written by Panamanians, it has many works written by Spanish authors.

This discovery was accomplished by the Spanish diplomat Antonio Serrano de Haro, who also studied these manuscripts. A new version of this anthology was published at 1984 in a combined job between the [[University of Panama|Universidad de Panamá]] and the "Instituto de Cultura Hispánica".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Serrano de Haro |first= Antonio |title= Llanto de Panamá a la muerte de don Enrique Enríquez |publisher= Editorial Universitaria |year= 1984 |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery confirms, in fact, that the first Panamanian literary manifestations (found until now) come from the 17th century.

===Romanticism===
[[Panama]] was not isolated from revolutionary movements which were seeking the independence of colonies from [[Spain]]. The drive for independence was accomplished with the [[Independence]] of [[Panama]] from [[Spain]] on November 28, 1821. As in other colonies, Panamanian [[Romanticism]] was related to, and influenced by, libertarian and nationalist notions.  Much of the literature of the period was produced by amateur authors; professional authors remained few.&lt;ref name="Miró 1999"/&gt;

Among the first [[Romanticism|romantic]] Panamanian poets were [[Manuel María Ayala]] (1785–1824) and [[Tomás Miró Rubini]] (1800–1881), followed by [[José María Alemán]] (1830–1887), [[Gil Colunje]] (1831–1899), [[Tomás Martín Feuillet]] (1832–1899), [[José Dolores Urriola]] (1834–1883), [[Amelia Denis de Icaza]] (1836–1911), [[Manuel José Pérez]] (1837–1895), [[Jeronimo de la Ossa]] (1847–1907), [[Federico Escobar]] (1861–1912) and [[Rodolfo Caicedo]] (1868–1905).

Romantic poetry, tinged with notions of nationalism, would be the main theme in Panamanian poetic works until the mid-20th century when [[avant-garde]] poetry arrived in Panama.

===Modernism===
In 1903, Panama separated from Colombia; this time saw the peak of modernism in Hispanic literature. The first modernist was [[Darío Herrera]] (1870–1914), friend and follower of [[Rubén Darío]], whom he met in [[Buenos Aires]]. Another important poet was [[León Antonio Soto]] (1874–1902), who died at a young age when tortured by the police for having championed the cause of Panama.

Two literary magazines focused mainly on the dissemination of the modernist movement: ''El Heraldo del Istmo'' (1904–1906), directed by [[Guillermo Andreve]] (1879–1940), and ''[[Nuevos Ritos]]'' (1907), founded by [[Ricardo Miró]] (1883–1940). Ricardo Miró is perhaps the most prominent poet of Panamanian modernism. His poem "Patria" (1909) is also famous.

At this time, [[Gaspar Octavio Hernández]] (1893–1918), author of ''[[Melodías del pasado]]'' (1915) and ''[[La copa de amatista]]'' (1923), was also active. Other notable poets of the same generation were [[María Olimpia de Obaldía]] (1891–1985) and [[Demetrio Korsi]] (1899–1957).

===1930 to present===
Since 1930, coinciding with the "Communal Action" (''Acción Comunal'') youth revolution, a new generation of poets, grouped around the magazine ''Antena'', distanced itself from modernist rhetoric, instead approaching the avant-garde. The main reference for this transformation was [[Rogelio Sinán]] (Taboga, 1902 – Panamá, 1994), an author who had traveled in Europe and visited the surrealists in Paris. ''[[Onda (fiction)|Onda]]'' (1929) shows the influence of pure poetry; other major works by Sinan include ''[[Incendios]]'' (1944) and ''[[Semana Santa en la niebla]]'' (1949), in which dreamlike elements show his surrealist affiliation.

Surrealism is also evident in the work of [[Ricardo J. Bermúdez]] (1914), whose most famous work is ''[[Laurel de cenizas]]'' (1951). The work of [[Demetrio Herrera Sevillano]] (1902–1950) is also a part of this avant-garde movement; his work was greatly influenced by ''[[ultraísmo]]''.

Another poet of this era, who was also a short-story writer and journalist, was [[Mario Augusto Rodríguez]] (1917). In 1957, he published his poetry collection ''[[Canto de amor para la Patría novia]]'', a poetic history of the Panamanian nation.

Other major poets of this era include [[Stella Sierra]], [[Roque Javier Laurenza]], [[Ofelia Hooper]], [[Tobías Díaz Blaitry]] (1919–2006), [[Tristán Solarte]] (1934), [[José de Jesús Martínez]], [[Diana Morán]] (1932), [[Alvaro Menéndez Franco]] (1932), [[Luis Carlos Jiménez Varela]], [[José Guillermo Ross-Zanet]] (1930), [[José Franco (poet)|José Franco]] (1931), and [[Elsie Alvarado de Ricord]] (1928–2005).

Major poets of the next generation included [[Benjamín Ramón]] (1939), [[Bertalicia Peralta]] (1939), [[Ramón Oviero]] (1939–2008), [[Moravia Ochoa López]] (1941), [[Dimas Lidio Pitty]] (1941-2015), [[Roberto Fernández Iglesias]] (1941), [[Eric Arce]] (1942), [[Enrique Jaramillo Levi]] (1944), [[Jarl Ricardo Babot]] (1945), [[Giovanna Benedetti]] (1950), [[Manuel Orestes Nieto]] (1951), [[Moisés Pascual]] (1955), [[Consuelo Tomás]] (1957), [[Héctor M. Collado]] (1960), and [[Pablo Menacho]] (1960).

At the end of the 20th century emerged a new generation of poets, who began to publish after 1990. Major poets of this era include [[Javier Romero Hernández]] (Chorrera, 1983), [[Sofía Santim]] (Panamá, 1982), [[Javier Alvarado]] (Santiago de Veraguas, 1982), [[Salvador Medina Barahona]] (Mariabé de Pedasí, 1973), [[Eyra Harbar Gomez]] (Bocas del Toro, 1972), [[Porfirio Salazar]] (1970), [[Katia Chiari]] (Panamá, 1969), and [[Alexander Zanches]] (David, Chiriquí, 1968).

==Narrative==

===Modernism and the first Panamanian books===
The short story in Panama can be said to have begun formally in 1903, when [[Darío Herrera]] (1870–1914) published the first book of stories by a Panamanian author, [[Horas Lejanas]], in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Since this time, the short story has been the most important literary genre in Panama.&lt;ref&gt;Jaramillo Levi, Enrique; Gajes del oficio, Panamá, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all modernist and postmodernist poets in Panama published stories during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Of these, [[Salomón Ponce Aguilera]] (1868–1945), [[Guillermo Andreve]], [[Gaspar Octavio Hernández]] (1883–1940), and [[Ricardo Miró]] (1883–1940) stand out as poets whose short stories, often scattered and unpublished, were picked up and commented on by writer [[Mario Augusto Rodríguez]] in 1956. Other important authors of this period include [[José María Núñez]] (1894–1990), [[Moisés Castillo]] (1899–1974), and [[Gil Blas Tejeira]] (1901–1975).

===Themes of the countryside and the canal in narrative===
One notable author of the next generation was [[Rogelio Sinán]] (1902-1994), author of the novel ''[[Plenilunio]]'' and the collections of stories ''[[A la orilla de las estatuas maduras]]'' (1946), ''[[La boina roja y cinco cuentos]]'' (1954), ''[[Cuentos de Rogelio Sinán]]'' (1971), and ''[[El candelabro de los malos ofidios]]'' (1982). Other authors of this generation included [[Lucas Bárcenas]] (1906–1992), [[César Candanedo]] (1906–1993), [[Renato Ozores]] (1910–2001), [[Alfredo Cantón]] (1910-1967), [[Ricardo Bermúdez]] (1914–2000), [[Mario Augusto Rodríguez]] (Santiago de Veraguas, 1917) (author of ''[[Campo Adentro]]'' (1947), ''[[Luna en Veraguas]]'' (1948), and ''[[Los ultrajados]]'' (1994)), [[José María Sánchez Borbón|José María Sánchez]] (1918–1973), [[Ramón H. Jurado]] (1922–1978), [[Joaquín Beleño]] (1921), [[Carlos Francisco Changmarín]] (1922), [[Jorge Turner]] (1922), [[Tristán Solarte]] (1924) and [[José Guillermo Ros-Zanet]] (1930). In this generation, authors cultivated nationalistic themes, either from the point of view of the cities at each end of the Panama Canal and their relation to the Canal Zone, or from rural point of view from the interior of the country.

===Universal themes===
The next generation is that of authors born since 1932. Many of these authors are still producing literary works. Major authors of this generation include [[Ernesto Endara]] (1932), [[Álvaro Menéndez Franco]] (1932), [[Enrique Chuez]] (1934), [[Justo Arroyo]] (1936), [[Rosa María Britton]] (1936), [[Victoria Jiménez Vélez]] (1937), [[Pedro Rivera (writer)|Pedro Rivera]] (1939), [[Benajamín Ramón]] (1939), [[Beatríz Valdés]] (1940), [[Gloria Guardia]] (1940), [[Dimas Lidio Pitty]] (1941), [[Moravia Ochoa López]] (1941), [[Mireya Hernández]] (1942–2006), [[Enrique Jaramillo Levi]] (1944), [[Isabel Herrera de Taylor]] (1944), [[Raúl Leis]] (1947), [[Giovanna Benedetti]] (1949), [[Lupita Quirós Athanasiadis]] (1950), [[Rey Barría]] (1951), [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] (1952), [[Herastro Reyes]] (1952–2005), [[Claudio de Castro]] (1957), [[Consuelo Tomás]] (1957), [[Yolanda Hackshaw]] (1958), [[Allen Patiño]] (1959), [[Rafael Alexis Álvarez]] (1959), [[Ariel Barría Alvarado]] (1959), [[Héctor Collado]] (1960), [[Gonzalo Menéndez González]] (1960), [[David Robinson Orobio]] (1960), [[Erika Harris]] (1963), and [[Rogelio Guerra Ávila]] (1963), [[Javier Stanziola]] (1971). This generation is notable for its abandonment of ''[[criollismo]]'' as a narrative theme in favor of universal themes, and in some cases, emphasizing dream and fantasy.

===Twenty-first century narrative===
Publishing for the first time in the 1990s, the newest generation of Panamanian storytellers has emerged. Among these writers are [[Carlos Fong]] (1967), [[Carlos Oriel Wynter Melo]] (1971), [[José Luis Rodríguez Pittí]] (1971), [[Melanie Taylor]] (1972), [[Lili Mendoza]] (1974), [[Lilian Guevara]] (1974), [[Roberto Pérez-Franco]] (1976), [[Gloria Melania Rodríguez]] (1981), and [[Annabel Miguelena]] (1984).
This generation is characterized by the use of short fiction, poetic and imaginative language, and human themes, in which the individual stands out above a chaotic, typically urban environment.

==Characterization==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Taylor Schilling at Paley Fest Orange Is The New Black.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor Schilling plays Piper Chapman]]
Chapman is a 31-year-old [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] who is sentenced to 15 months in prison for carrying a bag of drug-money ($50,000) to Belgium for her girlfriend, [[Alex Vause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/07/30/orange-is-the-new-black-star-taylor-schilling-on-her-path-to-prison.html|title='Orange Is the New Black' Star Taylor Schilling on Her Path to Prison|accessdate=October 4, 2014|date=July 30, 2013|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|author=Stern, Marlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to prison, Chapman owned an artisanal bath soap business in Brooklyn. She comes from a wealthy family, and was a debutante as a teenager.&lt;ref name=OItNBYi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2013/07/10/orange-new-black-yuppie-interrupted/sfQieZah74YFAVWZYugu2O/story.html|title='Orange Is the New Black': Yuppie, interrupted|accessdate=October 4, 2014|date=July 10, 2013|website=[[The Boston Globe]]|author=Gilbert, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is originally from [[Connecticut]]. Chapman is [[bisexual]], and in college was in a relationship with [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), a drug smuggler. 10 years prior to the series' beginning, she carried drug money from Colombia to Belgium with Vause. Eventually, Chapman grew disenchanted with Vause's lifestyle and broke up with her. She then began dating Larry Bloom ([[Jason Biggs]]), to whom she got engaged.

Piper is one of very few emphatically atheist inmates on the show. She responds to a request that she baptise herself by saying that she cannot pretend to believe in a god, saying that while it might make her happier if she believed in a religion, she "needs it to be true", and instead looks to science to explain the world. In another episode, when confronted on the subject again, she clarifies that "I've always thought [[agnosticism|agnostic]] was a sort of cop-out... If I had to label it I'd say that I'm a [[secular humanism|secular humanist]]."

In 2018, Schilling stated that while [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' was written with having a rationale for each action, "Piper’s behavior oftentimes feels groundless" and "the audience can’t quite grab onto Piper’s behavior. It seems like it’s coming out of nowhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tannenbaum, Emily|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a22603014/taylor-schilling-orange-is-the-new-black-season-6/|title=Taylor Schilling Is Ready to Hang Up Her Orange Jumpsuit|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=2018-08-03|accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
===Season 1===
Chapman is sentenced to 15 months in [[Litchfield Prison]] for Criminal conspiracy and [[Money laundering]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/orange-is-the-new-black-inmate-sentences.html|title=How Much Time Do the Women of Orange Is the New Black Have Left in Their Sentences?|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vause had been arrested and named Chapman as an accomplice in order to reduce her own sentence. On her first day, Chapman gets felt up by guard George "Pornstache" Mendez ([[Pablo Schreiber]]) and unintentionally offends prison matriarch Red ([[Kate Mulgrew]]), who runs the prison cafeteria. Red starves Chapman to make an example of her, and the other inmates are too intimidated to help except for [[Crazy Eyes (character)|Crazy Eyes]] ([[Uzo Aduba]]). Nonetheless, Chapman resists Crazy Eyes' subsequent advances, and makes amends with Red by making her lotion to help her back. She befriends [[Nicky Nichols]] ([[Natasha Lyonne]]), who becomes her confidante and protector. She also discovers Vause is sentenced to the same prison.

Chapman is assigned to the prison electrical workshop and accidentally steals a screwdriver. Her cellmate Miss Claudette ([[Michelle Hurst]]) helps her evade the guards' searches. In order to ingratiate herself with the other inmates, Chapman offers to review their appeal letters.

Although Bloom learns that Vause was the informant who gave Chapman up, he does not share this information with her. Chapman then rekindles her relationship with Vause. Meanwhile, Bloom, an aspiring writer, publishes a story about Chapman's incarceration that paints unflattering portraits of her fellow inmates and the prison staff. The article earns Chapman the ire of both the guards and the other prisoners, and puts a severe strain on her already fading relationship with Bloom.

Chapman is elected to the prison council, but finds that the only change she is able to make is to get the [[Cinder track|track]] reopened for Janae Watson ([[Vicky Jeudy]]) who was put in solitary confinement during the screwdriver incident. Chapman makes an enemy of [[Tiffany Doggett|Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett]] ([[Taryn Manning]]), who wanted her spot on the council. Doggett tells inmate counselor Sam Healy ([[Michael J. Harney]]) about Chapman and Vause's relationship; Healy punishes her by putting her in solitary confinement and telling Bloom about the affair. Bloom gets back at Chapman by doing an interview on [[NPR]] that casts Litchfield in a harsh light, which makes her even more unpopular. During an angry phone call, Bloom reveals that Vause informed on her. Vause asks Chapman to choose between her and Bloom. Chapman chooses Bloom, but Vause breaks them up and spurns Chapman. When Doggett attacks Chapman with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]], Chapman finally snaps and beats her to a pulp.&lt;ref name=OITNBS1raotne&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-heres-your-recap-ahead-of-season-2-9486431.html|title=Orange Is The New Black: Season 1 recap ahead of the new episodes|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 4, 2014|website=[[The Independent]]|author=Hooton, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OISNBS1R&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/orange-new-black-season-1-recap-everything-know-season-2-premiere-1593957|title='Orange Is The New Black' Season 1 Recap: Everything To Know Before The Season 2 Premiere|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 3, 2014|website=[[International Business Times]]|author=Schaefer, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
After spending a month in [[solitary confinement]], Chapman is flown to [[Chicago]] to serve as a witness against the drug kingpin who had been Vause's boss.&lt;ref name=OItNBS2RP1/&gt; There, she spends time in a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security prison]] with dangerous inmates who menace her daily.&lt;ref name=TSOITNBSOS2AP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/06/23/taylor-schilling-orange-is-the-new-black-piper-chapman-interview_n_5522381.html|title=Taylor Schilling, 'Orange Is The New Black' Star, On Season 2 And Playing The Ever-Evolving Piper|accessdate=October 5, 2014|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|author=Jancelewicz, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in episode 1, "Thirsty Bird", we see Chapman as a young girl ([[Clare Foley]]) in a flashback, discovering that her father is cheating on her mother. Vause persuades Chapman to commit [[perjury]] in order to keep them safe from the drug lord, but ultimately cuts a deal to testify against her former boss in return for early release; she then leaves Chapman to suffer the consequences of her perjured testimony alone. In episode 3, "Hugs Can Be Deceiving", we find out that Crazy Eyes had run outside and knocked Chapman unconscious after she had beaten up Doggett at the end of season 1. In episode 6, "You Also Have a Pizza", Chapman starts a prison newsletter, and makes a deal with a reporter to investigate the financial goings on at the prison. She eventually uncovers evidence that assistant warden Natalie Figueroa ([[Alysia Reiner]]) has been embezzling from the prison.&lt;ref name=OItNBS2RP1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-review-140195141813/|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2 Review, Part 1 (Episodes 1-6): Conflict Over Community|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]|author=Surette, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep her quiet, Figueroa arranges for Chapman to be transferred to a facility in [[Virginia]]. However, when Chapman gives prison administrator Joe Caputo ([[Nick Sandow]]) the evidence implicating Figueroa, he cancels the transfer and gives the warden the incriminating information, resulting in Figueroa's resignation.

Chapman gets a [[furlough]] to go to her grandmother's funeral. At home in [[New York City]], she realizes that Larry has lost interest in her, and soon learns that he has fallen in love with her best friend, Polly Harper ([[Maria Dizzia]]). Chapman is furious at first, but eventually agrees to give them her blessing in return for either of them telling Vause's parole officer that Vause is going to break parole, which will land her back in Litchfield prison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-review-part-2-140267649464/|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2 Review, Part 2 (Episodes 7-13): Fight the Power|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]|author=Surette, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
Chapman begins a business selling used panties to people outside of Litchfield, enlisting her brother Cal as her middleman. Chapman begins a romantic relationship with an Australian prisoner, Stella. After Stella steals Chapman's money, she plants contraband in Stella's bunk and orchestrates her being sent to the maximum security unit in retaliation the day before Stella's release date.

===Season 4===
Chapman continues her panty business but finds herself in competition with a group of Dominicans led by Maria Ruiz. When Chapman aligns herself with a gang of white supremacists and plants contraband in Maria's bunk, Maria retaliates by kidnapping her and having her branded with a swastika.&lt;ref&gt;VanArendonk, Kathryn.

'''Rajput painting''', also called  '''Rajasthani painting''', evolved and flourished in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]] in [[India]].  Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana. [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniatures]] in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of [[Shekhawati]], the forts and palaces built by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs.

The colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones.  Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

== Content ==
While there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.

Outside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.

Both of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as distinct portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists ([[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works. Likewise, Rajput techniques are not predominantly seen in [[Mughal painting]]s. &lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;small&gt;"At the opening of the eighteenth century, therefore, Rajput painting remains recognizably different in intent from traditional Mughal attitudes" (Beach 175).&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Schools ==
[[File:Maker unknown, India - Krishna and Radha - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Krishna and Radha'', might be the work of Nihal Chand, a master of the Kishangarh school trained at the imperial court in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Krishna and Radha|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/76766.html|accessdate=26 October 2018|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neeraj|first=Jai Singh|title=Splendour Of Rajasthani Painting|year=1991|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC&amp;pg=PP15&amp;lpg=PP15&amp;dq=shekhawati+painting&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-1KPo1-Rmd&amp;sig=uBKBi0BtGlqniNoZhs8NxBjGbbs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=djcvUK6POdHRrQfRxIG4Bw&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=shekhawati%20painting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are:
# The [[Mewar]] school that contains the [[Chavand, Rajasthan|Chavand]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Devgarh, Rajasthan|Devgarh]], [[Udaipur]] and [[Sawar]] styles of painting
# The [[Marwar]] school comprising the [[Kishangarh]], [[Bikaner]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Nagaur]], [[Pali]] and [[Ghanerao]] styles
# The [[Hadoti]] school with the [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Bundi]] and [[Jhalawar State|Jhalawar]] styles and
# The Dhundar school of [[Amber]], [[Jaipur]], [[Shekhawati painting|Shekhawati]] and [[Uniara]] styles of painting.

The [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and [[Kullu]] schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. [[Nainsukh]] is a famous artist of [[Pahari painting]], working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north.

Economic prosperity of commercial community and revival of “Vaisnavism” and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand.

All of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.

The '''Rubin Museum of Art''' is a museum dedicated to the collection, display, and preservation of the art and cultures of the [[Himalaya]]s, India and neighboring regions, with a permanent collection focused particularly on [[Tibetan art]]. It is located at 150 [[17th Street (Manhattan)|West 17th Street]] between the [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Avenue of the Americas]] (Sixth Avenue) and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] in the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Peaceful Places: New York City: 129 Tranquil Sites in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island | publisher=Menasha Ridge Press | author=Kanter, Evelyn | year=2010 | location=Birmingham, AL | page=183 | isbn=9780897327206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

==History==
The museum originated from a private collection of Himalayan art which Donald and Shelley Rubin had been assembling since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35165-2004Oct15.html|title=In New York, Himalayan Art With a Lofty Mission|last=Powell|first=Michael|date=October 17, 2004|website=The Washington Post|page=N01|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Rubins paid $22 million for the building that had been occupied by [[Barneys New York]], a designer fashion department store that had filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/realestate/postings-himalayan-artworks-17th-seventh-former-barneys-house-museum.html|title=Himalayan Artworks at 17th and Seventh; A Former Barneys To House a Museum - New York Times|last=Barbanel|first=Josh|date=2004-05-02|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was remodeled as a museum by preservation architects [[Beyer Blinder Belle]]. The original six-story spiral staircase was left intact to become the center of the {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|abbr=off}} of exhibition space.

The museum opened on October 2, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/arts/art-karma-top-floor-next-to-shoes.html|title=ART; Karma? Top Floor, Next to Shoes|last=Larson|first=Kay|date=2004-07-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and displays more than 1,000 objects including paintings, sculpture, and textiles, as well as ritual objects from the 2nd to the 20th centuries.  The new facade on 17th Street and the five floors of galleries were influenced by [[Tibetan art]], and were conceived by New York-based [[museum architect]]s Celia Imrey and Tim Culbert. Its graphic identity was conceived by [[graphic designer]] [[Milton Glaser]].

Besides exhibitions based on the museum's permanent collection, it also serves as a venue for national and international traveling exhibitions. The museum is affiliated with the Himalayan Art website to advance the study of Himalayan arts and culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayanart.org Himalayan Art website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The museum's exhibitions and programs are supported by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the New York State Music Fund, the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]], other corporate and foundation donors, and a roster of corporate and individual members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rubin Museum of Art: The First Five Years|url=http://docs.rma2.org/AR2004-09.pdf|publisher=Rubin Museum of Art.|location=New York|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the museum announced that founders Donald and Shelley Rubin would give a five-year, $25 million gift to support operations, exhibitions, and programs. Donald Rubin also planned to step down as chief executive, although the couple were to continue to lead the museum's board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/20/rubin-museum-will-get-25-million-and-a-new-chief-executive-/?ref-rubinmuseumofart | title=Rubin Museum Will Get $25 Million and a New Chief Executive | author=Kennedy, Randy | date=October 20, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
The 70,000-square-foot museum occupies what was formerly a portion of the [[Barneys New York|Barneys department store]] in Manhattan's [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood. It was acquired in 1998 and renovated extensively from 2000-2004. The renovation and new design elements were the results of a collaboration headed by the architectural firm of [[Beyer Blinder Belle]] and including Atelier Imrey Culbert (associate museum designers) and [[Milton Glaser#Milton Glaser Inc.|Milton Glaser Incorporated]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Many of the architectural details within the building were retained, most notably [[Andree Putman]]'s steel-and-marble staircase that spirals through the six-story gallery tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/9974/|title=Stairway to Nirvana|last=Stevens|first=Mark|date=May 21, 2005|work=New York Magazine|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to gallery space for featured exhibitions, the museum includes space for contemporary and historical photography, an art-making studio, a theater for multimedia events and performances, a café, and a gift shop. In September 2011, the museum opened a new 5,000 square-foot Education Center adjacent to the main museum building. The new space provides greatly expanded spaces to better facilitate lifelong learning and serve more visitors in deeper, more substantial ways. The Education Center was designed by Lee H. Skolnick Architecture + Design Partnership.&lt;ref name="Rubin Museum website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmanyc.org/ |title=Rubin Museum of Art website |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:Rubin Museum galleries.JPG|thumb|left|The second-floor gallery with objects from the permanent collection]]Among the museum's inaugural exhibitions were "Methods of Transcendance" and "Portraits of Transmission" (both October 2004-January 2005) and "The Demonic Divine in Himalayan Art" (October 2004-March 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Rubin Museum of Art: The First Five Years | publisher=Rubin Museum of Art | year=2010 | location=New York | page=82 | url=http://docs.rma2.org/AR2004-09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Demonic Divine: Himalayan Art and Beyond | publisher=Rubin Museum of Art and Serindia Publications | last1=Linrothe |first1=Robert N. |last2= Rhie |first2=Marilyn M. | year=2004 | location=New York and Chicago | page=321 | isbn=1932476083}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a three-part exhibition called "Holy Madness" spotlighted [[siddhas]] with "Portraits of Tantric Siddhas," "Mahasiddhas at Gyantse," and "Mahasiddhas at Alchi." Not limited in its focus to Buddhist and Hindu religious objects, "I See No Stranger: Early Sikh Art and Devotion" (September 2006-January 2007), "Bon: The Magic Word" (November 2007-February 2008), and "Victorious Ones: Jain Images of Perfection" (September 2009-February 2010) exhibited works related to each of those faiths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} June thru August of 2008, the museum held an exhibit entitled ''Buddha in Paradise'' which was made up of "40 works, from the 13th to the early 20th century, of painting, sculpture, and ritual texts" from the museums collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nysun.com/arts/paradise-on-earth-at-the-rubin-museum/80274/|title=Paradise on Earth at the Rubin Museum|last=Esplund|first=Lance|date=June 19, 2008|website=The New York Sun|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the "Gateway to Himalayan Art" exhibition opened on the museum's second floor. Presenting the fundamentals of Himalayan art, it explains the symbolism, iconography, and ritual implements in the artworks as well as the materials from which they are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/karlins/gateway-to-himalayan-art-rubin-museum9-14-10.asp | title=Gateway to the Himalayas | publisher=artnet.com | date=September 14, 2010 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Karlins, N. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit was to remain on view until 2014, with yearly rotations of specific objects. A two-year exhibit on the third floor, "Masterworks: Jewels of the Collection" (March 2011-January 2013), highlights the stylistic diversity of the museum's holdings and the connections between Himalayan and neighboring artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/exhibitions | title=Rubin Museum of Art: Exhibitions | accessdate=May 22, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609034713/http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/exhibitions | archivedate=June 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Activities==

The Rubin Museum offers an array of on- and off-site educational programs, as well as public programs such as talks and discussions; film screenings; live music, dance, poetry and other performances; and art demonstrations. The museum continues to refine a museum-wide access program in order to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities and special needs, language challenges, and at-risk and underserved segments of the population.

The '''''San Giobbe Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala di San Giobbe'') is a c. 1487 [[oil painting]] by the Italian Renaissance master [[Giovanni Bellini]], now in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]].

==History==
This altarpiece is one of the masterworks of Bellini's mature period, and was painted for the second left altar of the church of [[San Giobbe]] in Venice. It was probably inspired by the [[San Cassiano Altarpiece]] by [[ Antonello da Messina]] (1475-1476), and absorbed and further developed that work's innovations. Yet, as the dating of Bellini's painting is uncertain, such dependency cannot be proved.
The work is among Bellini's most famous, a claim made as early as ''De Urbe Sito'', a description of Venice by [[Marco Antonio Sabellico]] (1487-1491).

[[File:Pala di san giobbe 06.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Detail of the musician angels.]]
The depiction of Saints [[Saint Sebastian| Sebastian]] and [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] indicates that the painting might be created in connection with the plague probably that of 1987&lt;sup&gt;[correct date?]&lt;/sup&gt;. The dating of the work is disputed, ranging from the early 1470s to the late 1480s.  [[Jacopo Sansovino]] wrote in 1581 that the work for San Giobbe was Bellini's first using oil painting, which would imply an earlier date, nearer to Antonello's altarpiece. Yet, many scholars have disputed such claim.

The altarpiece remained in the church of San Giobbe until 1814-1818&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rugolo |first=Ruggero |language=fr|date= 2013|title= Venise - Où trouver Bellini, Carpaccio, Titen, Tintoret, Véronèse |url= |location= |publisher=Scala  |page= 12|isbn= 9788881173891|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
The work can be read as an example of [[Holy Conversation]]: Mary sits on a tall marble throne, holding the Child; at her feet are three musician angels, while at the side are, in symmetrical positions, six saints. They are, on the left, Sts. [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]], [[John the Baptist]] and Job; on the right, Sts. [[Saint Dominic|Dominic]], Sebastian and [[Louis of Toulouse]]. The child's feature are very similar to those in the [[Contarini Madonna]], also housed in the Accademia Gallery.

The upper part features a perspective coffered ceiling, flanked with pillars which are copies of the real ones at the original altar. Behind the Madonna is a dark niche. In the latter's half-dome is a gilt mosaic decoration in the Venetian style.

'''Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon''', founded as '''Shreve &amp; Lamb''', was an [[architect|architectural firm]], best known for designing the [[Empire State Building]], the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion in 1931.

==History==
The firm was founded in 1920 as Shreve &amp; Lamb, a partnership of [[Richmond Shreve|Richmond Harold ("R.H.") Shreve]], a Canadian from [[Nova Scotia]], and [[William F. Lamb]], from [[Brooklyn]], New York, United States (U.S.)—Shreve was the administrator, while Lamb was the designer. The two met while working at [[Carrère &amp; Hastings]], and Shreve &amp; Lamb was initially a Carrère &amp; Hastings firm. In 1924 the pair decided to leave Carrère &amp; Hastings and became an autonomous architectural company.&lt;ref name="Klose" /&gt;

In 1929 [[Arthur Loomis Harmon]], from [[Chicago]], U.S., joined Shreve &amp; Lamb, and the firm became Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon.&lt;ref name="Klose"&gt;Klose, Oliivia. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110309215524/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/2427.pdf "500 Fifth Avenue Designation Report"] [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (December 14, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining the firm, Harmon's works included battle monuments at Tours, Cantigny and Somme-Py in France, a YMCA in [[Jerusalem]], and the Shelton Hotel in New York, U.S.&lt;ref name="Klose" /&gt;

For the construction of the Empire State Building, the firm's most notable work, Lamb was responsible for the design, while Shreve's planning skills facilitated the completion of the construction in a year. Shreve's planning skills were recognized in New York and he was involved in projects beyond the firm, such as the [[Slum clearance]] Committee of New York.&lt;ref name="Klose" /&gt;

Shreve, Lamb &amp; Harmon primary focus was commercial office buildings and their work in this area was described as "spare and functional" in 2010 by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. However, the firm completed numerous residential projects, such as No. 130 East 57th Street, and this facet of the company's work was mainly conducted in neo-Tudor, as well as other popular historical styles of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Klose" /&gt;

The '''Southern Theatre''' is an historic [[theater (structure)|theater]] located at 21 East Main Street in [[downtown Columbus, Ohio|downtown]] [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It opened on September 21, 1896 and is the oldest surviving theater in Central Ohio and one of the oldest in the state of [[Ohio]]. The Southern Theatre is currently owned and operated as a home for live concerts, plays and opera by CAPA (the [[Columbus Association for the Performing Arts]]). CAPA also manages several other venues in Columbus including the [[Ohio Theatre (Columbus)|Ohio]], the [[Palace Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)|Palace]], and the [[Lincoln Theatre (Columbus, Ohio)|Lincoln Theatre]]s.&lt;ref name="capav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capa.com/columbus/venues/|title=CAPA, Venues|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Design===
Between 1889 and 1893 a series of fires destroyed five downtown Columbus theaters. As a result, a group of businessmen decided to develop a new hotel and theater with modern construction and safety features on the southern edge of downtown. The building was called "The Great Southern Fireproof Hotel and Opera House", and was designed by the local architectural firm of Dauben, Krumm, and Riebel. Construction began in 1894. Both the theater and the hotel were constructed of "fireproof" tile, brick, iron, steel, and concrete.&lt;ref name=capa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capa.com/venues/southern-theatre/theatre-history|title=Southern Theatre History|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater's auditorium design was progressive for its day and was reminiscent of [[Louis H. Sullivan]]'s 1891 [[Garrick Theater (Chicago)|Schiller Theatre]] in Chicago. From the [[proscenium]] opening, a series of concentric arches dotted with incandescent electric lights radiate into the house, resulting in superior lighting and excellent acoustics. Built to be self-sufficient, the theater, one of the first commercial buildings in Columbus to use electricity, [[electricity generation|generated]] its own power. Additionally, the building had three [[water well|wells]] in the basement, from which it produced its own water supply.&lt;ref name=capa/&gt; The theatre currently seats 933&lt;ref name="CJO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzartsgroup.org/cjo/venue.php |title=Columbus Jazz Orchestra |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065450/http://jazzartsgroup.org/cjo/venue.php |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an intimate "jewel box" type theater with two balconies.

In 1982, the Southern Theatre and its associated hotel were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

===Use===
The Great Southern Theatre originally hosted theatrical touring productions. [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was just one of the famous performers to play the theater in its first two decades. In the 1910s and 1920s the theater, now called the Southern, featured first run [[silent films]] and live [[vaudeville]]. From the 1930s on, the Southern was a popular home for second-run double features. In the 1970s the theater briefly returned to first run fare as the Towne Cinema, showing black exploitation movies. Throughout the 1970s the Southern also hosted a weekly live Country Music Jamboree, sponsored by local radio station [[WMNI]].&lt;ref name=capa/&gt;

The theater closed in 1979 and in 1986 was acquired by CAPA. After sitting empty for nearly two decades, the Southern was completely restored by CAPA in 1997-98 during an extensive 14-month rebuilding process. The newly restored Southern Theatre reopened on September 26, 1998.

'''Sumner Locke''' (4 July 1881 – 18 October 1917) was an Australian novelist, dramatist, poet and short story writer.

==Life and career==
Born '''Helena Sumner Locke''', she was the daughter of a clergyman and spent the early years of her childhood in Queensland before moving with her family to Melbourne in 1888.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/locke-helena-sumner-7215 "Locke, Helena Sumner (1881-1917)" Australian Dictionary of Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke began publishing short stories in such publications as ''The Bulletin'' and the ''Native Companion'' before her first play, ''The Vicissitudes of Vivienne'', was produced in 1908. This was followed the next year by a Sydney production of ''A Martyr to Principle''.  She was later described by a Sydney newspaper as being "the first woman dramatist to have a play produced in Australia by a commercial theatrical management".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article102213779 ''The Globe and Sunday Times War Pictorial'', "Sumner Locke", 15 January 1917, p16]&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer's reputation was enhanced by the publication in 1911 of ''Mum Dawson, 'Boss' '', a series of inter-connected stories about a back-blocks country woman struggling to maintain her farm and her family. ''The Examiner'' described it as having "a strong vein of genuine humour".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50485994 ''The Examiner'', "Literature: Notes on New Books", 28 July 1911, p7]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed a year later by its sequel ''The Dawsons' Uncle George''.

In 1912 Locke left Australia for England to work as a journalist and writer but returned to Australia in 1915 to nurse her sick mother.&lt;ref name=adb /&gt; In 1916 she published her best known work, ''Samaritan Mary'', in the United States.  It received favourable reviews there,&lt;ref name=adb /&gt; and "enjoyed a remarkable success."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15736275 "Death of Sumner Locke", ''The Sydney Morning Herald, 19 October 1917, p8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke married a childhood friend, Henry Logan Elliott, in January 1917.  He was posted to the front some two weeks later.  Locke traveled to America later in 1917 in order to meet her New York publisher, but was unable to join her husband in Europe due to the closing of the Atlantic crossing.&lt;ref name=adb /&gt;  She returned to Australia and gave birth to a son, [[Sumner Locke Elliott]], on 17 October 1917.  A day later she died from complications arising from the birth.

[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 03.jpg|thumb|330px|Mary and Christ]]
'''''The Last Judgment''''' ({{lang-it|Il Giudizio Universale}}&lt;ref name="museums"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Judgement|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/CSNs/CSNs_G_Giud.html|publisher=Vatican Museums|access-date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Michelangelo]] covering the whole [[altar]] wall of the [[Sistine Chapel]] in [[Vatican City]]. It is a depiction of the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and the [[Last Judgment|final and eternal judgment]] by God of all humanity. The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent [[saints]].  Altogether there are over 300 figures, with nearly all the males and angels originally shown as nudes; many were later partly covered up by painted draperies, of which some remain after recent cleaning and restoration. 

The work took over four years to complete between 1536 and 1541 (preparation of the altar wall began in 1535). Michelangelo began working on it twenty-five years after having finished the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], and was nearly 67 at its completion.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 639&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelangelo originally accepted the commission from [[Pope Clement VII]], but it was completed under [[Pope Paul III]], whose stronger reforming views probably affected the final treatment.&lt;ref name="Freedberg_471"&gt;Freedberg, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven are joined by the newly saved.  The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however, revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene.

The reception of the painting was mixed from the start, with much praise but also criticism on both religious and artistic grounds.  Both the amount of nudity and the muscular style of the bodies has been one area of contention, and the overall composition another.

== Description ==
Where traditional compositions generally contrast an ordered, harmonious heavenly world above with the tumultuous events taking place in the earthly zone below, in Michelangelo's conception the arrangement and posing of the figures across the entire painting give an impression of agitation and excitement,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the upper parts there is "a profound disturbance, tension and commotion" in the figures.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 187&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sidney J. Freedberg]] interprets their "complex responses" as "those of giant powers here made powerless, bound by racking spiritual anxiety", as their role of intercessors with the deity had come to an end, and perhaps they regret some of the verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 471 (quoted), 473&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an impression that all the groups of figures are circling the central figure of Christ in a huge rotary movement.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 640; Freedberg, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the work is Christ, shown as the individual verdicts of the Last Judgement are pronounced; he looks down towards the damned.  He is beardless, and "compounded from antique conceptions of [[Hercules]], [[Apollo]], and [[Jupiter]] Fulminator",&lt;ref name="Freedberg_471" /&gt; probably, in particular, the [[Belvedere Apollo]], brought to the Vatican by [[Pope Julius II]].&lt;ref name="Khan"&gt;Khan&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are parallels for his pose in earlier ''Last Judgments'', especially one in the [[Camposanto]] of [[Pisa]], which Michelangelo would have known; here the raised hand is part of a gesture of ''[[ostentatio vulnerum]]'' ("display of the wounds"), where the resurrected Christ reveals the wounds of his Crucifixion, which can be seen on Michelangelo's figure.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 185; Hall, 187; [[:File:Buonamico buffalmacco Camposanto.jpg|Detail from Pisa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the left of Christ is his mother, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], who turns her head to look down towards the Saved, though her pose also suggests resignation.  It appears that the moment has passed for her to exercise her traditional role of pleading on behalf of souls; with [[John the Baptist]] this [[Deesis]] is a regular motif in earlier compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 185–186; Freedberg, 471; Barnes, 65–69; Murray, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Preparatory drawings show her standing and facing Christ with arms outstretched, in a more traditional intercessory posture.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 63–66&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo - Cristo Juiz.jpg|thumb|330px|The central group around Christ]]
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 33.jpg|thumb|330px|A group of the Saved]]

Surrounding Christ are large numbers of figures, the saints and other saved souls.  On a similar scale to Christ are John the Baptist on the left, and on the right [[Saint Peter]], holding the [[keys of Heaven]] and perhaps offering them back to Christ, as they will no longer be needed.&lt;ref name="Khan" /&gt;  Several of the main saints appear to be showing Christ their attributes, the evidence of the martyrdom. This used to be interpreted as the saints calling for the damnation of those who had not served the cause of Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 10&lt;/ref&gt; but other interpretations have become more common,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 186&lt;/ref&gt; including that the saints are themselves not certain of their own verdicts, and try at the last moment to remind Christ of their sufferings.

Other prominent saints include [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]] below Peter, holding the attribute of his martyrdom, his own skin.  The face on this is usually recognized as being a self-portrait of Michelangelo.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 206; Hartt, 641; Khan&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others, even of the larger saints, are difficult to identify. [[Ascanio Condivi]], Michelangelo's tame authorized biographer, says that all of the [[Twelve Apostles]] are shown around Christ, "but he does not attempt to name them and would probably have had a difficult time doing so".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 72&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 38.jpg|thumb|350px|The damned in the air]]
The movements of the souls reflect the traditional pattern.  They arise from their graves at bottom left, and some continue upwards, helped in several cases by angels in the air (mostly without wings) or others on clouds, pulling them up.  Others, the damned, apparently pass over to the right, though none are quite shown doing so; there is a zone in the lower middle that is empty of souls.  A boat rowed by an aggressive [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], who ferried souls to the Underworld in classical mythology (and [[Dante]]), brings souls to land beside the entrance to Hell; his threatening them with his oar is a direct borrowing from Dante.  [[Satan]], the traditional Christian devil is not shown, but another classical figure, [[Minos]], supervises the admission of the Damned into Hell; this was his role in Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.  He is generally agreed to have been given the features of [[Biagio da Cesena]], a critic of Michelangelo in the Papal court.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 187–190; Freedberg, 471&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre above Charon is a group of angels on clouds, seven blowing trumpets (as in the [[Book of Revelation]]), other holding books that record the names of the Saved and Damned.  To their right is a larger figure of a soul who has just realized that he is damned, and appears paralyzed with horror.  Two devils are pulling him downwards.  To the right of this devils pull down other souls; some are being pushed down by angels above them.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 189; Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choice of subject ==
[[File:'Sistine Chapel ceiling' by Michelangelo JBU21.JPG|thumb|330px|The ''Last Judgment'' at the end of the chapel]]
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 51 inferno.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] and his boat of damned souls]]
The [[Doom paintings|Last Judgment was a traditional subject]] for large church frescos, but it was unusual to place it at the east end, over the altar. The traditional position was on the west wall, over the main doors at the back of a church, so that the congregation took this reminder of their options away with them on leaving. It might be either painted on the interior, as for example by [[Giotto]] at the [[Arena Chapel]], or in a sculpted [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] on the exterior.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 186–187; Sistine, 181; Hartt, 640; Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a number of late medieval panel paintings, mostly altarpieces, were based on the subject with similar compositions, although adapted to a horizontal picture space.  These include the ''[[Beaune Altarpiece]]'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], and ones by artists such as [[The Last Judgment (Fra Angelico, Florence)|Fra Angelico]], [[The Last Judgment (Memling)|Hans Memling]] and [[The Last Judgment (Bosch triptych)|Hieronymus Bosch]].  Many aspects of Michelangelo's composition reflect the well-established traditional Western depiction, but with a fresh and original approach.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 182–184&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional versions had a figure of ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' in about the same position as Michelangelo's, and even larger than his, with a greater disproportion in scale to the other figures.  As here, compositions contained large numbers of figures, divided between angels and saints around Christ at the top, and the souls being judged below.  Typically there is a strong contrast between the ordered ranks of figures in the top part, and chaotic and frenzied activity below, especially on the right side that leads to Hell.  The flow of souls usually began at the bottom (viewer's) left, as here, as resurrected souls rise from their graves and move towards judgement. Some pass judgement and continue upwards or to the left, to join the company in heaven, while others pass over to the right and then downwards towards Hell in the bottom right corner (compositions had difficulty incorporating [[Purgatory]] visually).&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 187; Hartt, 640; Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  The damned souls may be shown naked, as a mark of their humiliation as devils carry them off, and sometimes the newly-resurrected souls too, but angels and those in Heaven are fully dressed, their clothing a main clue to the identity of groups and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 640; Clark, 300–310 for a famous account of nudity in medieval religious art.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before starting ==
The project was a long time in gestation.  It was probably first proposed in 1533, but was not then attractive to Michelangelo. A number of letters and other sources describe the original subject as a "Resurrection", but it seems most likely that this was always meant in the sense of the General [[Resurrection of the Dead]], followed in [[Christian eschatology]] by the Last Judgment, rather than the [[Resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 180; Hughes; Vasari, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars believe there was indeed a substitution of the more sombre final subject, reflecting the emerging mood of the [[Counter-Reformation]], and an increase in the area of the wall to be covered.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 471; Hartt, 639 (both rather older sources than those taking the contrary view, which may be relevant).&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of Michelangelo's drawings from the early 1530s develop a ''Resurrection of Jesus''.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 180; Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasari]], alone among contemporary sources, says that originally Michelangelo was intended to paint the other end wall with a [[War in Heaven|Fall of the Rebel Angels]] to match.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 178–180; Vasari, 269&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 1535 the preparation of the wall was begun, but it was over a year before painting began.  Michelangelo stipulated the filling-in of two narrow windows, the removal of three [[cornice]]s, and building the surface increasingly forward as it rises, to give a single uninterrupted wall surface slightly leaning out, by about 11 inches over the height of the fresco.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 31, 178; Murray, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

The preparation of the wall led to the end of more than twenty years of friendship between Michelangelo and [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], who tried to persuade the Pope and Michelangelo to do the painting in his preferred technique of oil on plaster, and managed to get the smooth plaster finish needed for this applied.  It is possible that around this stage the idea was floated that Sebastiano would do the actual painting, to Michelangelo's designs, as they had collaborated nearly 20 years earlier. After, according to Vasari, some months of passivity, Michelangelo furiously insisted that it should be in fresco, and had the wall re-plastered in the rough ''[[arriccio]]'' needed as a base for fresco.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 178; Vasari covers this in his [http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariSebastianoPiombo.html life of Sebastiano]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was on this occasion that he famously said that [[oil painting]] was "an art for women and for leisurely and idle people like Fra Sebastiano".&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, [http://members.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariSebastianoPiombo.html "Life of Sebastiano del Piombo"] (near the end)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new fresco required, unlike his Sistine Chapel ceiling, considerable destruction of existing art. There was an [[altarpiece]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]] by [[Pietro Perugino]] above the altar, for which a drawing survives in the [[Albertina]],&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 31, 34&lt;/ref&gt; flanked by tapestries to [[Raphael Cartoons|designs by Raphael]]; these, of course, could just be used elsewhere. Above this zone, there were two paintings from the 15th-century cycles of Moses and Christ which still occupy the middle zone of the side walls.  These were probably Perugino's ''[[Finding of Moses]]'' and the ''[[Adoration of the Kings]]'', beginning both cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Above them were the first of the series of standing popes in niches, including [[Saint Peter]] himself, probably as well as a [[Saint Paul]] and a central figure of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 32, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the project required the destruction of two [[lunette]]s with the first two ''Ancestors of Christ'' from Michelangelo's own ceiling scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 180&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some of these works may have already been damaged by an accident in April 1525, when the [[altar curtain]]s went on fire; the damage done to the wall is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 33&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 35.jpg|thumb|350px|The Resurrection of the Dead]]

The structure of the chapel, built in a great hurry in the 1470s,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; had given trouble from the start, with frequent cracks appearing. At Christmas in 1525 a [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]] was killed when entering the chapel with the pope when the stone [[lintel]] to the doorway split and fell on him.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 31–33&lt;/ref&gt;  The site is on sandy soil, draining a large area, and the preceding "Great Chapel" had had similar problems.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

The new scheme for the altar wall and other changes necessitated by structural problems led to a loss of symmetry and "continuity of window-rhythms and cornices", as well as some of the most important parts of the previous iconographical schemes.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 38 (quoted), 184&lt;/ref&gt;  As shown by drawings, the initial conception for the ''Last Judgement'' was to leave the existing altarpiece and work round it, stopping the composition below the frescos of Moses and Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sistine Chapel was dedicated to the ''Assumption of the Virgin'', which had been the subject of Perugino's altarpiece. Once it was decided to remove this, it appears that a tapestry of the ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'', a subject often linked to the ''Assumption'', was commissioned, which was hung above the altar for important liturgical occasions in the 18th century, and perhaps from the 1540s until then.  The tapestry has a vertical format (it is {{convert|4.3|by|3|m}}), and is still in the [[Vatican Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;  A print of 1582 shows the chapel in use, with a large cloth of roughly this shape hanging behind the altar, and a canopy over it. The cloth is shown as plain, but the artist also omits the paintings below the ceiling, and may well not have been present himself, but working from prints and descriptions.

== Reception and later changes ==
[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 29.jpg|thumb|350px|Group of the damned, with [[Biagio da Cesena]] as [[Minos]] at right]]
[[File:Marcello Venusti Juicio Universal Tempera Grassa sobre tabla 1549 Museo di Capodimonte.jpg|350px|thumb|1549 copy of the still unretouched mural by [[Marcello Venusti]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples).]]
=== Religious objections ===
''The Last Judgment'' became controversial as soon as it was seen, with disputes between critics in the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] and supporters of the genius of the artist and the style of the painting. Michelangelo was accused of being insensitive to proper [[decorum]], in respect of nudity and other aspects of the work, and of pursuing artistic effect over following the scriptural description of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 112–114, 118–119; Sistine, 190–198; Khan&lt;/ref&gt;

On a preview visit with Paul III, before the work was complete, the pope's Master of Ceremonies [[Biagio da Cesena]] is reported by Vasari as saying that: "it was most disgraceful that in so sacred a place there should have been depicted all those nude figures, exposing themselves so shamefully, and that it was no work for a papal chapel but rather for the public baths and taverns".&lt;ref name="Vasari_274"&gt;Vasari, 274&lt;/ref&gt;  Michelangelo immediately worked Cesena's face from memory into the scene as [[Minos]],&lt;ref name="Vasari_274" /&gt; judge of the underworld (far bottom-right corner of the painting) with [[donkey ears]] (i.e. indicating foolishness), while his nudity is covered by a coiled snake. It is said that when Cesena complained to the Pope, the pontiff joked that his jurisdiction did not extend to Hell, so the portrait would have to remain.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by [[Lodovico Domenichi]] in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_2g8AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA668 Historia di detti et fatti notabili di diversi Principi &amp; huommi privati moderni]'' (1556), p. 668&lt;/ref&gt;  Pope Paul III himself was attacked by some for commissioning and protecting the work, and came under pressure to alter if not entirely remove the ''Last Judgement'', which continued under his successors.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marcello venusti, santi biagio e caterina prima della censura, 1549.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Marcello Venusti]]'s copy; detail showing an uncensored version of [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] at the bottom left while above her, the figure at the left had a different head position]]
[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 28.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Daniele da Volterra]]'s new [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]]]]

The mixing of figures from pagan mythology into depictions of Christian subject matter was objected to.  As well as the figures of Charon and Minos, and wingless angels, the very classicized Christ was objected to.  Beardless Christs had in fact only finally disappeared from Christian art some four centuries earlier, but Michelangelo's figure was unmistakenly Apollonian.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 61; Sistine, 190; Blunt, 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Further objections related to failures to follow the scriptural references. The angels blowing trumpets are all in one group, whereas in the Book of Revelation they are sent to "the four corners of the earth".  Christ is not seated on a throne, contrary to Scripture.  Such draperies as Michelangelo painted are often shown as blown by wind, but it was claimed that all weather would cease on the Day of Judgement.  The resurrected souls are in mixed condition, some skeletons but most appearing with their flesh intact.  All these objections were eventually collected in a book, the ''Due Dialogi'' published just after Michelangelo's death in 1564, by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian [[Giovanni Andrea Gilio]] (da Fabriano), who had become one of several theologians policing art during and after the Council of Trent.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 112–114; Barnes, 84–86; Sistine, 192&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as theological objections, Gilio objected to artistic devices like [[foreshortening]] that puzzled or distracted untrained viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades after the fresco was completed, the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563 finally enacted a form of words that reflected the [[Counter-Reformation art#Council of Trent|Counter-Reformation attitudes to art]] that had been growing in strength in the Church for some decades.  The Council's decree (drafted at the last minute and generally very short and inexplicit) reads in part : {{Quote|Every superstition shall be removed ... all lasciviousness be avoided;  in such wise that figures shall not be painted or adorned with a beauty exciting to lust... there be nothing seen that is disorderly, or that is unbecomingly or confusedly arranged, nothing that is profane, nothing indecorous, seeing that holiness becometh the house of God. And that these things may be the more faithfully observed, the holy Synod ordains, that no one be allowed to place, or cause to be placed, any unusual image, in any place, or church, howsoever exempted, except that image have been approved of by the bishop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aldersey-Williams|first=Hugh|title=A History of the Fig Leaf|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/history/2013/07/the_fig_leaf_in_painting_and_sculpture_excerpt_from_anatomies_by_hugh_aldersey.html|work=16 July 2013|publisher=Slate|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

There was an explicit decree that: "The pictures in the Apostolic Chapel should be covered over, and those in other churches should be destroyed, if they display anything that is obscene or clearly false".&lt;ref&gt;Decision of January 21, 1564, quoted Sistine, 269, n. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The defences by Vasari and others of the painting evidently made some impact on clerical thinking. In 1573, when [[Paolo Veronese]] was summoned before the Venetian Inquisition to justify his inclusion of "buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities" in what was then called a painting of the [[Last Supper]] (later renamed as ''[[The Feast in the House of Levi]]''), he tried to implicate Michelangelo in a comparable breach of decorum, but was promptly rebuffed by the inquisitors,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 23&lt;/ref&gt; as the transcript records:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;
Q. Does it seem suitable to you, in the Last Supper of our Lord, to represent buffoons, drunken Germans, dwarfs, and other such absurdities?&lt;br /&gt;
A. Certainly not.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Then why have you done it?&lt;br /&gt;
A. I did it on the supposition that those people were outside the room in which the Supper was taking place.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Do you not know that in Germany and other countries infested by heresy, it is habitual, by means of pictures full of absurdities, to vilify and turn to ridicule the things of the Holy Catholic Church, in order to teach false doctrine to ignorant people who have no common sense?&lt;br /&gt;
A. I agree that it is wrong, but I repeat what I have said, that it is my duty to follow the examples given me by my masters.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Well, what did your masters paint? Things of this kind, perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;
A. In Rome, in the Pope's Chapel, Michelangelo has represented Our Lord, His Mother, St. John, St. Peter, and the celestial court; and he has represented all these personages nude, including the Virgin Mary [this last not true], and in various attitudes not inspired by the most profound religious feeling.&lt;br /&gt;
Q. Do you not understand that in representing the Last Judgment, in which it is a mistake to suppose that clothes are worn, there was no reason for painting any? But in these figures what is there that is not inspired by the Holy Spirit? There are neither buffoons, dogs, weapons, nor other absurdities....&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.efn.org/~acd/Veronese.html Transcript translated per] Crawford, Francis Marion: "Salve Venetia". New York, 1905. Vol. II: pages 29–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revisions to the painting ===
Some action to meet the criticism and enact the decision of the council had become inevitable, and the genitalia in the fresco were painted over with drapery by the Mannerist painter [[Daniele da Volterra]], probably mostly after Michelangelo died in 1564.  Daniele was "a sincere and fervent admirer of Michelangelo" who kept his changes to a minimum, and had to be ordered to go back and add more,&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 193–194, 194 quoted; Freedberg, 477–485, 485 on the overpainting; Blunt, 119&lt;/ref&gt; and for his trouble got the nickname "Il Braghettone", meaning "the breeches maker".  He also chiseled away and entirely repainted the larger part of [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] and the entire figure of [[Saint Blaise]] behind her. This was done because in the original version Blaise had appeared to look at Catherine's naked behind, and because to some observers the position of their bodies suggested sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194: Barnes, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;  The repainted version shows Blaise looking away from Saint Catherine, upward towards Christ.

His work, beginning in the upper parts of the wall, was interrupted when [[Pope Pius IV]] died in December 1565 and the chapel needed to be free of scaffolding for the funeral and conclave to elect the next pope. [[El Greco]] had made a helpful offer to repaint the entire wall with a fresco that was "modest and decent, and no less well painted than the other".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 119&lt;/ref&gt;  Further campaigns of overpainting, often "less discreet or respectful", followed in later reigns, and "the threat of total destruction ... re-surfaced in the pontificates of [[Pius V]], [[Gregory XIII]], and probably again of [[Clement VIII]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Anthony Blunt]], "rumours were current in 1936 that [[Pius XI]] intended to continue the work".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 119, note&lt;/ref&gt;  In total, nearly 40 figures had drapery added, apart from the two repainted. These additions were in [[fresco secco|"dry" fresco]], which made them easier to remove in the most recent restoration (1990–94), when about 15 were removed, from those added after 1600. It was decided to leave 16th-century changes.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge (see Further reading) summarized (with comments) in notes 32 and 33 on p. 204 of Dillenberger, John, ''Images and Relics: Theological Perceptions and Visual Images in Sixteenth-century Europe'', 1999, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-512172-4}}, 9780195121728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qubuIWylVJUC&amp;pg=PA204 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a relatively early date, probably in the 16th century, a strip of about 18 inches was lost across the whole width of the bottom of the fresco, as the altar and its backing was modified.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Artistic criticism ===
==== Contemporary ====
As well as the criticism on moral and religious grounds, there was from the start considerable criticism based on purely aesthetic considerations, which had hardly been seen at all in initial reactions to Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]].  Two key figures in the first wave of criticism were [[Pietro Aretino]] and his friend [[Lodovico Dolce]], a prolific Venetian [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]].  Aretino had made considerable efforts to become as close to Michelangelo as he was to [[Titian]], but had always been rebuffed; "in 1545 his patience gave way, and he wrote to Michelangelo that letter on the ''Last Judgement'' which is now famous as an example of insincere prudishness",&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194–196; Blunt, 122–124, 123 quoted; Barnes, 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; a letter written with a view to publication.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Aretino had not in fact seen the finished painting, and based his criticisms on one of the [[old master print|prints]] that had been quickly brought to market.  He "purports to represent the simple folk" in this new wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 82&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it appears that at least the print-buying public preferred the uncensored version of the paintings, as most prints showed this well into the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vasari]] responded to this and other criticisms in the 1st edition of his ''Life of Michelangelo'' in 1550.  Dolce followed up in 1557 with a published dialogue, ''L'Aretino'', almost certainly a collaborative effort with his friend.  Many of the arguments of the theologian critics are repeated, but now in the name of decorum rather than religion, emphasizing that the particular and very prominent location of the fresco made the amount of nudity unacceptable; a convenient argument for Aretino, some of whose projects were frankly pornographic, but intended for private audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194–196; Blunt, 122–124&lt;/ref&gt;  Dolce also complains that Michelangelo's female figures are hard to distinguish from males, and his figures show "anatomical exhibitionism"; criticisms many have echoed.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes; Sistine, 195–196; Blunt, 65–66; Friedländer, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

On these points, a long-lasting rhetorical comparison of Michelangelo and [[Raphael]] developed, in which even supporters such as Vasari participated.  Raphael is held up as the exemplar of all the grace and decorum found lacking in Michelangelo, whose outstanding quality was called by Vasari his ''[[terribiltà]]'', the awesome, sublime or (the literal meaning) terror-inducing quality of his art.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 194–198; Blunt, 76, 99; Vasari, 269, note on translating ''terribiltà/terribilità''&lt;/ref&gt;  Vasari came to partly share this view by the time of the expanded 2nd edition of his ''Lives'', published in 1568, though he explicitly defended the fresco on several points raised by the attackers (without mentioning them), such as the decorum of the fresco, and "amazing diversity of the figures", and asserted it was "directly inspired by God", and a credit to the Pope and his "future renown".&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 99; Vasari, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern ====
[[File:Michelangelo, giudizio universale, dettagli 22.jpg|thumb|350px|Angels at the top left, one with the [[Crown of Thorns]]]]
[[File:Michelangelo, Giudizio Universale 31.jpg|thumb|350px|Saint Bartholomew displaying his flayed skin, with the face of Michelangelo]]
In many respects, modern art historians discuss the same aspects of the work as 16th-century writers: the general grouping of the figures, and rendering of space and movement, the distinctive depiction of anatomy, the nudity and use of colour, and sometimes the theological implications of the fresco. However, Bernadine Barnes points out that no 16th-century critic echoes in the slightest the view of [[Anthony Blunt]] that: "This fresco is the work of a man shaken out of his secure position, no longer at ease with the world, and unable to face it directly.  Michelangelo does not now deal directly with the visible beauty of the physical world".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 71, quoting and discussing Blunt, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, continues Barnes, "it was censured as the work of an arrogant man, and it was justified as a work that made celestial figures more beautiful than natural".&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other modern critics take similar lines to Blunt, like him emphasizing Michelangelo's "tendency away from the material and towards the things of the spirit" in his last decades.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 70–81, 70 quoted; Freedberg, 469–477&lt;/ref&gt;

In theology, the [[Second Coming]] of Christ ended space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, "Michelangelo’s curious representation of space", where "the characters inhabit individual spaces that cannot be combined consistently", is often commented on.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, quoted; Friedländer, 16–18; Freedberg, 473–474&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite apart from the question of decorum, the rendering of anatomy has been often discussed. Writing of "energy" in the nude figure, [[Kenneth Clark]] has:&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 204&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The twist into depth, the struggle to escape from the here and now of the picture plane, which had always distinguished Michelangelo from the Greeks, became the dominating rhythm of his later works.  That colossal nightmare, the Last Judgement, is made up of such struggles.  It is the most overpowering accumulation in all art of bodies in violent movement"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the figure of Christ, Clark says: "Michelangelo has not tried to resist that strange compulsion which made him thicken a torso until it is almost square..".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|S.J. Freedberg]] commented that "The vast repertory of anatomies that Michelangelo conceived for the ''Last Judgement'' seems often to have been determined more by the requirements of art than by compelling needs of meaning ... meant not just to entertain but to overpower us with their effects. Often, too, the figures assume attitudes of which a major sense is one of ornament..."&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 473–474&lt;/ref&gt;  He notes that the two frescos in the [[Cappella Paolina]], Michelangelo's last paintings, begun in November 1542, almost immediately after the ''Last Judgement'', show from the start a major change in style, away from grace and aesthetic effect to an exclusive concern with illustrating the narrative, with no regard for beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 475–477&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration, 1980–1994 ==
{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}
Early appreciations of the fresco had especially mentioned the colours, especially in small details, but over the centuries the build-up of dirt on the surface had largely hidden these.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes; compare Hartt, 641, probably not revised to reflect the restoration.&lt;/ref&gt;  The built-out wall led to extra deposition of soot from candles on the altar.  In 1953 (admittedly in November) [[Bernard Berenson]] put in his diary: "The ceiling looks dark, gloomy. The ''Last Judgment'' even more so... how difficult to make up our minds that these Sistine frescoes are nowadays scarcely enjoyable in the original and much more so in photographs".&lt;ref&gt;Berenson, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The fresco was restored along with the Sistine vault between 1980 and 1994 under the supervision of Fabrizio Mancinelli, the [[curator]] of post-classical collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] and Gianluigi Colalucci, head restorer at the Vatican laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;  During the course of the restoration, about half of the censorship of the "[[fig leaf|Fig-Leaf Campaign]]" was removed. Numerous pieces of buried details, caught under the smoke and grime of scores of years were revealed after the restoration. It was discovered that the fresco of Biagio de Cesena as Minos with donkey ears was being bitten in the genitalia by a coiled snake.

== Inserted self-portrait ==
Most writers agree that Michelangelo depicted his own face in the flayed skin of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]] (see [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)#Modern|above]]).  [[Edgar Wind]] saw this as "a prayer for redemption, that through the ugliness of the outward man might be thrown off, and the inward man resurrected pure", in a [[Neoplatonist]] mood, one that Aretino detected and objected to.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 185–190, 188 quoted; Sistine, 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dixon-chapter-2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.crucifixion.com/visual/theology/johndixon/terror.htm|title= The Terror of Salvation: The Last Judgment|accessdate= 2007-08-01|author= Dixon, John W.

The bearded figure of St. Bartholomew holding the skin was sometimes thought to have the features of Aretino, but open conflict between Michelangelo and Aretino did not occur until 1545, several years after the fresco's completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Leo|title=The Line of Fate in Michelangelo's Painting|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1980|volume=6|issue=3|pages=411–454|doi=10.1086/448058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 during [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann|Haussmann]]'s modernization of Paris the '''Théâtre de la Gaîté''' of the [[boulevard du Temple]] was relocated to the rue Papin across from the Square des Arts et Métiers.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue&gt;[http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue "History: The Venue, 150 Years in the Core of Paris"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323024255/http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue |date=2012-03-23 }} at the La Gaîté-Lyrique website. Retrieved 11 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The new theatre was needed to replace the company's previous theatre on the [[boulevard du Temple]], which had been slated for demolition to make way for the present [[Place de la République]] (Banham 1995, p. 120). The Square des Arts et Métiers, located adjacent to the [[boulevard de Sébastopol]], is now known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Square Émile-Chautemps|fr|vertical-align=sup}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The new theatre, built in an Italian style to designs of the architects [[Jacques-Ignace Hittorff]] and [[Alphonse Cusin]], opened on 3 September.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone 2000, pp. 201, 203; [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=10550&amp;no_cache=1 Théâtre de la Gaîté  Alphonse-Adolphe Cusin], Théâtre de la Gaîté [[Musée d'Orsay]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Architectural&gt;[http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue-0 "Architectural Project: The Venue"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323024325/http://www.gaite-lyrique.net/en/informations-pratiques/venue-0 |date=2012-03-23 }} at the La Gaîté-Lyrique website. Retrieved 14 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade the focus began to shift from [[melodrama]] to [[operetta]] and [[opera]], so the theatre also came to be known as the '''Gaîté-Lyrique'''.&lt;ref&gt;The shift to operetta is mentioned by Banham 1995, p. 120; the new name is mentioned by Block 1881, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfQoNtw4CKQC&amp;dq=%22Ga%C3%AEt%C3%A9-Lyrique%22&amp;pg=PA514#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lyrique%22&amp;f=false vol. 38, p. 514].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1920s Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]] danced here, and after [[World War II]] it was used for [[musical comedy]]. In the 1970s attendance decreased, and there were several attempts to find new uses for the building, culminating in 1989 in the construction of a short-lived amusement park, that resulted in the demolition of most of the theatre, except for the facade, entrance and foyer. The latter were restored during a 2004 reconstruction that converted the building into an arts centre, [[La Gaîté Lyrique]], completed in November 2010.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;

==19th century==
[[Jacques Offenbach]] was the director of the Théâtre de la Gaîté from 1873 to 1874.&lt;ref name=Lamb&gt;Lamb 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[opéra-bouffe]]-féerie  ''[[Le roi Carotte]]'' was first performed here in 1872 and his ''[[opéra-féerie]]'' ''[[Le voyage dans la lune]]'' in 1875. The opera ''[[Le timbre d'argent]]'' by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] was premiered here in 1877, at which time the theatre was briefly known as the '''Théâtre National Lyrique'''.&lt;ref name=Timbre&gt;The piano-vocal score (Saint-Saëns 1877, pp. 1, 3) gives the theatre name as Théâtre National Lyrique. Boston Public Library 1916, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MEAQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA339#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 339], also gives that name and identifies Vizentini as the director. Harding 1980, p. 202, mentions that Vizentini produced an opera by Saint-Saëns at the theatre. Langham-Smith 1992, p. 874, and Levin 2009, p. 391, say the company name was changed to Opéra-National-Lyrique from 5 May 1876 to 2 January 1878. Levin also says Albert Vizentini was the director of the company from 1 July 1875 to 18 May 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] danced at the theatre in 1921, 1923, and 1925.&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt; The 1921 performances included the ballerina [[Lydia Lopokova]] in the title role of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'',&lt;ref name=Buckle&gt;Buckle 1979, pp. 381–382.&lt;/ref&gt; and the company gave premieres of [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Chout]]'' (17 May 1921) and Stravinsky's ''[[Les noces]]'' (13 June 1923).&lt;ref name=Simeone/&gt;

Beginning on 15 November 1932 Franz Lehár's ''[[The Land of Smiles]]'' was first performed in France. It was given in a French adaptation by [[André Mauprey]] and Jean Marietti with the title ''Le pays du sourire''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruyas, Florian (1974).

During the [[Second World War]], the theatre was looted during the occupation. The large chandelier installed by Offenbach disappeared, as well the Emperor's golden coach, which had been stored in the service quarters.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;

After the war Henri Montjoye (né Barbero) took over the theatre, and after his death in 1950, his widow, the soprano [[Germaine Roger]], became the theatre's director.&lt;ref&gt;"Roger, Germaine (d. 1975)" in Gänzl 2001, p. 1733.&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous successes were put on. The 2-act operetta ''Andalousie'' by [[Albert Willemetz]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Raymond Vincy|fr}} with music by {{Interlanguage link multi|Francis Lopez|fr}} had a 12-month run that began on  25 October 1947.&lt;ref&gt;"Andalousie" in Gänzl 2001, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2-act ''Colorado'' by Claude Dufresne, billed as an ''opérette à grand spectacle'' with music by [[Jacques-Henry Rys]] and lyrics by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Larue|fr}}, starred the bass Armand Mestral (who alternated with Michel Dens) in the role of Jim Bullit, the tenor Lou Pizzara as Ricardo Diaz, the soprano Claude Chenard as Katharina Sanders, and Maurice Baquet as the little saloon pianist. The show opened on 16 December 1950 and ran for 11 months. It was revived at the theatre beginning on 12 February 1959 with Mestral and Baquet reprising their roles and Bernard Alvi as Ricardo and Andrée Grandjean as Katharina. It later went on tour and received provincial productions up into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"Colorado" in Gänzl 2001, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Visa pour l'amour'', a vehicle for two of Paris's biggest musical comedy stars, the tenor [[Luis Mariano]] and the comedian [[Annie Cordy]], was a 2-act ''opérette gaie'' with music by Lopez and a book by Vincy. It premiered in December 1961 and received around 600 performances.&lt;ref&gt;"Visa pour l'amour" in Gänzl 2001, p. 2144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s the ''[[Théâtre Silvia-Monfort|Carré Silvia-Monfort]]'' presented contemporary theatre, and some singers and a circus school, the Cirque Gruss, who offered their spectacles in the facing square, based themselves here for a time, and converted the attic of the theatre into stables for elephants.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;&lt;ref name=Doussot&gt;Doussot et al 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QIQKJDslWw0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 24].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s the dome of the main auditorium was threatening to collapse and was reinforced with concrete. In 1989 much of the theatre was demolished and transformed into an [[amusement park]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Planète magique|fr|vertical-align=sup}}, by [[Jean Chalopin]].&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt; The main auditorium, originally holding 1800,&lt;ref&gt;Galignani 1884, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dl0EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 234].&lt;/ref&gt; and the orchestra pit, apparently  large enough for 60 musicians,&lt;ref&gt;Faris 1980, p. 169, says that Offenbach's lavish 1874 revival of ''Orphée aux enfers'' included an orchestra of 60.&lt;/ref&gt; were among the parts of the building lost at this time. The venture was a failure and closed in 1991.&lt;ref name=Doussot/&gt; [[Manuelle Gautrand]], the architect who was in charge of the later restoration of the surviving parts of the theatre as well as the reconstruction and modernization of the demolished interior spaces, described the scene as follows: "The historical foyer and the lobby had been stripped of their original style and had been redecorated with vulgar colors and statues", and the amusement park itself was "an incredible accumulation of monumental sets, combining  pieced together dragons, rockets from the 80s, the world of Barbie, treasure hunts among the Incas…. A sort of 'low tech Disneyland' in the centre of Paris".&lt;ref name=Architectural/&gt;

In December 2003 restoration work began, and in December 2010 [[La Gaîté Lyrique]] was re-opened as a digital arts and modern music centre.&lt;ref name=HistoricalVenue/&gt;

The '''Théâtre des Capucines''' was a former theatre on the [[boulevard des Capucines]] in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris|2nd arrondissement]] of [[Paris]]. It was built in 1889 by architect [[Édouard-Jean Niermans]] and then taken over by two brothers, [[Émile Isola]] and [[Vincent Isola]], in 1892 to become the '''Théâtre Isola'''. They managed the theatre until 1897.

Berthez Armand was an early director and the actress-dancer [[Gaby Deslys]] (1881-1920) appeared there. The actress, singer and film star [[Arletty]] made her debut there in October 1919 and performed there regularly for ten years, especially in operettas. It was also the venue of the 1941 musical comedy ''Une femme par jour'', (with music by  [[Georges Van Parys]] and text by [[Pierre Véber]] and [[Jean Boyer (director)|Jean Boyer]]). [[Serge Gainsbourg]] inaugurated a series of popular concerts at the theatre in 1963, including an appearance by the singer [[Barbara (singer)|Barbara]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://francois.faurant.free.fr/a_capucines/barbara_a_capucines.html Artists at the Théâtre des Capucines in 1963]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre finally in 1970 and was taken over by the perfume company Fragonard which has preserved the building as a perfume museum, the '''[[Théâtre-Musée des Capucines]]'''.

"'''Trans-Europe Express'''" is a song by German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]]. The song was released as the lead single from their [[Trans-Europe Express (album)|sixth studio album]] of the same name in 1977. The music was written by [[Ralf Hütter]], and the lyrics by Hütter and [[Emil Schult]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title= Trans-Europe Express (Digital Remaster) |others= Kraftwerk |year= 2009 |type= liner notes |publisher= [[Mute Records]] |id= CDSTUMM305 |url= https://www.discogs.com/release/1966446-Trans-Europe-Express/images}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track is ostensibly about the [[Trans Europ Express]] rail system, with technology and transport both being common themes in Kraftwerk's oeuvre.

The track has since found further influence, both in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] by its [[Interpolation (music)|interpolation]] by [[Afrika Bambaata]] (via [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]) on "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]", which has been sampled and remixed by many different artists such as [[Paul Oakenfold]] for ''[[Swordfish (soundtrack)|Swordfish]]'''s soundtrack, and by modern experimental bands such as the [[electroclash]] bands of the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="tee" /&gt;

==Release==
"Trans-Europe Express" was released as a single in 1977,&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, 1998. p.454&lt;/ref&gt; and charted in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked at number 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r11209|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|title=Trans-Europe Express: Charts &amp; Awards: Billboard Singles|accessdate=October 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trans-Europe Express'' as a single did not chart in the UK although reached number one in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/g2brnx.htm|title=Song artist 715 - Kraftwerk |publisher= tsort.info|accessdate= 2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and lyrical references==

|filename=Trans-Europe Express sample.ogg
|title="Trans-Europe Express"
|description=[[Kraftwerk]]'s "Trans-Europe Express" from ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]''
|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}
Allmusic described the musical elements of the suite as having a haunting theme with "deadpan chanting of the title phrase" which is "slowly layered over that rhythmic base in much the same way that the earlier "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]" was constructed".&lt;ref name="tee"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t1542120|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|title=Song review: Trans-Europe Express|author=Mason, Stewart|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's lyrics reference the album ''[[Station to Station]]'' and meeting with musicians [[Iggy Pop]] and [[David Bowie]].&lt;ref name="Bussy85" /&gt; Hütter and Schneider had previously met up with Bowie in Germany and were flattered with the attention they received from him.&lt;ref name="Bussy84"&gt;Bussy, 2004. p.84&lt;/ref&gt; Ralf Hütter was interested in Bowie's work as he had been working with Iggy Pop, who was the former lead singer of [[the Stooges]]; one of Hütter's favorite groups.&lt;ref name="Bussy85"&gt;Bussy, 2004. p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

==German language version==
The song was also recorded and released in a [[German language]] version under the title ''Trans Europa Express'' both as a single in edited form and on the German language version of the album of the same name. The lyrics are a [[literal translation]] of the English language version although it is not known which came first.

==The Mix version==
A new version of ''Trans Europe Express'' was included on the 1991 album [[The Mix (Kraftwerk album)|The Mix]]. This version is considerably shorter than the original and omits the verse about [[David Bowie]] and [[Iggy Pop]]. It also segues directly into the tracks ''Abzug'' and ''Metal on Metal'', although the fusion with the former makes ''Trans Europe Express'' closer to the original in duration. A German language version of the track was also included on the German release of ''The Mix''.

==Live version==
The track has often featured in Kraftwerk's live sets and a live version of the ''Trans Europe Express / Abzug / Metal on Metal'' suite recorded at [[Riga]] Olimpiska Hall in 2004 is included on the group's live album [[Minimum-Maximum]].

==About==
[[File:Germaine Greer, 28 October 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|''TSWL'' founding editor [[Germaine Greer]]]]
As part of the now-defunct Tulsa Center for the Study of Women's Literature, the journal was founded in 1982 by Germaine Greer while she was teaching at the [[University of Tulsa]]. Greer's purpose for the journal was to begin "the rehabilitation of women's literary history".&lt;ref name="greer quotation"&gt;''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' 1.1 (1982): 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Following her tenure, Shari Benstock (1983–1986), Mary O’Toole (1986–1988), Holly Laird (1988–2005), and Laura Stevens (2005-2016) each served as the journal’s editor. Jennifer Airey became the editor in 2016.

The distinctive TSWL logo, present from the journal's inaugural issue, is a [[saxifrage|saxifrage flower]], captioned with a quotation from William Turner’s ''Herbal'': "The white saxifrage with the indented leafe is moste commended for the breakinge of the stone."&lt;ref name="turner quotation"&gt;''Herbal'' 3 (1568): 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's editorial and advisory boards include scholars prominent in their fields. Board members include [[Nina auerbach|Nina Auerbach]], [[Marilyn Butler]], [[Carol T. Christ]], [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]], [[Sandra Gilbert|Sandra M. Gilbert]], [[Susan Gubar]], [[Peggy Kamuf]], and [[Jane Marcus]].&lt;ref name="boards"&gt;[http://www.utulsa.edu/tswl/advisory_and_editorial_boards.htm 5]''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' Advisory and Editorial Boards&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">The '''Western Norway Exhibition''' ({{lang-no|Vestlandsutstillingen}}) is an annual exhibition for visual artists from [[Western Norway]]. It is generally a touring exhibition held in various places in Western Norway. Artists associated with the region are eligible to take part.&lt;ref name="Om VU"&gt;[http://www.vu2011.no/#om_vu Vestlandsutstillingen: Om VU.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Western Norway Exhibition has been an important venue for artists from the region ever since it started in 1922.&lt;ref name="Om VU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheim"&gt;[http://www.aftenbladet.no/kultur/Dette-er-vestlandsk-samtidskunst-3716778.html Sheim, Eli Næ. 2015. Dette er vestlandsk samtidskunst. ''Stavanger Aftenblad'' (June 12).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Informasjon"&gt;[http://www.vestlandsutstillingen.no/ Vestlandsutstillingen: Informasjon om Vestlandsutstillingen.]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition is a cooperative effort between the Kube Art Museum in [[Ålesund]], the Kabuso Art Gallery in [[Øystese]], the Sunnfjord Art Association in [[Førde]], the [[Haugesund Art Gallery]], and the Stavanger Art Association.&lt;ref name="Sheim"/&gt; Financial support is provided by the counties of [[Rogaland]], [[Hordaland]], [[Sogn og Fjordane]], and [[Møre og Romsdal]],&lt;ref name="Informasjon"/&gt; as well as the [[Arts Council of Norway]].

In addition to the Western Norway Exhibition, there are four other annual regional art exhibitions: the [[Eastern Norway Exhibition]] (''Østlandsutstillingen''), the [[Southern Norway Exhibition]] (''Sørlandsutstillingen''), the [[Central Norway Exhibition]] (''Den midtnorske kunstutstilling''), and the [[Northern Norway Exhibition]] (''Den Nord-Norske Kunstutstilling''). The exhibitions vary in how they are organized.

==History==
The Western Norway Exhibition was held for the first time in 1922. The initiative for it came from [[Axel Revold]] and the art historian [[Einar Lexow]]&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Knut (ed.). 1981. ''Norges kunsthistorie'', vol. 6: ''Mellomkrigstid''. Oslo: Gyldendal Norsk Forlag.&lt;/ref&gt; or, according to a 1975 newspaper article, from the artistic milieu in Stavanger, in which artists in the town met regularly at Harry Landås's apartment, where the discussion at one point turned to the [[Høstutstillingen|Autumn Exhibition]] and Olav Ansgar Larsen suggested setting up their own exhibition for Western Norway. After the idea developed further, Larsen got in touch with [[Nils Krantz]] in [[Bergen]], and the idea then became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;Ødegård, Åse. 1992. ''Aage Storstein. En billedbygger i norsk kunst''. Oslo: Bonytt AS.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, painters from [[Trøndelag]] were invited to participate, but this only occurred once. The exhibition has been held annually since 1928, with participants coming from the four counties of Western Norway.

==2011 Western Norway Exhibition==
The point of departure for the exhibition in 2011 was the short story "Rom for sten og hjort" (Space for Rock and Deer) by [[Tormod Haugland]]. The artistic coordinators were Karolin Tampere and Johanne Nordby Wernø.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestlandsutstillingen.no/vu2011/ Vestlandsutstillingen: VU2011, om utstillingen.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Western Norway Exhibition==
The theme of the exhibition in 2012 was motion, and the exhibition was curated by Annemari Skeide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vestlandsutstillingen.no/vu2012/ Vestlandsutstillingen: VU2012, om utstillingen.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Halla, a choir conductor, wants to disrupt the operations of a [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] aluminium plant in the [[Iceland]]ic highlands. She repeatedly damages pylons and wires to cut their power supply. One day, a long-forgotten application to adopt an orphan child from [[Ukraine]] is approved. At the same time, the government ramps up police and propaganda efforts in order to catch and discredit her. 
The film revolves around her attempts to reconcile her dangerous and illegal activism with the upcoming adoption.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/12/woman-at-war-review-benedikt-erlingsson-horses-men-icelandic-drama-pylon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety"/&gt;

==Accolades==
''Woman at War'' was shown at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]], in the International Critics' Week section, where the screenwriters won the SACD award.&lt;ref name="semaine-awards"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/354555/|title=Diamantino comes out on top in the Cannes Critics' Week |date=16 May 2018 |accessdate=17 May 2018 |work=Cineuropa}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The film also won the [[Lux prize]] award of the [[European Parliament]] for 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://luxprize.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Peter Bradshaw, for [[The Guardian]], praised Halldóra Geirharðsdóttir's 'attractive and sympathetic performance' as Halla, and called the overall film a 'well-turned, well-tuned oddity' that was 'confidently and rather stylishly made'.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

Jay Weissberg, for [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], called the film 'a delightful follow-up to  ''[[Of Horses and Men]]''', and praised the director for 'arranging beautifully shot picaresque episodes around a central figure who lives the ideals of the heroes she has hanging on her wall, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]'.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/woman-at-war-review-1202808656/&lt;/ref&gt;
