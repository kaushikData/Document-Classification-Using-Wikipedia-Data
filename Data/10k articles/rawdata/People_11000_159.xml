      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9394">'''Alexander Kennedy Miller''' (July 14, 1906 – October 23, 1993),&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com: State of Vermont Certificate of Death&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''A. K. Miller''', was an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] [[recluse]] who operated [[Miller's Flying Service]] in 1930, in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], [[US]]. Miller provided mail and other delivery services by means of an [[autogyro]], as well as listing "Expert Automobile Repairing" and "Aeroplanes Rebuilt &amp; Overhauled" on his [[business card]].&lt;ref name="MAD96"&gt;"East Orange Vermont Treasure Trove," Maine Antique Digest 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years he was known for his eccentricities, and his collection of valuable [[antique car]]s.

==Youth and education==
Miller was the only child of a wealthy [[New York City]] [[stockbroker]] and wholesale merchant. He purchased his first [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]] automobile while still in high school.&lt;ref name="NYT08181996"&gt;{{cite news |first= Rita|last= Reif|url=https://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FA0B11FC3C550C7B8DDDA10894DE494D81 |coauthors= |title=A Recluse and His Long-Hidden Trove of Cars. |quote=Alexander Kennedy Miller was always something of an eccentric and miser. The son of a wealthy stockbroker from Montclair, N.J., he attended Rutgers University on a scholarship to study mechanical engineering. An anecdote alongside his yearbook picture recounts an occasion on which he zoomed down the street on a motorcycle coatless in the dead of winter, heading to the barber shop 'for his quarterly haircut.' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 18, 1996 |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon purchased more Stutz cars from [[bankruptcy]] auctions and a number of [[autogyro]]s from the military for a small fraction of their actual value.&lt;ref name="NYT08181996"/&gt;

Miller attended [[Rutgers University]] on a scholarship to study [[mechanical engineering]]. A note alongside his yearbook picture describes an occasion when he rode down the street on a motorcycle, without a coat, in the wintertime, going to the barber shop "for his quarterly haircut".&lt;ref name="NYT08181996" /&gt;&lt;ref name=barnfind&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfieldcountyconcours.com/concourspix/Concours-program.pdf |title=A Real Barn Find |first=Miles |last=Morris |year=2005 |publisher=Fairfield County Concours d'Elegance |pages=4, 5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708103021/http://www.fairfieldcountyconcours.com/concourspix/Concours-program.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-08 |accessdate=2010-05-18 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and middle age==
In 1941, Miller married Imogene Raymond (1917–1996), the daughter of William Everett Raymond and Maria Louise Cook.&lt;ref name="NYT08181996" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], when Miller discovered he was too old to fly in the [[U.S. Air Force]], he instead joined the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], rising to the rank of captain.&lt;ref name="NYT08181996" /&gt; He taught tactical aviation and salvaged damaged aircraft, some of which he would go on to purchase himself and later sell.&lt;ref name="NYT08181996" /&gt;

==Vermont years==
After retiring from the Air Force in 1946, Miller and his wife moved to a large farm in East Orange, [[Vermont]]. The house had no central heating, antiquated plumbing and limited electricity; hot water was created by metal coils inside the wood stove.&lt;ref name="NYT08181996" /&gt;

It is here that Miller's eccentricities began to emerge. He exchanged most of his cash for [[gold]] and [[silver]] bars and coins.&lt;ref name="AA01"&gt;http://coolcatcorp.com/millerauction/MillerAuction.html Auction attendee's personal account&lt;/ref&gt; He took his autogyro apart and stored the pieces inside an old one-room schoolhouse that stood on his property. Over the years, he constructed a large number of [[shed]]s and ramshackle [[barn]]s out of scrap lumber and nails that he scavenged from various places. Inside the shacks, Miller concealed his trove of prized Stutz motorcars. While locals knew he had a Stutz or two, and Miller was known to other Stutz collectors, nobody knew the true extent of the collection.

Miller often drove considerable distances for good deals on auto or airplane parts. According to car aficionado Roderick C. Rice, Miller told him a story about driving a 1917 Stutz Bulldog (the first car Miller owned) to [[St. Louis]] to pick up an airplane wing. &lt;blockquote&gt;''A. K. said he brought it back, driving with the canvas roof down and the wing replacing it, strapped to two-by-fours attached fore and aft.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As time went by, the farmhouse and the farm in general became dilapidated. In keeping with his frugal nature, Miller himself usually drove beat-up [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s and when one would break down or he grew tired of it, he would abandon it in his yard. The neighbors often worried that the Millers were poor, and sometimes made offers of [[Charity (practice)|charity]].

At times, to raise cash, Miller would sell "spare parts" to other Stutz owners for their repair/restoration projects. However, rather than selling the actual parts (which he owned a large quantity of), he would painstakingly fabricate them himself from scrap metal, using his own cars and spare parts as templates. He was known to other Stutz aficionados as a shrewd but cheap businessman. David Brownell, editor of ''[[Hemmings Motor News]]'' said of Miller &lt;blockquote&gt;''Every time you'd try to do business with him, he'd quote the Bible to an annoying degree. If you asked him whether he'd be interested in selling a car, he'd say, 'You're being covetous.'''&lt;ref name="NYT08181996" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1970s, Miller's father died and Miller inherited the estate in Montclair and the family fortune.

==Death and treasure==
What this miserly lifestyle and ill-kept property hid was eventually to bring $2.18 million at auction. The 87-year-old A.K. Miller himself died in 1993 after falling from a ladder,&lt;ref name="MAD96" /&gt; and Imogene died of a heart attack in 1996. As no heirs were found, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] moved in to assess the value of the estate (taking a particular interest in collecting the years of back [[Income tax|taxes]] the Millers had owed).&lt;ref name="AQ36"&gt;"A.K. Miller's Amazing Stutz Stash," Automobile Quarterly, Vol.36 #3&lt;/ref&gt;

All told, approximately 30 original [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]] motorcars, a [[Stanley Steamer]], a 1926 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost]], several [[Franklin (automobile)|Franklin]]s, a [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]] (which had somehow been placed in the loft of the main barn),&lt;ref name="MAD96a"&gt;"Miller Auto Trove Exceeds Wildest Expectations; Brings $2.18 Mil," Maine Antique Digest, October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and assorted [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetles]] were discovered about the property. The main barn and the various sheds and shacks Miller had constructed over the years hid a fortune in antique vehicles and a huge number of spare parts Miller had purchased from the Stutz company when it went out of business.&lt;ref name="AQ36" /&gt;

A further $1 million in gold [[bullion]] was discovered hidden in the wood pile. About $900,000 in stock certificates, and $75,000 in silver bullion and coins were also uncovered in various safes and [[Basement#Crawl space|crawl spaces]].&lt;ref name="ISM01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.in.gov/ism/Exhibits_Collections/Collection/col_stutz.aspx |title=Archived item |accessdate=2007-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328064223/http://www.in.gov/ism/Exhibits_Collections/Collection/col_stutz.aspx |archivedate=2007-03-28 |df= }} Indiana State Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

A huge, 3-day auction was held by [[Christie's|Christie's Auction House]] to liquidate the Miller estate, including the cache of antique and other automobiles, and a cache of other collected items including music boxes (one of which sold for $7,040&lt;ref name="MAD96" /&gt;), typewriters, sewing machines, spool cabinets, and other assorted mini-collections. Today, the A.K. Miller collection is recognized as one of the largest and most well-known collections of [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]] motorcars.

{{BLP sources|date=January 2012}}

'''Allan Gregg''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[opinion poll|pollster]], political advisor, television interviewer and [[pundit]].

==Early life==
Gregg was born in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]]. He was the eldest child in his family which consisted of four boys and one girl. Gregg graduated from Harry Ainlay High School at the second top of his class with honors. Gregg then went on to study political science at the [[University of Alberta]] and Carleton University in Ottawa. He briefly served as a professor while working on his [[PhD]], but abandoned his studies due to the birth of his first child in 1975.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Tory strategist==
Gregg has long been involved in Canadian politics, but decided to travel south of the border to work with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] pollster [[Richard Wirthlin]], and learned much from him.  He then returned to Canada in the late 1970s.  He first came to national attention as the national campaign secretary of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] successful effort in the [[Canadian federal election, 1979|1979 federal election]].

Soon after that campaign, Gregg founded [[Decima Research]], a joint polling/public relations firm. The company became the Conservative party's polling firm, and Gregg played an important role in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984 election]] when the PC Party was led by [[Brian Mulroney]].  With the Conservative victory, Decima Research and Gregg entered the halls of power, and he was frequently at [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Mulroney's side.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Decima and Gregg worked for the federal Tories, operated in many provincial elections, and expanded worldwide, participating in over forty-five elections on three continents.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Gregg was an unusual-looking figure in Canadian politics, and especially in the Tory party.  He adopted a unique style including gold earrings, bright red shoes, long hair, and a great deal of leather clothing.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  He founded a record label, [[The Song Corp.]], and was co-manager of the [[Tragically Hip]].  He also served a five-year stint as president of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

He rose to greater prominence in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 election]] where he handled communications and polling for the PC Party.  Long an advocate for [[negative campaigning]], he directed the famed "bridge bombing" attack on Liberal leader [[John Turner]] that was designed to break the bridge linking anti-[[free trade]] voters to Turner.  The offensive was a success, Turner's popularity dropped, and the Tories were re-elected.  He also played an important role in the [[Charlottetown Accord#The referendum|1992 Canadian referendum]] where he crafted the message that the doom of Canada would be the certain result of a "No" vote.

==1993 election==
Gregg was given even more responsibility in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]] campaign.  He was senior pollster as well as top strategist and communications manager.

The 1993 Conservative Federal campaign was an unmitigated disaster for all concerned, including Gregg.  Other campaign leaders complained that his many duties meant he missed too many meetings.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  Gregg again pushed for negative tactics, crafting an [[1993 Chrétien attack ad|attack ad]] one of which Canadians found especially distasteful and offensive. The ad ridiculed a facial deformity of Liberal leader Jean Chrétien which was a result of a childhood polio infection.  This ad backfired and the Conservatives were reduced to two seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from their previous 151 seats. This was the result of a number of factors, including the intense unpopularity of former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. His party suffered the worst defeat ever in Canadian history for an incumbent federal party.

While the Tory campaign was not going well, this television ad (which aired on only one evening) was a memorable element. Modern Canadian national political campaign coverage has had few noteworthy campaign moments, but much like the 1984 Mulroney Turner debate ("[[You had an option, sir]]"), this advertising mistake was memorable. Attacking a physical defect was widely seen by Canadians as a low blow and as an American-style no-holds-barred campaign style that should not be imported. Several years later Gregg wrote about this in the pages of [[Saturday Night (magazine)|''Saturday Night'' magazine]], where his ''mea culpa'' rang hollow, as he continued to argue that "the ad tested well in the focus groups."

==Pollster==
After the campaign, Gregg left public life for a time.  He quit Decima, and sold his share of the company for millions of dollars. He cut his hair, and turned to a more reserved form of dress.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

After a year off, he founded a new company, [[The Strategic Counsel]], a market research and consulting firm, but one geared towards business rather than politics.  He returned to the public eye as a columnist in [[Maclean's]] magazine and a frequent pundit on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] news for several years.

Gregg also had a weekly television show, ''[[Allan Gregg in Conversation with...]]'' on the public broadcaster [[TVOntario]]. Its format was a half-hour, in-depth interview format, in which the subject of the interview was usually an author or intellectual discussing a current release. The format differed from traditional interview programs in that it included more comments from the interviewer (Gregg) than is usually the case. After several years of production TVO cancelled the program.

In 2001, he strongly denounced [[negative campaigning]] in a lecture at the School of Journalism and Communication at [[Carleton University]], saying that it would destroy politics as we know it and "invite totally unaccountable forces" to "influence society without the countervailing force of representative democracy".&lt;ref&gt;https://carleton.ca/jmc/newsevents/kesterton/gregg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Gregg was born in 1949 and has three children; Christian (b. 1975), Allanah (b. 1986), and Connor (b. 1988); his wife Marjorie died in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidhayes.ca/2002/02/song-corpse Song Corpse, by David Hayes, February 2004] 
:"In 1993, Gregg’s father died; less than two years later, so did his wife, Marjorie. Grieving, Gregg raised his three young children and divided his working time between The Strategic Counsel (which had co-founded after selling Decima Research to a public relations conglomerate), a new interview show on TVO, and his part-time job as president of Viacom Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of the U.S. media giant that controls Paramount Pictures Canada, Famous Players and other cultural interests."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoni Norbert Patek''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Antoine Norbert de Patek}}; 14 June 1812 – 1 March 1877) was a [[Poland|Polish]] pioneer in watchmaking and a creator of the [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]], one of the most famous [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[watchmaker]] companies.

== Early life ==

[[File:POL CoA Prawdzic.png|180px|thumb|right|[[Prawdzic coat of arms]]]]

Antoni Patek was born in 1812 in  Piaski Szlacheckie near [[Lublin]] in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] to Anna née Piasecka and Joachim Patek of [[Prawdzic coat of arms]].&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub"/&gt; At the age of 10, Patek moved with his parents to [[Warsaw]] where his father died on April 7, 1828.&lt;ref name="worldtempus"/&gt;

On March 1, 1828, 16-year-old Patek joined the Polish 1st Mounted Rifles Regiment. He fought in the [[November Uprising]] during which he was wounded twice. On February 27, 1831 for his heroic attitude Patek was promoted the second lieutenant of the "1 August" brigade, and on October 3 of the same year decorated with [[Virtuti Militari]] Golden Cross. After the downfall of the uprising – like many other officers and soldiers of Polish Army – he had to emigrate.&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;
[[File:Virtuti Militari.jpg|thumb|left|120px|4th Class Order of the [[Virtuti Militari]]]]

In 1832 he was engaged by general [[Józef Bem]] in organising an evacuation route for [[Poland|Polish]] insurgents through [[Prussia]] to France. He was charged with a command over a staging point in [[Bamberg]] near [[Munich]] (one of five staging points on the insurgents' evacuation route). After terminating the evacuation, Patek settled in France, firstly in [[Cahors]], then in Amiens where he worked as a type-setter.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;

Two years later an unfavourable decree issued by the French government under pressure from the Russian embassy, forced many former insurgents to resettle in [[Switzerland]]. Patek tried his hand at many trades, including trading with liquors and wines in [[Versoix]] near [[Geneva]]. For some time Patek attended painting courses given by the famous [[Swiss people|Swiss]] painter and engraver [[Alexandre Calame]]. During his studies, Patek also traveled to Paris where he remained for several months. Around this time, he was befriended by the [[Moreau (surname)|Moreau]] family of [[Versoix]] who he became friends with, and at whose home he would meet his future wife.  They probably encouraged him in a new activity – the trade in expensive pocket [[watches]], which were decorated by the goldsmiths, engravers, enamellers and miniaturists of the time. He thus started by buying movements of watches which he got to the Geneva watchmakers already known for the quality of their products and, under his direction, made them furnish with cases. From the very start, he attached highest importance to the quality and the artistic value of work and rather quickly managed to find the market where such creations of exceptional quality were highly appreciated.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

On July 10, 1839 in [[Versoix]], Patek married Marie Adélaïde Elisabeth Thomasine Dénizart, a daughter of a French tradesman Louis Charles Dénizart from Turin, and of his wife Marie Jeanne Adélaïde Elisabeth, née Devimes. Antoni and Marie de Patek had three children. The first one, Boleslas Joseph Alexandre Thomas (Bolesław Józef Aleksander Tomasz), born on June 16, 1841, died on September 18 of the same year. The two others were born much later, when Marie de Patek already was respectively 39 and 41 year old: a son, Leon Mecislas Vincent (Leon Mieczysław Wincenty), July 19, 1857 and one girl, Marie Edwige (Maria Jadwiga), October 23, 1859.&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

== Patek, Czapek &amp; Co. (1839–1845) ==

[[File:Polish Watchmaking in Geneva.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Engraving ''Polish Watchmaking in Geneva'' picturing ''Antoni Patek'' at the top, and portraits of both ''Gostkowski brothers'' below.]]

On May 1, 1839 in [[Geneva]], Antoni Patek together with another [[Poland|Polish]] immigrant (who in fact was of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent), the gifted [[Warsaw]] [[watchmaker]] [[Franciszek Czapek]] established their manufacture producing watches. The company was financially supported also by its first workers, among others [[Poland|Polish]] watchmakers: [[Wawrzyniec Gostkowski]], [[Wincenty Gostkowski]], and [[Władysław Bandurski]]. The first pocket watches were produced on individual orders. Primarily the young firm's artistic production reflected themes from Polish history and culture, such as portraits of revolutionary heroes, 10th and 12th centuries’ legends, and the cult of the Polish [[The Black Madonna of Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patekmuseum"/&gt;

The small company Patek, Czapek &amp; Co, which employed a half-dozen of workmen, produced approximately two hundred watches of quality per annum. The few preserved specimens make it possible to note the degree of perfection of these first watches, result of a successful union between artistic research and the technical skill.&lt;ref name="Swiss Watch Authority"/&gt;

Among the collection of [[The Patek Philippe Museum]] there are watches presenting Coat of Arms of Princess [[Zubów]] (see picture [http://www.patekmuseum.com/EN/theWatch.asp?id=1&amp;from=tl&amp;year=1845]) from 1845 and the portraits of Polish general [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], and Polish prince and marchal of France [[Józef Poniatowski]] (see picture [http://www.patekmuseum.com/EN/theWatch.asp?id=4&amp;themeId=1&amp;floorId=First]) from 1948.

== Patek &amp; Co. (1845–1851)  ==

Increasing disagreement between Patek and Czapek obliged the latter to withdraw. In 1851 Czapek established Czapek &amp; Co. where he produced watches until 1869. On May 15, 1845 the place vacated by Czapek was filled by the 30-year-old French watchmaker [[Adrien Philippe]], who in 1842 invented the key-less winding mechanism.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patekmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus_a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patek"/&gt;

== Patek Philippe &amp; Co. ==
{{main article|Patek Philippe &amp; Co.}}
[[File:Patek Philippe p1070011.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Exclusive clock of Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]]

On January 1, 1851 Patek &amp; Co. transformed into [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]]. The company started mass production of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus_a" /&gt;

Both co-owners recognised perfection as their ideal, and the company gained its success thanks to principles that Antoni Patek left to his descendants:
* the quality of produced watches maintained on the highest possible level,
* the ability of implementing new inventions and constructive solutions.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;

The "Queen Victoria" (see picture [http://www.patekmuseum.com/EN/theWatch.asp?id=7&amp;themeId=2&amp;floorId=First]) open-face keyless-winding watch was presented to [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom during the Great Exhibition of London at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] ([[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]]), on August 18, 1851.&lt;ref name="Watch Detail"/&gt;

In 1868, Patek Philippe made their first [[wristwatch]], which was sold on November 13, 1876 to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Countess Koscowicz.&lt;ref name="Watch Detail1"/&gt; They have also pioneered in perpetual calendar, [[chronograph]] and minute repeater in watches.&lt;ref name="patek2"/&gt;

Looking for trade contacts Patek travelled among others to England (1847), USA (1854), and Russia (1858).&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;

After Patek's death the company changed its owners several times; since 1929 Patek Philippe &amp; Co. has been owned by the Stern family, but kept its original name. Patek Philippe &amp; Co. issues collectable watches every year, and till today has remained a coveted luxury brand. Patek Philippe &amp; Co. is the only [[Geneva]] watch manufacturer honoured with the [[Geneva seal]]. Of all the movements bearing the Geneva Seal distinction, 95% are Patek Philippe &amp; Co. timepieces. The company does not cease in its efforts to innovate its products. Patek Philippe &amp; Co. has been awarded more than 70 patents, since implementing in 1845 the stem winding system. The 20 most expensive wristwatches sold at auction are all from Patek Philippe &amp; Co. The [[Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication]] watch made in 1933 holds the world record for the most expensive watch—sold at auction in 1999 for more than $11 million.&lt;ref name="patek3"/&gt;

The Sky Moon Tourbillon Ref 5002 is currently the world most complex complication timepiece.  At present only 3 pieces are produced a year.  Owners of these watches are selected by Patek Co as they are highly sought after.  They are sold primarily to collectors rather than traders so as to avoid the flipping of watches for profits.

== Patek's political life ==

In 1843, Patek was naturalized in [[Geneva]] and thus acquired [[Switzerland|Swiss]] nationality. However, he did not cease his political activity of a [[Poland|Polish]] emigrant and did not stop in his efforts to bring his assistance to the refugees. Thus, in 1838, he supported the initiative of a group of [[Poland|Polish]] emigrants for the establishment of "Polish Foundation", organization of mutual aid which was founded the following year and of which he became the treasurer and one of the most active members. In May 1844, he took part in the installation of a Polish Library with a salon of lecture in [[Geneva]]. Persuaded of the need for a centralization of the organizations of [[Poland|Polish]] emigrants, he recommended to the Poles residing in [[Geneva]] to collaborate with the commission of the "Funds of Polish Emigration" and the "Polish Library" of Paris. In the years 1843, 1845 and 1847 he requested the support of prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]] for this Society. On May 18, 1846, Patek adhered to the [[Polish Democratic Society]] of [[Lyon]] and, during the [[Spring of Nations]] in 1848, he went secretly to [[Frankfurt am Main]] to propose there, at the time of the meeting on March 6 of [[Dozór Polski]], the convocation of the Polish Parliament in exile.&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

The political activities of Patek during the [[January Uprising]] in 1863 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Polacy nad Lemanem w XIX wieku|last = Dąbrowski|first = Krysztof|publisher = Wydawn. Polskiego Tow. Wydawców Książek|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; were described by [[Julian Aleksander Bałaszwicz]], writing under the pseudonym of [[Albert Potocki]]. After the crushing of the insurrection, Patek brought his assistance to the refugees arriving to [[Geneva]] and maintained the relations with the [[Wiktionary:congregation|Congregation]] of the [[Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ]], (Polish: ''Zmartwychwstańcy''), in Paris. Thereafter, the pope [[Pius IX]] conferred on Patek the title of [[count]], in recognition of the services rendered as well as an active [[Catholic]], as within the community of the Polish emigrants. Unfortunately, the files of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] do not preserve documents providing information about the date and the nature of this distinction.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

Antoni Patek died in [[Geneva]] and was buried in a local cemetery in [[Chatelaine, Switzerland|Chatelaine]].&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

'''Athanase Seromba''' (born 1963) is a [[Rwanda]]n priest who was found guilty of aiding and abetting genocide and of [[crimes against humanity]] committed in the [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6175717.stm|title=Rwandan priest guilty of genocide|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rwanda's Unanswered Screams: Still seeking justice after the Seromba trial|date=28 February 2007|last=Venturini|first=Gabriella|work=[[The Hague Justice Portal]]|accessdate=28 November 2012|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=7123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the genocide, Seromba was priest of a [[Catholic]] parish at Nyange in the [[Kibuye province]] of western Rwanda.  He was charged with the deaths of around 2,000 [[Tutsis]] who took refuge in his parish church.  According to the charges brought against him, Seromba ordered his church to be bulldozed on April 6, 1994, and then shot some survivors.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Seromba fled Rwanda in July 1994. Catholic monks helped him move to Italy, change his name and also helped him work as a priest for the Catholic Church near the city of Florence using the alias Anastasio Sumba Bura.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/08/catholic-church-apologise-failure-rwanda-genocide-vatican|title=The Catholic church must apologise for its role in Rwanda's genocide {{!}} Chris McGreal|last=McGreal|first=Chris|date=2014-04-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from [[Carla Del Ponte]], the then Chief UN War Crimes Prosecutor, Seromba surrendered himself to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) on February 6, 2002. On February 8, 2002, he pleaded not guilty to the charges of [[genocide]], complicity in genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity.  His trial began on September 20, 2004, before the Third Trial Chamber of the ICTR.  On 13 December 2006, he was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6175717.stm|title=Rwandan priest guilty of genocide|publisher=''[[BBC News Online]]''|date=13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seromba appealed the verdict. On 12 March 2008, the [[Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) decided his responsibility was even greater than previously found, affirmed his conviction, and increased his punishment to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7292081.stm|title=Rwanda genocide priest given life|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 2009, Seromba was transferred to [[Benin]].  Seromba is serving his life sentence at [[Akpro-Missérété]] prison at [[Porto-Novo]], Benin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Lekhraj Khubchand Kripalani''' (15 December 1876 – 18 January 1969), also known as '''Dada Lekhraj''', was the founder of the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]].

== Life ==

Lekhraj Kripalani was born in a [[Hyderabad, Sindh]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;'Custodians of Purity, An Ethnography of the Brahma Kumaris', Tamasin Ramsay, PhD (2009), Monash University&lt;/ref&gt; In his fifties, Kripalani reported having [[vision (religion)|visions]] and retired, returning to Hyderabad and turning to spirituality.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth_Abbott_Celibacy"&gt;{{cite book

=== Om Mandli ===
{{See also|Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University}}

In 1936, Lekhraj established a spiritual organisation called Om Mandali. Originally a follower of the [[Vaishnavite]] [[Vallabhacharya]] sect&lt;ref&gt;The Brahma Kumaris as a 'reflexive Tradition': Responding to late modernity by Dr John Walliss, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7546-0951-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the exogamous [[Bhaiband]] community,&lt;ref&gt;The Sindh Story, by K. R. Malkani. Karachi, Allied Publishers Private Limited, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; he is said to have had 12 [[gurus]]&lt;ref&gt;Adi Dev, by Jagdish Chander Hassija, Third Edition, Brahma Kumaris Information Services, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; but started preaching or conducting his own ''[[satsang]]s'' which, by 1936, had attracted around 300 people from his community, many of them being wealthy. According to [[BKWSU]] claims, a relative reported that a [[spiritual being]] ([[Shiv baba|Shiv]]) entered in his body and spoke through him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Lekhraj has been regarded by the BKWSU as a medium of God, and as such, speaking channeled messages of high importance within the religious movement's belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Peace &amp; Purity: the Story of the Brahma Kumaris, Liz Hodgkinson. Page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Lekhraj named some of the members of his [[satsang]] as a managing committee, and transferred his fortune to the committee. This committee, known as ''Om Mandali'', was the nucleus of the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]].&lt;ref name="Elizabeth_Abbott_Celibacy" /&gt; Several women joined Om Mandali, and contributed their wealth to the association.&lt;ref name="Hardayal_Hardy_Struggles"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sindhi people|Sindhi community]] reacted unfavourably to Lekhraj's movement due to the group's philosophy that advocated women to be less submissive to their husbands, going against that strong cultural aspect at the time in India, and also preached chastity.&lt;ref name="Liz_Hodgkinson_Peace"&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Arya Samaj]] accused Om Mandali of being a disturber of family peace. Some of the Brahma Kumari wives were mistreated by their families, and Lekhraj was accused of sorcery and lechery.&lt;ref name="Elizabeth_Abbott_Celibacy" /&gt; He was also accused of forming a cult and controlling his community through the art of [[hypnotism]].&lt;ref name="Om_Radhe"&gt;{{cite book

  | pages     = 35–36
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid persecution, legal actions and opposition from family members of his followers, Lekhraj moved the group from Hyderabad to [[Karachi]], where they settled in a highly structured ashram. The [[Bhaibund]] anti-Om Mandli Committee that had opposed the group in Hyderabad followed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | quote     = The call for women brahmins (i.e. kumaris or 'daughters') to remain celibate or chaste in marriage inverted prevailing social expectations that such renunciation was proper only for men and that the disposal of women's sexuality should remain with their fathers and husbands. The 'Anti-Om Mandali Committee' formed by outraged male family members violently persecuted Brahma Baba's group, prompting their flight to Karachi and withdrawal from society. Intense world rejection gradually eased after partition in 1947, when the BKs moved from Pakistan to Mt. Abu.
  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 1939, the mothers of two girls aged 12 and 13 filed an application against Om Mandali, in the Court of the Additional Magistrate in Karachi. The women, from Hyderabad, stated that their daughters were wrongfully being detained at the Om Mandali in [[Karachi]].&lt;ref name="Liz_Hodgkinson_Peace" /&gt; The court ordered the girls to be sent to their mothers. [[Radhi Pokardas Rajwani|Om Radhe]] of the Om Mandali appealed against the decision in the High Court, where the decision was upheld. Later, Hari's parents were persuaded to let their daughter stay at the Om Mandali.

Several Hindus continued their protests against Om Mandali. Some Hindu members of the Sindh Assembly threatened to resign unless the Om Mandali was finally outlawed. Finally, the Sindh Government used the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1908 to declare the Om Mandali as an unlawful association.&lt;ref name="Hardayal_Hardy_Struggles" /&gt; Under further pressure from the Hindu leaders in the Assembly, the Government also ordered the Om Mandali to close and vacate its premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After the [[partition of India]], the [[Brahma Kumaris]] moved to [[Mount Abu]] (Rajasthan) in India in April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History==
{{see also|History of Denmark}}

===Early history===
[[Denmark]] has been inhabited by various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples since ancient times, including the [[Angles]], [[Cimbri]], [[Jutes]], [[Herules]], [[Teutones]] and others.&lt;ref name="WM_Danes"&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mentions of "[[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]" are recorded in the mid 6th century by historians [[Procopius]] ({{lang-el|δάνοι}}) and [[Jordanes]] (''danī''), who both refer to a tribe tribe related to the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Suetidi]] inhabiting the peninsula of [[Jutland]], the province of [[Scania]] and the isles in between. [[Franks|Frankish]] annalists of the 8th century often refer to Danish kings. The [[Bobbio Orosius]] from the early 7th century, distinguishes between South Danes inhabiting Jutland and North Danes inhabiting the isles and the province of Scania.

===Viking Age===
The first mention of Danes within the [[Denmark]] is on the [[Jelling stones#Runestone of Harald Bluetooth|Jelling Rune Stone]] which mentions how [[Harald Bluetooth]] converted the Danes to [[Christianity]] in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="denstoredanske.dk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_f%C3%B8r_Reformationen/daner?highlight=Daner |title=daner &amp;#124; Gyldendal - Den Store Danske |publisher=Denstoredanske.dk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between c. 960 and the early 980s, Harald Bluetooth established a  kingdom in the lands of the Danes, stretching from Jutland to Scania. Around the same time, he received a visit from a German [[missionary]] who, by surviving an [[trial by ordeal|ordeal by fire]] according to legend, convinced Harold to convert to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen, History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, trans. Francis J. Tschan (New York, 2002), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following years saw the Danish [[Viking expansion]], which incorporated [[Norway]] and [[Northern England]] into the Danish [[North Sea Empire]]. After the death of [[Cnut the Great|Canute the Great]] in 1035, [[England]] broke away from Danish control. Canute's nephew [[Sweyn II of Denmark|Sweyn Estridson]] (1020–74) re-established strong royal Danish authority and built a good relationship with the [[archbishop]] of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] — at that time the Archbishop of all of [[Scandinavia]]. Over the next centuries the Danish empire expanded throughout the southern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast.&lt;ref name="WM_Danes"/&gt; Under the 14th century king [[Olaf II of Denmark|Olaf II]], Denmark acquired control of the [[Kingdom of Norway (872–1397)|Kingdom of Norway]], which included the territories of [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroese Islands]]. Olaf's mother united Norway, Sweden and Denmark into the [[Kalmar Union]].&lt;ref name="WM_Danes"/&gt;

===Denmark-Norway===
In 1523, Sweden won its independence, leading to the dismantling of the Kalmar Union and the establishment of [[Denmark-Norway]]. Denmark-Norway grew wealthy during the 16th century, largely because of the increased traffic through the [[Øresund]]. The Crown of Denmark could tax the traffic, because it controlled both sides of the Sound at the time.

The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which originated in the [[Germany|German]] lands in the early 16th century from the ideas of [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), had a considerable impact on Denmark.  The [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Danish Reformation]] started in the mid-1520s. Some Danes wanted access to the [[Bible]] in their own language. In 1524, Hans Mikkelsen and [[Christiern Pedersen]] translated the [[New Testament]] into [[Danish language|Danish]]; it became an instant best-seller. Those who had traveled to [[Wittenberg]] in [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and come under the influence of the teachings of Luther and his associates included [[Hans Tausen]], a Danish monk in the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John Hospitallers]].

In the 17th century Denmark-Norway colonized [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="WM_Danes"/&gt;

After a failed war with the [[Swedish Empire]], the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658 removed the areas of the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] from Danish control, thus establishing the boundaries between Norway, Denmark, and [[Sweden]] that exist to this day. In the centuries after this loss of territory, the populations of the [[Skåneland|Scanian lands]], who had previously been considered Danish, came to be fully integrated as [[Swedes]].

In the early 19th century, Denmark suffered a defeat in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; Denmark lost control over Norway and territories in what is now [[northern Germany]]. The political and economic defeat ironically sparked what is known as the [[Danish Golden Age]] during which a Danish national identity first came to be fully formed. The Danish [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[nationalism|national]] movements gained momentum in the 1830s, and after the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]] Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on 5 June 1849. The growing [[bourgeoisie]] had demanded a share in government, and in an attempt to avert the sort of bloody revolution occurring elsewhere in Europe, [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] gave in to the demands of the citizens. A new constitution emerged, [[Separation of powers|separating the powers]] and granting the [[suffrage|franchise]] to all adult males, as well as freedom of the press, religion, and association. The king became head of the [[executive branch]].

==Identity==
[[:da:Danskhed|Danishness]] (''danskhed'') is the concept on which contemporary Danish national and ethnic identity is based. It is a set of values formed through the historic trajectory of the formation of the Danish nation.  The ideology of Danishness emphasizes the notion of historical connection between the population and the territory of Denmark and the relation between the 1000-year-old Danish monarchy and the modern Danish state, the 19th century national romantic idea of "the people" (''folk''), a view of Danish society as homogeneous and socially egalitarian as well as strong cultural ties to other Scandinavian nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/content/1/c6/10/39/64/2jenkins.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Det danske folk'' (The Danish people) as a concept, played an important role in 19th century [[ethnic nationalism]] and refers to self-identification rather than a legal status. Use of the term is most often restricted to a historical context; the historic German-Danish struggle regarding the status of the [[Duchy]] of [[Schleswig]] vis-à-vis a Danish [[nation-state]]. It describes people of Danish [[nationality]], both in Denmark and elsewhere. Most importantly, ethnic Danes in both Denmark proper and the former Danish [[Duchy]] of [[Schleswig]]. Excluded from this definition are people from the formerly Norway, [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]] as well as members of the [[Germans|German]] minority as well as members of other ethnic minorities.

Importantly, since its formulation, Danish identity has not been linked to a particular racial or biological heritage, as many other ethno-national identities have. [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] for example emphasized the Danish language and the emotional relation to and identification with the nation of Denmark as the defining criteria of Danishness. This cultural definition of ethnicity has been suggested to be one of the reasons that Denmark was able to integrate their earliest ethnic minorities of Jewish and Polish origins into the Danish ethnic group. Jewishness for example was not seen as being incompatible with a Danish ethnic identity as long as the most important cultural practices and values were shared. This inclusive ethnicity has in turn been described as the background for the relative lack of virulent [[anti-semitism]] in Denmark and the [[rescue of the Danish Jews]], saving 99% of Denmark's Jewish population from the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Yael Enoch. 1994. The intolerance of a tolerant people: Ethnic relations in Denmark.  Ethnic and Racial Studies. Volume 17, Issue 2, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Danish cultural identity is rooted in the birth of the Danish national state during the 19th century. In this regard, Danish national identity was built on a basis of [[peasant]] culture and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran theology]], with Grundtvig and his popular movement playing a prominent part in the process. Two defining cultural criteria of being Danish was speaking the Danish language and identifying Denmark as a homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Østergård, Uffe, Peasants and Danes: The Danish National Identity and Political Culture. Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Jan., 1992), pp. 3-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology of Danishness has been politically important in the formulation of Danish political relations with the [[European Union|EU]], which has been met with considerable resistance in the Danish population, and in recent reactions in the Danish public to the increasing influence of [[Immigration to Denmark|immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;Lise Togeby (1998). “Prejudice and tolerance in a period of increasing ethnic diversity and growing 
unemployment. Denmark since 1970”. Ethnic and Racial Studies, 21, 6: 1137-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Rydgren. 2010. Radical Right-wing Populism in Denmark and Sweden: Explaining Party System Change and Stability. Volume 30, Number 1, Winter-Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diaspora==
{{See also|Scandinavian diaspora}}
Danish [[diaspora]] consists of emigrants and their descendants, especially those that maintain some of the customs of their Danish culture. A minority of approx. 50,000 [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig|Danish-identifying German citizens]] live in [[Southern Schleswig]] in Germany, a former Danish territory, forming around 10% of the local population. In Denmark, the latter group is often referred to as "Danes south of the border" ({{lang|da|De danske syd for grænsen}}), the "Danish-minded" ({{lang|da|De Dansksindede}}) or simply "South Schleswigers". Due to immigration there are considerable populations with Danish roots outside Denmark in countries such as United States, [[Brazil]], Canada and [[Argentina]].

[[Danish Americans]] ({{lang|da|Dansk-amerikanere}}) are [[Americans]] of Danish descent. There are approximately 1,500,000 Americans of Danish origin or descent. Most Danish-Americans live in the [[Western United States]] or the [[Midwestern United States]]. [[California]] has the largest population of people of Danish descent in the United States.&lt;ref name="Danish Americans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Danish-Americans.html |title=Danish Americans |accessdate=2011-03-10 |quote= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable Danish communities in the United States are located in [[Solvang, California]], and [[Racine, Wisconsin]], but these populations are not considered to be Danes for official purposes by the Danish state, and heritage alone can not be used to claim Danish citizenship, as it can in some European nations (see below).

According to the 2006 Census, there were 200,035 [[Danish Canadians|Canadians with Danish background]], 17,650 of whom were born in Denmark.&lt;ref name="statcan1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/topics/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?TPL=RETR&amp;ALEVEL=3&amp;APATH=3&amp;CATNO=&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=&amp;DS=99&amp;FL=0&amp;FREE=0&amp;GAL=0&amp;GC=99&amp;GK=NA&amp;GRP=1&amp;IPS=&amp;METH=0&amp;ORDER=1&amp;PID=89424&amp;PTYPE=88971&amp;RL=0&amp;S=1&amp;ShowAll=No&amp;StartRow=1&amp;SUB=723&amp;Temporal=2006&amp;Theme=72&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF= |title=Statistics Canada : 2006 Census Topic-based tabulations |publisher=Statcan.ca |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada became an important destination for the Danes during the post war period. At one point{{when|date=March 2018}}, a Canadian immigration office was to be set up in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;Bender, Henning. ''Danish emigration to Canada''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[New York, New York|New York]], Frisch grew up in [[San Antonio]] and graduated from [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1940. He was a [[graduate assistant]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] from 1940 to 1942, and then worked at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] from 1943 to 1945. After the war he moved to [[MIT]], beginning as a research associate in 1946, obtained his PhD in 1947 and was appointed an assistant professor in 1948, associate professor in 1952 and full professor in 1958. He retired in 1988.

Frisch was a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] and of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was the recipient of [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]], [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]], [[Alfred P. Sloan]] and National Science Foundation research fellowships.

Frisch served on the Physics Advisory Committee of the [[National Science Foundation]], on the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|Brookhaven]] High Energy Advisory Committee, and was chairman of the Long-Range Planning committee of the [[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]].

Frisch was active in the field of nuclear disarmament, participating in the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Moscow Pugwash Conference]] in 1960, editing the book ''Arms Reduction'' in 1961, and participating in the 1962 Woods Hole Summer Study on Inspection.

Among his scientific publications was a 1963 paper in which he and [[James H. Smith (physicist)|James H. Smith]] succeeded in showing objective [[time dilation]] in the decay of cosmic [[muons]]. A thirty-five-minute movie describing this experiment performed both on the top of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]] as well as at [[MIT]] is available online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scivee.tv/node/2415&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to biologist [[Rose Epstein Frisch|Rose Frisch]].

'''Emma Swan''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]''. She is portrayed by [[Jennifer Morrison]], by Abby Ross as a teenager, and Mckenna Grace as a child. Emma first appeared in the series's [[Pilot (Once Upon a Time)|pilot]] as a [[Bail bondsman|bail bond agent]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] until she meets her biological son Henry, whom she gave up for adoption 10 years before, and learns she is the daughter of [[Snow White]] and [[Prince Charming]]. Henry urges Emma to go to the fictional town of Storybrooke, [[Maine]], to break a curse enacted by the [[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]] and to restore the [[fairy tale]] characters' [[happy ending]]s.

Morrison's portrayal of Emma has received praise, with some reviewers noting a [[Feminism|feminist]] twist in the depiction of fairy tales and a strong female lead. She is loosely based on the title character of the fairy tale "[[The Ugly Duckling]]", a swan which was lost and raised by ducks, before finding its birth family and recognizing its true nature, while her Dark One side is loosely based on Odile the Black Swan from the ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]''. It is revealed in the Season 6 episode "[[Tougher Than the Rest (Once Upon a Time)|Tougher Than the Rest]]" that she chose the last name Swan when she was young after a [[Pinocchio|friend]] mentioned that story.

==Character development and casting==
[[File:Jennifer Morrison by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|125 px|[[Jennifer Morrison]] at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].]] In early stages of the conception of the character, Emma's name was Anna,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Once_Upon_A_Time/Once_Upon_A_Time_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf Original Script of the Pilot. On page 7 she is called 'ANNA SWAN'].&lt;/ref&gt; and she was supposed to have three children, but she ended up having just Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AdamHorowitzLA/status/343489896285102080|title=Adam Horowitz on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original script of the Pilot, she is described as "Late 20s. Beautiful, with great strength behind classic features. But also not quite at home in her skin."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Once_Upon_A_Time/Once_Upon_A_Time_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf Original Script of the Pilot.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that actress [[Katee Sackhoff]] auditioned five times for the role of Emma, but according to her, the producers really wanted Morrison to play the part, and she accepted a role in the television series ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/katee-sackhoff-longmire-riddick-interview/ |title=Katee Sackhoff Talks LONGMIRE, RIDDICK with Vin Diesel, Auditioning for ONCE UPON A TIME, and Reflects on the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA Series Finale |first=Christina |last=Radish |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Morrison was hired for the part of Emma.&lt;ref name="deadlinemorrisoncast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/jennifer-morrison-set-as-the-lead-in-abc-pilot-once-upon-a-time-3-others-cast/ |title=Jennifer Morrison Set as the Lead in ABC Pilot 'Once Upon a Time', 3 Others Cast |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison explained her character as someone who "help[s] her son Henry whom she abandoned when he was a baby and who seems like he's a little bit emotionally dysfunctional", but noted that Emma does not start out believing in the fairytale universe.&lt;ref name="futoncriticinterview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/interviews/2011/10/21/interview-once-upon-a-time-co-stars-ginnifer-goodwin-josh-dallas-and-lana-parrilla-216214/20111021_onceuponatime/ |title=Interview: "Once Upon a Time" Co-Stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas &amp; Lana Parrilla |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |date=October 21, 2011 |author=Halterman, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison has described Emma as being like an overgrown teenager who does not know how to properly do certain things, like eating or taking care of herself; this is due to Emma not growing up in a family unit. Morrison said that when she does not know what to do with Emma, she thinks, "What a 14-year-old boy would do?"&lt;ref&gt;''Once Upon a Time - Behind the Magic'' - Page 32. London: Titan Books, October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison has also stated that Emma is loosely based on "[[The Ugly Duckling]]", and that Emma's last name Swan is derived from this fairy tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanbolt.com/6367/jennifer-morrison-on-being-the-skeptic-in-once-upon-a-time/|title=Jennifer Morrison On Being The Skeptic In 'Once Upon A Time' - FanBolt|work=FanBolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the creators of the series, the name Swan is "very symbolic and fairy tale name and it just felt right for her and for the journey we are creating for Emma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cabletv.com/blog/adam-horowitz-edward-kitsis-talk-new-seasons-of-ouat-and-ouatiw/ |title=Adam Horowitz &amp; Edward Kitsis Talk New Seasons of OUAT and OUATIW |author=Monica |date=October 21, 2013 |work=Cabletv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Emma became the "Dark One" at the end of the [[Once Upon a Time (season 4)|fourth season]] of the series, Morrison began doing research with mythology books and old fairy tale books, and looking back through the history of swans and the etymology of 'Swan' to prepare for this new trait of her character. For Morrison, it is a great opportunity to now play a villain and it is challenging for her to portray a character that is constantly evolving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/jennifer-morrison-research-once-upon-time-season-5-dark-emma |title=Jennifer Morrison Is Reading Old Fairy Tales to Play 'Dark Emma' on Once Upon a Time |first=Michele |last=Corriston |date=June 17, 2013 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character Background==

Emma is born shortly after and placed in the wardrobe along with Pinocchio, successfully travelling to the new land.&lt;ref name="S01E01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/2011/10/once-upon-a-time-review-pilot/|title=Once Upon a Time Review: Believe in Magic|last=Orlando|first=Christine|publisher=TV Fanatic|date=October 23, 2011|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the real world, Emma grows up in foster care, bouncing from various families, one including Ingrid, the  [[The Snow Queen|Snow Queen]]. As a teenager, Emma becomes a petty criminal with [[Baelfire|Neal Cassidy]]. They plan to start a new life in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], until Neal is persuaded by August Booth ([[Pinocchio]]) to turn Emma over to the police, to protect her destiny. Emma is jailed, later giving birth to Henry,&lt;ref name="S02E06"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-2-episode-6/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: Locker, Stalk, and Two Smoking Hotties"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (November 4, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; whom she gives up for adoption to give him a better life; he is then adopted by Regina Mills (the Evil Queen).&lt;ref name="S01E02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-1-episode-2/ |title='Once Upon a Time' recap: This Town Ain't Big Enough |last=Shaunna |first=Murphy |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 31, 2011 |accessdate=September 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some time in prison, Emma becomes a bail bond agent.

Emma's past is temporarily altered by Regina. After leaving Storybrooke, Emma lives with Henry in New York City. Sometime later, she meets Walsh and they begin dating.&lt;ref name="S03E11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-midseason-finale/|title='Once Upon a Time' recap: The End Is the Beginning Is the End|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Busis|first=Hilary|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the curse's reversal, Hook restores Emma's memories with a potion and the two return to Storybrooke with Henry to save her family by breaking the new curse caused by [[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena]], the [[Wicked Witch of the West]].&lt;ref name="S03E12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-12/|title='Once Upon a Time' recap: Monkey Business|last=Hillary|first=Busis|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She finds an insane Neal trapped within Mr. Gold's body. Losing his mind, Neal asks for Emma to free his father by killing him to defeat Zelena; she reluctantly agrees.&lt;ref name="S03E15"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-neal-dies/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: Really, Most Sincerely Dead?"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (March 30, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Regina later helps Emma to strengthen her magical powers, though they are removed when Zelena curses Hook but thanks to Regina they managed to defeat Zelena and close her time portal.&lt;ref name="S03E17"&gt;[http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/once-upon-a-time-season-3-episode-17/ "'Once Upon a Time' recap: Boat Show"] from [[Entertainment Weekly]] (April 13, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Emma and Hook are dragged into Zelena's time portal, she accepts Storybrooke as her home, regaining her magic to re-open the portal to the present where she begins a relationship with Hook. However, unaware to her, she also brings a previously deceased [[Maid Marian]] to the future which ruins Regina's happiness, having not heeded the warning of messing with the past. Elsa, who was trapped in an urn, was also brought to Storybrooke by the time portal. While working with [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]], who helps Emma to finally embrace and control her powers, Emma helps her new friend find her sister and return home while balancing the threat of the Snow Queen, who turns out to have been one of Emma's foster mothers, against her friends and family. After a period of peace, Emma begins to help Regina on her quest to find the Author of Henry's book. [[Cruella De Vil]] and [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]] soon come into town resurrecting [[Maleficent]] and working with Rumplestiltskin to find the very same author, intent on giving villains their happy endings. After Cruella De Vil threatens to kill Henry, Emma kills her, soon after learning of her parents' actions of removing Emma's potential for darkness by putting black magic within Maleficent's daughter and Emma's childhood friend Lily.&lt;ref&gt;Sympathy for the De Vil&lt;/ref&gt; After Emma returns to town, with the encouragement from Hook, she chooses to forgive her parents and let go of her anger. In moments before the finale, Emma is able to finally let her walls down and tells Hook she loves him. Emma then chooses to sacrifice herself for the town of Storybrooke, asking her parents and Hook to save her, she voluntarily plunges the dagger into the Darkness, transforming into the new Dark One.

===Season 5===
Emma searches for [[Merlin]] and is helped by a manifestation of [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]], who wants to teach her to be the Dark One, while Emma attempts to resist becoming evil at the same time. Sometime later, she transformed Hook into a second Dark One to save his life. Hook then cast the Dark Curse to get back to Storybrooke to have his revenge on Mr. Gold. Emma then altered the curse, adding a dream-catcher in it to wipe out everyone's memories of their time in Camelot.

Six weeks later, the rest of her friends returned to Storybrooke, but with a horrifying and shocking twist, their memories were wiped out once again and wearing Arthurian attires. As it turned out Emma made an appearance as the Dark One, with her new attire. Henry asks what happened to her, and she told them that they all went to Camelot to remove the darkness from her and they all failed (except Henry). Emma with her powers turned Sneezy into stone, proclaiming that there's no savior in the town. Emma surprisingly gave the Dark One dagger to Regina with the intention that if she goes too dark Regina would be the only one that would willingly "put her down." Shortly after this, Hook attempts true love's kiss with Emma in the hopes that the Dark One's curse would break, but ultimately failed, as Emma has fully embraced the darkness. Unbeknownst to the others, Emma currently has possession of the Excalibur in a locked room inside of her new house. She intends to make Excalibur and the Dark One's dagger whole again, as with it she will be able to snuff out the light forever and become invulnerable. However, she must recruit a hero to do so, as she cannot remove the sword; the hero she chooses is her predecessor Rumplestiltskin, who she tells finally has a chance to become a hero. She planned to siphon the darkness out of both of them and put it Zelena, who she forced into an accelerated labor to avoid killing Robin's child, and slay her. She regains her memories of what Hook plans, by resurrecting all the Dark Ones as part of his revenge. At first, Emma plans to absorb all the darkness inside her and kill herself. Things do not go according to plan when Hook steals it from her. Killian orders her to kill him, taking in all the darkness and Emma slays him with Excalibur while the darkness is removed from her, reverting to her old self. After blackmailing Mr. Gold for tricking her and Hook into making him the Dark One again, she and her friends and family descend into the Underworld to find Hook and plans to split her heart in half and share it with him [[A Curious Thing (Once Upon a Time)|like her parents]].

Arriving in the Underworld, Emma is contacted by Neal Cassidy, who warns to turn back, advice Emma chooses to ignore. She and the others later discover that the Underworld is for those with unfinished business, and they decide to help others move on, while they search for Hook. With the help of Hook's ex-girlfriend Milah, Emma manages to retrieve Hook from Hades's captivity. However, she is unable to split her heart, as Hades has decided that she, Regina, and Snow are to remain behind for freeing the souls of Prince Henry, [[Hercules]], and [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]]. It is discovered that the only way they would have a chance to return to the "Overworld" with Hook is by overthrowing Hades. In order to defeat Hades, Emma and Hook receive help from Hook's brother Liam; however, it is soon discovered that Liam betrayed them after being blackmailed by Hades. Fortunately, Henry agrees to help undo Liam's work by using his powers as the Author. Later, when Emma and Hook try to perform the heartsplit, they are informed by Hades that Hook's body has been dead for too long and is decaying, making him unable to come back to life. When Emma and Hook go into the depths of the Underworld to find ambrosia, something that would save Hook, they are faced with a True Love test, which they pass when Emma chooses Hook over her own heart, only to realize that Hades had tricked them and destroyed the ambrosia, and Hook tells Emma to leave him in the Underworld, as time is running out for her to go through the open portal. Emma objects, saying that she came to the Underworld to save Hook, and she wasn't leaving without him. Hook eventually gets her to say her goodbyes and she does, only to find out that Hades had trapped her and her family in the library using magic. Emma and Regina work together to use their own magic to counteract it. They all go through the portal, and while Emma has second thoughts about leaving Hook, she is persuaded to go by her father. When they get back to Storybrooke, Zelena is informed by Regina and Robin that Hades tried to trap them in the Underworld, but she brushes off the information and is upset with her sister. She talks to Hades about having the life she wants, which is just a simple picket fence life. However, Hades wants a whole kingdom. Robin and Regina break into the mayor's house, where Zelena and Hades are, trying to get Robin's daughter back from Zelena. Emma, distraught and unable to grieve Hook's death, tries to break down the protection spell surrounding the house, but Zelena uses her magic to stop her. Hades is about to use the Olympian Crystal to "end" Regina, but Robin steps in front of her, taking the blow, which kills him. Hades tries to pressure Zelena into killing Regina, but she stabs Hades instead.

Before Robin's funeral, Emma stands at Hook's grave and cries, trying to cope with the fact that he is truly gone now. Suddenly, a wave of magic flies through the air, causing her to stumble. She hears her name called from behind her and turns around and is shocked to see Hook. She happily embraces Hook, who tells her Zeus sent him back as a reward for stopping Hades. After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides to break the news about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (''again''). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World. Henry succeeds in destroying magic, only to be later convinced by the Dragon to get enough belief to recharge the crystal. It works and everyone is brought home. Once back in Storybrooke, Emma shares a passionate kiss with Hook.

===Season 6===
In the past, Aladdin, a "Savior", is taunted by Jafar over the inevitable downfall of all Saviors. In Storybrooke, refugees arrive from the Land of Untold Stories. Emma experiences tremors and visions; an arrested Hyde helps her receive an oracle's vision of a hooded figure killing her. Guided by Morpheus, Gold enters Belle's dreams to lift the sleeping curse; he tries to renew their love, but she rejects him. "Morpheus" reveals he is really their unborn son, and desired this outcome. Emma’s death visions trouble her, as it puts her future with Killian in doubt, and after seeing him entertain Ashley’s daughter, asks him to move in with her.

Emma discovers the sword can kill the Evil Queen without hurting Regina. The Queen steals the lamp and wishes Emma to an alternate reality where she was never the Savior; Regina follows her. In the "wish realm", Emma lives as a princess until Regina traumatically restores her memory. Regina frees Rumplestiltskin in exchange for a magic bean, but the portal to Storybrooke closes while Regina is distracted by the appearance of Robin Hood.

In 1990 Minnesota, a young Emma is told by a teenager that she has the power to change her fate. In present day, after they miss their way out of the Wish realm, Emma and Regina find another option for escape when they come across August, who agrees to help create a new portal.  Emma discovers that August was the teenager she met back in Minnesota and inspires him to complete the portal. Emma, Regina, and Robin return to Storybrooke, where Gideon explains to Gold and Belle his intention to kill Emma so that he can acquire her savior powers and kill the Black Fairy, a move that has David furious and Belle concerned. Emma and Gideon finally meet for the battle, but Emma survives, choosing her own fate.  Gideon retreats, proclaiming this far from over. Gold and Belle decide to work together for the good of  the son.

In the past, Snow makes a wish that grants the entire Enchanted Forest to use the gift of Song to defeat Regina, which also spreads to Oz as well. When Regina also becomes affected by the wish she finds a way to end it before the first curse takes place, but the Blue Fairy, who granted Snow the wish, tells Snow and David that the wish will be part of Emma's destiny. In Emma's past, her chance to make use of her talent is held back by being told she'll be alone. This would come back to taunt Emma in the present day, as Fiona returns to use that weakness to take Emma's heart before she unleashes a new curse on her wedding, with unlikely help from Gold by freezing her family. When Henry discovers the page in the book that reveals Emma's heart will make her stronger, not only does it embolden Emma, it stopped Fiona from crushing it, but Fiona still tells her the battle is still on. On wedding day, Emma and Hook finally marry just in time for the dark clouds to release a new curse that will set up the final battle.

Fiona's curse wipes Emma's memory past the final episode of season 1, and places her in a mental institution, where she (and the rest of the town) believes that Henry is Fiona's rightfully adopted son and all the fairytale stories were untrue. Henry, after several instances tries to get her to believe the truth, but she rebuffs him and moves back to Boston. Meanwhile, the rest of the characters are trapped in the Enchanted Forest as it and all the other realms crumble as a consequence of Emma's refusal to believe. However, Emma, inspired by a book Henry had created detailing her journey, returns to Storybrooke and chooses to believe him. Rumple successfully kills Fiona, which restores Emma's belief and transports the other characters back to Storybrooke. Emma fights Gideon, still under Fiona's lasting control, but ultimately chooses to sacrifice herself. Henry brings her back with True Love's Kiss and Gideon turns back into a baby, allowing Rumple and Belle a second chance.

At the end, Emma and Regina are shown to drop Henry off at his bus stop, and Emma later makes Hook deputy sheriff. All the characters are later gathered at Granny's for dinner as the book ends with the words, "And they all lived happily ever after".

===Season 7===
In the past, Emma is shown to share her concerns with Hook about Henry growing up while contemplating having another child. Later, Henry chooses to go to other realms in search of his story, and meets another version of Cinderella, whom he falls in love with. In that time, Emma becomes pregnant with her second child and goes to answer Henry's distress call along with Killian and Regina, with the former insisting she rest. Wish Hook, however, shows up and knocks out Hook, taking his place in hopes of traveling to Storybrooke with Emma and finding a cure for his poisoned heart. Hook manages to recover and fights Wish Hook, until the latter accidentally stabs himself with a dagger. As he lays dying, he admits to having a daughter and that he was searching for her. However, Emma manages to heal him and convinces him to travel with Henry in search of both their happy endings. She later leaves with her husband back to Storybrooke.

Henry and the others manage to foil a plot by Wish Rumple to wreak havoc on all the realms, and end up bringing them all to Storybrooke. Emma gives birth to a baby girl named Hope and, along with Hook, attends Regina's coronation where she is crowned "The Good Queen" of all the realms.

Jennifer Morrison has received praise for her portrayal of Emma. In a review from the  ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', TV critic Gail Pennington had high marks for Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/article_5094a078-95af-576b-b934-1cf3dec5e73f.html |title=A sneak peek at the fall TV season |first=Gail |last=Pennington |work=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' |date=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave excellent reviews for Morrison's character: "Her Emma is predictably cynical and prickly&amp;nbsp;– fairy-tale princess, my Aunt Fanny&amp;nbsp;– but she's sharp and lively enough to keep audiences begging for 'just a few more pages' before they go to bed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Several [[feminist]] outlets were pleased with the show for its feminist twist on fairy tales and with Emma being a strong female protagonist. Genie Leslie at ''[[Feministing]]'' commented that Emma was a "badass", that she liked how Emma was "very adamant that women be able to make their own decisions about their lives and their children", and how Emma was a "well-rounded" character who was "feminine, but not 'girly{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Feministing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.feministing.com/2012/01/19/once-upon-a-feminist-time/ |title=Once Upon a (Feminist) Time |author=Genie Leslie |date=January 19, 2012 |publisher=Feministing |accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natalie Wilson from ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' praised the show for a strong, "kick-butt" female lead, and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion.&lt;ref name=strongsnow /&gt;

'''Gheorghe Apostol''' (May 16, 1913 &amp;ndash; August 21, 2010) was a [[Romania]]n politician, deputy Prime Minister of Romania and  a former leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]], noted for his rivalry with [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]].

==Early life==
Apostol was born near [[Tudor Vladimirescu, Galați|Tudor Vladimirescu]], [[Galați County]].

After training at the [[Căile Ferate Române]] (CFR) school, he worked in a CFR [[foundry]] in [[Galați]]. In 1932, Apostol met [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], and became involved in the [[Communism|communist]] underground. He joined the Party in 1934 and became its link with the railway [[trade union]]s and minor left-leaning groups in Galați.

Arrested several times, Apostol was sentenced in 1937 to three years in prison, which he served in Galați and [[Doftana prison|Doftana]]. His activities upon his release from jail got him interned in camps for political prisoners, at [[Târgu Jiu]], [[Caracal]], and [[Miercurea Ciuc]]. In August 1944, as the [[Red Army]] was approaching the Romanian border, Apostol and several communist figures who were being detained at Târgu Jiu escaped and made their way to the underground. This version of the story follows Apostol's official biography of the 1950s; photos taken upon the liberation of the camp (published in ''Dosarele Istoriei'', for instance), allegedly showing him in the middle of the crowd of former prisoners, made some doubt this account.{{Who|date=December 2009}}

==With Gheorghiu-Dej==
He was among the most prominent collaborators of Gheorghiu-Dej. As members of the so-called ''prison faction'', opposed to the large group of Party members who had taken refuge in the [[Soviet Union]] prior to 1944, Gheorghe Apostol and Gheorghiu-Dej walked the fine line between [[Stalinism]] and reformism. Thus, [[Communist Romania]] did not steer away from Soviet policies until 1953, and Gheorghiu-Dej even got [[Joseph Stalin]]'s approval for the removal of rival [[Ana Pauker]] on charges of right wing deviance and [[cosmopolitism]], as well as for the elimination of [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]] (a Romanian communist who was not completely loyal to the Party). After Stalin's death in 1953, the regime in Romania, headed by the same inner circle, was largely opposed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[History of the Soviet Union (1953–1985)|de-Stalinization]], while carrying out its own reforms and attempting to cut off most economic ties to the Soviet Union.

Apostol continued to be the favoured link between the Party (then named ''Partidul Muncitoresc Român'', PMR – "Romanian Workers' Party") and the trade unions. At the same time, he climbed steadily in the Party hierarchy.  He joined the [[Central Committee]] in 1945 and the [[Politburo]] in 1948.  He was Minister of Agriculture in 1953–54, a member of the [[Great National Assembly]] legislative body, whose President he also was from April 1948 to June 1948, September 1950 to April 1951 and March 1952 to June 1952, and recipient of several national honours.  In 1954, Gheorghiu-Dej briefly gave up the first secretaryship of the party to Apostol, while remaining as prime minister.  However, it was understood that Gheorghiu-Dej still held the real power, and he formally took back the party leadership in 1955.

According to Apostol himself, an ailing Gheorghiu-Dej would have decided to appoint him as his successor in 1964: as confirmation, Apostol was sent to represent the Romanian government at [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s funeral. [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]] rallied the Party leadership around the neutral option represented by Ceaușescu, making sure that Apostol did not represent a threat upon Gheorghiu-Dej's death.

==Hostility to Ceaușescu==
As a result, Apostol became deeply hostile to Ceaușescu's policies, stating that they went against the legacy of Gheorghiu-Dej (in 2003, he described the latter as ''[[People's democracy (Marxism–Leninism)|democratic socialism]]''). He refused to pay the allegiance demanded by the new leader. Protected by [[Emil Bodnăraş|Emil Bodnăraș]], he was advised to take refuge in a diplomatic career, becoming [[ambassador]] to [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]] and then [[Brazil]].

In 1988, at the peak of Nicolae Ceaușescu's leadership, Apostol returned to Romania and contacted other communist figures of his generation (such as [[Alexandru Bârlădeanu]], [[Silviu Brucan]], [[Corneliu Mănescu]], [[Constantin Pîrvulescu]], and [[Grigore Răceanu]]) drafting an [[open letter]] of protest (dubbed ''Scrisoarea celor șase'' – "[[Letter of the Six]]"), directed at the government and made public (March 11, 1989) through the means of both [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Voice of America]]. According to Apostol, several ''Letter'' contributors expressed their concern at having to use [[Imperialism|imperialist]] means of [[propaganda]].

As a result, Apostol was placed under [[house arrest]], being constantly interrogated, in the hope that he would reveal himself as a "Soviet spy". The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], which the ''Letter'' had helped along, liberated him in December.

Apostol expressed his dislike for many aspects of post 1989 Romania. Apostol died  on August 21, 2010 at the age of 97.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/world/europe/27apostol.html?referer=https://www.google.com/|title=Gheorghe Apostol, Critic of Romania’s Ceausescu, Dies at 97|last=[[Associated Press]]|date=August 26, 2010|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Apostol was married to (?) between 1935-1947. From 1944 he lived with, and later married, Melita Schaerf (d. 1991), a Romanian journalist. They separated in 1956 and subsequently divorced. In 1965, Apostol married his third wife, Adriana Codreanu (born 21 December 1934).&lt;ref&gt;http://revistamuzicala.radioromaniacultural.ro/?p=24396&lt;/ref&gt; He had three children - Geta (b. 1935, living in Romania), Gheorghe (b. 1945, living in Canada), and Sanda (b. 1952, living in Israel), four granddaughters who live in Romania, the United States and Australia and 4 greatgrandchildren.

The plaque recognizes Levy as the top former CAP cadet in the Class of 2008.

==Early years==
Levy was born and raised in [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico]] to a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] father and an [[Israelis|Israeli]] mother. She received both her primary and secondary education in the city of her birth. In 2004, Levy graduated from [[Saint John's School (San Juan)|Saint John’s School]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Levy, who joined the Puerto Rico Wing of the [[Civil Air Patrol]] in 2000, reached the rank of Cadet Colonel and was the CAP's National Cadet of the Year in 2004. According to her citation, she earned the award for her outstanding academic performance, strong leadership skills, well-rounded extracurricular activities, and positive community involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anchoragecap.org/documents/OPEN%20COCKPIT11.htm CAP Cadet of the year]&lt;/ref&gt; Levy has stated that her experiences in the Civil Air Patrol served as an influential factor on her decision to apply for an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy.

==USAFA==
Levy received an appointment to attend the [[United States Air Force Academy]] at [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in [[Colorado]]. As a Cadet 1st Class and member of Squadron 9, she was among 28 cadets named Dean's Aces and who were honored for their academic achievements in the Fall semester of 2005 at the academy. Levy, who earned a 4.0 grade point average that semester, was one of five cadets that year to be named an Ace three times.&lt;ref&gt;Academy Spirit; Vol. 46 No. 13; March 31, 2006; Record number of cadets turn up Aces; by the Dean of the Faculty Staff&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2008, Levy earned her [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Biology]] with 3 foreign language minors: [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. She finished as the top graduate, earning the Outstanding Cadet in the Order of Graduation Award and a spot on the academy's 100-year Honor Roll.&lt;ref name="TAFC"&gt;[https://careersdocbox.com/US_Military/77791082-Top-academy-graduate-cap-s-first-rhodes-scholar-leads-class-of-2008-civil-air-patrol-a-flood-of-help-rising-waters-call-10-cap-wings-into-action.html Top Air Force Academy graduate, former CAP cadet, earns Rhodes Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; She received her Second Lieutenant's commission  in the United States Air Force and awards from the [[Argentine Air Force]] and the [[Chilean Air Force]] for graduating first in her class during the US Air Force Academy Graduation and Commissioning Ceremony.&lt;ref name="TAFC"/&gt;

===Rhodes scholar===
In 2007, Levy became the first Puerto Rican and the 35th Academy cadet to be awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. She was awarded the scholarship for the District 13 of Colorado. The Rhodes Scholarships were created in 1902 under the terms and conditions of the will of [[Cecil Rhodes]], a British born African colonial pioneer.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt;

Levy was planning on using the scholarship to obtain two master's degrees of one year each, the first a Master’s of Science in Global Health Science and the second a Master’s of Science in [[Medical Anthropology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in the [[United Kingdom]], however she was accepted to the Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) in Public Health program (a 3-year degree which grants Oxford's Ph.D. equivalent) starting September 2008, under Oxford's Department of Public Health with Prof. Harold Jaffe as her supervisor.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt;

Early in her first year at Oxford, she transferred to the History Faculty, where she obtained a Master of Studies in Historical Research in 2009 under military historian Dr. Robert Johnson, focusing on the formation of national armies in former French Equatorial Africa. Levy then obtained a Master of Science in Biology at Oxford, focusing on the population genetics of humans in southern Africa (under Dr. Cristian Capelli) and of penguins in the South Atlantic (under Dr. Tom Hart of the Institute of Zoology in London). Levy started her follow-on assignment in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proz.com/profile/109088 PROZ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy joined two other Rhodes Scholarship winners from the [[United States Military Academy]] and the [[United States Naval Academy]] making it the second consecutive year that the military academies claimed three of only 32 recipients in the United States.&lt;ref name="MH" /&gt;

Levy is fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and has published numerous articles related to language in the military and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. Levy was promoted to First Lieutenant in May 2010. She is married to Brad Williams.

==Recognition==
Levy was honored with a plaque that has her name, squadron name and graduation date, which has been placed in the ballroom balcony of the Academy's hall of honor. The plaque recognizes Levy as the top former CAP cadet in the Class of 2008.&lt;ref name="TAFC" /&gt;

'''Ibrahim Pasha''' ({{lang-tr|Kavalalı İbrahim Paşa}}, 1789 – November 10, 1848) was the eldest son of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the [[Wāli]] and unrecognised [[Khedive]] of [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|Egypt]] and [[History of Sudan (1821–85)|Sudan]]. He served as a general in the Egyptian army that his father established during his reign, taking his first command of Egyptian forces when he was merely a teenager. In the final year of his life, he succeeded his still living father as ruler of Egypt and Sudan, due to the latter's ill health. His rule also extended over the other dominions that his father had brought under Egyptian rule, namely [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], [[Hejaz]], [[Morea]], [[Ottoman Thasos|Thasos]], and [[Ottoman Crete|Crete]]. Ibrahim pre-deceased his father, dying 10 November 1848, only four months after acceding to the throne. Upon his father's death the following year, the Egyptian throne passed to Ibrahim's nephew (son of Muhammad Ali's second oldest son), [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas]].

Ibrahim remains one of the most celebrated members of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]], particularly for his impressive military victories, including several crushing defeats of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Among Egyptian historians, Ibrahim, his father Muhammad Ali, and his son [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail the Magnificent]] are held in far higher esteem than other rulers from the dynasty, who were largely viewed as indolent and corrupt; this is largely the result of efforts by his grandson [[Fuad I of Egypt]] to ensure the positive portrayal of his paternal ancestors in the Royal Archives that he created, which were the primary source for Egyptian history from the 1920s until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Fahmy, ''Mehmed Ali: From Ottoman Governor to Ruler of Egypt'' (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a statue of Ibrahim occupies a prominent position in Egypt's capital, [[Cairo]].

== Background ==
His Mother Emine, born at Nusretli in 1770 and died in Cairo 1824. She was the widow of Ottoman Turk Serezli Ali Bey, and a daughter of  Major Ali Aga of Nusretli. Ibrahim was her first born. It is further known that he was born in the village of ''Nusratli'' (today [[Nikiforos]]), near the town of Drama, the Ottoman province of [[Rumelia]], in what is now the eastern parts of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian region]] in Greece.

In 1805, during his father's [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power|struggle to establish himself as ruler of Egypt]], the adolescent Ibrahim, at 16, was sent as a hostage to the Ottoman captain Pasha ([[admiral]]). However, Ibrahim was allowed to return to [[Egypt]] once his father was recognised as [[Wāli]] of Egypt by the [[Ottoman Sultan]], and had [[Alexandria expedition of 1807|defeated the British military expedition]] of [[Major General]] [[Alexander Mackenzie Fraser]].

When Muhammad Ali went to [[Arabia]] to prosecute the war against the [[Wahhabi movement|Ibn Saud]] in 1813, Ibrahim was left in command of [[Upper Egypt]]. He continued the war with the broken power of the [[Mameluk]]s, whom he suppressed. In 1816, he succeeded his brother [[Tusun Pasha]] in command of the Egyptian forces in Arabia.

== Campaigns against the house of Saud==
{{Main article|Ottoman–Saudi War}}
Muhammad Ali had already begun to introduce European discipline into his army, and Ibrahim had probably received some training, but his first campaign was conducted more in the old Asiatic style than his later operations. The campaign lasted two years, and ended in the destruction of the [[First Saudi State|House of Saud]] as a political power. Muhammad Ali landed at [[Yanbu]], the port of [[Medina]], on 1813. The holy cities had been recovered from the Saudis, and Ibrahim's task was to follow them into the desert of [[Nejd]] and destroy their fortresses. Such training as the Egyptian troops had received, and their artillery, gave them a marked superiority in the open field. But the difficulty of crossing the desert to the Saudis stronghold of [[Diriyah]], some 400 miles east of Medina made the conquest a very arduous one. Ibrahim displayed great energy and tenacity, sharing all the hardships of his army, and never allowing himself to be discouraged by failure. By the end of September 1818, he had forced the [[Abdullah bin Saud|Saudi leader]] to surrender, and had taken Diriyah, which he sacked.

== Operations in the Morea ==

[[File:Ibrahim-messolonghi.jpg|thumb|Ibrahim Pasha attacks [[Missolonghi]] in the year 1826, (by Giuseppe Pietro Mazzola).]]
[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|upright|Ibrahim Pasha, with father [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] and Colonel Sève ([[Soliman Pasha al-Faransawi|Suleiman Pasha]], right).]]

On December 11, 1819 he made a triumphal entry into [[Cairo]]. After his return Ibrahim gave effective support to the Frenchman, Colonel Sève ([[Soliman Pasha al-Faransawi|Suleiman Pasha]]), who was employed to drill the army on the European model. Ibrahim set an example by submitting to be drilled as a recruit. In 1824, Muhammad Ali was appointed governor of the [[Morea]] (the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula in southern Greece) by Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]]. Mahmud actually required the assistance of the well-trained Egyptian army against the contemporary [[Greek Revolution]], which his forces had been unable to quell: in 1822, the Greeks had decisively defeated an army of some 30,000 men under Sultanzade [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]].

Ibrahim was sent to the Peloponnese with a squadron and an army of 17,000 men. The expedition sailed on July 4, 1824, but was for some months unable to do more than come and go between [[Rhodes]] and [[Crete]]. The fear of the Greek [[fire ship]]s stopped his way to the Morea. When the Greek sailors mutinied from want of pay, Ibrahim was able to land at Modon on February 26, 1825. He remained in the Morea until the capitulation of October 1, 1828 was forced on him by the intervention of the [[Western powers]].

He defeated the Greeks in the open field, and though the siege of [[Missolonghi]] proved costly to his own troops and to the Ottoman forces who operated with him, he brought it to a successful termination on April 24, 1826. But he was defeated in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] three times in a row. The Greek [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] bands harassed his army, and in revenge he desolated the country and sent thousands of the inhabitants into [[slavery]] in Egypt. These measures of repression aroused great indignation in Europe and led to the intervention of the naval squadrons of the United Kingdom, the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restored Kingdom of France]] and [[Russian history, 1796-1855|Imperial Russia]] in the [[Battle of Navarino]] (October 20, 1827). Their victory was followed by the landing of a French expeditionary force in the so-called [[Morea expedition]]. By the terms of the capitulation of October 1, 1828, Ibrahim evacuated the country.

== Campaigns in Syria ==
{{main article|Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–33)}}
{{See also|Syrian Peasant Revolt (1834–35)|Peasants' revolt in Palestine}}
In 1831, his father's quarrel with the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] having become flagrant, Ibrahim was sent to conquer [[Syria]]. He took [[Acre (city)|Acre]] after a severe siege on May 27, 1832, occupied [[Damascus]], defeated an Ottoman army at [[Homs]] on July 8 defeated another Ottoman army at [[Belen, Hatay|Beilan]] on July 29, invaded [[Asia Minor]], and finally routed the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Reşid Mehmed Pasha]] at [[Battle of Konya|Konya]] on December 21. It was there in Syria where he met [[Umar Tal]] the mystic, according to accounts Umar Tal healed the son of Ibrahim Pasha from a deadly fever. Umar Tal was inspired by Ibrahim Pasha, when Umar returned to [[Sokoto]] he followed the trends set by the Pasha. Umar Tal later became the commander of the [[Toucouleur Empire|Toucouleur]] in what is now [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], and [[Mali]].

The [[Convention of Kütahya]] on May 6 left Syria for a time in the hands of Muhammad Ali. Ibrahim was undoubtedly helped by Colonel Sève and the European officers in his army. After the campaign of 1832 and 1833, Ibrahim remained as governor in Syria. He might perhaps have administered successfully, but the exactions he was compelled to enforce by his father soon caused the popularity of his government to decline and provoked revolts. He was assisted by French officer [[Charles-Marie-Napoléon de Beaufort d'Hautpoul|Beaufort d'Hautpoul]] from 1834 to 1837, who was his Chief-of-Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZ_pm2UtD8EC&amp;pg=PA114 |title=An occasion for war: civil conflict in Lebanon and Damascus in 1860|first=Leila Tarazi|last= Fawaz|page=114 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1834 [[peasants' revolt in Palestine]], Ibrahim Pasha [[Siege of Al-Karak (1834)|besieged]] the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordanian]] city of [[Al-Karak]] for 17 days, in pursuit of the revolt's leader [[Qasim al-Ahmad]]. After a hole was blasted into the town's walls in late August, Al-Karak was destroyed and the orchards outside the town were uprooted as punitive measures against the residents for hosting Qasim. Fearing further retaliation from Ibrahim Pasha, the rebel leaders were handed to the Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Rogan31-2"&gt;Rogan, 1995, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AMAbXGQDmDYC&amp;pg=PA31 31]-2&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1838, the Porte felt strong enough to renew the struggle, and war broke out once more. Ibrahim won his [[Battle of Nezib|last victory]] for his father at [[Nezib]] on June 24, 1839. But the United Kingdom and the [[Austrian Empire]] intervened to preserve the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Their squadrons cut his communications by sea with Egypt, a general revolt isolated him in Syria, and he was finally compelled to evacuate the country in February 1841.

The Karakis were to take their revenge from Ibrahim Pasha, 6 years later when the Pasha and his Egyptian army were driven out of Damascus. In 1841, as the Pasha and his troops took the Hajj road from Damascus, they were persistently attacked all the way from [[Qatraneh]] to [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. The weary army were killed and robbed, and by the time Ibrahim Pasha reached Gaza, the commander had lost most of his army, ammunition and animals.&lt;ref name="cup"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMAbXGQDmDYC&amp;pg=PA31|page=31|title=Frontiers of the State in the Late Ottoman Empire: Transjordan, 1850-1921|accessdate=2016-06-08|date=2002-04-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last years ==
Ibrahim spent the rest of his life in peace, but his health was ruined. In 1846 he paid a visit to Western Europe, where he was received with some respect and a great deal of curiosity. When his father became [[senile]], Ibrahim was appointed [[Regent]] in his place. He held his regency from July till the time of his death on November 10, 1848.

'''Jabbar Collins''' (born July 8, 1972) is a wrongfully-convicted American man who served 16 years for a crime he did not commit. He was convicted of [[Murder#Degrees of murder|second-degree murder]] following the February 1994 death of Orthodox Rabbi Abraham Pollack in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="NYT10"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Stephanie|last1=Clifford|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/nyregion/jabbar-collins-wrongfully-convicted-man-reaches-10-million-settlement-with-new-york-city.html|title=Exonerated Man Reaches $10 Million Deal With New York City|last=|first=|date=19 August 2014|work=New York Times|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police charged 20-year-old Collins, who lived in a nearby housing project, with the murder. He was then sentenced by a jury in March 1995 to 34-years-to-life, sixteen of which he served.&lt;ref name="UMIC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3115|title=Jabbar Collins - National Registry of Exonerations|website=www.law.umich.edu|access-date=2018-07-31}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Collins was [[Exoneration|exonerated]] after a key witness recanted. The case settled in 2014 for $13 million. It exposed questionable policies under the former Brooklyn district attorney, [[Charles J. Hynes]], and his right-hand man, Michael F. Vecchione.&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-prosecutors-arent-above-the-law-20180726-story.html|title=Prosecutors aren't above the law: Gov.

The case has been used by the [[Frederic Block|Honorable Frederic Block]] in support of a bill for the nation’s first Commission on Prosecutorial Conduct.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt; Said bill is pending approval{{when|date=October 2018}} by [[Andrew Cuomo|Governor Andrew Cuomo]].

==Background==

Jabbar Collins was raised in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="NYP14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/19/man-who-spent-16-years-behind-bars-gets-10m-for-wrongful-conviction/|title=Man who spent 16 years behind bars gets $10M for wrongful conviction|date=2014-08-19|work=New York Post|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the murder, he lived in a nearby housing project within the vicinity of the crime scene.&lt;ref name="UMIC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3115|title=Jabbar Collins - National Registry of Exonerations|website=www.law.umich.edu|access-date=2018-07-31}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; A father of three,&lt;ref name="NYTV"/&gt; Collins was not able to finish high school but nonetheless earned a high school equivalency diploma. He had been enrolled in college classes before his arrest.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jabber-collins-and-new-york-state-reach-settlement-in-wrongful-conviction-case-for-3-million-1405009263|title=Jabbar Collins Settles Wrongful Conviction Suit for $3 Million|last=Gardiner|first=Sean|date=2014-07-10|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-07-31|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder of Abraham Pollack==

Rabbi Abraham Pollack was fatally shot in a failed robbery attempt while collecting rent in a Brooklyn apartment building in which he served as landlord.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; Those who knew him describe him as a devoted husband and father of nine who “treated everyone fairly” and “didn’t hassle you” about late rent. His generosity and fairness also extended to his workers; Pollack had allowed the janitor, a formerly homeless man, to live in the building’s basement in exchange for assisting the superintendent.&lt;ref name="JWT"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/twenty-years-on-second-thoughts-about-chasids-killer/|title=Twenty Years On, Second Thoughts About Chasid’s Killer|access-date=2018-07-31|last1=Winston|first1=Hella|work=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a Sunday in early February 1994, Rabbi Pollack was shot to death at the age of thirty-five. The building superintendent witnessed the crime and ran to get assistance from the janitor, who intervened during the attack and was shot and seriously injured.

Approximately two weeks after Rabbi Pollack’s murder, the janitor spoke to detectives and an assistant district attorney. He revealed that he had cut the perpetrator of the crime on his right side with a knife while intervening during the crime.&lt;ref name="JWT"/&gt;

Curiously, Collins did not exhibit any injury on his side when he voluntarily went to the 90th Precinct for a police interview twelve days following the murder.

Although both the building super and janitor were eyewitnesses to the murder of Rabbi Pollack, neither witness positively identified Collins as the perpetrator in a police lineup. Furthermore, Collins has a strong alibi placing him away from the scene of the crime.&lt;ref name="JWT"/&gt;

Early police reports indicate that a few witnesses had stated that the perpetrator was a local drug dealer who had been under recent investigation, alongside his brother, for another robbery. In the hour following the crime, the superintendent was shown photos of this drug dealer and his brother, whom he said resembled the man who murdered Rabbi Pollack. Another police report also states that that one of the brothers has a scar “on [the] stomach area” — the same area where the janitor had cut the perpetrator with a knife.&lt;ref name="JWT"/&gt;

Regardless of the fact that there was incriminating evidence against other suspects, the police continued to focus their investigation on Collins after they had received an anonymous phone call implicating him. The case built against Collins relied substantially on three witnesses, who were heavy drug users and whose accounts were not consistent with those of actual eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name="JWT"/&gt;

==Trial==

Collins was convicted in March 1995 after two witnesses testified to seeing him flee the crime scene. Another witness claimed that Collins had revealed his plans to rob Pollack as he was collecting rent.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

===Verdict and sentencing===

Collins was sentenced to 34-years-to-life in prison for murder in the second-degree. 

However, according to court documents, police were aware of [[Exculpatory evidence|exculpatory information]] pertaining to Collins.&lt;ref name="JWT"/&gt;

==Appeal==
Sure of his innocence, Collins began fighting his conviction while at the [[Green Haven Correctional Facility]], a maximum security state prison. Upon requesting documents through the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], Collins soon realized that some of these materials had not been provided to his trial lawyer at the time of his conviction. He decided to contact the witnesses whose testimonies implicated him in the murder of Rabbi Pollack. Collins soon found discrepancies in their stories and realized that the men had "received favorable treatment on pending cases in exchange for their testimony."&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; Witness admitted to having been enticed or threatened by the prosecution.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt; One of these witnesses later testified at a hearing that when he tried to recant his statement implicating Collins before trial, a prosecutor had threatened to hit him with a coffee table.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; Eventually, all three witnesses ultimately recanted their statements.

Collins also uncovered important [[prosecutorial misconduct]] in that a prosecutor did not turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense. Ultimately, the city admitted to the withholding of this exculpatory evidence at the time of the 1995 trial, conceding that Collins’ conviction and sentencing "resulted from violations of his [[Constitutional right|constitutional rights]]."&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;

After failing to receive relief in state court, Collins filed a petition for [[habeas corpus]] in federal court and enlisted the help of attorney Joel B. Rudin.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt; The defense asked for an order prohibiting [[New trial|retrial]] because of the gross misconduct. Following a one-day evidentiary hearing, the Kings County District Attorney’s Office decided not to oppose that outcome, perhaps because the prosecution witnesses were too compromised to retry the case. Even so, the office continued to allege that Collins was guilty.&lt;ref name="UMIC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3115|title=Jabbar Collins - National Registry of Exonerations|website=www.law.umich.edu|access-date=2018-07-31}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, officials at the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, who had previously stated that they would retry Collins, [[Motion (legal)#To dismiss|dismissed]] the case. A representative said at the time that the office still believed Collins to be the killer.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

===Settlement===
[[Settlement (litigation)|Settlement]] was reached in July 2014. At the behest of Judge Frederic Block, who urged city and state officials to settle Collins’ wrongful conviction lawsuit before going to trial,&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt; the matter settled for $3 million under the Unjust Conviction Act.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;

On the topic of this agreement, Collins’ attorney, Joel B. Rudin, commented, “Three million dollars is a lot of money, but it is a fraction of what Jabbar Collins is entitled to for 15 horrendous years in a maximum security state prison. We look forward now to concentrating totally on his much larger claim for damages against New York City.”&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

==Allegations of prosecutorial misconduct==
===Charles Hynes===
As of July 2018, Collins is also suing former Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, former members of his office, and New York Police Department detectives for civil violations in federal court.&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

This lawsuit follows [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] conducted by Collins’ lawyer, Joel B. Rudin, in the murder case. During a December 2010 deposition, Hynes reportedly stated that when he ordered the case dismissed, he no longer believed that Collins was guilty and that there was no evidence connecting him to the murder. He also stated under questioning that there was “a failure of ethical responsibility by someone involved in the case.”&lt;ref name="WSJ"/&gt;

===Michael Vecchione===
The case also brought to question the conduct of former Assistant District Attorney Michael F. Vecchione, who is renowned as an aggressive prosecutor who has overseen many high profile cases and co-author of the book, Friends of the Family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/new-book-friends-family-mafia-cops-claims-fbi-hogged-glory-article-1.361032|title=New book, 'Friends of the Family,' on Mafia cops claims FBI hogged the glory|last=Marzulli|first=John|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a New York Times article, Collins accused Vecchione of “playing God” in his threats against witnesses, elicitation of inaccurate testimonies, and withholding of exculpatory evidence. The misconduct which Collins believed deprived him of a fair trial, included the elicitation of a testimony from Angel Santos, one of the three witnesses who testified in the 1995 trial. In his testimony at the aborted habeas corpus hearing, Santos recounted [[coercion]] by Vecchione at the initial trial, stating that he was not only threatened but also held in jail for a week, until he testified.&lt;ref name="NYTV"/&gt;

The settlement spared the testimony of Vecchione who, in 2006, had signed a sworn affidavit dispeling notions of use of force or threats in obtaining witness testimonies.&lt;ref name="NYTV"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/nyregion/09vecchione.html|title=Brooklyn Prosecutor Drops Case Against Man Held in Murder|work=New York Times|last=Sulzberger|first=A. G.|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly criticized for his conduct in this case by District Attorney Charles Hynes’ successor [[Kenneth P. Thompson|Kenneth Thompson]], though not officially related, Vecchione retired in December 2013.&lt;ref name="NYT13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/15/nyregion/under-fire-brooklyn-deputy-prosecutor-will-retire.html|title=Under Fire, Brooklyn Deputy Prosecutor Will Retire|last=Yee|first=Vivian|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial significance: Bill for Commission on Prosecutorial Conduct===

According to a New York Daily News opinions editorial, [[Frederic Block|Federal Judge Frederic Block]] (who served in the settled civil case) was troubled by the lack of accountability in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/b-klyn-da-charles-hynes-hot-seat-wrongful-conviction-article-1.1203342|title=Brooklyn DA Charles Hynes in hot seat for protecting prosecutor who imprisoned innocent man|last=Marzulli|first=John|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he ruled that the city could be held liable, he was forced to dismiss the claims against the prosecutor and the district attorney of [[prosecutorial immunity]]. 

Block notes, as of July 30, 2018, the state and city taxpayers have paid $13 million in settlements. Despite his "egregious behavior," the prosecutor has neither been forced to pay for the settlement or face any punishment.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt; Block maintains that it is not uncommon for wrongful conviction cases across New York to stem from “a whole array of prosecutorial misconduct” yet simultaneously cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars “for the many years the innocent defendants spent in jail.” Prosecutors, he notes, have curiously remained largely unscathed.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;

==Personal life==
While in prison, both of Collins’ grandmothers passed away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/inside-city-hall/2017/09/16/jabbar-collins-wrongfully-convicted-interview-work-help-others-wrongfully-convicted#|title=Jabbar Collins: Wrongfully convicted, now helping others|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While incarcerated, Collins spent eight years helping his fellow inmates by acting as a legal research instructor. Since being released from prison, Collins has worked as a legal analyst at the Law Offices of Joel B. Rudin. He currently works as a legal analyst for Horizon Research Services&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/jabbar-collins-62ba9830/|title=Jabbar Collins|last=|first=|date=|website=Linkedin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, Collins appeared on NY1 to discuss wrongful convictions with his legal partner Rita Dave.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Leach made his Somerset debut in a two-day match against the [[South African cricket team in England in 2012|touring]] [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]] in July 2012, claiming the prized wicket of [[Hashim Amla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-south-africa-2012/content/story/571791.html |title=Duminy finds valuable form ahead of Tests |last=Moonda |first=Firdose |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=10 July 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first-class debut for Somerset in the [[2012 County Championship]] match against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in August 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Spinner-Leach-lined-Somerset-debut-Liverpool/story-16623597-detail/story.html |title=Spinner Leach is lined up for Somerset debut in Liverpool |publisher=The Bristol Post |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the rain affected match finished as a draw with Leach claiming [[Kyle Hogg]] as his maiden first-class wicket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/content/story/575419.html |title=Prince turns match on its head |last=Hodgson |first=Myles |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further opportunities in the first team were limited for the rest of the 2012 season with the signing of Pakistani spinner [[Abdur Rehman (cricketer, born 1980)|Abdur Rehman]], and Leach only featured in one further County Championship match and three matches in the [[2012 Clydesdale Bank 40]], but ended the season ninth in the national first-class averages with 12 wickets at 18.83 runs apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.somersetcountycc.co.uk/2012/09/jacks-off-to-play-grade-cricket-in-brisbane/ |title=Jack's off to play Grade Cricket in Brisbane |publisher=Somerset County Cricket Club |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leach spent the 2012–13 winter playing [[grade cricket]] for [[Valley District Cricket Club]] in [[Brisbane]], Australia, helping his side to win the T20 competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.somersetcountycc.co.uk/2013/03/jack-leach-aiming-for-championship-opener-against-durham/ |title=Jack Leach aiming for Championship opener against Durham |publisher=Somerset County Cricket Club |date=24 March 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an unusual circumstance, with 1 over left to play during [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2018–19|a Test match against Sri Lanka]] on 15 November 2018, Jack Leach opened England's innings as a [[nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]], surviving till stumps.

'''Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum''' is/was a Mexican neurophysiologist, writer and psychologist. He studied Mexican [[shamanism]], Eastern disciplines, [[meditation]], and [[telepathy]] through the [[scientific method]]. He wrote more than 50 books about these subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Jacobo Grinberg, desaparecido|last=Cherem S.|first=Silvia|date=September 18, 1995|work=Reforma|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacobo disappeared in December 1994.

== Biography == 
Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum was born in [[Mexico City]] in 1946. Grinberg decided to study the human mind when he was 12 years old, after his mother died from a stroke.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pijamasurf.com/2011/08/jacobo-grinberg-su-genial-obra-y-su-misteriosa-desaparicion/|title=Jacobo Grinberg: su genial obra y su misteriosa desaparición|last=Barros del Villar|first=Javier|date=February 8, 2011|website=Pijama Surf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[psychology]] at the Science Faculty of [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=March 10, 2010|title=Dr. Jacobo Grinberg, Investigador de la conciencia desaparecido misteriosamente|url=http://diariojudio.com/comunidad-judia-mexico/dr-jacobo-grinberg-investigador-de-la-conciencia-desaparecido-misteriosamente/15800/#|journal=Diario Judío|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, he went to [[New York City]] to study [[psychophysiology]] at the Brain Research Institute. He earned a [[Ph.D.]] at the [[E. Roy John]] Laboratory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His Ph.D. focuses on the electrophysiological effects of geometric stimuli on the human brain.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobogrinberg.com/|title=jacobo|website=jacobo|language=es|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he went back to [[Mexico]], he founded a laboratory of psychophysiology at the [[Universidad Anáhuac]]. He installed another laboratory of this kind in UNAM in the late 1970s. He founded the Instituto Nacional para el Estudio de la Conciencia (INPEC) in 1987,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; financed by UNAM and CONACYT. Jacobo published several of his books through INPEC.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Grinberg wrote more than 50 books about brain activity, [[witchcraft]], [[shamanism]], [[telepathy]], and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Jacobo tended to put his reputation as a scientist in danger when he tried to use the scientific method in shamanism studies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Attie|first=Leah Bella|date=December 17, 1995|title=No debemos olvidar|url=|journal=Reforma|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He combined the two in his professional work, always trying to understand the “magic world.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is said that while his work exhibited the scientific basis for telepathy, it was often rejected by fellow scientists. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-secret-behind-doctor-grinberg-film-mexico#/|title=THE SECRET BEHIND DOCTOR GRINBERG|website=Indiegogo|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comments by Guerzon
- you could provide information about a specific book or other research/accomplishments he's known for
- so far so good!
== Disappearance ==
Since December 8, 1994, Jacobo Grinberg has been missing. On December 12, his family prepared a party for him to celebrate his 48th birthday, but he did not show up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was common for him to make spontaneous travels or just not answer his phone for days, which is why his disappearance did not seem odd to his family in the beginning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are many conspiracies surrounding Jacobo's disappearance. It has been speculated that NASA or the CIA kidnapped him after the U.S military became interested in his research on the relationship between metaphysical worlds and humans and tried to seize his work.

&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== The Sintergy Theory ==
Grinberg's sintergy theory states that there is a continuous space of energy and the common human can only perceive a part of it. The result of this process is what everyone understand as "reality."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martínez González|first=Roberto|date=2007|title=Lo que el chamanismo nos dejó: Cien años de estudios chamánicos en México y Mesoamérica|url=|journal=Anales de Antropología|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory tries to answer the question of the creation of the experience. It is based on years of brain experiments and consciousness studies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The book where it is mentioned, "El Cerebro Consciente," was translated into seven languages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5544">'''Jakub Polák''' (1 September 1952 – 25 September 2012) was a Czech [[anarchism|anarchist]]&lt;ref&gt;Nadace M. J. Stránského, ''The New Presence'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anti-racism]] activist.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit"&gt;Czech Press Agency, Gwendolyn Albert (transl.), [http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_3632 "Czech anarchist, advocate of Romani people's rights, has passed away"], Romea.cz, Sept. 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Polák was involved particularly in [[Romani people|Roma]] rights and [[squatting|squatter]]s' rights issues.&lt;ref name="CNA-obit"&gt;Czech News Agency, [http://praguemonitor.com/2012/09/27/czech-anarchist-movement-doyen-polak-dies "Czech Anarchist Movement Doyen Polak Dies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102142505/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/09/27/czech-anarchist-movement-doyen-polak-dies |date=2012-11-02 }}, Sept. 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polák was born in [[Karlovy Vary]] and grew up in [[czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Marxist–Leninist Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="CNA-obit" /&gt; He became a dissident in his teens, when he became involved in the [[Prague Spring|Prague Spring of 1968]], and as a consequence he was not permitted to attend university.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; He took part in various dissident and underground movement activities.&lt;ref name="CNA-obit" /&gt; He was a co-founder of the 1989 [[Strike action|strike]] committee that led to the [[Velvet Revolution]].&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; He was also involved with the Czech branch of the [[Movement for Civil Society]].&lt;ref name="roth"&gt;Stephen Roth Institute, ''Antisemitism Worldwide 2000/1'', University of Nebraska Press, 2002, p.186, citing ''Prague Post'', April 25-May 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]], Polák openly founded numerous [[anarchism|anarchist]] organizations and publications.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; He joined the "Levá alternativa" ("LA"; transl. "Left Alternative"), eventually becoming a member of its anarchist wing.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; The group split, with the anarchist LA becoming the Československé anarchistické sdružení (ČAS; transl. Czechoslovak Anarchist Association).&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt;  In 1991, Polák and others from ČAS founded the ''[[A-Kontra]]'' magazine, which became the central organ of the Czech anarchist movement in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; Polák remained involved with ''A-Kontra'' until his death, working as editor-in-chief with the magazine.&lt;ref name="CNA-obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roth" /&gt;

Polák was involved in numerous anti-racist organizations and activities.  He worked as "attorney-in-fact" with numerous victims of racist and neo-Nazi attacks, including in the case of [[Tibor Danihel]], a victim of a 1993 attack by [[White power skinhead|racist skinheads]] in [[Písek]], [[South Bohemian Region|South Bohemia]],&lt;ref name="CNA-obit" /&gt; which he eventually brought to the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Czech Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; Polák was also instrumental in the cases of the 1994 murder of  Zdeněk Čepela in [[Tanvald]]; the 1998 murder of Milan Lacek in [[Orlová]]; a 1998 racist skinhead campaign in [[České Budějovice]]; the 2001 murder of Ota Absolon in [[Svitavy]]; and a 2010 attack by neo-Nazis in [[Benešov]].&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt;  He also served as an editor of various Romani publications, including the ''Romano gendalos'' (transl. "Romani Mirror") between 1993 and 1995, and with a news server [[Romea.cz]] until the end of his life.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; Polák was himself attacked in August, 1999, in a restaurant in [[Karviná|Karvina]], where he was meeting government minister [[Jana Chalupova]] regarding a 1998 skinhead murder of a Romani.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of State, [http://www.asylumlaw.org/docs/showDocument.cfm?documentID=31 "1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Czech Republic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613144120/http://asylumlaw.org/docs/showDocument.cfm?documentID=31 |date=2010-06-13 }} (Feb. 25, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Polák was active in housing and [[squatting|squatter]]s rights movements throughout his life.&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; In 1990, he co-founded a squat on Pplk. Sochora street in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="CPA-obit" /&gt; He remained active in squatters' rights movements throughout the rest of his life.  Even in the last months of his life, while ill with cancer, Polák worked with [[Romani people|Roma]] people in a case&lt;ref name="CNA-obit" /&gt; involving their eviction and relocation from their home in [[Přednádraží]], a neighborhood (sometimes described as a [[ghetto]] or [[shanty town|shantytown]]) in [[Přívoz|Ostrava-Privoz]].&lt;ref name="romaevict"&gt;Czech News Agency, [http://praguemonitor.com/2012/08/06/roma-refuse-leave-their-ostrava-homes "Roma refuse to leave their Ostrava homes"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130201162636/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/08/06/roma-refuse-leave-their-ostrava-homes |date=2013-02-01 }}, Aug. 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Grossman Stern''' and '''Michael Stern''' (both born 1946) are American writers who specialize in books about travel, food, and popular culture. They are best known for their ''[[Roadfood]]'' books, website, and magazine columns, in which they find [[road food]] restaurants serving classic American regional specialties and review them. Starting their hunt for regional American food in the early 1970s they were the first food writers to regard this food as being as worthy to report on as the [[haute cuisine]] of other nations. 

Since the Sterns began documenting regional American food in the 1970s many other writers and television personalities have used their pioneering work as inspiration. In addition to their early work with regional American food the Sterns' book ''Square Meals'' (Knopf 1985) put "[[comfort food]]s" like mac and cheese, meatloaf, and mashed potatoes on the culinary map. ''Square Meals'' did an audacious reverse spin on the tricked up and precious nouvelle cuisine that was beloved by food critics at that time.     

Jane Grossman grew up in [[New York City]], where she attended the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden School]] and received a BFA in graphic design at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Michael Stern grew up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968. They met as graduate students in art at [[Yale University]] and their first date, at [[Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana|Pepe's Pizza]] in New Haven, had a food focus.&lt;ref name=Ephron&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple married in 1970. The following year, Jane earned an MFA in painting from Yale and Michael changed schools and earned an MFA from [[Columbia University]] in film. Neither found work in their fields of study.

After a short stint of producing documentaries for WNBC, a teaching job at [[Hunter College]] and another at [[Wesleyan University]] they began work on the book that eventually became the first ''Roadfood''. The book was conceived as a book on "truck-stop dining," funded with an advance from a publisher. The Sterns set out in their car to travel through the United States and eat up to 12 meals daily at diners and local cafes.&lt;ref name=Ephron/&gt; The resulting first edition of ''Roadfood'' was published in 1977; the most recent edition was released in 2017.

In addition to their food writing, the Sterns have written books on American popular culture, including [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' bestselling]] ''Elvis World'' (1987) and ''The Encyclopaedia of Bad Taste'' (1990). In all, they have written over 30 books. They were staff writers for ''[[Gourmet (magazine)|Gourmet]]'' magazine for 18 years, have written for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', and are now contributing editors at ''[[Saveur]]''. 

They are regular guests on [[American Public Media]]'s public radio program, ''[[The Splendid Table]]''. They have won numerous awards, including [[James Beard award]]s, and were inducted into [[James Beard Foundation Award#Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America|Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamesbeard.org/index.php?q=james_beard_awards_whos_who Who’s Who of Food &amp; Beverage in America], the James Beard Foundation website, accessed September 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterns founded Roadfood.com; the site was sold to Fexy Media in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Gordinier| first = Jeff| title = Serious Eats and Roadfood Are Sold to Fexy Media| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2017-11-13| date = 2015-06-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/dining/serious-eats-roadfood-websites-sold-to-fexy-media.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, the Sterns remained in charge of editorial content of their website.&lt;ref name="eater-2015jun02"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.eater.com/2015/6/2/8704397/serious-eats-roadfood-seattle-fexy-media |title=Serious Eats Is Acquired by Seattle-Based Fexy Media: Roadfood has also been sold to Fexy Media. |website=Eater |date=June 2, 2015 |first=Daniela |last=Galarza}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Jane Stern published ''Ambulance Girl: How I Saved Myself by Becoming an EMT'', a memoir in which she described suffering from severe [[clinical depression]] when she was in her early 50s and overcame her depression by training and working as an [[emergency medical technician]] in Connecticut. In 2005 the book was made into a [[television movie]], ''[[Ambulance Girl]]'', for which actress [[Kathy Bates]] was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. The Sterns wrote a joint memoir, ''Two for the Road: Our Love Affair With American Food'', in 2006. 

The couple divorced in 2008; they still write as a team.&lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

In 2011 the former couple published ''The Lexicon of Real American Food'', and Jane Stern published a book on her little known but long-standing career as a [[tarot card reader]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nanci G.

'''James Calderwood''' (born 28 February 1955) is a Scottish former [[association football|football]] player and [[manager (association football)|manager]]. Calderwood played for [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] clubs [[Sparta Rotterdam]], [[Willem II Tilburg]], [[Roda JC]] and [[Heracles Almelo]]. After retiring as a player, Calderwood stayed in the Netherlands and became a coach, becoming a manager of [[Willem II Tilburg]] and [[NEC Nijmegen]].

He returned to his native Scotland in 1999 to become manager of [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]], guiding them to the [[2004 Scottish Cup Final]]. Calderwood left Dunfermline that summer to become manager of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], a position he held for five seasons. Aberdeen performed relatively well in the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] under Calderwood and reached the last 32 of the [[2007–08 UEFA Cup]], but suffered a number of domestic cup defeats by lower league opponents. He then had brief stints with [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]], helping each club retain their league status. Calderwood returned to the Netherlands in March 2012, with [[Go Ahead Eagles]].

In January 2014, Calderwood spent just under a month as manager of [[De Graafschap]] before resigning. Calderwood cited the sale of several of De Graafschap's key players without adequate replacement as the reason for his resignation from the post. In July 2016, Calderwood was appointed to the board of directors at [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/news/article/calderwood-joins-cowdenbeath-board/ |title=Calderwood joins Cowdenbeath board |work= |publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |date=15 July 2016 |accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Calderwood revealed that he has been battling earlier-onset dementia for the past two years and is being treated for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40949594 |title=Jimmy Calderwood: Former Aberdeen &amp; Dunfermline boss has Alzheimer's |work= |publisher=BBC Sport Scotland |date=16 August 2017 |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
Born in [[Govan]], [[Glasgow]], Calderwood was raised in the [[Castlemilk]] housing scheme in the city where he attended Grange Secondary School; he played in youth teams with [[Ricky Sbragia]] who also became a footballer and later a manager,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/sunderland_warming_to_humble_scot_sbragia_1_1152968|title=Sunderland warming to humble Scot Sbragia|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rsjc10&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/ricky-sbragia-would-be-a-great-choice-1079180|title=Ricky Sbragia would be a great choice as the new Motherwell boss, says pal Jimmy Calderwood|newspaper=Daily Record|date=26 December 2010|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also played at schoolboy level with future Scotland captain [[Willie Miller]].&lt;ref name="don"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Willie|title=Willie Miller - The Don|year=2013|publisher=[[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]]|isbn=9780857905505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his professional career with [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as an apprentice in 1971, making his first team debut against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1972 &lt;ref name = "scotsman"&gt;[http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Jimmy-Calderwood-confirmed-as-Kilmarnock.5984473.jp Jimmy Calderwood confirmed as Kilmarnock manager], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 14 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; (Sbragia joined him a year later).&lt;ref name=rsjc10/&gt; He made 159 appearances for the club before spending a short time on loan at [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] in 1979. His contract with Birmingham was cancelled at the end of the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Managerial career==

=== Netherlands ===
Calderwood first became a coach in 1991, of amateur club [[Rietvogels of Almelo]].&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; A year later he became an assistant coach of professional club [[FC Zwolle]],&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; before moving in 1993 to [[Cambuur Leeuwarden]].&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; He returned to [[Willem II Tilburg]] in 1995, initially as assistant coach before becoming the manager of the club a year later.&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; A year later, he moving to the managerial position at [[NEC Nijmegen]].&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt;

=== Dunfermline ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
After a two-year spell with NEC, [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] side [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] moved to make him their new manager. Calderwood spent five seasons at [[East End Park]], where he led the club to promotion to the SPL in his [[1999–2000 Scottish First Division|first season]] in charge.&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; He also led them to their highest ever SPL position, finishing fourth in [[2003–04 in Scottish football|2003–04]]. That season the side also reached the [[2004 Scottish Cup Final]],&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; guaranteeing their return to European competition&lt;ref name = "scotsman"/&gt; for the first time in 35 years as opponents [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] had already earned [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] qualification.

=== Aberdeen ===
In the summer of 2004 [[Willie Miller]], returning to [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]] as director of football, brought Calderwood to [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] to replace [[Steve Paterson]] as manager.&lt;ref name="Move to Aberdeen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aberdeen/3745299.stm|publisher=BBC Sport website|title=Calderwood agrees Dons move|date=28 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calderwood oversaw an improvement in Aberdeen's fortunes on the playing field. They narrowly missed out on qualifying for European competition in [[2004–05 in Scottish football|2004–05]] and [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]] but finished the [[2006–07 in Scottish football|2006–07]] league campaign in third place, ensuring [[UEFA Cup]] qualification. However, there was humiliation for his team when they were eliminated from the [[2006–07 Scottish League Cup]] by the amateur club [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/5271286.stm|title=Queen's Pk 0-0 Aberdeen (5-3 pen)  |work=BBC Sport |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afcheritage.org/matches/fixtures/mreport.cfm?fixture_id=4809&amp;Season=2006-07|title=Dons spot of bother ends in humiliation |work=AFC Heritage trust|date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Calderwood led Aberdeen to the last 32 of European competition for the first time since 1986 with a surprising 4–0 demolition of [[FC Copenhagen]] at Pittodrie. With this great achievement, the Dons were rewarded by drawing [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Calderwood's team drew 2–2 with Bayern at Pittodrie on 14 February 2008, but the Germans pulled off a convincing 5–1 win the following week. Calderwood signed a {{frac|3|1|2}}-year contract to end a month of speculation about his future, along with assistant manager [[Jimmy Nicholl]] and coach [[Sandy Clark]].

Calderwood took Aberdeen to the [[2007–08 Scottish Cup]] semi final, where they lost 4–3 to [[Dumfries]] First Division side, [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. This was despite two goals and an assist from [[Barry Nicholson]] playing against his hometown club.

The [[2008–09 in Scottish football|2008–09 season]] saw Calderwood come in for some stern criticism following the club's poor start to the campaign. The Dons failed to win any of their opening four home matches, and were beaten 4–2 by Kilmarnock in the League Cup. Fans became impatient with some claiming it was time for a fresh start just as the team recovered form and were in the race for third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sundayherald.com/sport/shfootball/display.var.2453843.0.0.php?act=complaint&amp;cid=1922682 |title=See you, Jimmy... |newspaper=Sunday Herald |date=27 September 2008 |accessdate=5 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806135511/http://www.heraldscotland.com/see-you-jimmy-1.833460 |archivedate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 January 2009 Calderwood led Aberdeen to a memorable 4–2 victory over Celtic that propelled Aberdeen to third in the league. However, just three league wins followed in the next 16 and Calderwood left the club "by mutual consent" on 24 May 2009, after the team had qualified for a place in the [[UEFA Europa League]] with a 2–1 victory over Hibernian.&lt;ref name="Dons part with manager Calderwood"&gt;{{cite news| title = Dons part with manager Calderwood| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aberdeen/8066189.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 2009-05-24| accessdate = 2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate is best known for his roles as Peter Waters in ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' and as O-Dog in the 1993 [[teen film|teen]] [[hood film|hood drama film]], ''[[Menace II Society]]''. Tate's other films include ''[[Dead Presidents]]'', ''[[Love Jones (film)|Love Jones]]'', ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'', ''[[A Man Apart]]'', ''[[Waist Deep]]'', ''[[Biker Boyz]]'', and ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]''.

==Early life==
Larenz Tate was born on Chicago, Illinois' [[West Side, Chicago|west side]], in a middle-class suburb, to Peggy and Larry Tate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/36/Larenz-Tate.html|title=Larenz Tate profile|website=Filmreference.com|date=1975-09-08|accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate is the youngest of three siblings (his two brothers, Larron and Lahmard, are also actors) whose family moved to [[California]] when he was 4 years old. Convinced by their parents to enter a drama program at the Inner City Cultural Center, the trio did not take the lessons seriously until classmate [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]'s ascent to fame after being cast on the sitcom ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. Subsequently, realizing that they could parlay their efforts into a tangible form of success, the siblings began to receive small roles and in 1985, Tate made his small-screen debut in an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The New Twilight Zone]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Tate attended [[Palmdale High School]], graduating in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phsfalcons.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=289292&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=698628|title=Hall of Fame - Alumni - Palmdale High School|website=Phsfalcons.org|accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following appearances in such television series as ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', Tate was cast in the television movie ''[[The Women of Brewster Place (miniseries)|The Women of Brewster Place]]'' before receiving the recurring role of Steve Urkel's nemesis, Willie Fuffner, in the family comedy series ''[[Family Matters]]'' (1989). He was also a cast member on the [[CBS]] series ''[[The Royal Family (TV series)|The Royal Family]]'', starring [[Redd Foxx]] and [[Della Reese]], which ended prematurely after Redd Foxx died. In the video game ''[[187 Ride or Die]]'', Tate voices the main character, Buck.

Following numerous small-screen roles,  offers began pouring in for Tate, and in late 1992, collaborative filmmaking siblings [[Hughes brothers|Albert and Allen Hughes]] approached him to star in their debut feature ''[[Menace II Society]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The film found Tate channeling his substantial energy into creating "O-Dog", a trigger-happy teenager. Following up with the little-seen but often-praised television series ''[[South Central (TV series)|South Central]]'', Tate would later appear in the family comedy-drama ''[[The Inkwell]]'' (1994) before re-teaming with the Hughes brothers for ''[[Dead Presidents]]'' (1995) and taking on the role of a love-stricken young poet in the romantic drama ''[[Love Jones (film)|Love Jones]]'' (1997). Larenz Tate also played the role of Kenny in ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' in the episode "That's No Lady, That's My Cousin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0583036/reference| title= ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' (TV series): That's No Lady, That's My Cousin| website=IMDb.com| access-date= April 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There followed roles in ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' (as the automotively monikered Ford Lincoln Mercury), the [[Frankie Lymon]] biopic ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' (1998, with Tate as Lymon), and 2000's ''Love Come Down''. Though a big theatrical release had eluded Tate for the first few years of the millennial turnover, Tate would soon turn up opposite [[Laurence Fishburne]] in the high-octane but critically derided ''[[Biker Boyz]]'' (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/biker_boyz/ |title= Biker Boyz |website=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Man Apart]]'' (2003), ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), as music legend [[Quincy Jones]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004), and ''[[Waist Deep]]'' (2006). Larenz was also featured in [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] singer [[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]]'s 2003 released music video ''[[Rain on Me]]'', where he played the jealous, abusive spouse of Ashanti. The video touched on the subject of domestic abuse. He also starred as part of the main cast in season's 4-7 of [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' as Bart "Black Shawn" Johnston.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

'''Lazarus Colloredo''' and '''Joannes Baptista Colloredo''' (1617 – after 1646) were [[Italy|Italian]] [[conjoined twins]] who toured in 17th-century Europe. They were born in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]].

The upper body and left leg of Joannes Baptista (named after [[John the Baptist]]) stuck out of his mobile brother Lazarus. He did not speak and kept his eyes closed and mouth open all the time and was a [[parasitic twin]]. According to a later account by [[Copenhagen]] anatomist [[Thomas Bartholinus]], if someone pushed the breast of Joannes Baptista, he moved his hands, ears and lips.

To make a living, Lazarus toured around Europe and visited at least [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] and Copenhagen, [[Denmark]] before he arrived in [[Scotland]] in 1642 and later visited the court of [[Charles I of England]].

They also visited [[Gdańsk]], [[Turkey]] and [[Denmark]], and toured [[Germany]] and Italy in 1646.&lt;ref&gt;Bondeson, Jan. (2000) ''The Two-Headed Boy, and Other Medical Marvels'' {{ISBN|978-0-8014-3767-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary accounts described Lazarus as courteous and handsome but for his brother who just dangled before him. When Lazarus was not exhibiting himself, he covered his brother with his [[cloak]] to avoid unnecessary attention.

Later accounts claim that Lazarus married and sired several children, none with his condition. His engraved portrait depicts him in a costume of a [[courtier]] of the period of the [[House of Stuart]].

The brothers' exact date of death is unknown.

The first [[Coin collecting|coin collector]] is said to have been [[Augustus]]. During the [[Renaissance]], it became a [[fad]] among some members of the privileged classes, especially kings and queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brief History of Coin Collecting |url=http://www.2-clicks-coins.com/article/coin-collecting-history.html |work=www.2-clicks-coins.com|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coin collector is different from a [[numismatist]], which is someone who studies coins. Many collectors are also numismatists, but some are not. Likewise, not all numismatists collect coins themselves.

'''Mabel Digby, Lady of Dromana and Decies''' (dates of birth and death unknown) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] noblewoman being the eldest daughter of [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] and [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly|Lettice FitzGerald, 1st Baroness Offaly]]. She was the wife of Sir Gerald FitzGerald, Lord of Dromana and Decies. In 1642, during an Irish rebellion, she was openly sympathetic to the Irish and entertained them at Dromana Castle. She later handed the castle over to them.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, Villiers-Stuart papers, p.6, retrieved 22-12-09&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==

Mabel was born on an unknown date sometime after 1598 in Coleshill, [[Warwickshire]], England, the eldest daughter and one of the ten children of [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] and Lettice FitzGerald, ''suo jure'' 1st Baroness Offaly. Her eldest brother was [[Robert Digby, 1st Baron Digby]], and another brother was Essex Digby, [[Bishop of Dromore]].

== Marriages and issue ==
She married her first husband Sir Gerald FitzGerald, Lord of Dromana and Decies on an unknown date. He was the son and heir of Sir John Og FitzGerald, Lord of Dromana and Decies, and Elinor Butler. She was described as having been "suitably English and [[Protestant]]".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Walton, ''Dromana: Lords of Decies and Villiers-Stuarts'', p.6, retrieved 22-12-09&lt;/ref&gt; She was said to have dominated Sir Gerald.&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office of Northern Ireland&lt;/ref&gt; They made their principal residence at Dromana Castle, County Waterford, and together had three children:
* Sir John FitzGerald, Lord of Dromana and Decies (died 1 March 1664), married firstly Katherine Le Poer, by whom he had his only daughter and heiress [[Katherine FitzGerald, Viscountess Grandison]]; he married secondly, Helen McCarthy
* Lettice FitzGerald, married [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] Major Richard Franklyn of Coolbach
* Daughter whose name is unknown, married Thomas Walsh of Piltown, Co. Waterford

Upon the death of her husband on 6 August 1643, Mabel married secondly Donagh O'Brien of Arragh.

== Rebellion of 1641 ==
On 23 October 1641, a major Irish rebellion broke out in [[Ulster]], and by December had spread to [[County Waterford]]. (See main article: [[Irish rebellion of 1641]]).

Although her husband sided with the English, Mabel showed herself sympathetic to the Irish rebels and in 1642 entertained them at Dromana Castle serving them "beefes, muttons, bread and beere".&lt;ref&gt;Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-September 1642, she handed the castle over to them; however, it was shortly afterward besieged and captured by the English.

== Death ==

Mabel died on an unknown date at Dromana. Her granddaughter, Katherine, inherited the entire Dromana estate upon the death of Mabel's only son in 1664. The FitzGeralds had managed to keep their estates intact during the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] settlements due to their Protestant religion and the influence of Mabel's Parliamentarian son-in-law Richard Franklyn, who served as a major in Oliver Cromwell's army.

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Michael''' (in Polish: '''Michał''') '''Sopoćko''' ({{IPAc-pl|mʲ|i|ˈ|h|a|ł|-|ˈ|s|o|p|o|ć|k|o}}; November 1, 1888 &amp;ndash; February 15, 1975) was a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and professor at [[Vilnius University]].{{sfn|Odell, pp. 84-85}} He is best known as the spiritual director of Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]].

==Life==
He was born in 1888 in Juszewszczyzna (also known as Nowosady) near [[Valozhyn]] in present-day [[Belarus]].&lt;ref name=Calloway /&gt;&lt;ref name=VaticanBio &gt;[http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/2008/ns_lit_doc_20080928_sopocko_en.html Vatican biography of Michał Sopoćko]&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[Vilnius Priest Seminary]] in 1910 and was ordained in 1914. He was a priest in Vilnius (1914–1918), then a chaplain in the army in Warsaw and Vilnius during [[World War I]]. After obtaining his doctorate in theology in 1926 he became the spiritual director at the seminary in Vilnius. and 1928 professor of pastoral theology at [[Stefan Batory University]] in Vilnius.

==Divine Mercy==
[[File:Lomza Holycross fc03.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Paintings of Faustina and Sopoćko in [[Łomża]]]]
Father Sopoćko was very supportive of the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion of Faustina Kowalska and in her diary (Notebook V, item 1238) she stated: "This priest is a great soul, entirely filled with God." Since 1931 Faustina had been trying (without success) to find someone to paint the ''[[Divine Mercy image]]'' until Sopoćko became her confessor in the middle of 1933. By January 1934 Sopocko arranged for the artist [[Eugeniusz Kazimirowski]] (who was also a professor at the university) to paint the image.{{sfn|Torretto, pp. 84-107}}&lt;ref&gt;Odell, Catherine M. ''Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy''. OSV Press, 1998 ({{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}}), 85-95&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday April 26, 1935 Sopoćko delivered the first sermon ever on the Divine Mercy - and Faustina attended the sermon.{{sfn|Torretto,  p. 16}} The first Mass during which the [[Divine Mercy image]] was displayed was on April 28, 1935, the [[Divine Mercy Sunday]] (the first after Easter). Sopoćko managed to obtain permission to place the [[Divine Mercy image]] within the [[Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]] as he celebrated the Mass that Sunday.{{sfn|Torretto,  p. 16}}{{sfn|Odell, pp. 102-103}}

In the summer of 1936 Sopoćko wrote the first brochure on the [[Divine Mercy]] devotion and
obtained the [[imprimatur]] of [[Romuald Jałbrzykowski|Archbishop Jałbrzykowski]] for it. The brochure carried the Divine Mercy image on the cover.{{sfn|Odell, p. 119}}

Faustina used to regard him as a saint: ''This priest is a great soul who is completely filled with God'' (''Diary'' 1238). ''Thanks to his effort a new light will shine in God's Church for the salvation of souls. […] I have not met such faithfulness to God as this soul features'' (1390). ''This soul, so humble, was able to withstand all storms and has not get discouraged with obstacles, but answered faithfully to God's call'' (1586).

Jesus used to have similar opinion: ''This is a priest according to My heart; his efforts are pleasant to Me. […] Through him I disseminate consolations for suffering, worried souls; through him I have been well pleased to proclaim the worship to My mercy'' (1256). ''His thought is closely connected with My thought, so be calm about My work; I will not allow him to mistake, and you, do not do anything without his permission'' (1408).

==[[Congregation of Sisters of Merciful Jesus]]==
In 1942, during [[World War II]] Sopoćko and other professors and students had to go into hiding near Vilnius for about two years. However, he used this time to establish a new religious congregation based on the [[Divine Mercy]] messages reported by [[Faustina Kowalska]].&lt;ref name=VaticanBio /&gt; After the War, Sopoćko wrote the constitution for the congregation and helped the formation of what is now [[Zgromadzenie Sióstr Jezusa Miłosiernego]].&lt;ref name=VaticanBio /&gt;

In an entry in [[Diary: Divine Mercy in My Soul|her diary]] on February 8, 1935, (Notebook I, item 378) Faustina had written that the Divine Mercy devotion would be suppressed for some time after her death, but would be accepted again, although Sopoćko would suffer for it.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Drake, 2002, ''Saints of the Jubilee'', {{ISBN|978-1-4033-1009-5}}, pp. 85-95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Odell153 &gt;Catherine M. Odell, 1998, ''Faustina: Apostle of Divine Mercy'', OSV Press, {{ISBN|978-0-87973-923-2}}, pp. 153-160&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 the Vatican forbade the Divine Mercy devotion and censured Sopoćko.&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthology of Christian mysticism'' by Harvey D. Egan, 1991, {{ISBN|0-8146-6012-6}}, pp. 563-565&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1965 [[Karol Wojtyła]], then Archbishop of Kraków and later Pope John Paul II opened a new investigation and submitted documents in 1968, which resulted in the reversal of the ban in 1978.&lt;ref name=Odell153 /&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], when the boundaries of Poland changed so much, Sopoćko left Vilnius. Until 1962 he has been a professor of pastoral theology at the [[seminary]] in [[Białystok]]. That time he wrote a book ''Miłosierdzie Boga w dziełach Jego'' (''Mercy of God in His works'') in four volumes. He died on February 15, 1975 in [[Białystok]], [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], and was buried there. In 1988 his remains were transferred to the Church of Divine Mercy in [[Osiedle Białostoczek, Białystok|Białostoczek]].

==Quote==
&lt;blockquote&gt;The decisive factor in obtaining God’s Mercy is trust. Trust is the expectation of someone’s help. It does not constitute a separate virtue, but is an essential condition of the virtue of hope, and an integral part of the virtues of fortitude and generosity. Because trust springs from faith, it strengthens hope and love, and is, moreover, linked up, in one way or another, with the moral virtues. It may, therefore, be called the basis on which the theological virtues unite with the moral. The moral virtues, originally natural, become supernatural if we practice them with trust in God’s help.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/catholicchaplaincy/divinemercy/miracles/ Sopocko, Michael, "Trust in God", Catholic Chaplaincy, University of Glasgow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Veneration==
His case for [[beatification]] was started at the Vatican in 1987.{{sfn|Odell, pp. 84-85}} In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]] issued a decree on the virtues of Father Sopoćko.&lt;ref name=Calloway &gt;''Purest of All Lilies: The Virgin Mary in the Spirituality of St. Faustina'' by Donald H. Calloway, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-59614-195-7}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] approved of a miracle through his intercession. His solemn beatification took place on Sunday September 28, 2008 at the Sanctuary of Divine Mercy in Białystok.

'''Mithilesh Kumar Srivastava''', better known as '''Natwarlal''' (1912–2009),&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=nan/&gt; was a noted [[India]]n [[Confidence trick|con man]] known for having repeatedly "sold" the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Red Fort]], and the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]] and also the [[Sansad Bhavan|Parliament House of India]] along with its sitting members.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=zn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applied Psychology: India Specific and Cross-cultural Perspectives By Smarak Swain|pages=22|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VA9TaE2V0eMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=natwarlal+shrivastav#v=onepage&amp;q=natwarlal%20shrivastav&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier life==
He was born in village in siwan, by profession he was a lawyer before he became a [[con man]].&lt;ref name=nan&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuts about Natwarlal|url=http://www.timescrest.com/opinion/nuts-about-natwarlal-5243|accessdate=3 August 2018|newspaper=The Times of India|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modus operandi==
He duped hundreds of people of [[crore]]s of rupees and used more than 50 aliases to disguise himself.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; He was a master of disguises and used novel ideas to cheat people. He was also a master in forging signatures of famous personalities.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=nan/&gt; He is also said to have cheated a number of industrialists including the [[Tata family|Tatas]], the [[Birla family|Birlas]] and also [[Dhirubhai Ambani]]&lt;ref name=cl/&gt; taking from them huge sums of money in cash, posing as a social worker or needy person.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;[[Chitralekha (weekly)|Chitralekha]], Feb 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He also duped many shop-owners of [[lakh]]s of rupees, paying them by [[cheque]] and [[demand draft]]s, which were later found to be forged.&lt;ref name=nan/&gt;&lt;ref name=cl/&gt;

Natwarlal was wanted  in more than 100 cases and by the police of 8 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Famous Fugitives|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/41442/|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[Indian Express]]|date=20 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natwarlal was arrested nine times but every time he was able to break out of jail and escape. He was convicted for 14 cases of forgery and was sentenced for 113 years, but he hardly spent 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Madhavan |first=Deepu |url=http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-man-who-sold-the-taj-mahal-thrice-247513.html |title=10 Things You Need To Know About The Man Who Sold The Taj Mahal. Thrice!!! |work=[[India Times]] |date=2015-11-19 |accessdate=2016-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The last time he was arrested was in 1996 and was 84 years old at that time. But he managed again to give the police the slip and was last seen by authorities on June 24, 1996; when the wheelchair-using octogenarian vanished while being transported from prison to a hospital for treatment. He disappeared at [[New Delhi]] railway station, when he was being taken to [[AIIMS]], under police escort from [[Kanpur]] jail for his treatment,&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=nan/&gt; after which he was never seen again.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;&lt;ref name=nan/&gt;

==Death and mystery==
In 2009, his lawyer requested that more than 100 charges pending against Natwarlal be dropped claiming that Natwarlal died on Saturday July 25, 2009. However, Natwarlal's brother, Ganga Prasad Srivastava, subsequently claimed to have [[cremated]] him in 1996 at [[Ranchi]].&lt;ref name=ht&gt;{{cite news|title=Natwarlal leaves ’em guessing even in death|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/natwarlal-leaves-em-guessing-even-in-death/story-mYkqbv8grOOw0oFEsIryrJ.html|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zn/&gt; So the actual time and year of death is yet uncertain. In the finest Natwarlal fashion, he “died” twice, 13 years apart, living up to his legend. 

He had 2 wives. He is survived by one daughter, who lives in Ranchi and is married to a soldier.&lt;ref name=nan/&gt; His younger brother, Ganga Prasad Shrivastav lives in [[Gopalganj (Bihar)|Gopalganj]].&lt;ref name=nan/&gt;

==In popular culture==
His exploits are often compared with [[Frank Abagnale]]&lt;ref name=toi&gt;{{cite news|title=Gotcha|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-04-01/special-report/27868558_1_max-domarus-hitler-s-speeches-adolf-hitler|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Lustig]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitara.com/discover/5wh/online.asp?story=74 Who Sold the Eiffel Tower Twice?]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jurm'' is a popular weekly crime based television programme aired by [[Aaj Tak]], based on episodes of his life and a story that was broadcast in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aaj Tak bids to unravel mystery of conman Natwarlal|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/tube/y2k4/apr/aprtube10.htm|accessdate=3 August 2012|newspaper=Indiantelevision.com|date=3 April 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103032057/http://www.indiantelevision.com/tube/y2k4/apr/aprtube10.htm#|archive-date=2013-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monument==
The people of his native village Bangra in Bihar take pride in the fact that he belonged to their village and have decided to put up a statue of him as his monument, at the place where his house once stood.&lt;ref name=nan/&gt;

While his house is said to have been demolished by the British, the land still belongs to the family.&lt;ref name=nan/&gt;

[[File:OlavScheflo.JPG|thumb|upright|Scheflo]]
'''Olav Andreas Scheflo''' (9 September 1883 - 25 June 1943) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Communist]] politician and journalist. 

Olav Scheflo was a member of the [[Norwegian Labour Party]] from 1905. After the [[October Revolution]] he fought hard to convince the Labor Party to join the [[Communist International]] and Scheflo was a Norwegian representative at the second congress of the Comintern in 1920 and was member of the Comintern Executive Committee from 1921 to 1927. Critical towards [[Stalinism]], he left the [[Norwegian Communist Party]] in 1928 and rejoined the Labor Party in 1929. 

When [[Sweden]]'s Communist leader, [[Zeth Höglund]] was offered to be made honorable corporal in the [[Red Army]] in 1918 but declined, the offer instead went to Scheflo, who gladly accepted the position. 

When [[Leon Trotsky]] lived in exile in Norway in 1935 and 1936, Scheflo strongly defended him against attacks from both Stalinist and the Norwegian bourgeoisie. However, he would never become a real [[Trotskyist]]s since he was closer to the Soviet [[Right Opposition]].

Scheflo's autobiography is ''Den røde tråd i Norges historie'' (''The Red Thread in Norwegian History'').

==Creation and development==
The concept and name of the character was announced on 8 April 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a640328/hollyoaks-announces-child-sex-abuse-storyline-for-mcqueen-family.html#~p9haNoeOS0B8fK|title=Hollyoaks announces child sex abuse storyline for McQueen family|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=8 April 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while additional details such as casting was announced on 10 April 2015.

Pete is portrayed as "charming and deceptive" as well as "a nice guy" and as such he was able to convince Reenie that Porsche propositioned him at the time of the event.

===Sexual abuse storyline===
It was announced in April 2015 that the McQueen family were going to be centre to a sexual abuse storyline. ''Hollyoaks'' were working with the [[NSPCC]] with the storyline. The NSPCC said "We've teamed-up with ''Hollyoaks'' to highlight the most common form of child sexual abuse with the aim of assisting young victims to find help and support"&lt;ref name=NSPCC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nspcc.org.uk/fighting-for-childhood/news-opinion/child-sexual-abuse-within-family-latest-hollyoaks-storyline/|title=Child sexual abuse within the family features in latest Hollyoaks storyline|work=[[NSPCC]]|date=8 April 2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early October 2015, it was announced that Pete would face a trial for sexually abusing the McQueen girls.&lt;ref name=trial&gt;{{cite web|first=Duncan|last=Lindsay|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/10/02/hollyoaks-spoilers-paedophile-pete-buchanan-for-child-sex-abuse-trial-5418506/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Paedophile Pete Buchanan for child sex abuse trial|work=Metro|date=2 October 2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2015, it was announced that Pete would have Cleo go and hide a key to a lock up that has photos of him and her but she will find out there is also photos of [[Jade Albright]] (Kassius Nelson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sophie|last=Dainty|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/hollyoaks/news/a775506/hollyoaks-spoilers-cleo-mcqueen-to-realise-the-truth-about-pete-after-reenie-is-arrested/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Cleo McQueen will realise the truth about Pete after Reenie is arrested|publisher=Digital Spy|date=27 November 2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Porsche tells Phoebe about how her mother, [[Reenie McQueen|Reenie]] ([[Zöe Lucker]]), was always better when Pete was around, but one night after Reenie came home drunk, Pete sexually assaulted her. It can also be noted that Reenie didn't believe Porsche when she was told about Pete's inappropriate behavior. On the day of [[Phoebe McQueen]]'s (Mandip Gill) funeral, it was revealed that Pete had been molesting Cleo for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Duncan|last=Lindsay|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/08/13/hollyoaks-spoilers-paedophile-storyline-involving-pete-buchanan-to-end-in-the-right-way-5340655/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: Paedophile storyline involving Pete Buchanan to 'end in the right way'|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=13 August 2015|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete makes his first appearance on 2 June. Porsche emotionally reveals to her family that when she was 15, Pete sexually abused her. Pete claims that Porsche kissed him, but that he rebuffed her advances. Subsequently, nobody believes that Porsche was abused. Pete begins to sexually abuse and groom Porsche's younger sister Cleo after his arrival; although it is implied that he has been doing so for some time before this. When Cleo refuses to continue her "relationship" with him, Pete leaves Reenie, knowing that this will cause Reenie's drinking to spiral out of control. Subsequently, Cleo begs for him to return and he does so on the understanding that she will go along with what he wants. Upon his return he proposes to Reenie, but privately tells Cleo that this is so he can be closer to Cleo. Pete grows extremely jealous of Cleo's relationship with her boyfriend, Harry, even persuading [[Jack Osborne]] ([[Jimmy McKenna]]) to rethink his decision of letting Cleo work for him during the summer. To prevent Cleo from going to see Harry, Pete has sex with Cleo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a640816/hollyoaks-casts-torchwood-star-kai-owen-as-abuser-pete.html#~p9rknHkj6K0bnz|title=Hollyoaks casts Torchwood star Kai Owen as abuser Pete|date=10 April 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point Pete doesn't use a [[condom]] when having sex with Cleo and she has to go to the sexual health clinic, which infuriates Porsche, Cleo lies and says she slept with Harry. Later that evening, Reenie and Pete buy Cleo [[birth control]] pills.

Weeks later, Pete meets [[Jade Albright]] (Kassius Nelson), who is being fostered by the Osborne family, Pete helps Jade with her schoolwork and gives her a phone so he can start grooming her. Cleo later notices how Pete is acting with Jade and threatens to expose their relationship to Reenie. On the week of Pete and Reenie's wedding, Cleo is ready to expose her and Pete's relationship with Reenie when Pete makes Cleo believe that Reenie has terminal breast cancer. After Cleo learns this is a lie she confronts Cleo again and he calls her a "lying bitch". Soon after Harry learns of the secret relationship and exposes it to the McQueen family at the wedding. Porsche then lets her anger out at Pete and Cleo storms off while [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]) threatens to kill Pete. The next day, Jade asks Pete to give her a lift to an old foster home when she believes the Osbornes' don’t want her anymore. Sonia manages to get a message to Jade about Pete being a pervert and Jade bashes a car door on him. Later, Pete is knocked down by [[Darren Osborne]]'s ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]) taxi. The next day, it is revealed that Reenie ran Pete over and he threatens to tell the truth if she doesn’t stop pushing Cleo to make a statement to the police.

At Christmas, Pete is spying on the McQueen’s where he knows Reenie is on the run, he phones the police as she is planning to leave with Porsche. A few weeks later Pete sends Cleo a text asking to meet up and she goes not realising it is him. Cleo tells Pete that she doesn’t want anything to do with him anymore. Pete then tries to get a job from Nathan Nightingale. Harry confronts Pete for being at the pub working and Pete pretends that Harry attacked him and Jason Roscoe arrests Harry.

During the trial, Pete feigned innocence, and it begins to look as if he will go free. However, Cleo takes the stand for a second time and describes what he did to her. Pete is found guilty by the jury; as he is led away to jail, he yells abuse at the McQueen family.

Pete returned on October 12 2018, when he is visited in prison by [[Joel Dexter]] (Rory Douglas-Speed) after Cleo's heart attack. Joel warns Pete to stay away from Cleo. He blames Pete for Cleo's purging, but Pete tells Joel that it is in fact Joel's fault. Joel attacks Pete and leaves.

==Reception==
When announcing that Pete would stand trial for his crimes, [[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] described Pete as "sinister". It was said that "fans watched in horror" when Cleo kissed Pete for the first time on-screen. Metro noted that Pete had "weaved a tangled, sinister and destructive web over many months", and has called Pete "sinister and sly" in an article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Duncan|last=Lindsay|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/11/hollyoaks-spoilers-paedophile-pete-buchanan-closes-in-on-cleo-mcqueen-again-5616525/|title=Hollyoaks spoilers: paedophile Pete buchanan closes in on Cleo again|work=Metro|date=11 January 2016|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond Oliver''' (1909–1990) was chef and owner of [[Le Grand Véfour]] restaurant in [[Paris]], one of France's great historical restaurants. Oliver detested the [[nouvelle cuisine]], preferring the rich ingredients favored by the chefs in his native [[Gascony]].

Oliver, who was born in [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]] in the [[Bordeaux]] region of [[France]], was the son and grandson of cooks. His maternal grandmother gave him his first instruction in cooking as a boy, and he began his apprenticeship as a chef under his father at the age of 15.

For more than 35 years, he was the owner of ''Le Grand Vefour'' on the Rue de Beaujolais in the [[Palais-Royal]] district. His celebrity clientele ranged from statesmen like [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Andre Malraux]], to writers including [[Albert Camus]] and [[Georges Simenon]], to the industrialists and financiers [[Henry Ford]] and [[David Rockefeller]]. The [[Aga Khan]], and [[Prince Rainier]] and [[Princess Grace of Monaco]] were among his appreciative clients, as were [[Jean Cocteau]] and [[Colette]].

During [[World War II]], Oliver operated a hotel in the French Alps, organized a Resistance cell, and hid Allied airmen who had been shot down on bombing missions. He sheltered an 11-man American bomber crew until the liberation and was later decorated by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1948, he purchased Le Grand Vefour, a restaurant dating to 1784. Six years after Oliver bought the restaurant, it was awarded the prized third star by the [[Michelin Guide]] (France's atlas to good dining), one of only a handful of kitchens that were so honored at that time.

Oliver published ''La Cuisine,'' a detailed technical cookbook, in 1967&lt;ref&gt;Translated as ''La Cuisine: Secrets of Modern French Cooking'' (New York: Tudor Publishing, 1969.)&lt;/ref&gt; and hosted a popular cooking show on television. He also served as one of the eleven judges at the [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]].

'''Richard Hodgson''' (1855–1905) was an Australian-born [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]].

==Biography==

Hodgson was born in [[Melbourne|Melbourne, Australia]] on 24 September 1855 to Mr. R. Hodgson, leather merchant of Melbourne. He received a doctor of law degree in 1878 from the [[University of Melbourne]]. In the 1880s he moved to [[England]] to study [[poetry]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. Hodgson met [[Henry Sidgwick]] his professor at Cambridge and became a member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland]]. (2006). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 177. {{ISBN|978-0780809222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson joined the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1887 to serve as its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness Publishing. p. 164. {{ISBN|978-0851127484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodgson was sent by the SPR in 1884 to India to investigate [[Helena Blavatsky]] and concluded that her claims of [[psychic]] power were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nevill Drury]]. (2006). ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult''. Watkins. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-1842931080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the phenomena that Hodgson investigated was the supposed miraculous [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical]] letters from the [[Mahātmā|Mahatmas]] which were said to magically appear over a four-year period in a cabinet in the Shrine Room at the Theosophical headquarters in Madres.&lt;ref name="Melton2007"&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton|John Melton]]. (2007). ''The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena''. Visible Ink Press. pp. 210-211. {{ISBN|978-1578592098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson in his report wrote that the letters were frauds and had been written by Blavatsky herself who had put them in the cabinet from an opening in her bedroom located behind the Shrine room.&lt;ref name="Melton2007"/&gt; Although a believer in [[mental mediumship]], Hodgson was a critic of [[physical mediumship]] which he claimed was fraudulent. Some of the mediums that he exposed as frauds were [[William Eglinton]], [[Eusapia Palladino]], [[Henry Slade]] and [[Rosina Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Spiritualism: A Popular History from 1847''. Dodd, Mead and Company. pp. 176-210&lt;/ref&gt;

A. T. Baird author of the book ''Richard Hodgson'' published by Psychic Press Limited, London in 1949 is the only biography of Hodgson. [[Joseph McCabe]] praised the work of Hodgson in debunking fraudulent mediums but wrote he was credulous on his study of [[Leonora Piper]].&lt;ref name="McCabe1920"&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London: Watts &amp; Co. pp. 101-105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eusapia Palladino==

The psychical researcher [[Charles Richet]] with Oliver Lodge, [[Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[Julian Ochorowicz]] investigated the medium [[Eusapia Palladino]] in the summer of 1894 at his house in the Ile Roubaud in the Mediterranean. Richet claimed furniture moved during the séance and that some of the phenomena was the result of a supernatural agency.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"&gt;Walter Mann. (1919). [https://archive.org/stream/folliesfraudsofs00manniala#page/114/mode/2up ''The Follies and Frauds of Spiritualism'']. Rationalist Association. London: Watts &amp; Co. pp. 115-130&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hodgson claimed there was inadequate control during the séances and the precautions described did not rule out trickery. Hodgson wrote all the phenomena "described could be account for on the assumption that Eusapia could get a hand or foot free." Lodge, Myers and Richet disagreed, but Hodgson was later proven correct in the Cambridge sittings as Palladino was observed to have used tricks exactly the way he had described them.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt;

In July 1895, Hodgson was invited  to [[England]] to Myers' house in [[Cambridge]] for a series of investigations into the [[mediumship]] of Palladino.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt; According to reports by Hodgson, Myers and [[Oliver Lodge]], all the phenomena observed in the Cambridge sittings were the result of trickery. Her fraud was so clever, according to Myers, that it "must have needed long practice to bring it to its present level of skill."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?: The Evidence Given by Sir A.C. Doyle and Others''. London, Watts &amp; Co. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Cambridge sittings the results proved disastrous for her mediumship. During the séances Palladino was caught cheating in order to free herself from the physical controls of the experiments.&lt;ref name="Mann1919"/&gt; Palladino was found liberating her hands by placing the hand of the controller on her left on top of the hand of the controller on her right. Instead of maintaining any contact with her, the observers on either side were found to be holding each other's hands and this made it possible for her to perform tricks.&lt;ref name="Brower2001"&gt;M. Brady Brower. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson had observed Palladino free a hand to move objects and use her feet to kick pieces of furniture in the room. Because of the discovery of fraud, the British SPR investigators such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[Frank Podmore]] considered Palladino's mediumship to be permanently discredited and because of her fraud she was banned from any further experiments with the SPR in Britain.&lt;ref name="Brower2001"/&gt;

In 1898, Myers was invited to a series of séances in Paris with [[Charles Richet]]. In contrast to the previous séances in which he had observed fraud he claimed to have observed convincing phenomena.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim1985"&gt;Janet Oppenheim. (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 150-151. {{ISBN|978-0521265058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick reminded Myers of Palladino's trickery in the previous investigations as "overwhelming" but Myers did not change his position. This enraged Hodgson, then editor of SPR publications to ban Myers from publishing anything on his recent sittings with Palladino in the SPR journal. Hodgson was convinced Palladino was a fraud and supported Sidgwick in the "attempt to put that vulgar cheat Eusapia beyond the pale."&lt;ref name="Oppenheim1985"/&gt; It wasn't until the 1908 sittings in Naples that the SPR reopened the Palladino file.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''. Prometheus Books. p. 61. {{ISBN|978-1591020868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leonora Piper==
[[File:Leonorapiper.jpg|thumb|right|220x220px|[[Leonora Piper]]]]
Hodgson was one of the very few psychical researchers that believed [[Leonora Piper]]'s controls were spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Bell, [[Thomson Jay Hudson]]. (1904). [https://archive.org/stream/spiritismhypnot00hudsgoog#page/n7/mode/2up ''Spiritism, Hypnotism and Telepathy: As Involved in the Case of Mrs. Leonora E. Piper and the Society for Psychical Research'']. Medico-Legal Journal.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, 1895 Dean Bridgman Connor a young electrician died of [[typhoid fever]] in an American Hospital in Mexico. His death was notified to his parents living in [[Burlington, Vermont]]. Connor's father claimed to have experienced a dream that his son was not dead, but alive and held captive in Mexico. There was publicity over the incident and Hodgson consulted Piper in which she gave several séances. It was alleged that Piper's spirit control claimed Conner was alive in a lunatic asylum kept by a "Dr. Cintz".&lt;ref name="Clodd1917"&gt;[[Edward Clodd]]. (1917). ''The Question: A Brief History and Examination of Modern Spiritualism''. Grant Richards, London. pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony Philpott a journalist for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' travelled to Mexico to investigate the incident but could find no lunatic asylum or Dr. Cintz as described by Piper's control. Philpott visited the hospital where Connor was reported to have died and interviewed the nurse Helen Smith (Mrs. F. U. Winn) in [[Tuxpan, Veracruz]] who attended Connor and she confirmed he had died of typhoid fever in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher]]. (1979). ''Search for the Soul''. Thomas Y. Crowell, Publishers. p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; On his return to Boston, Hodgson would not believe Philpott and insisted that Connor was alive and that if he had the money he would go to Mexico and find him. Philpott offered to pay his expenses and advertised the offer, however Hodgson declined the offer and did not go to Mexico.&lt;ref name="Clodd1917"/&gt; Due to the incorrect information the Dean Connor case has been described as an incident that has cast doubt on Piper's alleged ability to contact the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Neher. (2011). ''Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination''. Dover Publications. pp. 217-218. {{ISBN|978-0486261676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hodgson, during the latter days of his life, would allow no one to enter the privacy of his room in 15 Charles Street. During these years Hodgson believed that he constantly received direct communication with the regular band of spirits in charge of Piper. He received these messages when alone in the evening. He allowed no one to enter his room. Hodgson was afraid they would disturb the "magnetic atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hereward Carrington]]. (1930). ''Story of Psychic Science''. London: Rider &amp; Co. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; He told very few people about this.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Baird. (1949). ''The Life of Richard Hodgson''. Psychic Press Limited, London. pp. 301-302&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson's lover, Jessie D., died in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Baird. (1949). ''The Life of Richard Hodgson''. Psychic Press Limited, London. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In a séance Piper's control told Hodgson he would get married, have two children and have a long life but Hodgson died a few months later, unmarried and childless.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (1997). [http://randi.org/encyclopedia/Piper,%20Leonora%20E..html ''Leonora Piper''] in ''An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural''. St. Martin's Griffin. {{ISBN|978-0312151195}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Hodgson between December 1905 and the beginning of 1908 Piper held about seventy séances during which the [[spirit]] of Hodgson was said to have communicated through her.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Bordogna. (2008). ''William James at the Boundaries: Philosophy, Science, and the Geography of Knowledge''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 126. {{ISBN|978-0226066523}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the control of Piper sounded nothing like Hodgson. According to [[Joseph McCabe]] "when Hodgson died in 1905 and left a large amount of manuscript in cipher, she could not get the least clue to it. When friends put test questions to the spirit of Hodgson about his early life in Australia, the answers were all wrong."&lt;ref name="McCabe1920"/&gt; The Hodgson control was asked the name of his schoolmaster in [[Melbourne]] but failed to give the correct answer, Hodgson's sister who was sent the messages was not convinced they were from Hodgson.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore]]. (1911). ''The Newer Spiritualism''. Henry Holt and Company. p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Before he died Hodgson had written a test letter, and claimed that if he was to communicate through Piper he would reveal the contents inside the letter. Piper's Hodgson control failed to reveal the test letter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Rinn]]. (1950). ''Sixty Years of Psychical Research: Houdini and I Among the Spiritualists''. Truth Seeker Company. p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Blum]] has written that Hodgson was personally obsessed with Piper. Hodgson would stand outside her house, observing her for long periods of time even in the winter [[blizzard]]s of 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Blum]]. (2006). ''Ghost Hunters: William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death''. Penguin Books. p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0143038955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American psychologist [[Morton Prince]] who knew Hodgson well commented that the mediumship of Piper had "wrecked" his mind.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Oppenheim. (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 376. {{ISBN|978-0521265058}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Joseph McCabe]] stated Hodgson was an unreliable source on account of a letter he saw in the 2nd edition ''Spiritualism and Oliver Lodge'' by Dr. [[Charles Arthur Mercier]], from a cousin of George Pellew to [[Edward Clodd]], alleging that Hodgson claimed that Professor Fiske from his séance with Piper was "absolutely convinced" Piper's control was the real George Pellew, but that when Pellew's brother contacted Fiske about it, he replied it was "a lie" as Piper had been "silent or entirely wrong" on all his questions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London: Watts &amp; Co. pp. 101-105&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Gauld]], referring to this letter as published by Clodd, stated that it was "wholly unreliable", noted that Hodgson in his original report wrote that Fiske had a negative attitude, and noted that Hodgson himself considered the Fiske sittings to be of no evidential value.&lt;ref name="GauldPiper"&gt;Alan Gauld. (1968). ''Founders of Psychical Research''. Schocken Books. pp. 361-363&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist and psychical researcher [[James H. Hyslop|James Hyslop]] dedicated his 1905 book ''Science and a Future Life'', a study of the mediumship of Piper, to Hodgson, writing that Hodgson's research led him to the conclusions defended in the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[James H. Hyslop|Hyslop, James]]. (1905). [https://archive.org/stream/scienceandfutur00hysl#page/n7/mode/2up ''Science and a Future Life'']. Boston : H.B. Turner &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, he worked in several libraries in Kansas City and St. Louis.

==Career==
Robert Wedgeworth served as University Librarian, Professor of Library Administration and Professor of Library and Information Science at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UI) from November 1993 until August 20, 1999 when he retired from the University. The [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign University Library|UI Library]] is the largest public university research library in the world and the third largest of all public and private university research libraries in North America after [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]].

Prior to that Wedgeworth had been Dean of the School of Library Service, [[Columbia University]] from 1985-1992 and Executive Director of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) from 1972-1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=preconferences&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=12927|title=ALA {{!}} Robert Wedgeworth's Biography|website=www.ala.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the [[American Library Association]] selected Wedgeworth as one of 75 librarians to serve as staff for “Library 21,” a library of the future exhibit at the Seattle World’s Fair.  This experience and additional data processing training at IBM led to his appointment as Assistant Chief Acquisitions Librarian at [[Brown University]] in July 1966, with a special assignment to introduce library automation to the Brown Libraries.  From 1966 to 1969, he managed all domestic and foreign acquisitions of library materials at Brown while developing an automated acquisitions and fund accounting system.  As a [[Council on Library Resources|Council on Library Resources, Inc.]] Fellow he toured all of Western Europe studying the book trade during the summer of 1969.

Wedgeworth moved to the Graduate School of Library Service, [[Rutgers]]-The State University of New Jersey in the fall of 1969 to do advanced studies in librarianship and teach in the graduate program.  He left Rutgers to become Executive Director of the American Library Association (ALA) in August 1972.

===Literacy campaigns===
Assuming the [http://books.valdosta.edu/read/blacklib.html leadership of ALA] during a turbulent period of internal strife, he led the effort to democratize the Association and gave it new visibility and credibility nationally and internationally.  Under his leadership the Association grew from 28,000 members to over 40,000.  He developed a new Headquarters building in a joint venture that more than doubled the value of its property and produced a windfall profit of more than $10 million by 2003.  With the demise of the National Book Committee, Wedgeworth negotiated with the publishing industry to bring the [[National Library Week]] program to the ALA.  It quickly became a nationally visible marketing tool and the third major revenue source for the Association.

His interest in reading and literacy led to his involvement in the creation of the [[Friends of Libraries USA]] and to his initiative to organize the Coalition on Literacy in 1979.  He then persuaded the Advertising Council to launch the first nationwide ad campaign promoting adult literacy.

===Copyright campaigns===
In 1975, President [[Gerald R. Ford]] appointed Wedgeworth to the [http://digital-law-online.info/CONTU/contu36.html National Commission on New Uses of Copyrighted works] (CONTU) where he was influential in the resolution of library photocopying issues that were key components of the Copyright Revision Law of 1978.  From 1985 until 1992, he served as Dean of the School of Library Service, [[Columbia University]].

At Illinois, Wedgeworth reorganized the library faculty and transformed a 1970s university library, technologically, into a 1990s university library.  Under his leadership, Illinois launched a [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored digital library research program, expanded its [[Mortenson Center for International Library Programs|Mortenson Center]] training program for foreign librarians and launched the web-based Kolb-Proust Research Archive to international acclaim.  The UI Library also raised over $18 million in new endowments during his tenure, a record for a public university.

===ProLiteracy Worldwide===
Wedgeworth became President of [[ProLiteracy Worldwide]] in August 2002 when Laubach Literacy International (LLI) and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. (LVA) merged.  ProLiteracy Worldwide is the largest non-governmental [[literacy]] training organization in the world, and publishes basic and advanced literacy training materials and provides literacy training through its affiliates across the U.S. and partner organizations in over 60 developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Wedgewood retired as President and CEO of ProLiteracy in 2007.&lt;ref name="lj"/&gt; 

===International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions===
After six years on the Executive Board of the [http://www.ifla.org/V/press/pr960611.htm International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions] (IFLA), he was elected President in 1991 and re-elected in 1995 to serve until 1997.  He is only the second American to be elected IFLA President and the only one to be elected to serve a second term.  During his tenure as IFLA President he led the Association to become the dominant international library and information service organization in the world, expanding its membership to over 140 countries.  He led the transformation of IFLA by introducing a global communications system (IFLANET) through the technical support of SilverPlatter and the National Library of Canada. From 1993 in Barcelona to 1997 in Copenhagen, he presided over IFLA conferences that attracted record-breaking attendance to its programs and exhibits.

===Board memberships===
Currently, he serves as a member of the [http://www.caalusa.org/commission.html National Commission on Adult Literacy], he is a life member of the [[American Library Association]], a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a member of the Board of Trustees of [[Wabash College]], the Board of Trustees of the [[Newberry Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newberry.org/board-trustees | title = Board of Trustees | website = Newberry Library | accessdate = April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[Grolier]] Society.  Previously he has served on many boards and advisory committees including advisory committees to the Princeton, Miami, Stanford and Harvard University Libraries.  He recently completely twelve years as a public member of the Accrediting Council for Journalism and Mass Communication and six years as an editorial adviser to the [[World Book Encyclopedia]].

==Writing and reference works==
In his almost 40 years as a librarian, library educator and association executive, Wedgewood created and edited two major reference works, ALA YEARBOOK, 1976-1985 and the WORLD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES, 3d edition 1993.  

In addition, he has written and lectured widely on international librarianship, international book trade, and [[copyright]] and information policy and [[information technology]].  He has also conducted special studies of librarianship and the book trade in Western Europe, Latin America and South Africa.  His publication, STARVATION OF YOUNG BLACK MINDS: THE EFFECTS OF THE BOOK BOYCOTTS IN SOUTH AFRICA, New York, 1989 written jointly with Lisa Drew raised serious questions about curbing the free flow of information during the struggle to combat [[apartheid]].  More recently, he produced a study of library development in [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]] for the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] in 1998.

==Honors and awards==
For his achievements Wedgeworth has received many honors and awards including five honorary doctorates, most recently from the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in 1988.  In 1991, he was honored as the [http://www.lis.uiuc.edu/news/newsletter/f00/class_notes.html Most Distinguished Alumnus] of the [[University of Illinois]], Graduate School of Library and Information Science and in 1996 he received the [http://digitalarchive.oclc.org/da/ViewObjectMain.jsp;jsessionid=84ae0c5f8240ebf0fba47beb431ebbd7b930d2c0f07a?fileid=0000001710:000000043262&amp;reqid=519 Medal of Honor] from the International Council of Archives for his international activities.  From the [[American Library Association]], he has received three of its highest honors, the [http://www.ala.org/ala/awardsbucket/lippincottaward/lippincottawardrecipients.htm Lippincott] and [http://www.ifla.org/V/press/pr970822.htm Melvil Dewey] awards for professional leadership and the [http://www.news.uiuc.edu/II/00/1005ach.html Humphry/OCLC/Forest Press Award] for achievements in international librarianship. In 2011, he presented the [[Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture]]: "Literacy in Libraries: Challenges and Opportunities."

==Family==
He and his wife, Chung-Kyun (C.K.), who is also a retired librarian, have one daughter who is an editor with the Los Angeles Times.

'''Roy Franklin Simmons''' (November 8, 1956 – February 20, 2014) was an [[American football]] player who played as a [[Guard (American football)|guard]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) with the [[New York Giants]] and the [[Washington Redskins]].  With the Redskins he played in [[Super Bowl XVIII]]. He became the second former NFL player to come out as gay and the first to disclose that he was [[HIV-positive]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Savannah, Georgia]], Simmons had five siblings from multiple fathers. As a child, he was sexually assaulted by a male acquaintance, and he later said that he was severely affected by the trauma of that event. At [[Alfred E. Beach High School]] in Savannah, he became a highly recruited football star before committing to play at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; At Georgia Tech, he acquired the nickname "Sugarbear" due to his fun-loving personality. Though Simmons developed a habit of getting intoxicated and visiting bathhouses near the Georgia Tech campus, his college friends did not suspect that he was gay. &lt;ref name=Orth&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orth|first1=Maureen|title=Ex-NFL star goes public about getting HIV infection|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-12-07/features/0312070456_1_roy-simmons-gay-last-year-dave-kopay|accessdate=January 6, 2016|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional football career==
After his career at Georgia Tech, he became an eighth-round draft pick of the New York Giants in 1979.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=William|title=Roy Simmons, 57, lineman who later came out as gay, dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/sports/football/roy-simmons-who-came-out-as-gay-after-retiring-from-nfl-dies-at-57.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 6, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After signing with the team, Simmons moved his three younger brothers to New Jersey to live with him. Later, his mother and other family members moved in.&lt;ref name=Orth/&gt; Simmons was a regular on the offensive line in his rookie season, and by 1980 he started all 16 games as the left guard.&lt;ref name=PFR&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy Simmons|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/SimmRo20.htm|website=[[Pro-Football-Reference.com]]|accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simmons later said that he fell into problems with substance abuse during his time in the NFL. He felt that he had to keep his sexuality a secret, writing, "The N.F.L. has a reputation, and it’s not even a verbal thing — it's just known. You are gladiators; you are male; you kick butt."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Simmons lost his position as a starter in 1981 and he left the Giants before the 1982 season, citing mental fatigue.&lt;ref name=Orth/&gt; After briefly working as an airport baggage handler and failing to make the Giants roster in a 1983 comeback, he was signed by the Redskins. He appeared in the 1984 Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Simmons appeared briefly in the [[United States Football League]], but his professional career was over by 1985. In 1989, one of Simmons' young cousins had revealed to a girlfriend of Simmons that the former player had male lovers. Embarrassed, Simmons moved to San Francisco and disengaged from his family. He became immersed in the city's drug culture, was injured in a knife fight and became homeless at one point.&lt;ref name=Orth/&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1992, he announced that he was gay on ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]''. Around 1997, he learned that he was [[HIV-positive]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In 2006, three days before the Super Bowl, Simmons requested a media credential and two tickets to the game. The NFL denied his request, saying that it had received too many similar requests to accommodate all of them. Simmons and attorney [[Gloria Allred]] wrote to the NFL and requested an investigation into whether his request had been denied due to his sexuality or his HIV status.&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Giant Simmons wants discrimination investigation|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2325123|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=January 7, 2016|date=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''Out of Bounds'', was published that year.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

According to Simmons' brother Gary, the former NFL player lived alone and spent several stints in drug treatment after his playing career. Simmons was a born-again Christian, and a [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] video profile intimated that Simmons came to see homosexuality as immoral, but Simmons' brother said that Simmons was always proud to identify as a gay black man.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Simmons died February 20, 2014, in his [[Bronx, New York]] apartment at the age of 57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roy Simmons, who came out as gay after NFL career, dead at 57|url=https://nypost.com/2014/02/24/roy-simmons-who-came-out-as-gay-after-nfl-career-dead-at-57/|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=New York Post|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he was inducted into the [[National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsports.com/2015/7/27/9042113/national-gay-lesbian-sports-hall-fame-megan-rapinoe-robbie-rogers|title=9 inducted into National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame|author=Jim Buzinski|date=27 July 2015|work=Outsports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russian given names''' are provided at birth or selected during a name change. [[Russian Orthodox church|Orthodox Christian]] names constitute a fair proportion of Russian given names, but there are many exceptions including pre-Christian [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] names, Communist names, and names taken from [[demographics of Russia|ethnic minorities in Russia]]. Given names form a distinct area of the [[Russian language]] with some unique features.

The evolution of Russian given names dates back to the pre-Christian era, though the list of common names changed drastically after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]].  In [[History of Russia|medieval Russia]] two types of names were in use: canonical names given at [[baptism]]  (calendar or Christian names, usually modified) and non-canonical. The 14th century was marked by the elimination of non-canonical names, that ended by the 18th century. In the 20th century after the [[October Revolution]] the whole idea of a name changed. It was a completely new era in the history of [[Russian name]]s, marked by significant changes in common names.

The names of popular [[Russian saints|saints]] are known as "calendar names" from their occurrence in the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]]. A common custom is to name the baby for the saint who is the [[patron saint|patron]] over their [[birthday]]. Such names include [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]] ({{lang|ru|Иван}}, "[[John (given name)|John]]"), [[Andrei (given name)|Andrei]] ({{lang|ru|Андрей}}, "[[Andrew]]"), [[Yakov]] ({{lang|ru|Яков}}, "[[Jacob]]"), [[Yuri (Slavic name)|Yuri]] ({{lang|ru|Юрий}}, "[[George (given name)|George]]"), [[Tatyana]] ({{lang|ru|Татьяна}}, "[[Tatiana]]"), [[Maria (given name)|Maria]] ({{lang|ru|Мария}}, "[[Mary (given name)|Mary]]"), [[Avdotia]] ({{lang|ru|Авдотья}}, "[[Eudoxia (name)|Eudocia]]"), [[Elizaveta (disambiguation)|Elizaveta]] ({{lang|ru|Елизавета}}, "[[Elizabeth (given name)|Elizabeth]]"). The group of calendar names includes traditional names that used to be listed in orthodox [[Menologium|menologia]] prior to the [[October Revolution]] and in popular calendars of the Soviet era that had been printed since the second half of the 19th century. 95% of the Russian-speaking population in the Soviet Union in the 1980s had calendar names.

[[Slavic peoples|Ancient Slavic]] names include [[Stanislav (given name)|Stanislav]] ({{lang|ru|Станислав}}), [[Rada]] ({{lang|ru|Рада}}) and [[Radomir (given name)|Radomir]] ({{lang|ru|Радомир}}), and [[Dobromila]]. Old Russian names include [[Zhdan]] ({{lang|ru|Ждан}}), [[Peresvet]] ({{lang|ru|Пересвет}}), [[Lada]] ({{lang|ru|Лада}}), and [[Lyubava]] ({{lang|ru|Любава}}). Soviet-era names include [[Vilen (disambiguation)|Vilen]] ({{lang|ru|Вилен}}), [[Avangard (name)|Avangard]] ({{lang|ru|Авангард}}), [[Ninel]] ({{lang|ru|Нинель}}), and [[Era (name)|Era]] ({{lang|ru|Эра}}). Names borrowed from other languages include [[Albert (given name)|Albert]] ({{lang|ru|Альберт}}), [[Ruslan (given name)|Ruslan]] ({{lang|ru|Руслан}}), [[Zhanna]] ({{lang|ru|Жанна}}), and [[Leyla]] ({{lang|ru|Лейла}}).

The number of currently used names is relatively small. According to various estimations no more than 600 masculine and feminine names more or less regularly appear in modern generations: the main body of given names doesn't exceed 300-400.

==History==
The history of  Russian given name is usually divided in three stages:
* '''pre-Christian''', period of pagan names, created by means of Old-East Slavic language.
* '''Christian''', foreign Christian names began to replace old pagan names; small proportion of traditional names became canonical;
* '''modern''', starting from October Revolution, characterized by elimination of difference between canonical, calendar and non-calendar names, active borrowing and active name construction.

===Before the Christian era===
Before adoption of Christianity till the end of the 10th century, eastern Slavs (ancestors of modern [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]]) used almost exclusively Slavonic names which were given at birth. No distinction between first name and [[nickname]] was made during this period. Given names in Old East Slavonic language (nickname, epithet, handle) are similar to appellation after a particular episode. Pre-Christian names were used in [[Rus' people|Rus']] several centuries after adoption of Christianity. They were commonly used alongside Christian names till the end of 17th century.

Old Slavonic names are exceptionally diverse. Dictionary of Old Slavonic names by N. M. Tupikov, printed in 1903, comprised 5300 masculine and 50 feminine names. Old Slavonic names fall in several categories:
[[File:Дед Мороз.jpg|thumb|200px|«Moroz» ({{lang-ru|Мороз}}, "[[Frost]]") used to be a personal name, hence popularity of surname Morozov]]
* Numerical names representing birth order in a family: ''Perva'', ''Pervoy'' (the first), ''Vtorak'' (the second), ''Tretyak'' (the third), ''Chetvertak'' (the fourth) and so on. Due to biological limitations, those names wouldn't go far beyond 10 (Desyatko).
* Names based on individual characteristics, like hair and skin color.  Names like Chernysh, Chernyai, Chernyava,(=black one) Bel, Belyai, Belyak, Beloukha (=white one) were widely used. Constitution features also could be reflected in a name: Mal (Small), Малюта, Малой (Smaller), Долгой (Tall), Сухой (thin one), Толстой (Fat one), Голова (Head), Головач, Лобан, Беспалой (Fingerless).
* Names describing personality, habits and behaviour. Among them Забава (fun or game), Истома, Крик (scream), Скряба, Молчан (silent one), Неулыба (one who does not smile), Булгак (restless), Смеяна (one who laughs)  и Несмеяна (one who does not laugh).
* Names, reflecting attitude toward child, whether she was longed for: Богдан (gift of God) и Богдана, Бажен (желанный), Голуба, Любава (loved one), Ждан (awaited one) и Неждан (unexpected one), Хотен, Чаян и Нечай.
* Seasonal names: ''Veshnyak'' '''Вешняк''' (spring one), Zima '''Зима''' ([[winter]]), Moroz '''Мороз''' (frost).
* Animal and plant-related names: [[Bull]] ({{lang-ru|Бык}}, Byk), Волк (wolf), ворон (raven), Щука (pike), Кот (cat), Кошка (she-cat), Жеребец (Stallion), Корова (cow), Щавей (from щавель, rumex), Трава (grass), Пырей. It is believed that this kind of name is a relic of [[totem]] beliefs.
* Names related to beliefs that "bad" words can deflect evil spirits, diseases and even death: Горяин, Немил, Некрас (ugly ine), Нелюба (loveless one), Неустрой, Злоба (Anger), Тугарин (from туга — печаль, sorrow).
* Names related to other nations : Chudin '''Чудин''' (after [[Chud]] people, '''чудь'''), Karel Карел, [[Tatar]]in Татарин, Kozarin Козарин (от названия хазар), Ontoman '''Онтоман''' (after [[Turkish people|Turks]] people, '''оттоманы''').

All previously mentioned names fall into domestic category were used in family circle. However when a person entered a broader social group (changing his occupation or place of residence), his name was replaced or supplemented by another.  This sort of nickname exceeds family names in number - an adult has more distinct characteristics that can be used as a basis for a nickname than a child.

Not all pre-Christian names were equally popular. Only some tens of  several thousand names were actively used. Popularity of pagan names resulted in formation of various diminutive forms: Bychko from Byk, Zhdanko from Zhdan, Puzeika from Puzo and so on. The most popular names had many forms. For example root -bel- produced a wide range of names like Bela, Belka, Belava, Beloy, Belonya, Belyay, Belyash. Root -sem- produced 33 names, including Semanya, Semeika and Semushka.

Increasing influence of the Russian Orthodox church on social life led to gradual elimination of pagan nicknames. However, they didn't  become completely extinct, as they served as basis for major part of Russian surnames (the first stage of surname formation took place in the 15th century).

===Establishment of Russian naming tradition===
[[File:Cheryi-minei.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Icon]] "Минеи на год" ({{lang-ru|Minei na god}}, Year calendar) picturing all saints organized by their respective days. This kind of icons was kept in churches free to access. They were used as pictorial menologia, that even the illiterate could consult at any moment.]]

Adoption of Christianity led to introduction of completely new, foreign names that were tightly connected to baptism ceremony: according to Christian tradition baptism presumes giving Christian name. Names were given according to special books - minei '''Месячные минеи''', which described religious services, ceremonies for each day, including which saint to praise. Religious tradition dictated that children should be named in honor of a saint, praised on the day of baptism (Sometimes on birthday, sometimes any day between birth and baptism). Minei were extremely expensive, so some churches couldn't afford them. One possible solution was to use menologia (Месяцеслов, святцы) - [[calendar]]s with brief listing of religious celebrations and [[Saints days]].

Minei were among the first books to be translated into Russian from Greek. With a rare exceptions names were not translated, preserving their original pronunciation. Their meaning was completely obscure for vast majority of people and they were perceived as alien. This state of things led on the one hand to long coexistence of Christiana and pagan names and to active assimilation and transformation of Christian names.

====Coexistence of old and new names====
Christian and pagan names coexisted up to the 17th century. One of the reasons is that parents could not choose a name for a child freely – a newborn was baptized according to the menologium. Sometimes several children in one family would bear one name. Furthermore, the total number of names in the menologium at the time didn't exceed 400. Pagan nicknames being more diverse and less restrictive provided a convenient way to distinguish people bearing one name.

A practice established in the 14th to 16th centuries supposed giving two names: a baptismal name (usually modified) and a nickname. For example: Trofimko Czar ([[Torpes (disambiguation)|Torpes]] the [[Czar]]), Fedka Knyazets, Karp Guba, Prokopiy Gorbun ([[Procopius]] the Humpback), Amvrosiy Kovyazin, Sidorko Litvin. This practice was widespread in all [[strata]]s. [[Boyar]] [[Andrei Kobyla]] (''lit.'' Andrew the Mare) a progenitor of Romanov dynasty and some other boyar families man serve as an example as well his sons' names: Semyon Zherebets (Semyon the [[Stallion]]), Aleksandr Yolka (Alexandre the [[Spruce]]), Fyodor Koshka (Fyodor the [[Cat]]). Craftsmen did name their children in the same manner. For example, Ivan Fyodorov the first man to print a book often signed as Ivan Fyodorov, son of Moskvit (Иван '''Фёдоров сын Москвитин).'''

Influence of Russian Orthodox church steadily grew in 11th-14th centuries, its influence as a consolidating religious force after [[Mongol invasion of Rus]] and during period of feudal fragmentation in [[Kiev Rus]] became especially important.  Unification of Russian feudal states also contributed to raise of church's influence on policy and society. Under influence of the church many [[knyaz]]es, descendants of [[Rurik]], began to abandon their pagan names in favor of Christian names.

===Separation of Baptismal, Popular and Literary forms===
In XVII names divided in the three distinct forms: popular (spoken), literary and baptismal (church form). This process was boosted by [[Raskol|Patriarch Nikon's reform]]. One of the ventures he undertook was to  correct religious books, which had accumulated a lot of errors and misreading as they used to be copied by sometimes illiterate scribes. As a result religious services differed in different parts of the country. Patriarch Nikon set goal to unify service in Russia and to correct errors in religious books (including menologia). New translations from Greek were made to achieve this goal. Corrected versions were printed in 1654.

===Early Soviet Union===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
{{main|Names of Soviet origin}}
Modern era begins right after October Revolution. The decree "On Separation of Church from State and Schools from Church" outlawed connection of any public and social acts with religious ceremonies. Since that baptism ceased to be a legally binding act. The right to register names was handed to civil authorities, namely [[civil registry]].
As a result the whole conception of name changed. Naming no longer depended on religious traditions and rules.
Direct and tight connection with orthodox saints names was lost.
Any citizen was free to choose a name he wished for himself and his children. As a matter of fact, any word could be used as a name; function of civil registry was reduced to proper registration of citizens.

Social innovations gave incentive to develop "new names for new life". [[Mikhail Vasilyevich Frunze|Mikhail Frunze]], a high-ranked soviet officer, Civil war veteran was among the first to use a new name, naming his son Timur. Another example is the case of [[Demyan Bedny]], a well-known atheistic activist who named his son Svet. The Soviet writer Artem Veseliy named his daughter Volga.

Since 1924 [[Gosizdat]] started issuing calendars similar to those that had existed prior to the Revolution. This new kind of calendars included traditional but rare names given without reference to saints as well as new names. New names comprised non-baptismal names, both Russian and Slavic, borrowed names and newly formed names. Calendars of 1920-30 being a good reference wasn't the only source of names. As mentioned above, parents were free to pick any name they wished, and this freedom  led to active name formation, which later was dubbed "anthroponymic bang".

==Formal Russian name and its derivative forms==

===Legal given name===
According to Russian naming tradition in official speech people are addressed by their name followed by a patronymic.  In official situations one's given name is always written or spoken in its legal form (name given at birth and documented in papers like birth certificate and passport).

Prior to October Revolution canonical form was considered official. It was documented in baptismal register books. However, in birth certificate and other documents a secular form was used. Arising ambiguity was not considered important and didn't cause any legal consequences. In baptismal register books people bearing names Yuriy and Egor appeared as Georgy, but in other documents they could use the variant they were used to.
[[File:Pasport RF.jpg|thumb|200px|Russian [[internal passport]]]]
After the Revolution various forms of one name started being considered as different names. Names from the example above – Georgy, Yegor and Yuriy became legally different names after the Revolution. Generally, names are considered to be different if they during assimilation acquired significant differences as in following cases:
* Names have different [[initials]]: [[Elena (given name)|Elena]] and Alyona, Irina and Arina, Anastasia and Nastasya, Iosif and Osip, Yuliania and Ulyana.
* Differing in stem: Georgiy and Yuriy, Cyprian and Cupryan, Evstafiy and Ostap.
There are names which, being legally different, are considered the same in common usage and share short forms, like Nataliya and Natalya (short form – Natasha).

===Full (formal) and short forms===
As opposed to full forms  used in formal situations, short forms of a name are used in communication between well-acquainted people, usually relatives, friends and colleagues. Short forms emerged in spoken language  for convenience as majority of formal names are cumbersome. They are multi-syllabic, their phonetical structure sometimes doesn't comply with Russian phonetics, as they contain unusual sequences of phonems. Short forms being stylistically neutral, demonstrate that people using them are in close relationships and equal statuses. In case when elder people address younger ones, short names also are stylistically neutral.

Short form were derived from truncated stems of full forms, sometimes preserving very little in common. There are traditional short form, formed by adding -a or -ya suffix to a truncated stem of a name: Valer(y) → Valer|a,
Fyod(or) → Fed|ya, Rom(an) → Rom|a, Pyot(r) → Pet|ya, Ol(ga) → Ol|ya, Vic(toriya) → Vik|a.
Such transformation results in a short word ending with an open syllable, convenient to address or call a person.

Russian language has neutral suffixes that are used (sometimes with -a and -ya) with more radically truncated stems:
*  '''-sh-''': Ma(ria)  → Ma|sh|а, Pa(vel) → Pa|sh|a, Mi(khail) → Mi|sh|a, Da(rya) → Da|sh|a, (A)le(ksey) → Lyo|sh|a, (Alek)sa(ndr) → Sa|sh|a;
*  '''-n-''': Ma(ria) → Ma|n|ya, So(fya) → So|n|ya, Ta(tyana) → Ta|n|ya, Ga(vriil) → Ga|n|ya, Ge(nnadiy) → Ge|n|a, (An)to(nina) → To|n|ya, A(nna) → A|n|ya;
* '''-k-''': (Fe)li(zia) → Li|k|a, I(gor') → I|k|a, Mi(khail) → Mi|k|a;
*  '''-s-''' and -us-: Lyud(mila) → Lyuda, (A)ga(fya) → Ga|s|ya, (Ev)d(okiya) → D|us|ya etc..

Unrestrained  derivation of new names made possible coexistence of multiple short forms of the same name. For example, Irina → Rina, Risha, Irisha, Ina; Vitaliy → Vitalya, Vita, Vitya, Talya, Vitasha. On the other hand extremely faint phonetic connection between short and full forms permits to associate one short form with many full names. For example "Dictionary of Russian personal names" by N.A. Petrovskiy corresponds Alya to 19 masculine and 18 feminine names including Aleksey, Oleg, Yuvenaliy, Aleksandr and Aleksandra, Alisa, Alla, Galina.
[[File:Наташа Королёва.jpg|thumb|No fan would designate [[Natasha Koroleva]] as «Natalya Vladimirovna»]]
There are names for which a short form is difficult to produce. These are usually rare names like Erast, Orest, Toviy, Radiy, Rosa and suchlike. Also some (usually two-syllable) names in are traditionally used in full form even in informal conversation disregarding their short forms (Andrey, Igor, Oleg, Vera, Inna, Nina).

As already stated above, the short form is generally used in spoken conversation between acquainted people and usually doesn't act as an official or public name. However starting from the late 1980s in popular culture, in artistic circles short names gained new status. They appear on posters, disk covers and are widely used in mass media. [[Dima Malikov]], [[Dima Bilan]], Vlad Topalov, Nastya Poleva, Tanya Bulanova, Vika Tsyganova, Lyuba Uspenskaya, Masha Rasputina, Natasha Koroleva became known under their short names. This approach is perceived as accepted part of artistic freedom.

Many Russian short names are used, in slightly adapted form, as full legal given names in [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Croatia]]. For example: Anja, Feđa, Katja/Kaća, Maša, Nataša, Olja, Saša, Sonja, Tanja.

===Diminutive forms===
Diminutive forms constitute a distinct body among various derivative forms. As opposed to full, formal names, their short forms are emotional. They demonstrate warm and tender attitude towards addressee, although some diminutive forms can bear slighting or pejorative emotions.
Diminutive forms generally are used by close relatives and  good friends. They are often used by parents addressing their children.

Diminutive and affectionate forms are derived by adding various diminutive suffixes (-ochk-, -echk-, -onyk-, -enyk-, -ushk-, -yushk-, -yush-, -yash-, -ul-, -ush-, -un-, -us-, -k-, -ik- &amp;c.). Diminutive forms can be derived from both short and full names.
For example: from Maria (full form) following diminutive forms can be derived:
*Maria  → Maryunya, Marunya, Marusya, Maryusha, Maryushka and Maryasha.
*Masha (short from) → Mashka, Mashenyka, Mashulya.
*Manya (another short form) → Manechka, Manyusya, Manyusha, Manyasha etc.

Diminutives derived with -k- suffix carry a pejorative tint, (Sashka, Grishka, Svetka etc.) This is related to a historical tradition to use semi-names to refer to oneself when speaking with a person of higher social status. However, among peers this form didn't have such a tint, indicating only simplicity in communication and close relation. Nonetheless, in modern Russian diminutives like Vasyka, Marinka, Alka are considered stylistically lowered.

'''Semyon Ariyevich Kosberg''' (''Семен Ариевич Косберг'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) (October 1(14), 1903, [[Slutsk]] - January 3, 1965, [[Voronezh]]) was a [[Jewish]]  [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] engineer, expert in the field of [[aircraft engine|aircraft]] and [[rocket engine]]s, [[Doctor of Technical Sciences]] (1959), [[Hero of Socialist Labor]] (1961).

In 1931, Semyon Kosberg graduated from the [[Moscow Aviation Institute]]. He then worked in some of the biggest planning organizations of the Soviet aircraft industry. In 1941, Kosberg was appointed chief designer of an aircraft design bureau, later known as [[OKB-154]], which he ran until his death. He is known for his contributions to the creation of aircraft engines, mounted on the [[Lavochkin La-5]], [[Lavochkin La-7]], and other mass wartime aircraft. In 1946-1965, Kosberg supervised the development of a series of [[Liquid rocket propellants|liquid fuel]] rocket engines, which would be mounted on the final stages of carrier rockets and put into [[orbit]] piloted [[spacecraft]], [[satellite]]s, and interplanetary automatic [[space station]]s.

Semyon Kosberg was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] (1960), [[Order of Lenin]], three other orders and different medals. A [[Kosberg (crater)|crater]] on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side of the Moon]] is named after him.

[[File:Sean mac mahon.jpg|thumb|Sean Mac Mahon]]

'''Seán Mac Mahon''' (born John Michael Mc Mahon, also sometimes spelled as Seán McMahon, Sean Mac Mahon and Sean McMahon, ''Irish: Seán Mac Mathúna'', 15 September 1893 – 26 March 1955) was an Irish Rebel who fought in the [[Easter Rising|1916 rising]].

== Early life ==
Born John Michael Mc Mahon on Friday 15 September 1893  at 118 [[Cork Street, Dublin|Cork Street]] in Dublin. His mother was Mary, formerly Delaney, and his father, Edward Mc Mahon, was just 2 weeks from his 25th Birthday. His father Edward would later become a maltster in Cork Street.

He was the eldest of 7 children. 4 brothers and 2 sisters. Pat (Patrick) born 23 July 1897, the twins Ned (Edward) and Tom (Thomas) born on 4 December 1902 and Joe (Joseph) born 7 July 1909. The girls were Annie, born 21 September 1895 and Kathleen (Catherine) born 9 November 1900.

After leaving school on 26 September 1907 just 11 days after his 14th birthday Seán Mac Mahon started work in Dublin Post Office. He left on 17 September 1909 having reached the age limit of 16.

He then turned to clerical work possible for Plunkett Bros. Maltsters who maintained a presence, office and malthouse perhaps, at 4 and 5 Sandwith Street. He gave 5 Sandwith 
Street as his address when later interned in 1916. His father was at this time a Forman maltster with Plunkett Bros at this address.

== Activity in Volunteers Inception ==

At the inception of the [[Irish Volunteers|Volunteers]] in 1913 he was enrolled as a member of "B" Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin City Brigade.

In 1914 he became 1st Lieutenant under The O’Rahilly with promotion to Captain, replacing The O’Rahilly in 1915. It is assumed that by this time he was also a very active [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|IRB]] member. B Company, 3rd Battalion headquarters was at 144 Great Brunswick Street now called [[Pearse Street]].

== Easter Rising ==

[[Easter Rising|Easter Week 1916]] he fought as Captain of "B" Company, 3rd Battalion under Eamonn De Valera in Bolands Mills with responsibility for Westland Row Train Station.

He represented "B" Company at a meeting of the Battalion Council in 144 Great Brunswick Street on the Good Friday prior to the rising. Present were [[Éamon de Valera|Commandant De Valera]], Captain Begley, Lieutenant Byrne, Lieutenant Charlie Murphy, Joseph O Connor and others. They were given precise orders as to the positions they were to occupy on the Sunday. They were informed as to the quantity of stores at their disposal. A large quantity of provisions had been purchased. Each company was to be responsible for the collection of such stores and their transport to their operational area.

"B" Company were to take over [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row Railway Station]]. They were to send a party up to [[Tara Street]] and link up with 2nd Battalion who would be in charge of [[Amiens Street, Dublin|Amiens Street]] section of the railway. They were on the other side to connect up with "A" Company on the railway at Grand Canal Quay.&lt;ref&gt;When The Clock Struck in 1916. Close-Quarter Combat in the Easter Rising. By Derek Molyneux and Darren Kelly. Witness Statement of Joseph O Connor. Bureau of Military History 1913 – 1921. Document Number WS 157 {{ISBN|978-1-84889-213-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Mac Mahon cleared, barricaded and locked Westland Row station. Volunteers under Capt. John Mc Mahon, he was still known by his birth name, and Capt Joseph O Connor cut telephone wires and seized signal boxes. They were charged to snipe and fight running battles around the railway so as to maintain control of it. Ensuring that any reinforcements landing at Kingstown (Dún Laoghaire) would have to march to Dublin. He than sabotaged part of the line and entrenched his men about 300 yards away from the station. The railway was of enormous importance as it also ran through De Valera’s command area. Its defence was entrusted to "two of his best officers" Mac Mahon and O’ Connor.&lt;ref&gt;The Easter Rising by Michael Foy and Brian Barton. Published by Sutton Publishing Ltd in 1999. {{ISBN|0 7509 3433 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dublin Rising 1916 |first=Joseph E.A. |last=Connell |publisher=Wordwell Ltd |year=2015|isbn= 9781905569908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first encounter was on Monday near Bath Avenue when Mac Mahon with seven of his men repelled soldiers from [[Beggars Bush Barracks]] and killed a sergeant major. There were nine stone archways between Westland Row and Ringsend. The volunteer marksmen attacked British soldiers from behind these protecting walls and shot at them on Great Brunswick Street ( Pearse Street) and Grand Canal Street as well as in the square of Beggars Bush Barracks.

One memorable incident stands out. When one of his own determined men was seriously wounded the problem arose as to how to get the man to hospital. Captain Mac Mahon provided a solution by taking the man to St Vincent’s Hospital himself while in uniform and under fire from the British troops.

De Valera, who was getting exhausted, did towards the end of the fighting order the burning of Westland Row station but had to be persuaded by Mac Mahon not to do so. The deciding argument being that it would have most likely led also to the burning of St Andrews Church next door on Westland Row. This deciding argument story is passed down through the Mac Mahon family.

"By Thursday/Friday he was exhausted: ‘I can’t trust the men – they’ll leave their posts if I fall asleep, if I don’t watch them. ‘When Lt James Fitzgerald assured his O/C he’d sit by him de Valera relented and fell asleep immediately. Soon he awoke screaming. ‘set fire to the railway!" &lt;ref&gt;1916 The Easter Rising by Tim Pat Coogan. Published in paperback by Phoenix (Orion Books) {{ISBN|9780753818527}} (page 118)&lt;/ref&gt;  De Valera insisted that papers be dipped in whiskey and used to set fore to the waiting rooms and rolling stock, but another officer, Cpt John Mc Mahon, O/C of B Company, ‘eventually persuaded de Valera to reason and the fires were put out.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin in Rebellion A directory 1913 – 1923 by Joseph E.A. Connell jnr. Published by The Lilliput Press Dublin Revised edition 2009. {{ISBN|978 1 84351 137 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surrender and deportation ==

The reaction by the locals on Boland’s Mills surrender was unlike most other areas. The locals were friendly and sympathetic and they received an ovation in Grand Canal Street with offers of refuge. They were met by British officers and soldiers in Grattan Street where they laid down their weapons. The men marched into Lower Mount Street through lines of bayonets.

May 1916 he was deported and imprisoned first in Wakefield then [[Frongoch internment camp|Frongoch]] where he was listed as John Mc Mahon 5B Sandwith Street and finally [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs|Wormwood Scrubbs]]. Leo, Thomas and James Fitzgerald of 173 great Brunswick Street (Pearse Street), his future brothers in law were also interned in Frongoch. On the 11/06/1916 the General Council was elected in Frongoch and on the 21/6/1916 the Council called a meeting of all commissioned officers among which was Capt. J. Mc Mahon. Collins and Mulcahy. Mac Mahon and many of the future G. H. Q. Staff were present in Frongoch where the IRB was being reorganised.&lt;ref&gt;Frongoch University of Revolution by Sean O’Mahony. Published by FDR Teoranta 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In September that year in Frongoch it was suggested that a patch of ground be cultivated. Sean Mac Mahon and 2 others "being city men," asked to be shown how to do it. Eventually admitting "put us in the clink we won’t be doing any work".&lt;ref&gt;Frongoch University of Revolution by Sean O’Mahony. Published by FDR Teoranta 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2/11/1916 The Murphy incident started in Frongoch. Afterwards 15 hut leaders were court-martialled among whom was Sean Mac Mahon. He was defended by Gavin Duffy. He was sentenced to 28 days hard labour serving 6 of them in the camp.

== Post-release ==

He arrived home on Christmas Eve 1916 after the amnesty via Dún Laoghaire (Kingstown).&lt;ref&gt;Frongoch University of Revolution by Sean O’Mahony. Published by FDR Teoranta 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

He was employed as a clerk on the managerial staff of the Nationality, [[Arthur Griffith]]’s newspaper. He resumed his association with the Volunteers becoming Vice Commandant of the 3rd Battalion. He was held in the highest esteem by the founder and editor of the paper President Griffith. B Company 3rd Battalion was immediately reformed with Seán Quinn being elected Captain.

== South Longford by-election ==

Prior to May 1917 President Griffith sent Seán Mac Mahon and Joseph Curran to Longford to work on ensuring Joseph Mc Guinness was elected for [[Sinn Féin]] in the [[South Longford by-election, 1917|South Longford by-election]]. McGuinness was serving a prison term when he was elected to Westminster and among those who also worked on his election campaign was [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. The election slogan for McGuinness at the time was "Put him in to get him out!" It was narrowly won by Sinn Féin with a majority of 37 votes. Seán Mac Mahon and Joseph Curran worked hard and "we converted the hostile people who tried hard to beat us out of Newtownforbes."&lt;ref&gt;Military Archives File Reference SP11399 Joseph Michael Curran B Company 3rd Battalion 1916 for Pensions Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The election was held on the 9th May 1917.

When Seán and Joseph reached Dublin on their return a number of police tried to capture a flag from them. They got several items but not the flag as it was divided between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Military Archives File Reference SP11399 Joseph Michael Curran B Company 3rd Battalion 1916 for Pensions Collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the period of this election that the Volunteers were formed in the area of South Longford. The Volunteers took a very active part in the election organizing and canvassing voters, protection duty at the polling stations, bringing voters to the booths, escorting the ballot boxes and suchlike work.

On the 25th October1917 a new Sinn Féin Ard Fheis was held. De Valera was elected President of the party. Griffith and Fr Michael O Flanagan were vice-presidents. Collins barely made it onto the executive. The next day De Valera was elected President of the Irish Volunteers. Collins was appointed director of organisation of the volunteers. A 26 man executive was established. [[Cathal Brugha|Cathal Bruagh]] was put in charge of the executive but it became a bit too loose. It was decided to set up a headquarters staff.

"Seven of the most prominent members of the resident executive met at the headquarters of the printers union at 35 Lower Gardener Street to select a chief of staff in March 1918. Those attending were Collins, Richard Mulcahy, Dick Mc Kee, Gearoid O Sullivan, Diarmuid O’ Hegarty, Rory O’Connor and Seán Mac Mahon." &lt;ref&gt;Michael Collins The Man Who Won the War by T.Ryle Dwyer. Published by Mercier Press Cork. Revised edition 2009. 
{{ISBN|978 1 85635 625 1}} (Page 84)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulcahy was elected chief of staff. In 1919 Seán Mac Mahon became Q.M.G. of the IRA. Being attached to the General Headquarters.

== Marriage ==

He married Lucinda Fitzgerald on Thursday 27 November 1919 in the Church of Saint Andrew, Westland Row, Dublin, that same church that he had helped save from being destroyed. They went to Ulster for their honeymoon to see Seán MacEntee, MacEntee  at that time served as Vice-Commandant of the Belfast Brigade of the IRA. Their first home was in Heytesbury Street, in Dublin

== Q Company ==

Seán Mac Mahon was the organiser of the famous Q Company based at Dublin Docks, which was finally organised into a unit in March 1921. John Kennedy was transferred from "B" Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin Brigade, to his department to help run it. He also found time to organise the Volunteers at the various railway stations both in Dublin and throughout the country.

On another occasion, about this time, the British military carried out a raid on a business premises in [[St Stephens Green|Stephen’s Green]]. Every room in the building with the exception of two were searched. One of these was the Q.M.G.’s War Office.

Many meetings took place in Whelan's Pub at 49 Parnell Street. Owned and run by James Kirwan from Tipperary. He was a member of "D" Company 2nd Battalion, Dublin Brigade. Whenever there was an important meeting being held in the snug Richard Mulcahy would preside with Seán Mac Mahon, Gearoid O Sullivan, Frank Thorton, Seán O’Connell, Michael Larken and of course [[Oscar Traynor]] these men were always present. Mick Collins was always in and out, keeping much of his funds hidden here. £3,000 at one time behind a brick in the wall of the cellar. Often used to buy arms. It was here that the escape from [[Kilmainham Gaol]] and of Sean Mac Eoin from Mountjoy were planned.&lt;ref&gt;Memories of James Kirwan as reported by Niall Carroll in a national newspaper.&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting remembered by Pax Whelan (Pax O’ Faoláin) about February 1921. "I was at a HQ meeting in a house on the quays. All the top people were there, Mick, Liam Mellows who was director of purchases, Cathal Brugha Minister for Defence, Rory O’ Connor, Seán Mac Mahon Q.M.G., Liam Lynch and some others. They were discussing whether to bring in a boat with arms" &lt;ref&gt;Pax O’ Faoláin Page 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in several engagements during the [[Black and Tans|Black and Tan]] war and was present during the night ambush when his Brother in Law, Leo Fitzgerald was killed in Great Brunswick Street on 14 March 1921.

== 14 March 1921 ==

Dublin had awoken on the morning to 14 March 1921, to the news that six IRA Volunteers, captured in an ambush at Drumcondra two months before, had been hanged.

The Labour movement called a half-day general strike in the city in protest at the hangings. The Republican government declared a day of national mourning. All public transport came to a halt.

By the evening, the streets cleared rapidly as the British-imposed curfew came into effect at 9pm each night. It was about 8 o’clock. The curfew was approaching. A company of [[Auxiliaries]], based in Dublin Castle was sent to the area to investigate an explosion. It consisted of one Rolls Royce armoured car and two tenders (trucks) holding about 16 men. Apparently the Auxiliaries had some inside information as they made straight for the local IRA headquarters at 144 Pearse Street. One later testified in court that – "I had been notified there were a certain number of gunmen there". Leo, with others, was protecting his brother in law and other senior staff attending a meeting. As soon as the Auxiliaries approached the building, fire was opened on them from three sides. Firing lasted for just five minutes but in that time seven people were killed or fatally wounded and at least six more wounded. Leo Fitzgerald was killed outright.

== The Treaty and Civil War ==

The Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921.

On the formation of the Regular Army in February 1922 he continued as Q.M.G.

When Michael Collins was shot in Beal Na mBláth and buried in Dublin he carried, with others, the coffin from St Vincents Hospital Dublin to the waiting gun carriage. Michael Collins brother gave him the handerchief that was on Collins person when he was shot.

In September 1922 he succeeded General Mulcahy as Chief of the General Staff. He was unknown not only to the Irish public but also to the British at Dublin Castle. At a reunion in Gormanstown in September 1922 General Mulcahy boasted of the great progress of the Army by indicating the newly appointed Chief of Staff as "the Army’s first real Chief of Staff"

The Army needed to be professionalised, armed and numbers increased in the short term. After the civil war ended it would have to be brought to peace time operation and numbers reduced again.

Trouble continued in Northern Ireland with violence against the Catholics. It was considered important to continue to supply and arm the Northern Ireland IRA units. To this end the [[Free State Army]] sanctioned the surreptitious purchase of arms from a London arms dealer.

In May 1923 General Sean Mac Mahon summed up the course of events "Early last year (1922), during the programme in the North and when our men in the Northern Divisions were making every effort to deal with the situation, the demand for arms increased and every weapon we could lay our hands on was sent to one of our Northern divisions. Arms were taken from Southern units and sent up North and later we supplied them with some arms from the regular army. The position became very difficult and, after many meetings with our Northern officers, it was decided that we would procure a quantity of arms under cover to be sent in to the six counties. I went into the matter of procuring a quantity of revolvers and rifles with Mr Frank Fitzgerald (Uncle to Gareth Fitzgerald), who has been procuring materials for us for a long time…"

This deal went badly wrong with Frank Fitzgerald. General Mac Mahon approved the deal and an advance of £10,000 was given out of Army funds. The revolvers were due at the end of June 1922 however the attack to retake the Customs House was on 28, 29 and 30 June 1922. General Seán Mac Mahon was in Cork at this time. General Mac Mahon told Fitzgerald to hold things up because he was concerned that the guns may get into the wrong hands.

Things began to go badly wrong in London at the end of August 1922 and it seems that Fitzgerald may have been a rather incompetent gunrunner. He messed up one revolver deal in June by not turning up for an appointment with the arms dealer who then sold the guns to Brazil. Everything fell apart. The Free State authorities no longer had the same need for the arms having won the civil war. But whatever pressure Fitzgerald put on it was effective (He had a brother in the Cabinet and was friendly with Mulcahy and Ernest Blyth).

On 19 October 1923 Mulcahy and General Sean Mac Mahon had a meeting with [[W. T. Cosgrave|W.T. Cosgrave]] (President of the Executive Council). Mulcahy and other Ministers went to the Dept of Finance and drew out £5,000 Then Mulcahy and General Mac Mahon caught the night boat to England to see Fitzgerald. They brokered a deal and gave him the money. Needless to say the saga continued on with the Free State threatening legal action. Some arms were received but the Cosgrave government tried to distance itself from the situation. The last word on the matter was in the Dáil in 1927 when Fianna Fáil’s Frank Carney TD (Chief supplies officer Portobello 1922) commented that they fitted out a flying column from South Down/Armagh area two or three days before the attack on the Four Courts. They had been waiting on the guns from London.&lt;ref&gt;Magill March 1983 " Frank Fitzgerald and the Arms Crisis of 1922" By Michael Farrell&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 1922 Ernie O Malley was arrested and brought to Portobello. General Sean Mac Mahon went privately to visit him.

Even before the end of the civil war in 1923 it was evident that the leadership of the National Army or "Defence Force" saw a future where they were a respected, professional, well organised army, subservient to the government of the day. That Government was following the agreement with Britain and had concerns about its military budget. At the beginning of 1923 the National Army accounted one third of all current budget expenditure by the state. The leadership of the IRA organisation wished to continue the fight for an all island Republic using whatever means but particularly a well-armed nationalist army. While the Free State government wished to shrink the National Army now that the [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] was over. Richard Mulcahy met this IRA leadership on a number of occasions but was very frustrated with them. In May 1923 the army had risen to 3,000 officers and 52,000 other ranks.

== Paris visit ==

During this time the state had to find its feet and day-to-day operations and services had to be provided. General Seán Mac Mahon paid an official visit to France 14 July to 31 July 1923. During which he laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. He was well received by the French Military and gained much information on the running of a professional army. There was some problem with wearing an Irish Military uniform but this appeared to come more from the British representatives in Paris.

== The Army Council ==

Mulcahy did secure a redundancy package for the men that would have to leave the National Army and return to civilian life. Many found occupations within the civil and public services. Matters were moving along swiftly but the IRA organisation seemed deeply committed to the beliefs of the pre-truce ideals. They would refer to Mulcahy as Commander in Chief or Chief of Staff, when in fact he was the Minister of Defence and Seán Mac Mahon was the Chief of Staff and head of the National Army. They also mistakenly believed that Mulcahy was President of the IRB.

The Army Council by now accepted and took steps to action the Governments budgetary target of 1,300 officers and 30,000 other ranks by January 1924. The decisions now were not how many but who. The predicament the Army Council and in particular Mac Mahon and Mulcahy found themselves in was in large part due to their taking a stronger line against the IRA than would their political masters. Seán Mac Mahon feared the IRA organisation would turn the army "into an armed mob" &lt;ref&gt;A City In Civil War Dublin 1921 – 4 by Pádraig Yeates. Published by Gill &amp; Macmillan. Pages 288,293,295,296. {{ISBN|978 0 7171 6726 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of being" Forced into a military machine that will be the right arm of any government the people wish to place in power".

Cosgrave read the IRA’s ultimatum into the record of the Dáil. Reaction particularly from the Labour party was mild. Although Labour members did join the public outcry against the IRA organisation. Some such as McGrath characterised the "Mutiny" as a row between the IRA and the IRB about how the army should be reorganised.

Mulcahy offered the IRA organisation an interview with Seán Mac Mahon. Liam Tobin agreed to meet Mac Mahon provided he came as "head of the Army". This showed the continued failure of the IRA Organization to understand the new political realities of the new state. Mulcahy made the offer because Seán Mac Mahon was President of the IRB but Liam Tobin and the IRA Organisation were not even aware of this and the significance of the offer.&lt;ref&gt;A City In Civil War Dublin 1921 – 4 by Pádraig Yeates. Published by Gill &amp; Macmillan. Pages 288,293,295,296. {{ISBN|978 0 7171 6726 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the Army crisis in 1924 Seán Mac Mahon along with the rest of the Army Council was asked to resign. He was initially reluctant to do this and his commission was therefore withdrawn. A committee of inquiry was formed and on their recommendation he was reinstated by the Executive Council and an apology given to him in the Dáil. His commission was actually withdrawn for just one day.

He returned to serve but not as Chief of General Staff.

== Retirement and death ==

He retired through ill health in January 1927. Asked to go into politics he declined. The Army provided him with a house, Coolgarif in Stillorgan. He only stayed here a short time before buying a house himself in Dundrum, then County Dublin now Dublin 14. The house was called Meadowbrook. Here he stayed with his wife, Lucinda and 3 children Terence (Terry), Kathleen (Kanki) and Seán (Seánog).

He died on 26 March 1955 and is buried with his wife and two of his children in [[Deans Grange Cemetery|Deansgrange cemetery]]. He received a full state funeral. A memorial committee formed and thanks to them his grave is marked with a Celtic cross.

== Memorial Bridge ==
[[File:Macmahon bridge.jpg|thumb|Sean Mac Mahon Bridge in Grand Canal Dock, Dublin City.]]
In 1966 a new bridge at Boland’s Mill between Ringsend and Pearse Street was opened in his name. President Eamonn de Valera unveiled the plaques. Before the ceremony members of the Dublin Brigade IRA formed up outside 144 Pearse Street, the old Battalion HQ, under the command of Comdt Vincent Byrne and headed by a colour party under Mr P. Buttner and the St Brigid’s Brass Band they marched to the Seán Mac Mahon Bridge.

This bridge was rebuilt in 2008 and rededicated in his name on 30 May 2008.

{{See also|John McCain presidential campaign, 2008}}
On July 2, 2008, Schmidt was appointed to head up day-to-day operations of the McCain campaign in response to concerns that the campaign lacked coordination and a clear message. [[Rick Davis (politics)|Rick Davis]] retained the formal title of "campaign manager".&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/02/AR2008070203038.html|title=McCain Puts New Strategist Atop Campaign|author=[[Dan Balz]] and Michael D.

====Press commentary====
''[[The New York Times]]'' described Schmidt's management as having transformed the McCain campaign into "an elbows-out, risk-taking, disciplined machine", crediting him with aggressive responses to press criticism and creative methods of manipulating the news cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/us/politics/07schmidt.html |title=An Adviser Molds a Tighter, More Aggressive McCain Campaign |last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |first2=Adam |last2=Nagourney |date=September 6, 2008 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s Michael Scherer, in an opinion piece from September 15, 2008, relating to Schmidt's involvement with [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|John McCain's presidential campaign]] stated that Schmidt, the "lord of outrage, has a long and prosperous career ahead of him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1841131,00.html |title=McCain's Outraged and Outrageous Campaign |last=Scherer |first=Michael |date=September 15, 2008 |work=Time |location= New York |accessdate=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stance on gay rights====
Schmidt voiced his support for [[gay rights]] at a meeting of the [[Log Cabin Republicans]], a [[gay]] Republican group. He said: "I just wanted to take a second to come by and pay my respect and the campaign's respect to your organization and to your group. Your organization is an important one in the fabric of our party."&lt;ref name="Advocate1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.advocate.com/news/2008/09/04/mccain39s-top-strategist-addresses-log-cabin-republicans|title=McCain's Top Strategist Addresses Log Cabin Republicans|last=Eleveld|first=Kerry|date=September 4, 2008|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|accessdate=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt said about his [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] sister and her life partner: "On a personal level, my sister and her partner are an important part of my life and our children's life. I admire your group and your organization and I encourage you to keep fighting for what you believe in because the day is going to come."&lt;ref name="Advocate1"/&gt;

In February 2013, Schmidt along with 74 other Republicans co-signed an ''[[amicus curiae|amicus]]'' brief to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in support of overturning [[Proposition 8]]. "The die is cast on this issue when you look at the percentage of younger voters who support gay marriage", he was quoted as saying. "As [[Dick Cheney]] said years ago, 'Freedom means freedom for everybody.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/us/politics/prominent-republicans-sign-brief-in-support-of-gay-marriage.html?hp&amp;_r=0 |title= Republicans Sign Brief in Support of Gay Marriage |last=Stolberg |first=Sheryl Gay |date=February 25, 2013 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure from the Republican Party===
In May 2018, when President [[Donald Trump]] moved the [[Embassy of the United States, Jerusalem|U.S. embassy in Israel]] from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, sparking violent [[2018 Gaza border protests|Gaza border protests]], Schmidt said Trump "has blood on his hands".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nbcnews.com/video/steve-schmidt-there-is-blood-on-trump-s-hands-1233504323949 Steve Schmidt: There is blood on Trump's hands]". NBC News. May 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 19, 2018, Schmidt formally withdrew from the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] over [[Donald Trump]]'s policy of separating immigrant families at the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S. border with Mexico]]. He also cited Republican leadership for their failure to challenge the policy. Schmidt said of Trump, "We have in America—right now, at this hour—to understand that you have a lawless president, a vile president, a corrupt president, a mean, cruel president, who is seeking to remake the world order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hines |first1=Nico |title=Steve Schmidt: Why I Quit the 'Vile' Republican Party |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/steve-schmidt-mccains-campaign-chief-quits-indecent-and-immoral-gop |website=The Daily Beast |language=en |date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He tweeted "the Republican Party&amp;nbsp;... is fully the party of Trump. It is corrupt, indecent and immoral. With the exception of a few Governors like Baker, Hogan and Kasich it is filled with feckless cowards who disgrace and dishonor the legacies of the party's greatest leaders&amp;nbsp;... Today the GOP has become a danger to our democracy and our values."&lt;ref&gt;Huff Post 20 June 2018: [https://www.yahoo.com/news/gop-strategist-quits-apos-corrupt-135557288.html ''GOP Strategist Quits 'Corrupt' Party Of 'Feckless Cowards', Will Vote For Democrats'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing his new political orientation, he stated:

{{Quote|This Independent voter will be aligned with the only party left in America that stands for what is right and decent and remains fidelitous to our Republic, objective truth, the rule of law and our Allies. That party is the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gstalter | first = Morgan | title = GOP strategist Steve Schmidt denounces party, will vote for Democrats | newspaper = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date = June 20, 2018 | url = http://thehill.com/homenews/news/393170-gop-strategist-denounces-party-will-vote-for-democrats | access-date = 2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Game Change''==
Schmidt is portrayed by [[Woody Harrelson]] in the [[HBO]] film ''[[Game Change (film)|Game Change]]''. The film, based on chapters of the book of the same title by political journalists [[John Heilemann]] and [[Mark Halperin]], focuses on the choice of [[Sarah Palin]] as John McCain's running mate in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]]. Schmidt is shown as pushing for the choice of Palin, then afterward conceding she was unqualified for the job, including a limited knowledge of current affairs.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-dunn/game-change-sarah-palin-a_b_1325852.html?ref=politics&amp;ir=Politics |title=Game Change: Sarah Palin and the Confessions of Steve Schmidt |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 9, 2012 |first=Geoffrey |last=Dunn |work=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt himself voiced his approval of the film, saying that "it tells the truth of the campaign"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/18/entertainment/la-et-gamechange-20120218 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=James |last=Rainey |title=Choosing sides on Sarah Palin |date=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that watching the film was tantamount to "an out-of-body experience".&lt;ref&gt;David Frum, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/03/04/david-frum-hbo-s-game-change-charts-sarah-palin-s-revenge.html "HBO's 'Game Change' Charts Sarah Palin's Revenge"], thedailybeast.com.

'''Teina Pora''' is a New Zealander who was wrongfully convicted of murdering Susan Burdett when he was aged 17; he served time in [[Auckland Prison|Paremoremo prison]] from 1994 for the crime, until he received parole in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/teina-pora-granted-parole-5880337 Teina Pora granted parole]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, 39-year-old Burdett was raped and murdered in her home in Papatoetoe, [[Auckland]]. She was repeatedly struck in the head with a softball bat. About a year later, Teina Pora who was a [[Mongrel Mob]] prospect at the time,&lt;ref&gt;http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/bid-overturn-murder-conviction-4394252&lt;/ref&gt; was arrested on other charges and claimed he was there when the murder happened. He was subsequently convicted of rape and murder in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10806944 'Innocent man' in jail 20 years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reasonable"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10806923 Reasonable doubts]&lt;/ref&gt; Pora appealed his conviction, but in 2000, was found guilty for the crime a second time. After spending 20 years in prison, Pora was released on parole in April 2014.&lt;ref name="Teina Pora released from prison"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11237952 Teina Pora released from prison], New Zealand Herald, 14 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, he maintained his innocence and the convictions were quashed by the Privy Council in March 2015. On 15 June 2016, he was awarded NZ$2.52 million compensation and received a government apology for being wrongfully convicted of rape and murder.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11657075|accessdate=15 June 2016|title=Teina Pora compensation: Justice Minister Amy Adams confirms $2.52 million payout|date=15 June 2016|publisher=New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

Teina Pora was born with [[foetal alcohol spectrum disorder]], caused by his mother's drinking during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/teina-pora-legal-team-condition-linked-to-confession-2014031917#axzz3PhQBNVbd Teina Pora legal team: Condition linked to confession], TV3 News, 19 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11353161 Pora mental age that of a child, lawyer says], New Zealand Herald, 5 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Otara]]. His father was never around and his teenage mother died of cancer when he was four.

After his mother's death, Pora lived with grandparents and other family members, including an aunt who tried to raise him as her own son.&lt;ref name="Why an innocent man would confess"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872994 Why an innocent man would confess], New Zealand Herald, 23 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager he spent time in boys' homes but often ran away.&lt;ref name="did"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10877229 Susan Burdett: Did the police bungle this murder case?]&lt;/ref&gt; His brother told TV3's [http://www.tv3.co.nz/3RD-DEGREE-Wednesday-March-13-2013/tabid/3692/articleID/90951/Default.aspx ''3rd Degree''] programme that by the time he was a teenager, Pora was already doing "heaps of crime" but that "he was never a violent person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/Was-Teina-Pora-wrongly-jailed/tabid/1773/articleID/290136/Default.aspx Was Teina Pora wrongly jailed?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The murder of Susan Burdett ==
Susan Burdett was a 39-year-old accounts clerk who lived alone in [[Papatoetoe]] and enjoyed ten pin bowling.  On 23 March 1992 she went bowling at the Manukau Superstrike. After she got home, she had a shower and was then raped and battered to death with a softball bat.  When she was found, the softball bat, which she kept for her own protection, was found lying on the bed beside her.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10877229 Susan Burdett: Did the police bungle this murder case?] New Zealand Herald, 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background to Pora's involvement ===
Pora and some friends were walking through a park in Manukau a few days after the murder when they found an old softball bat in a drain. It was not the weapon used in the Burdett murder as this was found beside her body at the scene of the crime.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt; Unaware of this, when Pora's aunt found out about the bat in the drain, she suggested to police that Pora may have committed the murder. Police responded by interviewing Pora in April 1992 and again in May 1992. On both occasions he denied any involvement and provided hair and DNA samples to police, which excluded him as a suspect.  However, his aunt continued to put forward the view that Pora was involved but the police concluded her information was unreliable.&lt;ref name="why"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10872994 Why an innocent man would confess]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== His 'confession' ===
Pora was a prolific car thief&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and almost a year later, he was arrested for failing to attend court. In the course of a "general conversation" with a police officer, Pora "told him of his troubled life, told the officer he wanted to go straight, that he felt unwanted by his family and that he knew he was being sought by the Mongrel Mob and police".&lt;ref name="why"/&gt; After police told him there was a reward of $20,000 for assistance in capturing Susan Burdett's murderer, Pora claimed he knew who committed the crime. He said he drove two Mongrel Mob members to the house and acted as lookout while they went inside.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10871565 Police censure profiler who spoke out about crime to Herald], New Zealand Herald, 16 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Pora didn't give the names of the Mongrel Mob members, but when police put two names to him, he went along with these suggestions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Later on, police determined the two Mongrel Mob members both had alibis and their DNA did not match that found in the body. The DNA came from Malcolm Rewa but police didn't learn that until four years later.&lt;ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/&gt;

After claiming he was at the scene, Pora was held for the next four days during which he was questioned about the case for 14 hours - without a lawyer.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt; During the course of this drawn out interview, much of which was recorded on video, he frequently changed his story about what happened. After initially claiming he acted as a lookout for the two Mongrel Mob members, he later said he went into the house after "hearing noises and seeing the crimes being carried out". Still later, he said he held Burdett down by the arms while the others raped her.&lt;ref name="reasonable" /&gt; Pora was subsequently charged with Burdett's rape and murder.

In 1995, once Pora was in prison, he provided three more names to police after they offered him another $50,000 and said they would help when he came up for parole.&lt;ref name="Why didn't Pora name Malcolm Rewa"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11355475 Why didn't Pora name Malcolm Rewa?] New Zealand Herald, 8 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trials and hearings ==

=== First trial 1994 ===

No finger prints, DNA, or any other direct evidence linking Pora to the murder scene were produced in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3news.co.nz/tvshows/3rd-degree/was-teina-pora-wrongly-jailed-2013031313#axzz3PhQBNVbd Was Teina Pora wrongly jailed?]
, TV3, 13 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, despite the contradictory nature of Pora's 'confessions', the [[The Crown|Crown]] successfully argued at his trial that no one would confess to being involved in such a brutal rape and murder if they were not actually involved. His aunt, Terry McLaughlin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11353378 Pora appeal: Error in not making rapist's impotence known], Privy Council told, New Zealand Herald, 5 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; was a key Crown witness at the trial.&lt;ref name="Why an innocent man would confess"/&gt; Court documents showed she was paid $5000 to testify against him at the trial.&lt;ref name="did"/&gt; Police have refused Official Information Act requests about payments made to other witnesses against Pora but the NZ Herald reports that a minimum of three witnesses were paid and received a total of $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10871565 Police censure profiler who spoke out about crime to Herald]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conviction of Malcolm Rewa for rape ===
In 1999, Malcolm Rewa was convicted of raping Ms Burdett after semen at the crime scene was found to be his. He was also found guilty of raping numerous other women and is currently serving preventive detention for these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10907529 Teina Pora case: Police fear miscarriage of justice], New Zealand Herald, 3 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Rewa's offending went on for some years before the police finally brought him to justice. In 2014, [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3's]] 3rd Degree programme suggested police had overlooked Rewa's involvement in six different sexual assaults. The [[Independent Police Conduct Authority|IPCA]] was then asked to investigate Rewa's offending including one particular sexual attack which occurred in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipca.govt.nz/includes/download.aspx?ID=134565 Report on the Police investigations into offending by Malcolm Rewa], IPCA 24 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; five years before he raped Susan Burdett. Police eventually apologised to Malcolm Rewa's victims over the length of time it took to catch him and prevent any further offending.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11298349 Police apologise for delay in catching rapist], New Zealand Herald, 24 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Rewa was also charged with the murder of Susan Burdett. But by that time, Pora had already been convicted for this. Although Rewa was found guilty for sexually assaulting Ms Burdett on the night she died, the jury was unable to decide whether he was involved in her murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipca.govt.nz/includes/download.aspx?ID=134565 Report on the Police investigations into offending by Malcolm Rewa], IPCA 24 July 2014, para 1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second trial 2000 ===

Pora appealed his conviction after the semen in Ms Burdett's body was found to belong to Malcolm Rewa.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The Court of Appeal ordered a retrial and in 2000, Pora was found guilty a second time.&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt; Pora then applied for the [[Royal Prerogative of Mercy]], under which the [[Governor-General of New Zealand|Governor-General]] can order a new trial.&lt;ref name="flawed"/&gt; In May 2013, his legal team prepared an appeal to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] to have his convictions quashed which put his application for the Royal Prerogative of Mercy on hold.&lt;ref name="path"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10881438 NZ murder appeal on path to top UK court]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parole hearings ===
Over his 20 years in prison, Pora made numerous appearances before the parole board. At those hearings he repeatedly denied he had any part in Burdett's murder, which made it difficult for the board to grant him parole.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; His 12th attempt to be released on parole was declined in October 2013 after he admitted visiting a prostitute with a former inmate while on temporary leave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/teina-pora-has-let-himself-down-lawyer-5654883 Teina Pora declined parole]. ''One News''. 21 OCtober 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally released in April 2014.&lt;ref name="Teina Pora released from prison"/&gt; At a monitoring hearing five months later, the board noted he was doing well but added: "Given his lengthy time in prison, and limited education before (being) imprisoned, (reintegration) will be a difficult and necessarily slow process of which he is aware."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/decisions-statistics-and-publications/decisions-of-public-interest/pora%2c_teina_26092014.html PORA, Teina 26/09/2014], New Zealand Parole Board.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128131848/http://www.paroleboard.govt.nz/decisions-statistics-and-publications/decisions-of-public-interest/pora%2C_teina_26092014.html |date=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privy Council hearing 2014 ===

On 31 January 2014 the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Judicial Committee]] announced that Pora had been granted permission to take his case to the Privy Council in London later in 2014. The hearing was held in November. Pora's lawyer Jonathan Krebs told the Privy Council his client had recently been diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and had a mental age of nine or 10 at the time of the crime. He said this disability meant Pora was easily confused, had a drive to please others, and that his confession in 1993 should therefore be seen as unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/258578/pora-lawyer-argues-confession-false Pora lawyer argues confession false], Radio New Zealand, 5 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions were also asked about the people named by Pora as having committed the murder. One of the Privy Council judges, Lord Toulson asked New Zealand's Solicitor-General "Why didn't Pora name [Malcolm] Rewa?" The explanation given by Pora's lawyers was that "Pora couldn't name Rewa because Pora didn't know him and because Pora wasn't there".&lt;ref name="Why didn't Pora name Malcolm Rewa"/&gt; The Solicitor General, Michael Heron, disagreed saying that a number of people had testified to having seen Pora and Rewa together and argued that Pora had special knowledge about the crime indicating he was involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11353378 Pora appeal: Error in not making rapist's impotence known, Privy Council told], New Zealand Herald, 5 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Privy Council quashed Pora's convictions on 3 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11411064 |title=Justice after 21 years in jail: Teina Pora 'set up for new life' after Privy Council quashes convictions for Susan Burdett murder |first=Phil |last=Taylor| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=4 March 2015 |accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compensation and apology ==
On 15 June 2016, Teina Pora was awarded NZ$2.52 million compensation and received a government apology for being wrongfully convicted of rape and murder. Retired High Court judge Rodney Hansen, [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], who was appointed by the government to review the case after the Privy Council quashed Pora's convictions, said he could have found Pora innocent on a higher standard than the balance of probabilities.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"/&gt;

In July 2017, Pora appealed the amount awarded, submitting that it had been calculated on 1998 guidelines that awarded $100,000 per year, and had not been adjusted for inflation as recommended by Judge Hansen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/334321/pora-heads-back-to-court-over-compensation-payout|accessdate=25 October 2017|title=Pora heads back to court over compensation payout|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Radio New Zealand - radionz.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court upheld the appeal in August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/338261/court-rules-for-teina-pora-in-compensation-battle|accessdate=25 October 2017|title=Court rules for Teina Pora in compensation battle|date=29 August 2017|publisher=Radio New Zealand - radionz.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|general election]] resulted in a change of government, and incoming Justice Minister [[Andrew Little (New Zealand politician)|Andrew Little]] announced that the outgoing government's intention to appeal the decision would not go ahead and Pora's compensation would be increased to match inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/342384/little-confirms-pora-compensation-will-be-adjusted|accessdate=25 October 2017|title=Little confirms Pora compensation will be adjusted|date=26 October 2017|publisher=Radio New Zealand - radionz.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Little announced Pora would receive an extra $988,099 bringing his total compensation to $3,509,048.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11941746 Teina Pora 'happy and free' after compensation adjusted for inflation by Government], NZ Herald, 8 November 2017
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns about conviction ==
Two police officers expressed concerns that Pora was wrongly convicted. Detective Sergeant Dave Henwood, a [[Offender profiling|criminal profiler]], believed Rewa raped and murdered Mrs Burdett and acted alone, based on his knowledge of Rewa's criminal signature. He also thought the reason the juries failed to convict Rewa of the murder was that they could not reconcile this possibility with the knowledge that Pora had already been convicted for it.&lt;ref name="reasonable"/&gt; In 2012 a second senior officer, who also worked on the case, wrote to Police Commissioner Peter Marshall expressing his concern that the wrong man had been convicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10813408 Second cop fears wrong man jailed for Burdett murder]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan's brother, Jim Burdett, also believed that Rewa was the one who raped and killed his sister. He believed Susan stood up for herself, that Rewa took the bat off her that she kept for self-defence and "struck the blows that killed her".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830957 Burdett's brother says Pora innocent]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malcolm Rewa's offending profile ===
When prosecuting Rewa, the police argued that Rewa and Pora committed the crime together. The difficulty with this view is that Rewa had a track record as a lone offender - a serial stalker and rapist who was convicted of attacks on 24 other women. Rewa and Pora also came from rival gangs and were significantly different in age; Rewa was 40 and a senior member of the [[Highway 61 Motorcycle Club|Highway 61]] gang while Pora was a 16-year-old [[Mongrel Mob]] associate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10806923 Reasonable doubts], ''New Zealand Herald'', 19 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence put to the Privy Council also suggested that Rewa suffered from erectile dysfunction and would have been unlikely to have had an accomplice because of his embarrassment about this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11353378 Pora appeal: Error in not making rapist's impotence known, Privy Council told], ''New Zealand Herald'', 5 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Laurence Alison, chair of forensic psychology at [[Liverpool University]], concluded that it is "highly unlikely" Malcolm Rewa would have worked with any co-offender, let alone with Pora. He said: "These conclusions would have been much harder to arrive at at the time of Teina Pora's appeal since far less was known about behavioural profiling and specific co-offending patterns in rape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10877287 British profiling expert backs Henwood on Burdett case]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pora's confession ===

According to ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' investigative reporter, Phil Taylor, who wrote extensively about the case, Pora's 'confession' was flawed. He "couldn't find the street Burdett lived in, couldn't point out her house when police stood him in front of it, described Burdett as fair and fat when she was dark and slim, didn't know the (victim's) bed was a waterbed...couldn't describe the house layout... didn't know the position her body was left in, (and) said she screamed and yelled when her closest neighbour heard only a series of dull thuds. And those he claimed had raped her were all cleared by DNA."&lt;ref name="reasonable"/&gt;&lt;ref name="did"/&gt;

[[Gisli Gudjonsson]], professor of forensic psychology at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]], [[King's College, London]], was asked to review the nine hours of videotaped interviews and talked with Pora in prison. Gudjonsson is an authority on how people can be induced to make false "confessions". He said Pora's confessions were the result of intellectual impairment and his desire to claim the $20,000 reward - Pora was told there was an "indemnity against prosecution for non-principal offenders".&lt;ref name="did"/&gt; Gudjonsson believed the convictions were "fundamentally flawed and unsafe".&lt;ref name="flawed"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10817983 Expert Burdett confession was utterly flawed]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calls for inquiry ===

In 2013, the Police Association officially called for a review of Pora's conviction, citing "sufficient concern among some senior detectives to warrant an inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/216199/pora%27s-legal-team-must-decide-next-step-minister|title = Pora's legal team must decide next step - minister|date = 5 August 2013|publisher = Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Māori Party]] also backed an inquiry in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Maori-Party-pushing-Poras-case/tabid/423/articleID/292192/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Maori Party pushing Pora's case| date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary about his case titled ''The Confessions of Prisoner T'' was aired on [[Maori Television]] on 5 May 2013. It featured defence lawyer, Marie Dyhrberg, who said that out of all the criminals she has ever been involved with, she believed in Pora's innocence more than any other.&lt;ref name="path" /&gt; In response to the documentary, the [[Green Party of New Zealand|Green Party]] also called for a review. Green Party spokesman [[David Clendon]] wrote to [[Commissioner of Police (New Zealand)|Police Commissioner]] [[Peter Marshall (police officer)|Peter Marshall]] asking him to reopen the case. He said "serious misconduct by police was rare in New Zealand", but "it was important to maintain the public's faith in the justice system by holding a review".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10881711 Greens call for review of Pora conviction] NZ Herald 6 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tom Bianchi''' (born 1945 in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]) is an American writer and [[photographer]] who specializes in male [[nude photography]].

==Career==
His 21 books of photographs, poems, and essays primarily cover the gay male experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/read/tom-bianchi-fire-island-pines-interview-photos].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[St. Martin's Press]] published ''Out of the Studio'', Bianchi's book of male nudes, frankly gay and affectionally connected.  Thereafter, 20 of Bianchi's books have been published, three documentary films about Bianchi's work have been distributed, and Bianchi's work has been published in more than thirty anthologies on the male nude.  His ''On the Couch'' series, ''Deep Sex'', ''Erotic Triggers'' and ''Fine Art Sex'' deal with the expression of conscious sexual energy.  His most recent book, made with his partner, Ben Smales, is ''Fire Island Pines Polaroids 1975–1983''. The book was honored by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the Best Photo Books of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Bianchi/e/B000API1H4].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and AIDS activism==
Bianchi was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago. He earned a law degree at [[Northwestern University]] and practiced corporate law for ten years.  At thirty-four, he left his position as senior counsel at [[Columbia Pictures]], tore up his law degree, pasted it into a painting and had his first one-man show with [[Betty Parsons]] and Carol Dreyfuss in New York.  Shortly thereafter, he had his first major museum retrospective at the [[Spoleto Festival]] in 1984.

Bianchi studied [[political science]] at the [[University of New Mexico]], and subsequently [[law]] at [[Northwestern University]]. He worked as a lawyer in [[Chicago]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] Bianchi resides in [[Palm Springs, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2016}} {{cite news | last = Murphy| first = Tim| title = Once on This Island| work = [[Out (magazine)|Out]] | publisher = Regent Entertainment Media Inc. | url = http://out.com/detail.asp?id=24123| access-date = January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{citation needed span|date=April 2016|text=Bianchi, who is [[HIV positive]], has been active in several projects devoted to the fight against AIDS. He is the co-founder of a [[biotechnology]] company and manages the funding for the development of new AIDS medication.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">'''Wilfred Le Bouthillier''' (born May 12, 1978) is an [[Acadian]] singer from the town of [[Tracadie-Sheila, New Brunswick|Tracadie-Sheila]], [[New Brunswick]] and the winner of the 2003 edition of [[Star Académie]], a [[Quebec]] [[reality show]] for aspiring singers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.last.fm/music/Wilfred+LeBouthillier&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He is known simply by his [[first name]], Wilfred. His debut album ''Wilfred Le Bouthillier'' was released in the autumn of 2003. Produced with the assistance of [[Cajun]] singer [[Zachary Richard]], it proved to be an enviable success, selling over 200,000 copies. This is exceptional for an artist in Quebec. By way of comparison, this would be equivalent to selling more than 8 million copies of an English-language album in the United States.

Among his awards and distinctions, Wilfred has received several "Prix Étoiles" (in Acadie). He took home the [[Juno Award for Francophone Album of the Year]] for his debut album, ''Wilfred Le Bouthillier''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soulshine.ca/news/newsarticle.php?nid=419 "CARAS Scores A Hit With 2004 Juno Awards"]. ''Soul Shine''. 2004-04-05&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated in several categories during the Quebec l'ADISQ 2005 gala, including one nomination in the Best Seller category. At the 16th SOCAN gala, his song "Je Ferai Tout," was listed among the top ten most played francophone songs on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qim.com/artistes/biographie.asp?artistid=571&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilfred recorded a follow-up album in 2005 called ''Poussières''. This album was another success for the artist, classified as the second best-selling album in Quebec and the twelfth best-seller in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The first song released from that album, "Avec Toi," made it to the top 5 in the top 100 radio BDS countdown while the video also placed the song in the top 5 on [[Musique Plus]] and [[Musimax]] (the Francophone version of MuchMusic).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archambault.ca/poussieres-ACH001792138-fr-pr?origin=cross_sales&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of August, 2007, "L'insignifiant," also from the album "Poussières," was sitting at number seven on Quebec's "Top 50 Radio Correspondants Francophone."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2579">'''Zafeirakis Theodosiou''' ({{lang-el|Ζαφειράκης Θεοδοσίου}}) (1772 - 1822) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] ''prokritos'' (πρόκριτος), meaning political leader of Greeks during Ottoman rule, of [[Naousa, Imathia]] and an important figure of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].

==Life==

Zafeirakis was born in [[Naousa, Imathia]] originating from a wealthy family that gave him the opportunity to educate himself to the most important institutions of his time. He studied at [[Ioannina]] where he spent most of his youth. 
At that time, [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]] was ruling the area and valuing Zafeirakis' skills took him under his protection and later appointed him to administrate Naoussa when he extended his influence to Central Macedonia.

But Zafeirakis quickly opposed Ali Pasha's authoritative administration. As a result, Ali Pasha turned against him and he was forced to abandon his place for [[Thessaloniki]] and later [[Mount Athos]] and [[Constantinople]]. There he was associated with Ottoman authorities and twelve years later he managed to receive an order from the [[Sultan]] to return to his previous
command to Naussa where he stayed until his death.

He became very popular to his fellow citizens by promoting local manufactures, especially those that had to do with weaponry, building schools, churches and road construction. Around 1820 he was introduced into [[Filiki Eteria]] and came close with [[Anastasios Karatasos]] and [[Aggelis Gatsos]], assigning them to protect his area. He personally organised the liberation of Naoussa on February 19, 1822, becoming one of the first liberated cities in Macedonia during the [[Greek War of Independence|Revolution]].
However, in April the Pasha of Thessaloniki himself besieged Naoussa with 18,000 men and two weeks later he managed to regain control over the city. Zafeirakis and his family lost their lives during the following pillage.
