      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5309">'''Abdus Salam''' ({{lang-ar| عبد السلام}}) is a male Muslim honorific or given name, built on the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Š-L-M|Salam]]''. The name means "servant of the All-peaceable", ''as-Salam'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the letter s is a [[sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the letter l of the ''al-'' is assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written with letters corresponding to ''Abd al-Salam'', the usual pronunciation corresponds to ''Abd as-Salam''. Alternative transliterations include ''Abdul Salam'', ''Abdul Salaam'',  ''Abdus Salam'' and others, all subject to variant spacing and hyphenation.

'''Adam Sultanovich Delimkhanov''' ({{lang-ru|Адам Султанович Делимханов}}) (born September 25, 1969) is a [[Chechnya|Chechen]] politician who has been member of the [[Russia]]n [[State Duma]] for the [[United Russia]] party since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duma.gov.ru/structure/deputies/131490/ Delimkhanov's profile] at the State Duma website. Retrieved on April 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A close associate and cousin&lt;ref name="newsru"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsru.ru/russia/07apr2009/yamadaevy.html|script-title=ru:Депутат Делимханов хочет судиться с полицией ОАЭ за ложные обвинения в убийстве Ямадаева|date=7 April 2009|publisher=[[NEWSru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the pro-[[Moscow]] Chechen leader [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], Delimkhanov headed the police division that protected Chechen oil facilities from 2003 to 2006. He was appointed deputy prime minister overseeing security forces in 2006. The next year he was elected to the Russian State Duma on a [[Vladimir Putin]]-led United Russia party ticket.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/world/europe/06chechnya.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home Dubai Police Link Murder of Chechen to Russian].

A Chechen exile, [[Umar Israilov]], murdered in [[Vienna]] in January 2009, had accused Delimkhanov of beating him in Kadyrov's presence. Delimkhanov declined requests for comment on the allegation. In April 2009, the [[Dubai]] police blamed Delimkhanov for having ordered the assassination of the former Chechen warlord and Russian military commander [[Sulim Yamadayev]]. Delimkhanov denied the accusation, saying it was a provocation directed to destabilize Chechnya&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; and that he is preparing to sue Dubai police for libel.&lt;ref name="newsru"/&gt;

As of April 2009, Delimkhanov — along with six other Russian citizens — is wanted by Dubai, one of the [[Emirates of the United Arab Emirates|emirates of the UAE]], in connection with the murder of Sulim Yamadayev, via [[Interpol]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]] 27 April 2009 14:41:22 [[GMT]]: [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/LR736521.htm Interpol issues arrest warrant in Chechen murder]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Atanas Sielava''' ({{lang-be|Антон Сялява}}, {{lang-uk|Антін Селява}}, {{lang-pl|Antoni Sielawa}}) (1583 &amp;ndash; 5 October 1655) was the [[List of Major Archbishops of Kiev–Galicia|Metropolitan of Kiev, Galicia and Russia]] of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] from 1641 to his death in 1655.

==Life==
Atanas Sielava was born on about 1583 in the [[Polotsk Voivodeship]] from a family of Cossack origin and belonging to the Orthodox religion. In 1612 he entered in the [[Order of Saint Basil the Great]], in the monastery of the Holy Trinity in [[Vilnius]],{{r|EP}} taking the religious name of Anton (Antony). He lived for some time in the same cell with [[Josaphat Kuntsevych|Saint Josaphat Kuntsevich]] and he was ordained a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1617. He studied in the [[Roman Colleges#Collegio Greco|Greek College in Rome]] from 1617 to September 1619.{{r|PGCR}}

On 12 November 1623 the bishop of [[Polotsk]], Josaphat Kuntsevich (later declared a [[Saint]]), was killed by an Orthodox mob. After him, Anton Sielava was appointed to the [[episcopal see|See]] of Polotsk.{{r|EOU}} He was consecrated a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] in early 1624 by Metropolitan [[Joseph Rutski]] and enthroned on 14 February 1624.{{r|HKV}}

To Metropolitan Joseph Rutski succeeded Metropolitan [[Rafajil Korsak]], who, when in 1639 left [[Belarus]] to go to [[Rome]] for [[Visit ad Limina]], appointed Sielava as [[Vicarius]] for the Church. Rafajil Korsak died in Rome in August 1640 and, according to his last will, [[Pope Urban VIII]] confirmed Sielava as new Metropolitan after the usual process of eligibility.{{r|EP}} Anton Sielava was so formally appointed Metropolitan of Kiev on 18 March 1641.{{r|HC4}} His patriarchate was initially marked by the [[beatification]], on 16 May 1643, of Josaphat Kuntsevich.

Following his predecessors Joseph Rutski and Rafajil Korsak, Sielava went on in negotiations with the Orthodox Patriarch of Kiev, [[Peter Mogila]] about the way to unify the Ukrainian Church.{{r|Baran}} However he was not a person of the stamp of his predecessors, and after the death of Mogila (1646), the discussions ended without results.

Sielava left much part of the administration of the Church to others, and he was of a sickly disposition and quite [[hypochondriac]],{{r|Senyk}} and in the last part of his life he was seriously ill and blind.{{r|Pelesz}}

Since 1648, the political situation in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] underwent years of crisis due to the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], a [[Cossack]] rebellion in [[Ukraine]] fiercely anti-Catholic, followed by the [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)]] and [[Second Northern War]]. The Greek-Catholic Church was seriously threaten, many churches, monasteries and schools were destroyed, and priests and monks killed.{{r|Baran|page1=231}} Sielava had to leave Polotsk and died on 5 October 1655,{{r|HKV}} when already (since 1653) the Greek-Catholic Church was in the resolute hands of [[Gabriel Kolenda]].

==Works==
Anton Sielava was also a writer and a [[polemist]]. Among his works we have his "''Antelenchus''", against the "''Elenchum''" of [[Meletius Smotrytski]], and his "''Vitam Servi Dei  Josaphat, Archiepiscopi Polocensis''" (Life of the Servant of God Josaphat, bishop of Polotsk) edited in 1624.{{r|EP}}

'''Bampfylde Moore Carew''' (1693–1759) was an English [[rogue (vagrant)|rogue]], [[Vagabond (person)|vagabond]] and [[impostor]], who claimed to be King of the [[Beggars]].

==Life==
He was the son of Reverend Theodore Carew, rector of [[Bickleigh, Mid Devon|Bickleigh]]. The Carews were a well-established [[Devon]]shire family. Although they had a reputation for adventurousness, Bampfylde Moore Carew took this to extremes, if his [[picaresque]] [[memoirs]] are to be believed. Little is known about his life beyond these, in which he is described on the title-page as ''"the Noted Devonshire Stroller and Dogstealer"''.

==''The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew''==

===Literary history===
''The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew'' was first published in 1745. Although it states that the contents were ''"noted by himself during his passage to America"'' and it is likely facts were supplied by Carew, the author was probably [[Robert Goadby]], a printer in [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]], who published an early edition in 1749. It has been suggested that Carew dictated his memoirs to Mrs. Goadby.

The ''Life and Adventures'' continued to be a best seller throughout the next hundred years in numerous editions as books and [[chapbook]]s. He became a nationally known character, appealing to a provincial audience. One edition of his life was printed in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in 1785.

How much of the Life is true is impossible now to know. Carew certainly travelled and is likely to have indulged in minor crimes but many stories seem too fantastic or literary to be true. It appealed to the market for mild 'rogue' literature and many editions included a [[thieves' cant|canting]] dictionary. The public found ''The Life'' appealing: an educated man from a good family who spent his life ingeniously and audaciously outwitting the establishment, including people who should have recognised him and without ever doing anything really bad.

Carew seemingly settled in [[Bickleigh, Mid Devon|Bickleigh]] towards the end of his life. This may have been because of an offer of support from his relative, Sir Thomas Carew of Bickerton, winning a lottery, or because of age and weariness. Some editions of ''The Life and Adventures'' suggest Carew reflected with sadness on how 'idly' he had spent his life, perhaps making a racy story acceptable by adding a moral ending.

Carew died at [[Bickleigh, Mid Devon|Bickleigh]] in 1759, leaving a daughter.

===Contents===
Carew claims to have taken to the road after he ran away from [[Blundell's School]] in [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]]. With friends, he chased a deer through fields causing damage, which caused farmers to complain to the headmaster. Carew ran away and, at an alehouse, fell in with a band of “gypsies”. (These were almost certainly not [[Romani people|Romany]] but [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s living off their wits.) Carew travelled widely, at first around Devon and then around England, supporting himself by playing confidence tricks on the wealthy.

His first trick involved a “Madam Musgrove”, who asked for his help in discovering treasure she believed was hidden on her land. Carew, consulting “the secrets of his arts” for a fee of 20 guineas, informed her it was under a laurel tree but that she should not seek it until a particular day and hour. Of course by the appointed hour Carew and her money were long gone. This was a well-known and documented trick from a period when [[cunning folk]] were often consulted about lost items.

Carew claimed to be a master of disguise, in which he followed the tradition of [[counterfeit]] [[rogue (vagrant)|rogue]]s dating back to [[Thomas Harman]]. He masqueraded as a shipwrecked sailor (a popular way to claim [[alms]]), a clergyman, and defrauding “Squire Portman” twice in one day, first as a rat-catcher and then a woman whose daughter had been killed in a fire, (another staple of fraudulent beggars).

Carew then travelled to [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], where he stayed a short time. On his return, he pretended to be the mate of a vessel and eloped with the daughter of a respectable apothecary of [[Newcastle on Tyne]], whom he afterwards married. After further years as a vagabond, he claimed to have been elected [[King of the Gypsies]] upon the death of Clause Patch. The ceremony described reproduces one from [[Thomas Harman]]’s ''Caveat for Common Cursitors'', via the popular play The [[Beggars' Bush]] by [[Francis Beaumont]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], and [[Philip Massinger]] in which Clause is a character.

Carew was convicted of being an idle vagrant and sentenced to be transported to [[Maryland]]. There he attempted to escape, was captured, escaped again, and fell in with friendly Indians. He travelled to [[Pennsylvania]], swam the [[Delaware]], adopted the guise of a Quaker, and made his way to [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Carew, Bamfylde Moore|first=John|last=Ashton|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having embarked for England, he escaped being pressed to serve in the Navy by pricking his hands and face, and rubbing in bay salt and gunpowder, so as to simulate smallpox. 
Such tricks were commonplaces in rogue literature. 
On returning to England, he claims to have found his wife and daughter and then travelled to Scotland by 1745 in time to accompany [[Charles Edward Stuart]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and [[Derby]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

An interesting aside is that when he was sentenced to be transported to Maryland it was in the ships of a company run by a family of Bideford Port, Devon, which later married into the Moore, Bampfylde, and Carew families. 

There is a Bond and a Contract from Mr Davy, Clerk of the Peace and Justices, for the transport of Richard Bond, Bampfield Moore Carew, William Crocker, Abraham Hart, Edward Browne, John Smith, Judith Daw and Mary Underhill to Virginia. Bampfield Moore Carew's name is inserted in the Bond only.&lt;ref&gt;QS/129/21  1738 Devon Quarter Session Records [[Devon Record Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; The trade of transporting convicts was common from the west country ports in the 18th century as a return cargo for the tobacco trades, Bideford being one of the major centres for such imports.

[[File:The Cock.jpg|thumb|Painting of the first Cock Hotel in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Surrey]] by [[Thomas Rowlandson]] in 1789.&lt;ref name=Harper1922&gt;{{citation |title=The Brighton Road |pages=158–159 |author=Charles Harper |year=1922 |publisher=Cecil Palmer|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''coaching inn''' (also '''coaching house''' or '''staging inn''') was a vital part of Europe's inland transport infrastructure until the [[History of rail transport|development of the railway]], providing a resting point for people and horses. The [[inn]] served the needs of travellers, for food, drink, and rest. The attached stables, staffed by [[hostler]]s, cared for the horses, including changing a tired team for a fresh one. Coaching inns were used by private travellers in their [[coach (carriage)|coaches]], the public riding [[stagecoaches]] between one town and another, and (in England at least) the [[mail coach]]. Just as with [[roadhouse (facility)|roadhouses]] in other countries, although many survive, and some still offer overnight accommodation, in general coaching inns have lost their original function and now operate as ordinary [[pub]]s.

==Description==
Coaching [[inn]]s stabled teams of horses for [[stagecoach]]es and [[mail coach]]es and replaced tired teams with fresh teams. Traditionally they were seven miles apart but this depended very much on the terrain. Some English towns had as many as ten such inns and rivalry between them was intense, not only for the income from the stagecoach operators but for the revenue for food and drink supplied to the passengers. [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], [[Hertfordshire]] still has an unusually high number of historic pubs along its high street due to its former position on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] from London to the North of England.

==Historic inns==
[[File:thegeorgesouthwark.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The George Inn, Southwark]] is the only galleried coaching inn to survive in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubs.com/main_site/pub_details.php?pub_id=92|title=pubs.com - pubs Resources and Information.|work=Pubs.com|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There were many coaching inns in what is now [[central London]]. The only remaining one with the galleries to the bedrooms above is [[The George Inn, Southwark]], owned by the [[National Trust]] and still run as a pub. Many have been demolished and plaques mark their location. The [[Nomura]] building close to the [[Museum of London]] on [[London Wall]] commemorates the "Bull and Mouth" Inn; Golden Cross House, opposite [[St Martin's in the Fields]] recalls the Golden Cross, Charing Cross coaching inn.

Historic inns in Oxford include The [[Bear Inn, Oxford|Bear Inn]] (originally established in 1242) and the [[Lamb &amp; Flag (Oxford)|Lamb &amp; Flag]].

Those in Wales include the [[Black Boy Inn]] (built 1522) and the [[Groes Inn]] (1573).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groesinn.com|title=Hotels in North Wales - Dog Friendly Conwy Hotels - The Groes Inn|work=The Groes Inn|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Lion in Cardigan (established 1105) is probably the oldest Welsh coaching inn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblacklion-hotel.co.uk/home.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413074232/http://www.theblacklion-hotel.co.uk/home.html |date=April 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cock and Bull==

[[File:StonyStratford CockandBull.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Public house#Pub signs|Pub signs]] of the Cock and the Bull]]
A pair of coaching inns alongside the former [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]] or the old [[Roman road]] [[Watling Street]] in [[Stony Stratford]] ([[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]]), named respectively 'The Cock' and 'The Bull', are said to have given rise to the term "cock and bull stories." Coaches or the [[Mail coach]] would stop in the town on their way from London to the North and many a traveller's tall tale would be further embellished as it passed between the two hostelries, fuelled by [[ale]] and an interested audience. Hence any suspiciously elaborate tale would become a cock and bull story.
This is a cock and bull story in itself, however; as there is no evidence to suggest that this is where the phrase originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-coc6.htm|title=World Wide Words: Cock and bull story|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase, first recorded in 1621, may instead be an allusion to Aesop's fables, with their incredible talking animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cock|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=Etymonline.com|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this slightly predates coaching inns, the names of the two inns could have been a reference to "Cock and Bull stories" as to encourage the passing of such anecdotes within their doors.

'''Copts in Egypt''' refers to [[Coptic people]] born in or residing in [[Egypt]].

Coptic people are the largest [[ethno-religious]] minority in Egypt. The largest Coptic Christian group in Egypt is the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox Church]] with a population of at least 7,200,000&lt;ref name="U.S.Dept of State/Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm|title= Egypt from "U.S. Department of State/Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs"|date=September 30, 2008 |publisher= [[United States Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FCO/Egypt/"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|title=Egypt from "Foreign and Commonwealth Office"|date=August 15, 2008|publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign and Commonwealth Office -UK Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121212135632/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/middle-east-north-africa/egypt|archivedate=December 12, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle Eastern Christians"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGL7o69KBIC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=coptic+orthodox&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0ROIHZ4FFm&amp;sig=DcEAaveJzQsCeS1tQK-liQc54cM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=es46SqsUiP61A9ufrOUK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1|title=Who are the Christians in the Middle East?|date=June 18, 2009|publisher=Betty Jane Bailey | isbn=978-0-8028-1020-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/copticchristians.htm ''Tour Egypt''].

==History==
{{further information|Christianity in Egypt}}
[[File:Copts-with-Nasser-1965.jpg|180px|thumb|right|President Nasser welcomes a delegation of Coptic bishops (1965)]]
[[File:Coptic flag.svg|thumb|180px|[[Coptic flag]].]]

Under Muslim rule, the ethnic Copts were cut off from the mainstream of Christianity, and were compelled to adhere to the [[Pact of Umar]] covenant, thus assigned to [[Dhimmi]] status. Their position improved dramatically under the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in the early 19th century. He abolished the [[Jizya]] (a tax on non-Muslims) and allowed ethnic Copts to enroll in the army. [[Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria|Pope Cyril IV]], 1854–61, reformed the church and encouraged broader Coptic participation in Egyptian affairs. Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha]], in power 1863–79, further promoted the Copts. He appointed them judges to Egyptian courts and awarded them political rights and representation in government. They flourished in business affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Todros, ch 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ethnic Copts participated in the Egyptian national movement for independence and occupied many influential positions. Two significant cultural achievements include the founding of the [[Coptic Museum]] in 1910 and the Higher Institute of Coptic Studies in 1954. Some prominent Coptic thinkers from this period are [[Salama Moussa]], [[Louis Awad]] and Secretary General of the [[Wafd Party]] [[Makram Ebeid]].

In 1952, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] led some army officers in a coup d'état against [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]], which overthrew the Kingdom of Egypt and established a republic. [[Nasser]]'s mainstream policy was [[pan-Arab]] nationalism and socialism. The ethnic Copts were severely affected by Nasser's nationalization policies, though they represented about 10–20% of the population.&lt;ref name="nisan"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nisan | first = Mordechai | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Minorities in the Middle East | publisher = McFarland | year = 2002 | page = 144 | isbn = 978-0-7864-1375-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Nasser's pan-Arab policies undermined the Copts' strong attachment to and sense of identity about their Egyptian pre-Arab, and certainly non-Arab identity which resulted in permits to construct churches to be delayed along with Christian religious courts to be closed.&lt;ref name= nisan/&gt;

===Pharaonism===
{{main article|Pharaonism}}
Many Coptic intellectuals hold to "Pharaonism," which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. However, some Western scholars today argue that Pharaonism was a late development shaped primarily by [[Orientalism]], and doubt its validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jacques | last = van der Vliet | title = The Copts: 'Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'? | journal = Church History &amp; Religious Culture |date=June 2009 | volume = 89 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 279–90 | doi=10.1163/187124109x407934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Donald Malcolm | last = Reid| title= Whose Pharaohs?: Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FeviPDy08e8C&amp;pg=PA258 |year= 2003|publisher= U. of California Press|pages= 258ff | chapter = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persecution and discrimination in Egypt==
{{Main article|Persecution of Copts|Religion in Egypt}}

[[Freedom of religion|Religious freedom]] in Egypt is hampered to varying degrees by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Coptic Christians, being the largest religious minority in Egypt, are also negatively affected. Copts have faced increasing [[marginalization]] after the 1952 [[coup d'état]] led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Until recently, [[Christians]] were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches. Although the law was eased in 2005 by handing down the authority of approval to the governors, Copts continue to face many obstacles and restrictions in building new churches. These restrictions do not apply for building mosques.&lt;ref&gt;WorldWide Religious News.

The Coptic community has been targeted by hate crimes resulting in Copts being victims of murder by Islamic extremists. The most significant was the 2000–01 El Kosheh attacks, in which Muslims and Christians were involved in bloody inter-religious clashes following a dispute between a Muslim and a Christian. "Twenty Christians and one Muslim were killed after violence broke out in the town of el-Kosheh, {{convert|440|km|mi}} south of Cairo".&lt;ref name="Egyptian court orders clashes retrial"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1465023.stm|title= Egyptian court orders clashes retrial|date=July 30, 2001|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Christian Concern]] reported that in February 2001, Muslims burned a new Egyptian church and the homes of 35 Christians, and that in April 2001 a 14-year-old Egyptian Christian girl was kidnapped because her parents were believed to be harboring a person who had [[Religious conversion|converted]] from [[Islam]] to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9C0zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RggGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6308,5873985&amp;dq=international-christian-concern&amp;hl=en |title=Copts Under Fire |author= |publisher=The Free Lance-Star |date=November 23, 2002 |accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist [[John R. Bradley]] writing around 2008 noted that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;" ... other longstanding Coptic complaints include the under-representation  of Christians in the police, judiciary, armed forces, civil service, government, and education system. There is also a virtual ban on access to state-controlled radio and television. One oft-cited example of official discrimination is a law that, until recently, required personal presidential approval to carry out even simple church repairs, such as fixing a toilet and which was blamed for delays of more than a decade in the issuing of permits to build churches. Mubarak eased the law in 2005, delegating such responsibility to local governors."&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Members of U.S. Congress have expressed concern about "human trafficking" of Coptic women and girls who are victims of abductions, forced conversion to Islam, sexual exploitation and forced marriage to Muslim men.&lt;ref name="trafficking"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/04/21/house-members-press-white-house-confront-egypt-forced-marriages/ | title = House Members Press White House to Confront Egypt on Forced Marriages | last = Abrams | first = Joseph |date = April 21, 2010 | work = foxnews.com | accessdate = November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] was a Copt who served as [[Egypt]]'s foreign minister under President [[Anwar Sadat]]. During Mubarak regime, there were two Copts serving on [[Egypt]]'s governmental cabinet: Finance Minister [[Youssef Boutros Ghali]] and Environment Minister Magued George. There was also one Coptic governor out of 25, that of the [[upper Egypt]]ian governorate of [[Qena]], and the first Coptic governor in a few decades. In addition, [[Naguib Sawiris]], an extremely successful businessman, is a Copt who lived in Egypt during that era. In 2002, under the [[Mubarak]] government, [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Christmas]] (January 7) was recognized as an official holiday.&lt;ref&gt;ArabicNews.com.

While freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Egyptians are able to [[Religious conversion|convert]] to Islam generally without difficulty, but Muslims who convert to Christianity face difficulties in getting new identity papers and some have been arrested for allegedly forging such documents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/egypt14701.htm Human Rights Watch.

Security agencies will sometimes claim that such conversions from [[Islam]] to [[Christianity]] (or occasionally vice versa) may stir social unrest, and thereby justify themselves in wrongfully detaining the subjects, insisting that they are simply taking steps to prevent likely social troubles from happening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comeandsee.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=502 Egypt: Egypt Arrests 22 Muslim converts to Christianity].

The Egyptian Census of 1897 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 14.7% (13.2% Christians, 1.4% Jews). The Egyptian Census of 1986 reported the percentage of Non-Muslims in Urban Provinces as 6.1% (5.7% Christians, 0% Jews). The decline in the Jewish representation is interpreted through the creation of the state of Israel, and the subsequent emigration of the Egyptian Jews. There is no explanation for a 55% decline in the percentage of Christians in Egypt. It has been suggested that Egyptian censuses held after 1952 have been politicized to under-represent the Christian population.

In August 2013, following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|3 July 2013 Coup]] and clashes between the military and Morsi supporters, there were [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état#Violence against Coptic Christians|widespread attacks]] on Coptic churches and institutions in Egypt by [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chulov | first = Martin | title= Egypt's Coptic Christians report fresh attacks on churches: Christian leaders blame Muslim Brotherhood supporters for arson and other attacks, including shooting death of teenage girl | work= The Guardian | date= Aug 15, 2013 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/15/egypt-coptic-christians-attacks-churches | accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[military doctrine]], '''countervalue''' is the targeting of an opponent's assets which are of value but not actually a military threat, such as cities and civilian populations.  [[Counterforce]] is the targeting of an opponent's military forces and facilities.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed., records the first use of the word in 1660 and the first use in the modern sense in 1965, where it is described as a "[[euphemism]] for attacking cities".

==Theory==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
In [[warfare]], and in particular [[nuclear warfare]], enemy targets can be divided into two general types: counterforce military targets and countervalue civilian targets. These terms were not used during the [[Second World War]] bombing of civilian populations and targets not directly military.

The rationale behind countervalue targeting is that when two sides have both achieved [[assured destruction]] capability—that is, when the nuclear arsenals of each side have the apparent ability to survive a wide range of counterforce attacks, and carry out a [[second strike]] in response—then, in an all-out nuclear war, the value of targeting the opponent's nuclear arsenal diminishes, and the value of targeting the opponent's cities and civilians increases.  This line of reasoning, however, assumes that the opponent values its civilians over its military forces.

One view argues that countervalue targeting upholds [[nuclear deterrence]] because both sides are more likely to believe in each other's [[no first use]] policy.  The line of reasoning is that if an aggressor [[first strike|strikes first]] with nuclear weapons against an opponent's countervalue targets, then, by definition, such an attack does not degrade the opponent's military capacity to retaliate.

The opposing view, however, counters that countervalue targeting is neither moral nor credible because if an aggressor should strike first with nuclear weapons against only a limited number of a defender's counterforce military targets, the defender should not retaliate in this situation against the aggressor's civilian populace.

However, another position is that because they are the aggressor, and therefore are starting the conflict, they should not be treated with a "gloves-on" approach, as that would give further incentive to be an aggressor.

==International law==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The intentional targeting of civilians with military force, including nuclear weapons, is prohibited by [[international law]].  In particular, the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] prevents attacks on certain types of civilian targets and the [[Protocol I]] states that civilian objects are not acceptable military targets.  (Not all states are party to Protocol I.)  Nonetheless, "proportional" [[collateral damage]] is allowed, which could justify attacks on military objectives in cities. Many strategic military facilities like bomber airfields were located near cities. Command and control centers were located in Moscow, Washington D.C., and other cities.

[[File:Paul Schreber.jpg|thumb|Daniel Paul Schreber]]

'''Daniel Paul Schreber''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃʀeːbɐ|lang}}; 25 July 1842 &amp;ndash; 14 April 1911) was a German judge who suffered from what was then diagnosed as [[dementia praecox]] (later known as [[paranoid schizophrenia]] or schizophrenia, paranoid type). He described his second [[psychiatric disease|mental illness]] (1893–1902), making also a brief reference to the first disorder (1884–1885) in his book ''Memoirs of My Nervous Illness'' (original German title ''Denkwürdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is no personal account of his third disorder (1907–1911), but some details about it can be found in the Hospital Chart (in Appendix to Lothane's book). During his second illness he was treated by Prof. [[Paul Flechsig]] (Leipzig University Clinic), Dr. Pierson (Lindenhof), and Dr. Guido Weber (Royal Public Asylum, [[Sonnenstein Castle|Sonnenstein]]).

==Schreber's experiences==
Schreber was a successful and highly respected judge until middle age when the onset of his [[psychosis]] occurred. He woke up one morning with the thought that it would be pleasant to "succumb" to sexual intercourse as a woman. He was alarmed and felt that this thought had come from somewhere else, not from himself. He even hypothesized that the thought had come from a doctor who had experimented with hypnosis on him; he thought that the doctor had telepathically invaded his mind. He believed his primary psychiatrist, Prof. [[Paul Flechsig]], had contact with him using a "nerve-language" of which Schreber said humans are unaware. He believed that hundreds of people's souls took special interest in him, and contacted his nerves by using "divine rays", telling him special information, or requesting things of him. During one of his stays at the Sonnenstein asylum, he concluded that there are "fleeting-improvised-men" in the world, which he believed were divinely fabricated men, as miracles to provide Schreber with "play-with-humans" in light of a depopulation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As his psychosis progressed, he believed that God was turning him into a woman, sending rays down to enact 'miracles' upon him, including little men to torture him. Schreber was released from psychiatric hospitals around 1902, shortly before the publication of his book. He reassumed his private activities, which he conducted very well up to 1907, when his mother died. He went then through a final hospitalisation. Schreber died in 1911, in an asylum.

Though Schreber's book was made famous because of its value as a psychological memoir, the reason Schreber wrote the book was not for reasons of psychology. Schreber's purpose was expressed in its subtitle (which was not translated as part of the English edition, but fully reproduced inside it): "In what circumstance can a person deemed insane be detained in an asylum against his declared will?" Schreber, an accomplished jurist, wrote these memoirs in order to pose a legal question, namely, to what extent is it legitimate to keep someone like himself in an asylum when he expressly declares he desires his liberty.

=== Schreber's Cosmology ===

The fundamental unit of Schreber's cosmology were "nerves", which composed both the human soul and the nature of God in relation to humanity. Each human soul was composed of nerves which derived from God who with "His" own nerves was the ultimate source of human existence. God's nerves and those of humanity existed parallel to one another except when the "Order of the World" was violated which constituted the fundamental premise of Schreber's memoirs- in which the two universes experienced dangerous "nerve-contact" with each other. For Schreber this was focused upon his personal and institutional relationship with Dr. Flechsig, who became a rebellious "nerve specialist" by virtue of his psychiatric power in contrast to the "Omnipotence" of God.

The peculiar universe of Schreber's was mediated by the activity of rays, which could assume a "pure" and "impure" relation; these rays could be controlled by Flechsig or emanated strictly from God, who sought to influence Schreber and his reality by "divine miracles". The rays had the capacity for independent activity, though they were distinguished from souls and nerves (generally identical) which emanated from other human beings deceased or living. Within Schreber's cosmology the universe as an observable reality, and the Sun especially, was a partially independent realm which God merely communicated through, using rays and miracles to influence at times when the "Order of the World" needed to be adjusted. Strictly speaking God only initiated nerve-contact with human beings through dreams or inspired states (in poetry, etc.), or when humans had become corpses and returned to the "forecourts of Heaven" after purification to rejoin the 'nerve soul' of God. However, the entire crisis which Schreber describes in his book is the dangerous combination between humanity and God within the mind of Schreber.

Schreber's cosmology can be schematized in this way:

*God - Upper and lower (Ormuzd and Ariman, respectively, derived from Persian theology)

*The "forecourts of Heaven" - The "states of Blessedness" where deceased humans' souls reside after a process of "purification" (These are called the "anterior realms of God" in contradistinction to the "posterior" realms which consist of the upper and lower Gods)

*The Universe - Separated from the transcendental sphere of God providing the human/material world and yet threatening God's invested existence within it; celestial bodies allow the means for God's life/light to interact with His creations

*Divine rays - Semi-sentient entities (which are the cosmic fuel of God's Omnipotence, and influence Schreber and the world but can be manipulated by Flechsig)

*Nerves/Souls - The spiritual bodies of humans which are active whether the living person is alive or dead, and go through various states of purification in order to return to God's nerves in a "state of Blessedness" (there is no Hell in Schreber's cosmology)

==Freud's interpretation and its criticisms==
Although Freud never interviewed Schreber himself, he read his ''Memoirs'' and drew his own conclusions from it in an essay entitled "Psycho-Analytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)" (1911). Freud thought that Schreber's disturbances resulted from repressed homosexual desires, which in infancy were oriented at his father and brother. Repressed inner drives were projected onto the outside world and led to intense hallucinations which were first centred on his physician Dr. Flechsig (projection of his feelings towards brother), and then around God (who represented Schreber's father, [[Daniel Gottlob Moritz Schreber]]). During the first phase of his illness Schreber was certain that Dr. Flechsig persecuted him and made direct attempts to murder his soul and change him into a woman (he had what Freud thought to be [[emasculation]] hallucinations, which were in fact, according to Schreber's words an "unmanning" (''entmannung'') experience). In the next period of his ailment he was convinced that God and the order of things demanded of him that he must be turned into a woman so that he could be the sole object of sexual desire of God. Consideration of the Schreber case led Freud to revise received classification of mental disturbances. He argued that the difference between [[paranoia]] and [[dementia praecox]] is not at all clear, since symptoms of both ailments may be combined in any proportion, as in Schreber's case. Therefore, Freud concluded, it may be necessary to introduce a new diagnostic notion: paranoid dementia, which does justice to polymorphous mental disturbances such as those exhibited by the judge.

Freud's interpretation has been contested by a number of subsequent theorists, most notably [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their work ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' and elsewhere. Their reading of Schreber's ''Memoirs'' is a part of their wider criticism of familial orientation of psychoanalysis and it foregrounds the political and racial elements of the text; they see Schreber's written experience of reality abnormal only in its honesty about the experience of power in late capitalism. [[Elias Canetti]] also devoted the closing chapters of his theoretical magnum opus ''[[Crowds and Power]]'' to a reading of Schreber. Finally, [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Seminar on the Psychoses'' and one of his ''écrits'' "On a Question prior to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis" are predominantly concerned with reading and evaluating Schreber's text over-against Freud's original and originating interpretation.

==Schatzman's interpretation==
In 1974, Morton Schatzman published ''Soul Murder'', in which he gave his own interpretation of Schreber's psychosis. Schatzman's interpretation was in turn based on [[William Guglielmo Niederland|W. G. Niederland's]] research from the '50s, (Niederland had previously worked with survivors of Nazi concentration camps).&lt;ref&gt;Niederland, W G. Schreber: Father and Son. Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 28 Apr 1959 (2), 151-169&lt;/ref&gt; Schatzman had found child-rearing pamphlets written by Moritz Schreber, Daniel Schreber's father, which stressed the necessity of taming the rebellious savage beast in the child and turning him into a productive citizen. Many of the techniques recommended by [[Moritz Schreber]] were mirrored in Daniel Schreber's psychotic experiences. For example, one of the "miracles" described by Daniel Schreber was that of chest compression, of tightening and tightening. This can be seen as analogous to one of Moritz Schreber's techniques of an elaborate contraption which confined the child's body, forcing him to have a "correct" posture at the dinner table. Similarly, the "freezing miracle" might mirror Moritz Schreber's recommendation of placing the infant in a bath of ice cubes beginning at age three months. Daniel Paul Schreber's older brother, Daniel Gustav Schreber, committed suicide in his thirties. Han Israels argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman, claiming that Schreber's father had been unfairly criticized in the literature, in his 1989 book ''Schreber: Father and Son''.&lt;ref&gt;Israels, H. (1989). ''Schreber: Father and Son''. Madison: International Universities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lothane's interpretation==
More recently, [[Henry Zvi Lothane]] has argued against the interpretations of Niederland and Schatzman in his book ''In Defense of Schreber. Soul Murder and Psychiatry''.&lt;ref&gt;Lothane. H. (1992). ''In Defense of Schreber. Soul Murder and Psychiatry''. Hillsdale, NJ/London: The Analytic Press. Second, German edition, Lothane, Z. (2004). ''Seelenmord und Psychiatrie Zur Rehabilitierung Schrebers''. Giessen: Psychosozial-Verlag. (2nd edition of ‘’In Defense of Schreber’’&lt;/ref&gt; Lothane's Schreber research included the study of archival records concerning the relationship between Schreber and the other significant people in his life, including his wife and his doctors. On Lothane's account, the existing literature on Schreber as a rule (1) leaves substantial gaps in the historical records which careful archival research could in some measure fill; (2) leaves out psychoanalytically significant relationships, such as that between Schreber and his wife and (3) overstates the purportedly sadistic elements in Schreber's father's child-rearing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lothane, Z. (1992). ''In defense of Schreber. Soul murder and psychiatry''. Hillsdale, NJ/London: The Analytic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Lothane's interpretation of Schreber also differs from previous texts in that he considers Schreber a worthwhile thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Lothane, Z. (2011). The teachings of honorary professor of psychiatry Daniel Paul Schreber, J.D., to psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, or dramatology’s challenge to psychiatry and psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Review'', 98(6): 775-815.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dushku has three brothers,&lt;ref name="Megafest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2013/11/25/super-megafest-2013-eliza-dushku-panel/|title=Super Megafest 2013: Eliza Dushku Panel|last=Lafferty|first=Hanna|publisher=Emertainment Monthly|date=November 25, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128125941/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/2013/11/25/super-megafest-2013-eliza-dushku-panel/|archivedate=November 28, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised in a religious family as a part of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], although she no longer affiliates with the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016121246/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home3/58379865-200/dushku-curtis-judy-mormon.html.csp|title=Eliza Dushku of 'Buffy,' 'Dollhouse' shares Comic Con stage with mom - The Salt Lake Tribune|date=October 16, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Beaver Country Day School]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Watertown High School (Massachusetts)|Watertown High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watertownlib.org/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/263|title=Watertown High School: The Annual|year=1998|publisher=Watertown Free Public Library|page=22|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Dushku came to the attention of casting agents when she was 10. She was chosen in a five-month search for the lead role of Alice in the film ''[[That Night]]''. In 1993, Dushku landed a role as Pearl alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in ''[[This Boy's Life (film)|This Boy's Life]]'', a role that she said opened a lot of doors.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The following year, she played the teenage daughter of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] in ''[[True Lies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elizapatriciadushku.com/bio|title=Eliza Dushku|website=Elizapatriciadushku.com|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had parts as [[Paul Reiser]]'s daughter in ''[[Bye Bye Love (film)|Bye Bye Love]]'', as Cindy Johnson in ''[[Race the Sun]]'', and roles in the television movie ''Journey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEUr55E10v4|title=Journey Trailer 1995|author=Video Detective|date=November 11, 2014|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the short film ''Fishing with George''.

===''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''===
Dushku intended to attend [[Suffolk University]] in Boston, where her mother taught at the time,&lt;ref name="Megafest"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBR&gt;Tramountaanas, George A. (March 29, 2014). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=51822 "ECCC: Eliza Dushku Talks 'Buffy,' 'Dollhouse' and Going Back to College"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].&lt;/ref&gt; but her agent asked her to submit a videotape audition for a show starring another of his clients, [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]. After reading the script, Dushku rushed to a local [[Claire's]] to purchase dark makeup and other appropriate accessories for the part,&lt;ref name=CBR/&gt; [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. When she began her work on that series, Dushku was still a minor, and had to receive [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]] to work the production's long hours. She later recalled with amusement that the judge who handled her emancipation case, who was an avid fan of that show, jokingly said that she would sign the emancipation order if she could get a signed photo from Dushku.&lt;ref name="Megafest"/&gt;

After completing high school, Dushku returned to acting with the role of [[Faith Lehane]] on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', a [[Slayer (Buffyverse)|Slayer]] much more troubled than the main character [[Buffy Summers]]. Though initially planned as a five-episode role, the character became so popular that she stayed on for the whole third season and returned for a two-part appearance in season four, after which the remainder of her original [[story arc]] was played out as part of the first season of the ''Buffy'' spin-off series ''Angel''. Repentant and rededicated, Faith returned as a heroine in other episodes of ''Angel'' and in the last five episodes of ''Buffy''. 

As an unwelcome effect of her portrayal as Faith, Dushku was inundated with fan mail from legions of prisoners. She said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've been getting fan mail from maximum security penitentiaries and [[death row]]. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything – disgusting things that you don't even want to know about. And they send me pictures – "Oh, here's a picture of me before I was incarcerated!" – and there's some guy sat on the sofa with a bottle of beer and a moustache, and a big gut. It's so creepy. Way more creepy than ''Buffy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.eliza-dushku.com/archives0102/na050101.html|title=E.D.t.v.:: the eliza dushku news channel|publisher=Eliza-Dushku.com|accessdate=April 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030902195143/http://www.news.eliza-dushku.com/archives0102/na050101.html|archivedate=September 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Subsequent roles===
[[File:Eliza Dushku @ Wizard World Philly May 2004 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Dushku at [[Wizard Entertainment|Wizard World]] Comic Con in [[Philadelphia]] (May 2004)]]
In 2000, Dushku starred in the hit cheerleader comedy ''Bring It On''.&lt;ref name="tws902"/&gt; She followed that up with ''[[Soul Survivors]]'',&lt;ref name="tws902"/&gt; reuniting her with ''Race the Sun'' co-star [[Casey Affleck]]. In 2001, she appeared in ''[[The New Guy]]'' with [[DJ Qualls]] and ''[[City by the Sea]]'' with [[Robert De Niro]] and [[James Franco]].&lt;ref name="tws902"/&gt; The latter film garnered attention from a wider adult audience and several good reviews. The same year, [[Kevin Smith]] invited Dushku to be a part of ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.&lt;ref name="tws902"/&gt;

In 2003, Dushku starred in the horror film ''[[Wrong Turn]]''&lt;ref name="tws902"/&gt; and ''The Kiss'', an independent comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] supernatural drama, ''[[Tru Calling]]'', where she played the main character, medical student [[Tru Davies]]. After having a grant pulled out from under her, Tru is forced to take a job at a local morgue where she discovers her power to "re-live" the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of ''[[Buffy The Vampire Slayer]]'' which would have been about Faith. She has had many roles as a "bad girl" in movies and relishes the opportunities. In an interview with ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, "It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't have to deal with the consequences, because it's only acting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=4046&amp;src=fc|title=Faith No More|last=Young|first=Paul|work=Maxim|date=May 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180956/http://www.maximonline.com/articles/index.aspx?a_id=4046&amp;src=fc|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dushku starred in an [[Off-Broadway]] production entitled ''[[Dog Sees God]]'' from December 2005, playing "Van's sister", a character paralleled with [[Lucy Van Pelt]] from the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip on which the play production is based. She quit in February 2006 along with other members of the cast amidst rumors of abuse from the producer, which were later dismissed.

She played the lead character on ''Nurses'', a hospital comedy-drama for Fox. This was the second Fox pilot in which she was cast, but not broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960922?refCatId=14|title=Dushku joins Fox's 'Nurses'|last=Schneider|first=Michael|last2=Adalian|first2=Josef|work=Variety|date=March 11, 2007|accessdate=March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in the [[Simple Plan]] music video, "[[I'm Just a Kid]]", as the band's love interest, as well as [[Nickelback]]'s video for "[[Rockstar (Nickelback song)|Rockstar]]".

===2005–present===
[[File:Eliza Dushku by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dushku at [[Tribeca Film Festival]] (2007)]]
On October 1, 2005, she announced at [[Wizard World]] Boston that shooting had begun for ''[[Nobel Son]]'' in which she would star with [[Alan Rickman]], [[Danny DeVito]] and [[Bill Pullman]]. The movie was released at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/32560|title=Nobel Son review|publisher=Aintitcool.com|date=May 7, 2007|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another project is ''[[On Broadway (film)|On Broadway]]'', an independent movie filmed in her native Boston. The movie received positive reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bostonist.com/2007/04/30/on_broadway_at_the_independent_film_festival_of_boston.php|title=On Broadway At the Independent Film Festival of Boston|last=Femia|first=Michael|publisher=Bostonist|date=April 30, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612134004/http://bostonist.com/2007/04/30/on_broadway_at_the_independent_film_festival_of_boston.php|archivedate=June 12, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a few of them highlighting Dushku's performance.

Dushku has had roles in five video games. She voiced the role of Yumi Sawamura in the English language version of ''[[Yakuza (video game)|Yakuza]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], which was published and developed by [[Sega]], and released in September 2006. Dushku also stars as Shaundi, one of the lead characters in ''[[Saints Row 2]]'', which was developed by [[Volition (company)|Volition, Inc.]] and published by [[THQ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2008/9/12/previews/54767/|title=Saints Row 2 Singleplayer/Co-Op Preview|last=Pavlacka|first=Adam|publisher=WorthPlaying.com|date=September 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in North America on October 14, 2008, for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. She was the voice talent for the role of Rubi Malone, the main character in the game ''[[WET (video game)|WET]]''. She appeared at Spike TV's 2008 [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="tws903"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=photoGalleryAlbum&amp;galleryid=2414&amp;order=2|title=Spike TV's Video Game Awards|work=Variety|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=September 7, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414215905/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=photoGalleryAlbum&amp;galleryid=2414&amp;order=2|archivedate=April 14, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danielle Nicolet]] took over the role of Shaundi in ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]''. She also voiced Megan McQueen in Champion Mode of the 2011 video game Fight Night Champion.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced on August 2, 2006, that Dushku would co-star with [[Macaulay Culkin]] in ''[[Sex and Breakfast]]'', a dark comedy written and directed by Miles Brandman. A reviewer described Dushku as "charming" and giving the character "an edge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935547?refcatid=31|title=Sex and Breakfast (Review)|last=Anderson|first=John|work=Variety|date=November 29, 2007|accessdate=September 7, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107043713/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935547?refcatid=31|archivedate=November 7, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was released in Los Angeles on November 30, 2007, and on DVD on January 22, 2008. She starred in ''[[Open Graves]]'', a 2008 horror-thriller about a [[Satanism|satanic]] game co-starring [[Mike Vogel]]. She played the main character in ''[[The Thacker Case]]'' and ''[[The Alphabet Killer]]'', both thrillers based on real-life events, one of them directed by [[Rob Schmidt]], with whom she had worked on ''Wrong Turn''. Both movies were released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/05/15/eliza-dushku-joins-the-force-for-alphabet-killer/|title=Eliza Dushku Joins The Force For ‘Alphabet Killer’|last=Jacks|first=Brian|publisher=MTV Movies Blog|date=May 15, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501194733/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/05/15/eliza-dushku-joins-the-force-for-alphabet-killer/|archivedate=May 1, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Alphabet Killer'' contains Dushku's first topless scene.&lt;ref name="egotastic.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/eliza-dushku/eliza-dushku-topless-video-from-the-alphabet-killer-topless-004259|title=Eliza Dushku topless in The Alphabet Killer|publisher=Egotastic|date=December 22, 2008|accessdate=December 22, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224004508/http://egotastic.com/entertainment/celebrities/eliza-dushku/eliza-dushku-topless-video-from-the-alphabet-killer-topless-004259|archivedate=December 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film earned mixed reviews, but reviewers praised Dushku's performance, commenting "Eliza Dushku commands the screen but cannot reconcile the script's conflicted and increasingly idiotic agendas."&lt;ref name=tws906&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939227?refcatid=31|title=The Alphabet Killer|last=Scheib|first=Ronnie|work=Variety|date=December 17, 2008|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in ''[[Bottle Shock]]'', a drama about [[Napa valley]] wine.&lt;ref name="tws901"/&gt; The film was directed by Randall Miller, who helmed ''Nobel Son''.&lt;ref name="tws901"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/07/20/elisha-dushku-and-bill-pullman-join-bottle-shock|title=Eliza Dushku and Bill Pullman Join 'Bottle Shock'|last=Campbell|first=Christopher|publisher=Cinematical|date=July 20, 2007|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2007, Dushku signed a development deal with [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] and [[20th Century Fox]]. Under the pact, the network and the studio would develop projects tailor-made for the actress as well as approach her with existing pitches and scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i3183b40c3b46a938e4669aa95744ca66 |title=Dushku busy with Fox TV |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930231821/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i3183b40c3b46a938e4669aa95744ca66 |archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, it was announced on October 31 that Dushku had lured [[Joss Whedon]], of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', back to TV, as they agreed to create a show called ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''. Dushku produced the show and played the main character, '[[Echo (Dollhouse)|Echo]]', which aired on Fox during the [[2008–09 United States network television schedule|2008–09 TV Season]].
In an interview, Dushku talked about how ''Dollhouse'' and her reconnection with Whedon came about:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I invited [[Joss Whedon]] to lunch after I did the business deal with Fox. We'd had a cool relationship in the past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show.

The '''Gadianton robbers''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|æ|d|i|ˈ|æ|n|t|ən}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «găd-ē-ăn´tun»&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Book of Mormon]], were a secret criminal organization in ancient [[Americas|America]].

==First incarnation==
The society was first founded around 52 BC or 51 BC by [[Nephite]] supporters of [[Paanchi (Book of Mormon)|Paanchi]], an unsuccessful candidate for chief judge. Paanchi had been executed for [[treason]] when he refused to accept the election of his brother [[Pahoran#Pahoran, son of Pahoran|Pahoran II]] to the judgment seat and then tried to incite a revolution. One of his supporters, Kishkumen ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|ʃ|ˈ|k|uː|m|ə|n}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «kĭsh-kū´mun»&lt;/ref&gt; assassinated Pahoran in retaliation. Kishkumen and his associates entered into a pact to keep the assassin's identity a secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/hel/1/11#11 Helaman 1:11]&lt;/ref&gt;

A man, Gadianton, became the leader of Kishkumen's secret group. He arranged for Kishkumen to assassinate Chief Judge [[Helaman II]] by promising that if Gadianton were made chief judge, he would appoint the other members of the band to positions of authority. Kishkumen was apprehended and killed by one of Helaman's servants, and Gadianton and his followers, fearing the same fate, fled into the wilderness.

Within 25 years, Gadianton's band had grown into a large criminal organization known as "Gadianton's robbers and murderers",&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/hel/6/18#18 Helaman 6:18]&lt;/ref&gt; with both Nephites and [[Lamanites]] among its members. In 26 BC, the Gadianton robbers assassinated Chief Judge [[Cezoram]] and his son.

The Lamanites made every effort to eradicate the Gadianton robbers among them. The Nephites, in contrast, began to join the band in larger and larger numbers until most them were members. Members swore to protect one another and identified one another by means of secret signs and secret words. By 24 BC, the entire Nephite government was under the control of the Gadiantons.

Around 20 BC, Chief Judge [[Seezoram]] was murdered by his brother, [[Seantum]]; both of them were members of the Gadianton band. The murder was announced and the culprit identified by [[Nephi, son of Helaman|Nephi the son of Helaman]]. Nephi's knowledge of the event was believed by many to be evidence of his prophetic powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/hel/9 Helaman 9]&lt;/ref&gt; When a famine struck the area a few years later, the people believed that God was behind it, and they reacted by repenting and cracking down on the Gadiantons. The society was completely eradicated, and their secret plans were buried into the earth.

==Second incarnation==
However, in 12 BC, a group of disaffected Nephites recovered the secret plans and re-established the Gadianton. This time, instead of infiltrating mainstream Nephite society, the group established bases in the mountains and the wilderness and periodically raided Nephite and Lamanite cities by [[guerrilla warfare]]. It continued to increase in power, and by 13 AD, it had caused so much destruction that the Nephites and Lamanites united and declared war on the Gadiantons.

The Gadiantons initially had the upper hand in the war, and in AD 16, the Gadianton leader, [[Giddianhi]], sent a letter to the Nephite governor [[Lachoneus]] demanding surrender. The letter is reproduced in the Book of Mormon and provides a rare look at the Gadianton robbers, as seen by themselves. Giddianhi closes with these words: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.”&lt;ref&gt;3 Nephi 3:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In AD 21, however, the Nephites defeated the Gadiantons, killing both Giddianhi and his successor, [[Zemnarihah]], and the society was again destroyed.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

==Third incarnation==
In around 245, a group of Nephites once again resurrected the old oaths and secrets and re-established the Gadianton robbers. Over the course of the next 50 years, they spread all over the land and became extremely wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/4_ne/1/46#46 4 Nephi 1:46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gadiantons later united with the Lamanites, and the combined force completely wiped out the Nephites.

'''Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda''' (7 November 1891 – 15 March 1938), born '''Yenokh Gershevich Iyeguda''' was a [[secret police]] official who served as director of the [[NKVD]], the [[Soviet Union]]'s security and intelligence agency, from 1934 to 1936. Appointed by [[Joseph Stalin]], Yagoda supervised the arrest, [[Moscow Show Trial|show trial]], and execution of the [[Old Bolshevik]]s [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Grigory Zinoviev]], climactic events of the [[Great Purge]]. Yagoda supervised the construction of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal]] with [[Naftaly Frenkel]], using penal labor from the [[GULAG]] system, during which many laborers died.

Like many Soviet NKVD officers who conducted political repression, Yagoda himself became ultimately a victim of the Purge. He was demoted from the directorship of the NKVD in favor of [[Nikolai Yezhov]] in 1936 and arrested in 1937. Charged with the crimes of [[wrecking (Soviet crime)|wrecking]], espionage, [[Trotskyism]] and conspiracy, Yagoda was a defendant at the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites"|Trial of the Twenty-One]], the last of the major Soviet show trials of the 1930s. Following his confession at the trial, Yagoda was found guilty and shot.

==Early life==
[[File:1912 genrich jagoda kartei orchrana.jpg|thumb|left|Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda on police information card from 1912]]
Yagoda was born in [[Rybinsk]] into a [[Jewish]] family. The son of a jeweller, trained as a statistician, who worked as a chemist's assistant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montefiore|first1=Simon Sebag|title=Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar|date=2004|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=0 75381 766 7|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed that he was an active revolutionary from the age of 14, when he worked as a compositor on an underground printing press in [[Nizhni-Novgorod]], and that at the age of 15 he was a member of a fighting squad in the Sormovo district of Nizhni-Novgorod, during the violent suppression of the [[1905 revolution]]. One of his brothers was killed during the fighting in Sormovo; the other was shot for taking part in a mutiny in a regiment during the war with Germany. He said he joined the Bolsheviks in Nizhni-Novgorod at the age of 16 or 17, and was arrested and sent into exile in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Case of the Anti Soviet Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites, Verbatim Report|date=1938|publisher=People's Commissariat of Justice of the U.S.S.R.|location=Moscow|page=784|last1=See Yagoda's last plea at his trial in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his arrest, he married Ida Averbakh, one of whose uncles, Yakov Sverdlov, was a prominent Bolshevik, and another, [[Zinovy Peshkov]], was the adopted son of the writer Maxim Gorky. In 1913, he moved to St Petersburg to work at the Putilov steel works. After the outbreak of war, he joined the army, and was wounded in action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Бажанов|first1=Борис|last2=Кривицкий|first2=Вальтер|last3=Орлов|first3=Александр|title=Ягода.

[[File:1915-genrich yagoda.jpg|thumb|280px|Yagoda in 1915]]
There is another version of his early career, told in the memoirs of the former NKVD officer [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov|Aleksandr M. Orlov]], who alleged that Yagoda invented his early revolutionary career and did not join the Bolsheviks until 1917, and that his deputy [[Mikhail Trilisser]] was dismissed from the service for trying to expose the lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Alexander|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed that this was gossip put around by Yagoda's successors after his fall from power.

== Political career ==
After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, Yagoda rose rapidly through the ranks of the ''[[Cheka]]'' (the predecessor of the OGPU and  [[NKVD]]) to become the second deputy of [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], the head of the Cheka, in September 1923. After Dzerzhinsky's appointment as chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy in January 1924, Yagoda became the real manager of the [[Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie|State Political Directorate]] (OGPU), as the deputy chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]] had little authority because of his serious illness. In 1924, he joined the USSR's head of government, [[Alexei Rykov]] on a ship tour of the Volga. An American journalist who was allowed to join them on the trip described Yagoda as "a spare, slightly-tanned, trim looking, youngish officer" adding that it was "difficult to associate terror with the affable and modest person".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Dreamt Revolution|last=Reswick|first=William|publisher=Henry Regnery Company|year=1952|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the chemist [[Vladimir Ipatieff]] met Yagoda briefly in Moscow in 1918 and thought that "it was unusual for a young men in his early twenties to be so unpleasant. I felt then that it would be unlucky for me or anyone else ever to fall into his hands." When he saw him again in 1927, "his appearance had changed considerably: he had grown fatter and looked much older and very dignified and important."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of a Chemist: Memoirs of Vladimir Ipatieff|last=Ipatieff|first=Vladimir|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1946|isbn=|location=Stanford, Ca|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genrikh Yagoda and Ida Averbakh 1922.jpg|thumb|Genrikh Yagoda and his wife Ida Averbakh, 30 September 1922. Ida was executed in 1938]]
[[File:1924 yagoda menshinsky dsershinsky.jpg|thumb|left|380px| Yagoda, [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky|Menzhinsky]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Dzerzhinsky]], 1920]]
Though Yagoda appears to have known [[Joseph Stalin]] since 1918, when they were both stationed in [[Tsaritsyn]] during the civil war, "he was never Stalin's man"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar|last=Montefiore|first=Simon Sebag|publisher=Phoenix|year=2004|isbn=0 75381 766 7|location=London|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Stalin ordered that the Soviet Union's entire rural population were to be forced onto collective farms, Yagoda is reputed to have sympathised with Bukharin and Rykov, his opponents on the right of the communist party. [[Nikolai Bukharin]] claimed in a leaked private conversation in July 1928 that "Yagoda and Trilisser are with us", but once it became apparent that the right was losing the power struggle, Yagoda switched allegiance. In the contemptuous opinion of Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina, Yagoda "traded his personal views for the sake of his career" and degenerated into a "criminal" and a "miserable coward".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This I Cannot Forget|last=Larina|first=Anna|publisher=Pandora|year=1993|isbn=0 04 440887 0|location=London|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda..jpg|thumb|1922 exit visa hand signed by Genrikh Yagoda in Moscow.]]
Yagoda continued to be effective head of the OGPU until July 1931, when the little known Old Bolshevik [[Ivan Akulov]] was appointed First Deputy Chairman, and Yagoda was demoted to the post of Second Deputy. Akulov was dismissed and Yagoda reinstated in October 1932, After Yagoda's fall, one of his former colleagues confessed: "We met Akulov with violent hostility...the entire party organisation in the OGPU was devoted to sabotaging Akulov."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Was Stalin's Agent|last=Krivitsly|first=W.G.|publisher=The Right Book Club|year=1940|isbn=|location=London|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin must have agreed to his reinstatement with ill grace, because four years later he accused the OGPU/NKVD of being "four years behind" in rooting out the supposed Trotskyite anti-Soviet conspiracy, although Yagoda had been complicit in the execution of one of Trotsky's sympathisers, [[Yakov Blumkin]], and in sending others to the [[GULAG]], the system of forced labour created under his supervision.

As deputy head of the OGPU, Yagoda organized the building of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal]] using [[forced labor]] at breakneck speed between 1931 and 1933 at the cost of huge casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulag.eu/GULAG/Storm.html ''Gulag, The Storm projects - The White Sea Canal''], ''Gulag.eu''.

Retrieved on 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yagoda supervised the deportations, confiscations, mass arrests and executions that accompanied the forced collectivisation, and was one of the people responsible for the [[Holodomor]], which resulted in the deaths of at least 7.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukemonde.com/genocide/margolisholocaust.html|title=Seven million died in the 'forgotten' holocaust - Eric Margolis|website=www.ukemonde.com|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Agnieszka Bieńczyk-Missala, Sławomir Dębski (2010).

Polski Instytut Spraw Miedzynarodowyc. p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1934, he was rewarded by being made a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Yagoda had founded [[Poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services|a secret poison laboratory of OGPU]] that was at disposal of Stalin. One of the victims became his own NKVD boss, [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]]. He was slowly poisoned during two weeks by two assistants of Yagoda&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'' by Roman Brackman, Routledge, 2004, p.204-205&lt;/ref&gt; Menzhinsky's death was followed one day later by death of Max Peshkov, the son of [[Maxim Gorky]], the doyen of Soviet literature. Yagoda had been cultivating Gorky as a potentially useful contact since 1928, and employed Gorky's secretary, Pyotr Kryuchkov, as a spy. "Whenever Gorky met Stalin or other members of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], Yagoda would visit Kryuchkov's flat afterward, demanding a full account of what had been said. He took to visiting public baths with Kryuchkov. One day in 1932, Yagoda handed his valuable spy $4,000 to buy a car."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear and the Muse Kept Watch, The Russian Masters - from Akhmatov and Pasternak to Shostakovich and Eisenstein - Under Stalin|last=McSmith|first=Andy|publisher=The New Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-59558-056-6|location=New York|pages=91|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had developed an obsession with Max Peshkov's wife, Timoshka, and visited her daily when she was newly widowed, though her mother denied that they were ever lovers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear and the Muse Kept Watch|last=McSmith|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Arkady Vaksberg]] and other researchers, Yagoda poisoned [[Maksim Gorky]] and his son on the orders from Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arkady Vaksberg]], ''The Murder of Maxim Gorky: A Secret Execution'', 2006, Enigma Books, {{ISBN|1929631626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NKVD Chief===

[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Yagoda (middle) inspecting the construction of the Moscow-Volga canal. Behind him is [[Nikita Khrushchev]].]]

On 10 July 1934, two months after Menzhinsky's death, Joseph Stalin appointed Yagoda [[People's Commissar]] for Internal Affairs, a position that included the oversight of both the regular and the secret police, the [[NKVD]]. Yagoda worked closely with [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] in organizing the first [[Moscow Trials|Moscow Show Trial]], which resulted in the prosecution and subsequent execution of former Soviet politicians Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev in August 1936 as part of Stalin's [[Great Purge]]. The [[Red Army]] high command was not spared and its ranks were thinned by Yagoda, as a precursor to the later and more extensive [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|purge in the Russian military]]. More than a quarter of a million people were arrested during the 1934–1935 period; the GULAG system was vastly expanded under his stewardship, and penal labor became a major developmental resource in the Soviet economy.

Stalin became increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda's performance. In the middle of 1936, Stalin received a report from Yagoda detailing the unfavorable public reaction abroad to the show trials and the growing sympathy among the Soviet population for the executed defendants. The report enraged Stalin, interpreting it as Yagoda's advice to stop the show trials and in particular to abandon the planned purge of [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] and the former commander in chief of the Red Army. Stalin was already unhappy with Yagoda's services, mostly due to the mismanagement of Kirov's assassination and his failure to fabricate "proofs" of ties between Kamenev and Zinoviev and the [[Okhrana]] (the tsarist security organization).&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Roman., [https://books.google.com/books?id=nA7YzQMzO9YC&amp;pg=PA231 ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life''], London: Frank Cass Publishers (2001), p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; As one Soviet official put it, "The Boss forgets nothing."&lt;ref&gt;Barmine, Alexander, ''One Who Survived'', New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), pp. 295-296&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1936, Stalin sent a telegram (co-signed by [[Andrei Zhdanov]]) to the members of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. The telegram read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We consider it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be appointed to head the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs. ''Yagoda has obviously proved unequal to the task of exposing the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc.'' The [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] was four years late in this matter. All party heads and the most of the NKVD agents in the region are talking about this."&lt;ref&gt;Medvedev, Roy. ''Let History Judge'', New York (1971), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A day later, he was replaced by Yezhov, who managed the main purges during 1937–1938. Yagoda was demoted to the post of [[People's Commissariat for Post and Telegraph|People's Commissar for Post and Telegraph]].

===Arrest, trial, and execution===
In March 1937, Yagoda was arrested on Stalin's orders. Yezhov announced Yagoda's arrest for diamond smuggling, corruption, and working as a German agent since joining the party in 1917. Yezhov even blamed Yagoda of an attempt to assassinate him by sprinkling [[mercury (element)|mercury]] around his office. He was accused of poisoning [[Maxim Gorky]] and his son. It was discovered that Yagoda's two Moscow apartments and his [[dacha]] contained 3,904 [[Pornography|pornographic]] photos, 11 pornographic films, 165 pornographically carved pipes, one [[dildo]], and the two bullets that killed Zinoviev and Kamenev.{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=195}} Yezhov took over the apartments. He had spent four million [[ruble]]s decorating his three homes, boasting that his garden had "2,000 orchids and roses."{{sfn|Montefiore|2007|p=85}}

Yagoda was found guilty of [[treason]] and [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against the Soviet government at the [[Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites"|Trial of the Twenty-One]] in March 1938. He denied he was a spy, but admitted most other charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet 'Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites'|publisher=People's Commissariat of Justice of the USSR|year=1938|location=Moscow|pages=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]] describes Yagoda as expecting [[clemency]] from Stalin after the show trial: "Just as though Stalin had been sitting right there in the hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: 'I appeal to you! ''For you'' I built two great canals!'". &lt;ref&gt;See Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. ''The Gulag Archipelago'' Vol I–II, Harper &amp; Row, 1973, {{ISBN|0-06-013914-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/30/archives/solzhenitsyn-on-purge-trials-of-the-30s-the-gulag-archipelago.html|title=‘The Gulag Archipelago, 1918–1956’ Solzhenitsyn on Purge Trials of the 30's|first=Aleksandr I.|last=Solzhenitsyn|date=30 December 1973|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yagoda was summarily shot soon after the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/24jun2010/beria.html|title=Лаврентия Берию в 1953 году расстрелял лично советский маршал|publisher=|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ida Averbakh was executed in 1938. His sister, Lilya, was arrested on 7 May 1937, and shot on 16 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=The final photograph of Lilya Genrikh, taken before her execution is in King|first1=David|title=Ordinary Citizens, the Victims of Stalin|date=2003|publisher=Francis Boutle|location=London|isbn=1 903427 150|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother-in-law, [[Leopold Averbakh]], was shot in August. In 1988, on the 50th anniversary of the trial, the Soviet authorities belatedly cleared all of the other 20 defendants of any criminal offence, admitting that the entire trial was built on false confessions. Yagoda was the only defendant not to be posthumously rehabilitated.

[[File:Igraine and Gorlois.jpg|thumb|[[Igraine]] and Gorlois in [[Władysław T. Benda]]'s illustration for ''Uther and Igraine'' by [[Warwick Deeping]] (1903)]]

In [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], '''Gorlois''' ({{lang-cy|Gwrlais}}) of [[Tintagel]], [[List of legendary rulers of Cornwall|Duke of Cornwall]], is the husband of [[Igraine]] prior to [[Uther Pendragon]]. He is the father of [[Morgan le Fay]], [[Morgause]], and [[Elaine (legend)#Elaine of Garlot|Elaine]].

Gorlois' name first appears in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' ({{circa|1136}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Mary |contribution=Gorlois |title=Jones' Celtic Encyclopedia |year=2005 |contribution-url=http://www.maryjones.us/jce/gorlois.html |accessdate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Uther falls in love with Igraine and wars with Gorlois to get to her. Uther asks for [[Merlin]]'s aid in pursuing her, and Merlin concocts some drugs that disguise Uther in the form of Gorlois. As Gorlois, he approaches his love easily and they sleep together, conceiving [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. Unbeknownst to either of them, the real Gorlois has been killed in his castle that very night. Eventually Igraine is convinced to marry Uther.

Later treatments such as the [[Vulgate Cycle]] and [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' expand on this outline by having Gorlois' daughters married off to Uther's [[vassal]]s; Elaine to King [[Nentres of Garlot]], Morgause to [[King Lot]] of [[Orkney]], and (after receiving an education in a [[convent]]) Morgan to King [[Urien]]. Arthur is spared any knowledge of this when he is whisked away by Merlin to be raised by [[Sir Ector]].

Dr. '''Harold Olmo''' (July 31, 1909 &amp;ndash; June 30, 2006) was a pioneering [[viticulture|viticulturist]] and professor at the [[University of California, Davis]] where he created many new grape varieties known today as [[Olmo grapes]]. In the 1950s, he helped to establish California's first [[quarantine]] facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. This led to an expansion of California's [[wine]] industry as more ''[[Vitis vinifera]]'' was introduced to the area.

==Career==
In 1955, Professor of [[Viticulture]] at the [[University of California]] Harold Olmo was in Western Australia studying climatic limitations of viticulture in the [[Swan Valley (Western Australia)|Swan Valley]]. Olmo spent eight months in Western Australia at the invitation of the Western Australian Vine Fruits Research Trust.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://winebookcellar.com.au/viticulture-environment/|title=Viticulture and Environment|last=Gladstones|first=John|publisher=Trivinum Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9945016-1-5|edition=Revised|location=Tanunda, South Australia|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he published his report in 1956, one of the recommendations put forward was that [[Mount Barker, Western Australia|Mount Barker]] and the [[Frankland, Western Australia|Frankland]] of the [[Great Southern (wine region)|Great Southern]] area of [[Western Australia]] showed great promise for making table wines in the light traditional European style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanygateway.com.au/what-to-do/great-southern-wine-region.html|work=Great Southern Wine Region History|title=The Great Southern wine region history|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Olmo also developed more than 30 new grape varieties, including [[Ruby Cabernet]], [[Carnelian (grape)|Carnelian]], [[Rubired]] and [[Royalty (grape)|Royalty]].&lt;ref name=" grape variety creation "&gt;{{cite book|title= The encyclopedia of fruit &amp; nuts |publisher= CABI International|year=2008|ISBN= 978-0-85199-638-7|author= J Janick, James Troop Professor in Horticulture, Purdue University, USA, R E Paull, Department Chair, Professor of Horticulture, University of Hawaii at Manoa, USA |page= 918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VIVC"&gt;[[Vitis International Variety Catalogue]] (VIVC) ''[http://www.vivc.de/datasheet/dataResult.php?data=10288 Royalty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417040200/http://www.vivc.de/datasheet/dataResult.php?data=10288 |date=2016-04-17 }}'' Accessed: August 17th, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wine grapes"&gt;J.

He was born in Ireland in 1847 and his father, Alexander Carville, in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/carville/66/|title=Descendants of Alexander Carvi - Genealogy.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his [[undergraduate]] and [[Juris Doctor]] degrees from [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU). Carville is a member of the [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gumbo|year=1963|publisher=Louisiana State University|location=Baton Rouge, LA|pages=236–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carville spent two years serving in the [[United States Marine Corps]], achieving the rank of [[Corporal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/10-people-you-didnt-know-were-us-marines |title=10 People You Didn't Know Were U.S. Marines &amp;#124; U.S. Naval Institute |publisher=Usni.org |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/02/carville-bumps-into-bp-ceo/?fbid=WmcDFSCWNDE#more-106834 |title=CNN Political Ticker: All politics, all the time Blog Archive - Carville bumps into BP CEO " - Blogs from CNN.com |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and later worked as a high school teacher. Before entering politics, Carville worked as a [[litigator]] at a [[Baton Rouge]] law firm from 1973 to 1979.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
Carville was trained in consulting by [[Gus Weill]], who in 1958 had opened the first advertising firm which specialized in political campaigns in the state capital in Baton Rouge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpb.org/programs/legends/weill.html|title=About Gus Weill|publisher=lpb.org|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the Clinton campaign, Carville and consulting partner [[Paul Begala]] gained other well-known political victories, including the [[gubernatorial]] triumphs of [[Robert P. Casey|Robert Casey]] of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1986, and [[Zell Miller]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1990, and [[Brereton Jones]] of [[Kentucky]] in 1991. But it was in 1991 when Carville and Begala rose to national attention, leading appointed incumbent [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Harris Wofford]] of Pennsylvania back from a 40-point poll deficit over [[White House]] hand-picked candidate [[Dick Thornburgh]]. It was during Wofford's campaign that the "[[it's the economy, stupid]]" strategy used by [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 was first implemented.

===Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign===
In 1992, Carville helped lead Bill Clinton to a win against [[George H. W. Bush]] in the presidential election. In 1993, Carville was honored as Campaign District Manager of the Year by the [[American Association of Political Consultants]]. His role in the Clinton campaign was documented in the feature-length Academy Award-nominated film ''[[The War Room]]''.

One of the formulations he used in that campaign has entered common usage, derived from a list he posted in the war room to help focus himself and his staff, with these three points:
# Change vs. more of the same.
#[[It's the economy, stupid|The economy, stupid]].
# Don't forget health care.&lt;ref&gt;THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats – Clinton and Bush Compete to Be Champion of Change; Democrat Fights Perceptions of Bush Gain; Oct. 31, 1992, New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/us/1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-bush-compete-be-champion-change-democrat-fights.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and media work===
After 1992 Carville stopped working on domestic campaigns, stating that he would bring unneeded publicity. He then worked on a number of foreign campaigns, including those of [[Tony Blair]] – then Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom]] – during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]]; [[Ehud Barak]] of [[Israel]]'s [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] (at the suggestion of Clinton, who had grown frustrated with [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s intransigence in the peace process) in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999 Knesset election]]; and the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. In 2002, Carville helped Bolivian [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] win the presidency in [[Bolivia]], while working as a Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) strategist.  This was portrayed in the documentary ''[[Our Brand Is Crisis (2005 film)|Our Brand Is Crisis]]''.

In 2004, he was brought in for last-minute consulting on [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004|John Kerry's presidential campaign]], but he did not play a major role.

In 2005, Carville taught a semester of the course "Topics in American Politics" at [[Northern Virginia Community College]]. Among the guests he had come speak to the class were [[Al Hunt]], [[Mark Halperin]], Senator [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], [[George Stephanopoulos]], [[Karl Strubel]], [[Stan Greenberg]], [[Tony Blankley]], representatives from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], and [[James Fallows]].

In 2006, Carville switched gears from politics to sports and became a host on a sports show called ''60/20 Sports'' on [[XM Satellite Radio]] with [[Luke Russert]], son of NBC journalist [[Tim Russert]]. The show is an in-depth look at the culture of sports based on the ages of the two hosts (60 and 20).

After the Democrats' victory in the 2006 midterm election, Carville criticized [[Howard Dean]] as [[Democratic National Committee]] Chair, calling for his ouster, as he believed Dean had not spent enough money. In late November 2006, Carville proposed a truce of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2006/11/carvilles_truce.html Hotline On Call: Carville's Truce?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061228161832/http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2006/11/carvilles_truce.html |date=2006-12-28 }} ''The Hotline''. National Journal Group. 2006-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carville was the [[executive producer]] of the 2006 film ''[[All the King's Men (2006 film)|All the King's Men]]'', starring [[Sean Penn]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]], which is loosely based on the life of [[Louisiana]] [[Governor]] [[Huey Long]].

Carville had believed that [[Al Gore]], whom he helped put in the White House as vice president in 1992, would run for president in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120906215956/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/2/27/120317.shtml James Carville: Al Gore Will Run in 2008]. ''NewsMax.com''. 2007-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction did not come true.

On March 4, 2009, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' reported that Carville, Paul Begala, and [[Rahm Emanuel]] were the architects of the Democratic Party's strategy to cast conservative [[talk radio]] host [[Rush Limbaugh]] as the face of the [[Republican Party (US)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19596.html|title=Rush Job: Inside Dems' Limbaugh Plan|last=Martin|first=Jonathan|date=March 4, 2009|publisher=Politico|accessdate=2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carville was particularly critical of Limbaugh for saying he wanted [[Barack Obama]] to "fail".

Afghan presidential candidate [[Ashraf Ghani]] hired Carville as a campaign advisor in July 2009. Carville said that the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 Afghan presidential election]] is "probably the most important election held in the world in a long time," and he called his new job "probably the most interesting project I have ever worked in my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/659/story/1312800.html|title=U.S. strategist helps rival of Afghan president|agency=Associated Press|date=2009-07-08|accessdate=2009-07-14}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot }}  ''Cf.'' {{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601070&amp;sid=aHvyg97ihhPM|title=Carville to Advise Karzai Challenger in Afghan Election Contest|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2009-07-14}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carville, who works for Ghani ''pro bono'', when asked about similarities between politics in Afghanistan and politics in Louisiana, responded: "Yeah, I felt a little bit at home, to be honest with you."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Eggler &amp; Michelle Krupa, [http://nola.live.advance.net/news/t-p/neworleans/index.ssf?/base/news-11/1249104648283580.xml&amp;coll=1&amp;thispage=2 "Carville finds familiar politics in Afghanistan" (section titled "Going native")]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in ''Times-Picayune'', 2009 August 1, Saint Tammany Edition, p. B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Carville worked as senior advisor for the campaign of Colombian presidential candidate [[Juan Manuel Santos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasillavacia.com/historia/6941 "Juan Manuel Santos' campaign is running at full speed, La Silla Vacía (Colombian Political Website in Spanish)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

He is acting as advisor for [[Daniel Scioli]] ([[Governor of Buenos Aires]]) re-election campaign.

He is a regular contributor with [[Stan Greenberg]] to the weekly Carville-Greenberg Memo at [[The National Memo]].

===Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential primary campaign===
As an advisor to [[Hillary Clinton]]'s [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], Carville told ''[[The New York Times]]'' on March 22, 2008, that New Mexico Governor [[Bill Richardson]], who had just endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]] for the Democratic nomination, was comparable to [[Judas Iscariot]]. It was "an act of betrayal," said Carville. "Mr. Richardson's endorsement came right around the anniversary of the day when Judas sold out for [[30 pieces of silver]], so I think the timing is appropriate, if ironic," Mr. Carville said, referring to Holy Week. Governor Richardson had served in President Bill Clinton's administration as both [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] and [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]], and Carville believed that Richardson owed an endorsement to Senator Clinton in exchange for being offered those posts by her husband. Carville also claimed that Richardson assured many in the Clinton campaign that he would at least remain neutral and abstain from taking sides.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Nagourney and Jeff Zeleny, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/us/politics/22richardson.html "First a Tense Talk With Clinton, Then Richardson Backs Obama"], ''The New York Times'', March 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson denied Carville's account, arguing that he had not made any promises to remain neutral. Richardson claims that his decision to endorse Obama was "clinched" by his speech on race relations following the swirl of controversy surrounding Obama's former pastor [[Jeremiah Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/22/richardson-obamas-speech-was-decisive/ | work=CNN | title=Richardson: Obama's speech was decisive | accessdate=2010-05-05 | date=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carville went on to note,"I doubt if Governor Richardson and I will be terribly close in the future," Carville said,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sinderbrand |first=Rebecca |title=Carville: Controversial Judas comment 'had the desired effect' |work=CNN Political Ticker |publisher=CNNPolitics.com |date=2008-03-25 |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/25/carville-controversial-judas-comment-had-the-desired-effect
|accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "I've had my say...I got one in the [[List of baseball jargon (W)#wheelhouse|wheelhouse]] and I tagged it."

Even as Clinton's campaign began to lose steam, Carville remained both loyal and positive in his public positions, rarely veering off message and stoutly defending the candidate. But on May 13, 2008, a few hours before the primary in [[West Virginia]], Carville remarked to an audience at [[Furman University]] in [[South Carolina]], "I'm for Senator Clinton, but I think the great likelihood is that Obama will be the nominee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/05/13/carville-obama-likely-to-win-nomination/ | work=CNN | title=Carville: Obama likely to win nomination | accessdate=2010-05-05 | date=2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moment marked a shift from his previous and often determinedly optimistic comments about the state of Clinton's campaign.

After Barack Obama's clear lead for victory in the Democratic presidential campaign on June 3, James Carville said he was ready to open up his wallet to help Obama build a political war chest to take on [[John McCain]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/684/000167183/ |title=Obama for America |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Carville is married to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-turned-[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] political consultant [[Mary Matalin]], who worked for [[George H. W. Bush]] on his 1992 presidential reelection campaign. Carville and Matalin were married in New Orleans in October 1993. They have two daughters: Matalin Mary "Matty" Carville and Emerson Normand
"Emma" Carville.

In 2008, Carville and Matalin relocated their family from Virginia to New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Argetsinger |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Argetsinger |author2=[[Roxanne Roberts]]  |title=His Family Is Following the Ragin' Cajun Home |work=The Reliable Source |pages=C03 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2008-03-27 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032700006.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012190812/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032700006.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-10-12 |accessdate=2008-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carville joined the faculty of Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communication in January 2017.

She applied by attending an open casting call in Los Angeles, but she had said she was unfamiliar with the show. Originally from [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], Amber was in the first group to enter the house. Amber was one of two women involved in the "Bomb Squad" alliance formed by Caleb and Frankie. During her time in the house, Amber received unwanted romantic attention from Caleb, who he referred to as his "Queen". She won the Head of Household competition in Week 2 but was dethroned after her nominees, Hayden and Nicole, won the Battle of the Block competition. In week 3, Amber was nominated with Donny by Nicole, who won the Head of Household competition. However, Amber and Donny won the Battle of the Block competition and secured her safety for the week, although Caleb threw the competition to ensure Amber's safety. Following Devin's eviction, Amber and Caleb were exiled from the Bomb Squad (with Frankie claiming they were "too much drama"), while the remaining members formed a new alliance called "The Detonators". Amber was seen as a physical threat by most of the guys and quickly became a target of the Detonators after telling Christine (unaware she was a member of the alliance) about a plan to possibly form a girl's alliance with her and Nicole and get some of the guys out (her main target being Zach), which backfired when Christine told the Detonators of Amber's plan. Zach and Frankie quickly put a plan in motion to backdoor Amber after they won the Head of Household competition. Annoyed at his unreciprocated feelings for Amber and still unaware of the new alliance, a frustrated Caleb later approached Frankie with a plan to put Amber on the block as a scare tactic, unaware a plan had already been set in motion to backdoor her. Amber was named the replacement nominee against Jocasta by Frankie (with Caleb thinking it was his idea) after Hayden won the Power of Veto and took Victoria off the block. Christine later attempted to keep Amber in the game by reassuring the Detonators that Zach was no longer Amber's target and that she wanted to put Caleb on the block after thinking he was responsible for her being the replacement nominee, however this also backfired on Amber as the Detonators relayed this information to Caleb, and her fate was sealed even further when Zach twisted Amber's words about her relationship with Caleb and relayed this information to him. Amber was evicted on Day 42 in a unanimous vote of 9-0, finishing in 12th place.

==Brittany==
'''Brittany Christine Martinez (née Thompson)''' (born February 1, 1985), 29, is an event coordinator from [[Torrance, California]]. She is a recently single mother of three. Originally from [[Long Beach, California]], she entered the house with the second group. Unlike the other HouseGuests, Brittany was not aware of the show's existence until she was recruited at a bar in [[Hermosa Beach]]. She was nominated alongside Victoria in Week 1 by Frankie but won the "Battle of the Block" competition, securing her safety and dethroning Frankie in the process. The following week, after Devin held a house meeting telling everyone how he had accused Donny of not being who he said he is and had forced Caleb to nominate him, Brittany realized that what Caleb had said about nominating those that were eliminated first in the previous Head of Household competition was a lie and said so. Frankie and Caleb later informed Devin about what Brittany had said, to his annoyance. Brittany was nominated again alongside Paola, with Brittany being Devin's main target, which became official after they lost the Battle of the Block to Hayden and Nicole. After Devin won the Power of Veto, Brittany pleaded for him to use the veto on her, noting their similarities for being single parents. After a change of heart, Devin used the veto to take Brittany off the block and nominated Zach in her place. In week 4, Brittany was nominated by Cody, after Frankie told him that Brittany had said she felt unsafe being the only girl not to "suck up" to Cody. Derrick also encouraged Cody to target Brittany because she was the only person not on their side of the house  that they could manipulate. Brittany and Victoria did not manage to win the Battle of the Block competition, leaving them as the official nominees. Losing the veto, she was made an official nominee. Brittany was voted out in a unanimous vote of 10-0 against Donny on Day 35, coming in 13th place.

He nominated Nicole and Christine for eviction. Christine won POV, which meant that Caleb named Victoria the replacement nominee alongside Nicole, in hopes that Nicole would be evicted a second time. In Week 12, Caleb won his fourth HOH of the season. Only counting official or permanent HOHs, he is tied with Drew Daniels, Janelle Pierzina, Hayden Moss, Rachel Reilly, Ian Terry and Aaryn Gries for the most HOHs in a single season. He then nominated Frankie and Victoria for eviction. In Week 12, HOH Derrick nominated Caleb and Victoria for eviction. Cody won the veto and decided not to use it, leaving the nominations the same. On Day 90, Caleb was evicted by Cody, coming in 4th Place. Caleb had a well known unrequited crush on Amber which many other housemates regard as "creepy and obsessive". Caleb was disliked by several houseguests at the beginning of the game, especially Cody and Zach due to his obsession with Amber but obtained a friendship with the two. He also had close friendships with Derrick, Brittany, Devin, Donny, Frankie and Amber despite his obsession with her. Caleb voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. Prior to the premiere, Caleb created controversy after an [[Instagram]] post surfaced which voiced his disapproval of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. In addition, it was revealed that he used [[homophobic]] slurs in his responses and referred to Obama as a [[Muslim]] [[List of ethnic slurs|monkey]].

On Day 97, Cody won the final HOH of the season after winning on a tiebreaker question. He evicted Victoria and took his ally Derrick to the final 2.

Devin initiated the "Crazy 8's" alliance with his group of the house (who entered first) and formed a side alliance with Donny known as the "Double D's". Following the second group's entrance into the house, Devin joined the "Bomb Squad" alliance and later targeted his own ally Donny for eviction. Without consulting the other alliance members, he then brought Amber and Christine into the "Bomb Squad". It then became clear to the other house guest that he was the loose cannon of his alliance, with his paranoia and erratic behavior starting to irritate the majority of his fellow house guests.  He was crowned the second Head of Household in Week 2 after it was revealed that Cody had unintentionally fouled before he finished. He nominated Brittany and Paola, with the intention of evicting Brittany. Once he won the Power of Veto, Devin had a change of heart and did not want to evict a single mother of three as a single parent of a daughter himself. He ended up putting up his fellow "Bomb Squad" ally, Zach, as a replacement nominee which led to his alliance turning against him. Knowing everyone was out to get him, Devin fought to win the Power of Veto, however Donny beat him out in the second to last round of the competition (after which the rest of the HouseGuests cheered wildly). After Donny used the Power of Veto on Jocasta, Devin was announced the replacement nominee. Devin was the third house guest evicted on Day 28 in a unanimous vote. He came in 14th place.

He had previously applied to compete on ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''. Frankie applied to the show after getting encouragement from Adam Poch of [[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|BB13]] to do so. He became the first Head of Household after winning the Head of Household competition, "Go Fly a Kite". However, he was dethroned as HoH after his nominees (Brittany and Victoria) won the "Battle of the Block" competition. He became co-Head of Household again in Week Four with partner Cody in the "Devilled Eggs" competition, but he was dethroned for the second time when nominees Amber and Jocasta won the Battle of the Block. He formed an alliance with his fellow HoH Caleb called the "Bomb Squad", as well as a final two deal with Zach.  Frankie is also one of three members whom fans voted to participate in this season's twist, [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)#Team America|Team America]]. Frankie got the news of his grandfather's death on the show, but decided against leaving ''Big Brother''. Shortly thereafter, he won his third Head of Household competition, entitled "Country Hits", because Derrick threw the competition. Frankie is the first houseguest in Big Brother History to win HoH two weeks in a row. This is mostly because he was dethroned twice, giving him an equal chance to win HOH again. On Day 36, Frankie became the sole HoH (after being dethroned twice before) when his nominees (Jocasta and Victoria) lost the Battle of the Block competition. He was responsible for Amber's eviction that week. After Nicole won Head of Household, she and the rest of the house wanted to eliminate Frankie.

In the next week, Frankie won his fourth Head of Household competition and nominated Cody and Caleb in an attempt to evict Donny. But after Christine and Donny won the Battle of the Block, and when Frankie won the Power of Veto competition, he decided to use the veto on Caleb and nominated his ally and best friend Zach in his place, in a successful attempt to finally evict Zach from the house. On Day 77, Frankie won his second POV of the season and won his fifth HOH competition of the season, meaning he has broken the record for most HOH wins but only retained three of his HOH reigns due to being dethroned Week 1 and 4 during the Double HOH Twist. Therefore, he did not break the record. In Week 12, Frankie was nominated alongside Victoria for eviction by Caleb and was evicted with a unanimous vote of 2-0, coming in 5th Place. Frankie voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. In terms of retainable competition wins, not including the Battle of the Block, Frankie Grande is tied with fellow houseguest Cody Calafiore, Frank Eudy and Shane Meaney for the most competitions won by a male, at 6.

During the fifth week, Hayden won the Power of Veto and used it to save Victoria.&lt;ref name="HaydenVeto" /&gt; On Day 49, Caleb immediately had to nominate two houseguests (It was Double Eviction Night) so, he nominated Hayden alongside Donny.

'''Paola Shea Racelis''' (born May 29, 1987), 27, is a DJ who is originally from [[East Hampton, Connecticut]] and is currently residing in [[Astoria, New York]].&lt;ref name=PaolaBB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Interactive|first1=CBS|title=Paola Shea|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214874/|publisher=CBS.com|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was recruited for the show, although she claims to have been a fan of the show. Paola has appeared in Maxim magazine as well as becoming a top ranked female gamer.&lt;ref name=PaolaBB /&gt; She was in the first group to enter the house. Whilst in the house, Paola was seen as an easy target for nominations due to her complete lack of ability in all of the competitions. Caleb nominated Paola and Donny in week 1, however they lost the Battle of the Block and remained on the block. After Donny won the Power of Veto, Joey was announced as the replacement nominee. Paola survived the eviction, with no votes cast against her. In week 3,  Devin nominated Paola alongside Brittany, with the latter being his main target. Devin asked Paola to throw the Battle of the Block and ensured her that she would not be going home. Paola kept her word and lost the Battle of the Block (although most of the HouseGuests weren't sure if she actually threw the competition due to being generally weak in all competitions). After Devin won the Power of Veto, he blindsided Paola by using the veto on Brittany after she made a valiant plea to him to keep her in the game, and announced Zach as the replacement nominee. On Day 21, Paola became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house, receiving a total of ten eviction votes, the first non-unanimous vote of the season, with only Jocasta and Donny voting to evict Zach. She came in 15th place.&lt;ref name="PaolaEviction"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carbone|first1=Gina|title=Big Brother 16 Spoilers: Paola Shea Goes Home — Second HG Evicted!|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/big-brother/articles/2014-07-10-16-spoilers-paola-shea-evicted|website=http://www.wetpaint.com|publisher=Wet Paint.|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victoria==
'''Victoria Rafaeli''' (born June 16, 1992), 21, is a photographer who is originally from [[Brooklyn]] and [[Holon, Israel]] but currently residing in [[Weston, Florida]].&lt;ref name=VictoriaBB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Interactive|first1=CBS|title=Victoria Rafaeli - Big Brother 16 Cast|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214875/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Israeli parents and even once rejected a public marriage proposal.&lt;ref name=VictoriaBB /&gt; She has drawn comparisons to reality star [[Kim Kardashian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ghahremani|first1=Tanya|title='Big Brother' Victoria Is the New Kim Kardashian &amp; Here Are 5 Reasons Why|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/32350-big-brother-victoria-is-the-new-kim-kardashian-here-are-5-reasons-why|publisher=Bustle|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria was inspired to become a photographer at the age of nine, ever since she picked up her first camera.&lt;ref name=AboutVictoria&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rafaeli|first1=Victoria|title=Victoria Rafaeli Photography – About|url=http://www.victoriarphoto.com/#!about/c240r|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started her own photography business when she was only nineteen years old, without any formal training.&lt;ref name=VictoriaBB /&gt; Victoria was recruited for the show, although she claims she was unfamiliar with the American version, she had seen the [[HaAh HaGadol|Israeli version]] of the show.

She entered the house with the second group. She was nominated by Frankie for eviction, feeling like it was fair because she and Brittany were the first house guests to be eliminated in the HOH competition. However, they escaped the block after winning the "Battle of the Block" competition, voiding Frankie's nominations and removing his HoH status. On Day 29, she was nominated by Cody with once again Brittany and lost the "Battle of the Block" competition, but won the power of veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carbone|first1=Gina|title=Big Brother 16 Spoilers: Cody Is Week 4 HOH; Brittany on Block; Victoria Won POV!(UPDATES)|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/big-brother/articles/2014-07-17-spoilers-week-4-hoh-nominees|publisher=Wet Paint|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was again nominated by Frankie in the fifth week with Jocasta and failed to win the "Battle of the Block" competition, but was saved by Hayden, who she selected as "Houseguests' Choice" for the veto competition.&lt;ref name="HaydenVeto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyer|first1=Matthew|title=‘Big Brother 16′ Spoilers: Week 5 Veto Ceremony Results|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/big-brother-16-spoilers-week-5-veto-ceremony-results/|publisher=BigBrotherNetwork|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Week 6, she was nominated alongside Caleb by Donny for eviction, however, they won the "Battle of the Block" competition but in doing so earned three punishments; – shaved head, Adam and Eve (chained to Caleb for forty eight hours), and slop (for two weeks).&lt;ref name="AdamAndEve"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Sonya|title=‘Big Brother’ season 16, episode 18 recap: Adam and Eve|url=http://www.hypable.com/2014/08/03/big-brother-season-16-episode-18-recap-adam-and-eve/|publisher=Hypable|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During week 10, on Day 74, Victoria was the replacement nominee after Christine won the POV. On Day 77, Victoria was nominated by Derrick to ensure Christine's eviction. In Week 11, Frankie nominated Cody and Victoria with his target being later. Both got off the block however due to the Rewind Twist. During Week 12, Victoria was nominated for an eighth time alongside Frankie by Caleb, however Victoria won $5,000 when she bet on eventually winner Hayden to win the "Puck It For Luxury" Jury Competition.&lt;ref name=Luxury&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drum|first1=Mark|title=Big Brother Season 16 Episode 36 Recap: Only One Will Win|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2014/09/15/big-brother-season-16-episode-36-recap-only-one-will-win/|publisher=CBSLocal|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria's closest ally has been Derrick, and she also formed a strong bond with Nicole when she returned to the house. Victoria currently holds the record for having the  most nominations in a single season with ten nominations, but four of those nominations were either vetoed or canceled out through "Battle of the Block" wins. She does, however, hold a ''Big Brother'' record of most consecutive post-veto nominations, having survived all five of the other nominations each in a row, without receiving a single vote to evict her until her sixth consecutive nomination. On Day 97, Victoria was evicted by the final HOH Cody, coming in 3rd place. She is the ninth and final member of the Jury. Victoria voted for Derrick to win Big Brother.

On Aug 23, an incident involving Victoria started at around 11:14&amp;nbsp;a.m. when Nicole found Victoria collapsed in the toilet stall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kubicek|first1=John|title='Big Brother 16' Spoilers: A Medical Emergency and Team America|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/big-brother/big-brother-16-spoilers-a-medi-54415.aspx|publisher=Buddy TV|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that the pain she received from her wisdom teeth (which started on Aug 22) was a possible cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reiher|first1=Andrea|title='Big Brother 16': Victoria Rafaeli collapses in the bathroom|url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/big_brother_16_victoria_rafaeli_collapses_in_the_bathroom-2014-08|publisher=Zap2It|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria left the house for medical attention and she returned to the house at 1:56&amp;nbsp;p.m. from the hospital. She stated that they gave her an IV for the pain and dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boyer|first1=Matthew|title=Big Brother 16: Victoria Rafaeli Medical Emergency – Found On Bathroom Floor &amp; Live Feeds Cut – Update|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/big-brother-16-victoria-rafaeli-medical-emergency-bathroom-feeds/|publisher=Big Brother Network|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zach==
'''Zachary "Zach" Colin Rance''' (born September 9, 1990), 23, is from [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida]]. He graduated from the [[University of Florida]] with a degree in [[Economics]].&lt;ref name=ZachBB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Interactive|first1=CBS|title=Zach Rance - Big Brother 16 Cast|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/cast/214880/|publisher=CBS|accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zach was a member of the "Bomb Squad" and the founder of "The Detonators". Zach won his first HOH in week 5 and choose to nominate Nicole and his ally, Christine after she refuses to follow through with his plan to throw the Battle of the Block competition with Amber, his real target. He was ultimately dethroned. He was nominated in Week 6 by Nicole but escaped the eviction after his ally voted for him to stay. He was nominated once again in Week 7 by his ally Christine. He won the veto and saved himself, leading to Nicole's eviction. In Week 8, he became the replacement nominee by Frankie after he was deemed a troublemaker by him and was evicted on a 5-0 vote. He is technically the fourth jury member but Nicole came back so it makes him the third member of the Jury. He came in 9th place. Zach voted for Derrick to win Big Brother. Zach became quite popular with fans for his zany behavior and seemingly romantic relationship with House Guest Frankie Grande which led him to be in the Top 3 of America's Favourite Houseguest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8499">In many denominations of [[Christianity]] the [[ordination of women]] is a new phenomenon. This is true enough that those so ordained gain some attention. This list deals with that and will include bishops as well, but due to historical differences [[deaconess]]es will not be included. In [[Presbyterianism]], [[Methodism]] and a few other denominations the ordination of women predates 1900 and is now common enough to be unremarkable. Hence those denominations are not included.

He ruled over an area of southern [[Xinjiang]], nicknamed [[Tunganistan]] by westerners, from 1934-37.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Andrew D.

==Tunganistan==

His 36th Division crushed the [[Charkhlik Revolt]] by the [[Uighurs]] in the [[Ruoqiang County|Charkhlik]] oasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=Charkhlik+ma+hu-shan#v=snippet&amp;q=Charkhlik%20uighur%20rising%20put%20down%20by%20the%20tungans&amp;f=false|title=Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: A Political History of Republican Sinkiang 1911–1949|author=Andrew D.W.

Ma Hushan and the 36th Division declared their loyalty to the [[Kuomintang]] government in [[Nanjing]] and sent emissaries there requesting aid to fight against [[Sheng Shicai]]'s provincial forces and the Soviet Union.

'''Marilyn J. Boxer''' (born 1930) is a historian in the field of [[women's studies]], one of the earliest in that field. She served as chair of the women's studies program at [[San Diego State University]], the first program of its kind in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Trailblazers of California: Pioneers to the Present|last=Harris|first=Gloria G.|publisher=History Press|year=2012|isbn=9781614236214|location=Charleston, SC|pages=|chapter=Marilyn J. Boxer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in various academic and administrative leadership roles there and at [[San Francisco State University]].

She was born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and attended [[Wellesley College]] on a scholarship but dropped out before graduating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1950s and '60s she led a family life, marrying twice and raising three children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this time, she read the influential [[Feminism|feminist]] works ''[[The Second Sex]]'' by [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' by [[Betty Friedan]], and resolved to complete her degree.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She re-entered at the [[University of Redlands]] and earned a bachelor's in history in 1965.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8gh9m71/|title=Boxer (Marilyn J.)

As a graduate student, she taught "Women in History" at [[San Bernardino Valley College]], which she later characterized as her first "women's studies" course.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was hired at San Diego State University in 1974 and appointed chair of the women's studies program,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which had been founded in 1970.

In the 1980s, she moved into administrative roles at San Diego State, serving as associate dean of the College of Arts and Letters from 1984 to 1985, and dean from 1985 to 1989.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/mboxer/boxercv.11.pdf|title=Curriculum Vitae|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[San Francisco State University]] in 1989, serving as vice-president for academic affairs from 1989 to 1996 and professor of history until 2003, when she became [[emeritus]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was a lecturer and scholar at the Institute for Research on Women and Gender at [[Stanford University]], which acquired her papers in 2014.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.stanford.edu/blogs/special-collections-unbound/2014/07/archives-acquires-papers-marilyn-boxer-and-karen-offen|title=Archives acquires papers of Marilyn Boxer and Karen Offen|website=Stanford Libraries|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received the 2004 [[Helen S.

'''Melvyn Francis Courtney''' (born 1943) is a Nelson City Councillor and a former [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] then [[Independent politician|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand.

==Early life==

Courtney was born in [[Christchurch]] and grew up in the suburb of [[Spreydon]]. He studied business administration and trained in the grocery industry before moving to Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecommunityarchive.org.nz/node/71517/description |title=Courtney, Melvyn Francis, 1943– |year=2009 |website=The Community Archive |publisher=Archives New Zealand | accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtney represented the [[Nelson (New Zealand electorate)|Nelson electorate]] from 1976 to 1981 and was opposition spokesman for horticulture and fisheries for five years. He was a recipient of both the [[Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal]] in 1977 for service to the community and the [[New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal]] in recognition of services to New Zealand. Courtney is currently in his fourth term on the [[Nelson City Council]].

===Independent===
In March 1981  Courtney announced that he had let his membership of the Labour Party lapse. Soon after, he withdrew from the Labour Party caucus and sat in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] as an [[Independent politician|independent]].

The Labour Party suffered defeats in the 1975, 1978 and 1981 general elections under the leadership of Bill Rowling. Courtney saw the momentum that had been gained under the Prime Ministership of the charismatic Labour leader [[Norman Kirk]] (1972–74) was being eroded and lost by Rowling. Courtney firmly believed that change was needed in the leadership in order to beat Robert Muldoon and the National Party. Rowling was not an effective counter to Muldoon: in Parliament Muldoon had the measure of Rowling and Rowling was perceived as weak in the media. After Courtney's strong performance in the [[Nelson by-election 1976|Nelson by-election in 1976]] the 1978 Labour Party general election result was a "major disappointment" for Courtney (Henderson, 1981). In the December 1980 leadership vote of confidence Courtney voted against Rowling. Rowling clung onto the Labour leadership by one vote-his own (Bassett, 2008).

Courtney's announcement of his independent candidacy for the [[New Zealand general election, 1981|1981 general election]] was made only a few days before the 35th anniversary of the death of [[Harry Atmore]], MP for Nelson from 1911 to 1946. Atmore had been the last independent MP to be elected to the [[Parliament of New Zealand]].

===1981 election===
At the 1981 election supporters rallied around Courtney's Independent campaign and, although defeated, it was by the very narrow margin of 698 votes. Courtney took 37.0 per cent of the total vote, 3.4 percentage points behind the Labour candidate, and nearly three times as many votes as the [[New Zealand National Party|National]] candidate's share of the vote. This was the best result by an independent candidate in [[Elections in New Zealand|New Zealand Elections]] in nearly 40 years.

'''Morlachs''' ({{lang-sh|Morlaci,  Crni Vlasi}}, {{lang-sr-cyr|Морлаци}}) has been an [[exonym]] used for a rural [[Christian]] community in [[Herzegovina]], [[Lika]] and the [[Dalmatian Hinterland]]. The term was initially used for a [[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlach]] pastoralist community in the mountains of [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Croatia]] in the second half of the 14th until the early 16th century. Later, when the community straddled the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]–[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] border in the 17th century, it referred to Slavic-speaking, mainly Eastern Orthodox, and to a lesser degree Roman Catholic people. The exonym ceased to be used in an [[ethnic]] sense by the end of the 18th century, and came to be viewed as derogatory, but has been renewed as a [[social anthropology|social]] or [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropological]] subject. With the nation-building in the 19th century, the population of the Dalmatian Hinterland espoused either a [[Serbs|Serb]] or [[Croats|Croat]] ethnic identity, but preserved some common sociocultural outlines.

==Etymology==
The word ''Morlach'' is derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Morlacco'' and [[Latin language|Latin]] ''Morlachus'' or ''Murlachus'', being [[cognate]] to [[Modern Greek|Greek]] Μαυροβλάχοι ''Maurovlachoi'', meaning "Black Vlachs" (from Greek μαύρο ''mauro'' meaning "dark", "black"). The [[Serbo-Croatian]] term in its singular form is ''{{lang|sh|Morlak}}''; its plural form is ''{{lang|sh|Morlaci}}'' [mor-latsi]. In some 16th-century redactions of the ''[[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja|Doclean Chronicle]]'', they are referred to as "Morlachs or ''Nigri Latini''" (Black Latins).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.muzic-ivan.info/hrvatska_kronika.pdf| title=Hrvatska kronika u Ljetopisu pop Dukljanina| author=Ivan Mužić| publisher=Muzej hrvatski arheoloških spomenika| location=Split| year=2011| page=66 (''Crni Latini''), 260 (''qui illo tempore Romani vocabantur, modo vero Moroulachi, hoc est Nigri Latini vocantur.'')| quote=In some Croatian and Latin redactions of the [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]], from 16th century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petar Skok]] suggested it derived from the Latin ''maurus'' and Greek ''maurós'' ("dark"), the diphthongs ''au'' and ''av'' indicating a Dalmato-Romanian lexical remnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=P. Skok| title=Etymological dictionary of Croatian or Serbian language| publisher=[[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|JAZU]]| location=Zagreb| volume=II| year=1972| pages=392–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Dimitrie Cantemir]], in his ''History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire'' remarks that when [[Moldavia]] was subdued to the Ottoman Rule by [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed|Bogdan III]], Moldavia was referred to by the Ottomans as "Ak iflac", or Ak Vlach (i.e., White Wallachians), while the [[Wallachia|Wallachians]] were known as "Kara iflac", or Kara Vlach, (i.e., Black Wallachians). &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q3NUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA47 p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;
"Black Vlachs" in fact mean "Northern Vlachs" , because Turkish "[[wikt:kara|kara]]" means black but also means North in old Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;Cicerone Poghirc, Romanizarea lingvistică și culturală în Balcani. In: Aromânii, istorie, limbă, destin. Coord. Neagu Giuvara, București, Editura Humanitas, 2012, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several interpretations of the ethnonym and phrase "moro/mavro/mauro vlasi". The direct translation of the name Morovlasi in Serbo-Croatian would mean Black Vlachs. It was considered that "black" referred to their clothes of brown cloth. The 17th-century [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Dalmatia]]n historian [[Johannes Lucius]] suggested that it actually meant "Black Latins", compared to "White Romans" in coastal areas. The 18th-century writer [[Alberto Fortis]] in his book ''Travels in Dalmatia'' (1774), in which he wrote extensively about the Morlachs, thought that it derived from the Slavic ''more'' ("sea") – ''morski Vlasi'' meaning "Sea Vlachs". 18th-century writer [[Ivan Lovrić]], observing Fortis' work, thought that it came from "more" (sea) and "(v)lac(s)i" (strong) ("strongmen by the sea"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=P.

==Origin and culture==
[[Image:Valerio - Musiciens Morlaques (Salone), 1864.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Morlachian musicians from [[Solin|Salona]], Théodore Valerio, 1864]]
The etymology of the exonym points to a connection with [[Vlachs]], but as stated in Fortis' work ''Travels in Dalmatia'', they were at that time Slavic-speaking. Because of migrations from various parts of the Balkans, the name had passed to later communities. The Morlach people were both of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] faith.

Fortis spotted the physical difference between Morlachs; those from around [[Kotor]], [[Sinj]] and [[Knin]] were generally blond-haired, with blue eyes, and broad faces, while those around [[Zadvarje]] and [[Vrgorac]] were generally brown-haired with narrow faces. They also differed in nature. Although they were often seen by urban dwellers as strangers and "those people" from the periphery,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolff|2002|p=126}}; {{Cite book| first=Richard| last=Brookes| publisher=F.C. and J. Rivington| year=1812| title=The general gazetteer or compendious geographical dictionary (Morlachia)| page=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1730 ''[[provveditore]]'' Zorzi Grimani described them as "ferocious, but not indomitable" by nature, [[Edward Gibbon]] called them "barbarians",{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=40}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=348}} and Fortis praised their "[[noble savage]]ry", moral, family, and friendship virtues, but also complained about their persistence in keeping to old traditions. He found that they sang melancholic verses of epic poetry related to the Ottoman occupation,{{sfn|Beller|Leerssen|2007|p=235}} accompanied with the traditional single stringed instrument called [[gusle]].{{sfn|Beller|Leerssen|2007|p=235}} During his travels, he discovered what he believed to be a "Morlachian ballad", the ''[[Hasanaginica]]''.{{sfn|Beller|Leerssen|2007|p=235}} Manfred Beller and [[Joep Leerssen]] identified the cultural traits of the Morlachs as being part of the South Slavic and Serb ethnotype.{{sfn|Beller|Leerssen|2007|p=235}}

They made their living as [[shepherd]]s and merchants, as well as soldiers.{{sfn|Lovrić|1776|p=170–181}}{{sfn|Vince-Pallua|1992}} They neglected agricultural work, usually did not have gardens and orchards besides those growing naturally, and had for the time old farming tools, Lovrić explaining it as: "what our ancestors did not do, neither will we".{{sfn|Lovrić|1776|p=174|ps=: ''Ciò, che non ànno fatto i nostri maggiori, neppur noi vogliam fare.''}}{{sfn|Vince-Pallua|1992}} Morlach families had herds numbering from 200 to 600, while the poorer families around 40 to 50, from which they received milk, and made various dairy products.{{sfn|Lovrić|1776|p=170-181}}{{sfn|Vince-Pallua|1992}}

Contemporary I. Lovrić said that the Morlachs were Slavs who spoke better Slavic than the [[Ragusans]] (owing to the growing Italianization of the Dalmatian coast).{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=360}} Boško Desnica (1886–1945), after analysing Venetian papers, concluded that the Venetians undifferentiated the Slavic people in Dalmatia, and that the language and script of the region was labeled as "Illirico" or "Servian".{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=356}} Lovrić made no distinction between the Vlachs/Morlachs and the Dalmatians and Montenegrins, whom he considered Slavs, and was not at all bothered by the fact that the Morlachs were predominantly Orthodox Christian.{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=361}} Fortis noted that there was often conflict between the Catholic and Orthodox Morlachs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Narodna umjetnost|volume=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP7ZAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Institut za narodnu umjetnost|page=83|quote="It is usual that there is perfect disharmony between the Latin and the Greek religions; neither of the clergymen do not hesitate to sow it: each side tells thousands of scandalous stories about the other" (Fortis 1984:45)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However some of Morlachs have passed to Islam during Turkish occupation&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Catherwood, Making War In The Name Of God, Kensington Publishing Corp., 1 2008, P.141&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, "Viaggio in Dalmatia", Fortis presented the poetry of the Morlachs.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Wolff, Rise and fall of Morlachismo. In: Norman M. Naimark, Holly Case, Stanford University Press, Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, {{ISBN|978-0804745949}} p.44&lt;/ref&gt; He also published several specimens of Morlach songs.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Wolff, Rise and fall of Morlachismo. In: Norman M. Naimark, Holly Case, Stanford University Press, Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, {{ISBN|978-0804745949}} p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Fortis believed that the Morlachs preserved their old customs and clothes. Their ethnographic traits were traditional clothings, use of the [[gusle]] musical instrument accompanied with epic singing.

==History==

===Early history===
The use of ''Morlachs'' is first attested in 1344, when ''Morolacorum'' are mentioned in lands around [[Knin]] and [[Krbava]] during the conflict between the counts of the [[Kurjaković noble family|Kurjaković]] and [[Nelipić]] families.{{sfn|Mužić |2010|p=10, 11|ps=: ''Et insuper mittemus specialem nuntium…. Gregorio condam Curiaci Corbavie,…. pro bono et conservatione dicte domine (Vedislave) et comitis Johannis,….; nec non pro restitutione Morolacorum, qui sibi dicuntur detineri per comitem Gregorium…; Exponat quoque idem noster nuncius Gregorio comiti predicto quod intelleximus, quod contra voluntatem ipsius comitis Johannis nepotis sui detinet catunos duos Morolacorum…. Quare dilectionem suam… reget, quatenus si quos Morolacos ipsius habet, placeat illos sibi plenarie restitui facere…''}} The first mention of the term ''Morlachs'' is simultaneous with the appearance of [[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlachs]] in the documents of [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Croatia]] in the early 14th century; in 1321, a local priest on the island of [[Krk]] granted land to the church ("to the lands of Kneže, which are called Vlach"), while in 1322 Vlachs were allied with [[Mladen II Šubić of Bribir|Mladen Šubić]] at the [[Battle of Bliska|battle]] in the hinterland of Trogir.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=10}} According to Mužić in those early documents there is no identifiable differentiation between the terms Vlach and Morlach.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=14-17}} In 1352, in the agreement in which [[Zadar]] sold salt to the [[Republic of Venice]], Zadar retained part of the salt that ''Morlachi'' and others exported by land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Listine o odnošajih Južnoga Slavenstva i Mletačke Republike|publisher=JAZU|location=Zagreb|volume=III|year=1872|page=237|quote=Prvi se put spominje ime »Morlak« (Morlachi) 1352 godine, 24. lipnja, u pogodbi po kojoj zadarsko vijeće prodaje sol Veneciji, gdje Zadar zadržava dio soli koju Morlaci i drugi izvoze, kopnenim putem.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mužić |2010|p=11|ps=: ''Detractis modiis XII. milie salis predicti quolibet anno que remaneant in Jadra pro usu Jadre et districtu, et pro exportatione solita ﬁ eri per Morlachos et alios per terram tantum…''}} In 1362, the ''Morlachorum'',  settled, without authorization, on lands of [[Trogir]] and used it for pasture for a few months.{{sfn|Mužić |2010|p=12|ps=: ''quedam particula gentis Morlachorum ipsius domini nostri regis... tentoria (tents), animalia seu pecudes (sheep)... ut ipsam particulam gentis Morlachorum de ipsorum territorio repellere… dignaremur (to be repelled from city territory)... quamplures Morlachos... usque ad festum S. Georgii martiris (was allowed to stay until April 24, 1362).''}} In the Statute of [[Senj]] dating to 1388, the [[House of Frankopan|Frankopan]]s mentioned ''Morowlachi'' and defined the amount of time they had for pasture when they descended from the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=67009| author=L.

Early Vlachs probably lived on Croatian territory even before the 14th century, being the progeny of romanized [[Illyrians]] and pre-Slavic Romance-speaking people.{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=129}} During the 14th century, Vlach settlements existed throughout much of today's Croatia, from the northern island [[Krk]], around the [[Velebit]] and [[Dinara]] mountains, and along the southern rivers [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] and [[Cetina]].

===16th century===
As many former inhabitants of the Croatian-Ottoman borderland fled northwards or were captured by the Ottoman invaders, they left unpopulated areas. The [[Austrian Empire]] established the [[Military Frontier]]s in 1522, which served as a buffer against Ottoman incursions.{{sfn|Suppan|Graf|2010|p=55-57}} At the time, "Vlachs",{{refn|group="nb"|"[[Vlachs]]", referring to pastoralists, since the 16th century was a common name for Serbs in the Ottoman Empire and later.&lt;ref name=LING&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/pas/pas2003/pas2003-02.pdf| title=Elements of ethnic identification of the Serbs| author=D. Gavrilović| location=Niš| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tihomir Đorđević points to the already known fact that the name 'Vlach' didn't only refer to genuine [[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlachs]] or [[Serbs of Croatia|Serbs]] but also to cattle breeders in general.&lt;ref name="LING"/&gt; A letter of Emperor Ferdinand, sent on November 6, 1538, to Croatian ban Petar Keglević, in which he wrote ''"Captains and dukes of the Rasians, or the Serbs, or the Vlachs, who are commonly called the Serbs"''.&lt;ref name=LING/&gt; In the work ''About the Vlachs'' from 1806, Metropolitan Stevan Stratimirović states that Roman Catholics from Croatia and Slavonia scornfully used the name 'Vlach' for ''"the Slovenians (Slavs) and Serbs, who are of our, Eastern confession (Orthodoxy)"'', and that ''"the Turks in Bosnia and Serbia also call every Bosnian or Serbian Christian a Vlach"'' (T. Đorđević, 1984:110).&lt;ref name=LING/&gt;}} served both in the conquesting Ottoman armies, and Austria and Venice, and were settled by both sides.{{sfn|Suppan|Graf|2010|p=52, 59}}

In 1579, several groups of ''Morlachs'', understood as a Serb tribe in Dalmatia, immigrated and requested to be employed as military colonists.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunther Erich Rothenberg|title=The Austrian military border in Croatia, 1522–1747|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g701AAAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=50|quote=&lt;!--Morlachs, a Serbian tribe--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, there were some tensions between these immigrants and the established [[Uskoks]].&lt;ref name="Rothenberg1960"/&gt; In 1593, ''[[provveditore]] generale'' (Overseer) Cristoforo Valier mentioned three nations constituting the Uskoks: the "natives of Senj, Croatians, and Morlachs from the Turkish parts".{{sfn|Fine|2006|p=218}}

The name "Morlach" entered toponymy; the [[Velebit]] mountain was called ''Montagne della Morlacca'' ("mountain of the Morlachs"), while the Velebit canal was called ''Canale della Morlacca''.

From the 16th century onward, the historical term changes meaning, as in most Venetian documents, Morlachs are now usually called immigrants, both Orthodox and Catholic, from the Ottoman-conquered territories in the Western Balkans (chiefly Bosnia and Herzegovina). These settled in the Venetian-Ottoman frontier, in the hinterlands of coastal cities, and entered Venetian military service by the early 17th century.

===17th century===
{{see also|Morlachs (Venetian irregulars)}} [[Image:Morlachia.jpg|thumb|right|"Morlachia" in the 17th century, map by [[Thomas Jefferys]] (1785).]]
At the time of the [[Cretan War (1645–69)]] and [[Morean War|Morean War (1684-99)]], a large number of ''Morlachs'' settled inland of the Dalmatian towns, and [[Ravni Kotari]] of Zadar. They were skilled in warfare and familiar with local territory, and served as paid soldiers in both Venetian and Ottoman armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roksandić|first=Drago|title=Etnos, konfesija, tolerancija (Priručnik o vojnim krajinama u Dalmaciji iz 1783. godine)|location=Zagreb|publisher=SKD Prosvjeta|pages=11–41|year=2004|language=Croatian|url=http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/pov/zavod/triplex2/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ROKSANDIC_1999.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activity was similar to that of the [[Uskoks]]. Their military service granted them land, and freed them from trials, and gave them rights which freed them from full debt law (only 1/10 yield), thus many joined the so-called "Morlach" or "Vlach" armies.&lt;ref name="Tusculum 2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Milan Ivanišević|title=Izvori za prva desetljeća novoga Vranjica i Solina|location=Solin|journal=Tusculum|volume=Volume 2, No. 1 September|page=98|year=2009|language=Croatian|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=78147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, some notable Morlach military leaders{{refn|group="nb"|The head leaders in Venice, Ottoman and local Slavic documents were titled as ''capo'', ''capo direttore'', ''capo principale de Morlachi'' (J.

After the dissolution of the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1797, and loss of power in Dalmatia, the term Morlach would disappear from use.

==Legacy==
During the time of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]], Morlachs were seen as the "model of primitive Slavdom",{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=13}} and the "spirits of [[pastoral]] [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] ''Morlacchia''".{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=41}} They attracted the attention of travel writers like 17th-century [[Jacob Spon]] and [[Sir George Wheler]],{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=128}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wendy Bracewell|author2=Alex Drace-Francis|title=Under Eastern Eyes: A Comparative Introduction to East European Travel Writing on Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZipk3ZEJJwC&amp;dq=morlachs&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2008|pages=154–157|isbn=9639776114}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 18th-century writers [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who labeled their poems as "Morlackisch".{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=190}}{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=42}} In 1793, at the carnival in Venice, a play about Morlacchi, ''Gli Antichi Slavi'' ("antique Slavs"), was performed, and in 1802 it was reconceived as a ballet ''Le Nozze dei Morlacchi''.{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=42}} At the beginning of the 19th century, still seen as relics from the primitive past and a byword for barbarous people, they inspired science fiction novelist [[H. G. Wells]] in his depiction of the fictional [[Morlock]]s ,{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=348}} while the female embroidered leggings reminded [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] of the appearance of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] [[squaw]]s.{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=47}} In the 20th century, Alice Moque, as did many other women travelers, in her 1914 travelogue ''Delightful Dalmatia'' emphasized the picturesqueness of the sight of Morlach women and men in their folk costumes, which "made [[Zadar|Zara]]'s Plazza look like a stage setting", and regretted the coming of new civilization.{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=47}}

In the Balkans the term became derogatory, indicating people from the mountains – backward people, and became disliked by the ''Morlachs'' (Croats and Serbs) themselves.&lt;ref name="Baerlein"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Baerlein|title=The Birth of Yugoslavia (Complete)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrerfGc7kUoC&amp;pg=PT20|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=978-1-4655-5007-1|pages=20–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Naimark|Case|2003|p=46}} There have been no individuals declaring themselves to be Morlachs in the Croatian censuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/usp_03_HR.htm |title=Stanovništvo prema narodnosti, popisi 1971. - 2011. |date= |language=Croatian |accessdate=20 December 2012}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_03_10/H01_03_10.html|title=Croatian 2001 census, detailed classification by nationality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In ''[[Rigveda]]'' the name ''mūni'' refers to a known Vedic [[Rishi]] who was prosperous beyond ritualistic orthodoxy, i.e., [[Brahmanism]] &lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="citation"&gt;Muni. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a much later work, the ''[[Yoga Vasistha|Laghu-yoga-vasistha]]'' &lt;ref&gt;( 6.7.3 )&lt;/ref&gt;, mūnis are divided into two types:

'''Nitsana Darshan-Leitner''' is an Israeli attorney, human rights activist and the founder of [[Shurat HaDin]] Israeli Law Center. She has been leading the legal fight against terror financing, the anti-Israel boycott campaigns (BDS) and combating the multitude of lawfare tactics utilized against the Jewish State by its enemies. As the president of the Israel-based civil rights organization, Shurat HaDin–Israel Law Center, she has represented hundreds of terror victims in legal actions against terror organizations and their supporters. Ms. Darshan-Leitner has successfully recovered more than two hundred million dollars in compensation on their behalf. In recent years, Ms. Darshan-Leitner initiated a legal campaign to deprive terrorists of social media resources such as Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/225925|title=Facebook sued in mega court case|website=Israel National News|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/wife-n-y-man-killed-brussels-bombing-suing-twitter-article-1.2941966|title=Fiancee of N.Y. man killed in Brussels bombing suing Twitter|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and YouTube, which they use to incite violence against Jews and promote terror attacks. In her efforts to combat anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli activities, Ms.  Darshan-Leitner assisted in blocking the Gaza Flotilla,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Lawyers-not-IDF-at-forefront-of-battle-against-flotilla|title=Lawyers, not IDF, at forefront of battle against flotilla|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; terminated efforts to indict IDF soldiers for war crimes, and filed legal actions against those who boycott Israeli academics and companies in violation of the law.

Staffed by some of Israel's leading activist attorneys, Shurat HaDin–Israel Law Center follows the model of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the famed American civil rights organization dedicated to bankrupting the KKK and other neo-Nazi groups in the United States with the goal to economically destroy the hate groups in the Middle East. Thus, the organization's motto: "Bankrupting Terrorism – One Lawsuit at a Time!" She and her associates specialize in tracking the assets and bank accounts of terror groups and legally obstructing and restraining their funds. They have become known by banks, legal organizations and outlaw regimes around the world as the leading authority and resource on stopping the movement of global terror financing. Today, they represent hundreds of terror victims in lawsuits against Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the PLO, The Palestinian Authority, Hezbollah, Iran, Syria, Egypt, North Korea, UBS, and the Lebanese Canadian Bank. The cases, being litigated in Israeli, American, Canadian and European courts, allow the victims of terrorism to fight back.

In 2016, Ms. Darshan-Leitner was chosen as one of the 50 most influential Jews in the world by the Jerusalem Post,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Not-Just-News/Jerusalem-Post-50-Most-Influential-Jews-Number-31-Nitsana-Darshan-Leitner-469055|title=Jerusalem Post 50 Most Influential Jews: Number 31 - Nitsana Darshan-Leitner|work=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named by the Israeli Forbes magazine as one of the 50 most influential Israeli women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbes.co.il/news/new.aspx?Preview=1&amp;0r9VQ=EHLKD|title=Forbes Israel|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and family==

Darshan-Leitner was born in [[Petah Tikva]], Israel.  After completing undergraduate education she received a law degree from [[Bar Ilan University]] in the 1990s and holds  an MBA  from Manchester University.  She subsequently received an [[MBA]] from [[Manchester University]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  She is a mother of six children and is married to Aviel Leitner, an American-born law lecturer from Miami, Florida. She currently lives in North Tel Aviv, Israel.

==Career==
In the 1990s Darshan-Leitner helped litigate a case on behalf of victims of the [[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]] hijacking of 1985. During work on this case, she appeared before the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in an attempt to prevent one of the hijackers, [[Muhammad Zaidan|Muhammed Abbas]] from being allowed to travel to Israel.&lt;ref name="jewishpress.com"&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/38455 "Nitsana darshan Leitner born" at Jewish Press] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207035125/http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/38455 |date=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2003, Abbas was captured by American forces in Iraq while attempting to flee from Baghdad to Syria. Italy subsequently requested his extradition. The Pentagon reported on March 9, 2004 that Zaidan had died the previous day, of natural causes, while in U.S. custody.

In 2003, Darshan-Leitner founded [[Shurat HaDin|Shurat HaDin – Israel Law Center]] in [[Tel Aviv]].  Shurat HaDin is an Israeli-based civil rights center which focuses on bringing lawsuits and legal actions on behalf of the victims of terrorism. She has said she was influenced by the activities of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] which had bankrupted several branches of the [[KKK]] and other neo-Nazi groups through civil litigation. In founding Shurat HaDin, she noted her goal was to "go after terrorists in the same way that they (the SPLC) were going after racists."&lt;ref name="jewishpress.com" /&gt;

According to a 2007 US embassy cable released by [[WikiLeaks]], Darshan-Leitner explained to a US embassy official that Shurat HaDin received evidence from and had taken direction "on which cases to pursue"  from Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/israel-arrests-palestinian-teenager-facebook-posts-151105070221213.html |title=Israel arrests Palestinian teenager over Facebook posts |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=November 6, 2015 |first=Patrick |last=Strickland |accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darshan-Leitner is said to have succeeded in receiving more than $1 billion in judgments, freezing over $600 million in terror assets and securing over $120 million in actual disbursements to the victims and their families. She represents hundreds of terror victims in cases brought against Jimmy Carter, the Islamic Republic of Iran, North Korea, the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and the PLO, among others. She successfully represented Puerto Rican family victims of the 1972 [[Lod Airport massacre|Lod terrorist attack]] in a lawsuit against North Korea. In 2010, a US federal court on the island ruled in their favor, ordering the North Korean government to compensate the victims for the sum of $378 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israellawcenter.org/uploadimages/image/Calderon%2008-cv-01367-FAB.pdf Calderon CV] at Israel Law Center {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017031903/http://www.israellawcenter.org/uploadimages/image/Calderon%2008-cv-01367-FAB.pdf |date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent cases==

Since 2003 Darshan-Leitner and a team of lawyers have worked with hundreds of terror victims in lawsuits&lt;ref name=Amy&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jewishreview.org/node/8584| title=Attorney hits terrorists where it hurts| publisher=[[Jewish Review]] |date=May 2, 2003| first=Amy| last= Kaufman | accessdate = 2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and legal actions against [[Hamas]], the [[Palestinian Authority]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="July1"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E1DF1E3DF931A3575BC0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| title=Syria Is Sued by Family of Man Killed by '96 Bomb in Jerusalem | publisher=[[NY Times]] |date=August 2, 2000| first=Judith| last= Miller | accessdate = 2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] and numerous financial institutions.&lt;ref name="July2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=/ForeignBureaus/archive/200701/FOR20070131e.html |title=Terror Victims' Families Get Approval to Sue Arab Bank |publisher=[[CNSNews]] |date=January 31, 2007 |first=Julie |last=Stahl |accessdate=2008-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205194033/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewForeignBureaus.asp?Page=%2FForeignBureaus%2Farchive%2F200701%2FFOR20070131e.html |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darshan-Leitner has been involved in a wide range of legal actions in Israel.&lt;ref name="FoxNews1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,338009,00.html | title=Israeli Town Demands Anti-Missile Laser | publisher=[[FoxNews]]|date=March 17, 2008| first=Fox| last=News | accessdate = 2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abroad on behalf of Jewish rights cases&lt;ref name=Todd-Pitock&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.jewsweek.com/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Article%5El1645&amp;enPage=BlankPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enDispWhat=object&amp;enVersion=0&amp;enZone=Stories&amp; | title=On the trail of terrorists | publisher=[[JewsWeek]] | date=February 22, 2005 | first=Todd | last=Pittok | accessdate=2008-04-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018142401/http://www.jewsweek.com/bin/en.jsp?enDispWho=Article%5El1645&amp;enPage=BlankPage&amp;enDisplay=view&amp;enDispWhat=object&amp;enVersion=0&amp;enZone=Stories&amp; | archive-date=October 18, 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Darshan-Leitner (Shurat Hadin) sent warning letters to World Vision Australia and AusAID, after the two aid organisations had been accused of funding the Palestinian Union of Agricultural Workers Committee (UAWC) which Darshan-Leitner said was an instrumentality of the terrorist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). UAWC - World Vision activities were resumed in early March 2012 after an investigation by World Vision found no evidence that humanitarian support for UAWC was in any way leaking to terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/vision-back-as-ausaid-dismisses-terror-link/story-fn59nm2j-1226286658838 | title=Vision back as AusAID dismisses 'terror' link | date=March 2, 2012 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darshan-Leitner rejected the finding and demanded, under Australia's Freedom of Information Act that AUS Aid and World Vision turn over details of the investigation. She noted that USAID, the agency that administers foreign aid for the U.S. government, has labeled UAWC a PFLP affiliate, an allegation based on a 1993 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Narunsky|first=Gareth|title=Probe into charity’s alleged links with terrorist organisation|url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/probe-into-charitys-alleged-links-with-terrorist-organisation/25060|work=The Australian Jewish News|accessdate=18 February 2013|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darshan-Leitner also alleged that the President, Vice-President, Treasurer and other key members of the AUWC board are senior PFLP officials. On April 2, 2012, the Shurat HaDin Center was asked by the Australian Government to provide it with evidence of a connection between the AUWC and the PFLP.

In September 2006 Darshan-Leitner and [[New York City]] attorney [[Robert Tolchin]] filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the families of 12 missing Jewish-Iranians against the former Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]]. Khatami has refused to answer the complaint and has defaulted the case.

In January 2008 she filed a lawsuit for NIS 260,000,000 ($65,000,000 US) against the Egyptian Government in a court in [[Beersheba]] on behalf of ten families of Sderot (Israel) whose relatives were killed or seriously injured by  Palestinian Kassam rockets.

Thirty families who were victims of terrorist attacks either because they were injured or because they lost a family member in a wave of terrorist attacks that occurred in Israel between 2001 and 2003. The families sued Credit Lyonnais, a French bank, because the bank provided banking services and maintained accounts for CBSP, a primary fundraiser for Hamas (as designated by the US Treasury Department and by Israel in 1998). CBSP acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. The group has collected large amounts of money from mosques and Islamic centers, which it then transfers to sub-organizations of Hamas.

From 1997 onward, the bank allegedly knowingly transferred large sums to Hamas controlled organizations in the West Bank and Gaza. This activity occurred until 2003, when the bank finally closed the account following over three years of suspicious fund transfers.

In March 2008 the court denied defendant's motion, noting in particular that France maintains a particularly strong interest in eradicating terrorism, and the likelihood of criminal or civil challenges against the bank are rather slim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weinstein v. Islamic Republic of Iran|url=http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=335&amp;show=reports2#Weinstein_|work=Shurat HaDin Israeli Law Center|accessdate=18 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121135940/http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=335&amp;show=reports2#Weinstein_|archive-date=2013-01-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008 Shurat HaDin was co-counsel in filing in [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Manhattan Federal Court]] against [[Swiss]] mega bank [[UBS]] GA&lt;ref name="FoxNews2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008May13/0,4670,TerrorLawsuit,00.html | title=Swiss mega bank UBS GA Accused of Financing Terror | publisher=[[FoxNews]]|date=May 13, 2008| first=Fox| last=News | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is accused by the plaintiffs of financing terror. Included amongst the plaintiffs were  three families who were physically and emotionally harmed by the Katyusha rockets launched by Hizbollah into Israeli cities during the 2006 war with Lebanon.  Attorneys for UBS have denied the allegations and said they would vigorously defend the lawsuit.

The Federal District Court dismissed the complaint in August 2009 for lack of proximate cause between UBS’ fund transfers and Iranian support of terror organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. The court found that there was no causal link between UBS and the terror organizations supported by Iran. The court stated that a requirement under the Anti-terrorism Act is that UBS not only must have known about the causal link between its funds provided to Iran and Iranian support for terror organizations, but also must have intended that the funds were to be used for that purpose. Such intent was not proven by plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rothstein v.

In June 2008 the families of 12 missing Iranian Jews filed a petition in the Israeli High Court of Justice seeking to block the Israeli government from releasing information on the fate of four disappeared Iranian diplomats as part of the prisoner release deal with [[Hizbollah]].  The Iranian diplomats were captured by Christian militia forces, the [[Samir Jaja]] faction, in [[South Lebanon]] in 1982. The families are represented in the court proceeding before the High Court by Darshan-Leitner.

In July 2008 Darshan-Leiter received word from the Israeli High Court of Justice that the petition was being dismissed as the issue was one of "diplomatic concern." The court did however point a harsh finger at Israeli PM at the time, Mr. Ehud Olmert, with an expectation that the "matter not be pushed asunder." Darshan-Leinter then turned to the PM with a request by the families for an urgent meeting before the deal went through. Receiving no response, Darshan-Leiter then turned to all 120 members of the Israeli Parliament, The Knesset, asking that they remember the 12 Missing Jews of Iran in their speeches and activities throughout their term of service.

In July 2008 the Center joined with Montreal-based attorney [[Jeffrey Boro]] and Professor [[Ed Morgan (professor)|Ed Morgan]] of the [[University of Toronto]]'s [[International Law and Counter-Terrorism Project]] to file a civil action by Canadian victims of Hizbollah.  The lawsuit.&lt;ref name="CTA Global Media"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080707/terror_lawsuit_080707/20080707?hub=TopStories| title=Lawsuit targets bank over alleged Hezbollah ties| publisher=[[CTA Global Media]]| date=July 8, 2008| accessdate=2008-07-08| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708121336/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080707/terror_lawsuit_080707/20080707?hub=TopStories| archivedate=July 8, 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  contends that since 2004, the [[Lebanese-Canadian Bank]] (LCB), formerly the Lebanese branch of the [[Royal Bank of Canada]], permitted the Yousser Company for Finance and Investment and the Martyrs Foundation, two Lebanese organizations recognized by the United States as active terrorist groups, to open and maintain accounts at the bank. The suit alleges that LCB allowed the two groups to freely transfer many millions of dollars of Hizbollah funds and to carry out millions of dollars in financial transactions, within and without Lebanon, by means of wire transfers, letters of credit, checks and credit cards provided by LCB. LCB, the suit charged, facilitated Hizbollah's terrorist activities and is  liable to the plaintiffs for the harm that has been inflicted upon them and their families in the rockets attacks launched by Hizbollah on civilians in Northern Israel in the year 2006. Darshan-Leitner claimed in filing the suit that LCB knew that both charities are part of Hizbollah's financial arm and that by providing them banking services they were really assisting the Iranian backed terrorists in Lebanon and their rocket attacks against civilians.

On July 14, 2008 Darshan-Leiter and Attorney Robert Tolchin of New York filed a civil action on behalf of victims of the Hizbollah against an American Bank. The action was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan Representing 85 victims and their family members, the lawsuit&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-hezbollah-lawsuit,1,5474466.story| title=Survivors of 2006 Hezbollah attacks sue 2 banks for $650M in federal court in US| publisher=[[LA Times]] |date=July 14, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-15 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleges that the [[American Express]] (AMEX) Bank, Ltd. and the Lebanese-Canadian Bank (LCB) unlawfully executed millions of dollars in wire transfers for Hizbollah between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs assert that Hizbollah used the funds transferred by AMEX Bank and LCB to prepare and carry out the rocket attacks which the terrorist organization rained on Israeli cities between July 12 and August 14, 2006.

The plaintiffs rested their claims in part on written findings issued by the [[New York State Banking Department]] in 2007, which determined that AMEX Bank had failed to establish adequate procedures to prevent terrorism financing as demanded by state and federal law. This is the first lawsuit brought by terror victims against a U.S. financial institution that serves as a correspondent for a bank in Lebanon.  Darshan-Leitner told the Associated Press that "the idea of the lawsuit in part is to warn American correspondent banks that they will be held responsible for attacks by Hezbollah if they transfer money to them," Darshan-Leitner said. "We expect them to follow the law."

On August 21, 2008 over 100 victims of terrorist attacks carried out by the [[Hamas]] and [[Palestine Islamic Jihad]] ("PIJ") terror organizations in Israel filed a civil action in Los Angeles Superior Court against China's largest bank, the Bank of China Ltd. ("BOC"). The suit, [[Zahavi v. Bank of China]], seeks both compensatory and punitive damages.  The plaintiffs allege in their complaint that starting in 2003, BOC executed dozens of wire transfers for the Hamas and PIJ totaling several million dollars. In April 2005, Israeli counter-terrorism officers met with officials from the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and China's Central Bank regarding these Hamas and PIJ wire transfers. The Israelis demanded that the Chinese officials take action to prevent BOC from making any further such transfers. Despite the Israeli warnings, the BOC – with the Chinese government's approval – continued to wire terrorist funds for the Hamas and PIJ.  The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys [[Federico C. Sayre]] of [[Los Angeles]], Robert Tolchin of [[New York City]] and Darshan-Leitner.

In February 2011 Darshan-Leitner and David Schoen filed a $5m lawsuit against former US President [[Jimmy Carter]], alleging that his book [[Palestine: Peace not Apartheid]] "intentionally misleads and misrepresents about actual historic events", contrary to New York state law against deceptive business practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horn|first=Jordana|title=Jimmy Carter being sued for alleged falsehoods|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=206458|accessdate=24 May 2011|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, three months after the filing, the suit was dropped by the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Plaintiffs Drop Suit Over Jimmy Carter Book|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/plaintiffs-drop-suit-over-jimmy-carter-book/|newspaper=New York Times|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sokolow et al v. Palestine Liberation Organization et al]] - Darshan-Leitner was co-counsel in the civil proceedings against the [[PLO]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]], which found both organizations liable for the injuries and deaths of American citizens caused by six terror attacks in Israel between 2001 and 2004. Damages totaling $655.5 million were awarded by the jury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/nyregion/damages-awarded-in-terror-case-against-palestinian-groups.html?emc=edit_na_20150223&amp;nlid=31298867&amp;_r=0 Palestinian Groups Are Found Liable at Manhattan Terror Trial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public campaigns==

On May 1, 2008, Darshan-Leitner along with former Soviet [[Ida Nudel]] launched a public campaign to save the life of a Palestinian police officer accused of  having assisted the Israeli intelligence services in hunting down fugitive terrorists. The policeman, Imad Sa'ad&lt;ref name="Eli Lake"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/appeal-is-made-to-bush-to-save-arab-accused/75781/| title=Appeal Is Made to Bush To Save Arab Accused of Helping Israel| publisher=[[NY Daily Sun]] |date=May 5, 2008| first=Eli| last=Lake | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been sentenced to death by a Palestinian military tribunal in Hebron. Sa'ad, it is alleged, provided the Israel Defense Forces with the whereabouts of four suspected bomb makers whom the Palestinian Authority was unwilling to hand over to the Israelis.

Darshan-Leitner has argued that the [[Temple Mount]] is being harmed by work carried out by the Jerusalem [[Wakf]] and she organized a campaign to encourage the Israeli government to file charges against the Wakf. "The Temple Mount", one of the holiest sites in the Muslim world and home of the Al-Aqsa mosque, "is the property of Jewish nation and has been for thousands of years," claimed Darshan-Leitner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Aaron|title=Muslims Sued for Destroying Jewish Temple Artifacts|url=http://www.templeinstitute.org/archive/09-11-07.htm|work=The Temple Institute|accessdate=18 February 2013|date=9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darshan-Leitner took the case to court and lost. The High Court (BAGATZ), dismissed the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli High Court Blocks Prosecution of Islamic Waqf|url=http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=357&amp;show=photo&amp;pn=983&amp;ref=report|work=Shurat HaDin Israeli Law Center|accessdate=18 February 2013|date=4 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022032106/http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=357&amp;show=photo&amp;pn=983&amp;ref=report|archive-date=22 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheldon J. Plankton''' and '''Karen Plankton''' are fictional characters in the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. They are respectively voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and [[Jill Talley]]. Their first appearance was in the episode "Plankton!" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], the creator of the program, with additional character development by Lawrence.

Plankton is an intellectual [[plankton]]ic [[copepod]] who runs the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, who is a talking supercomputer. Plankton is the arch-rival of [[Mr. Krabs]], who owns the far more profitable [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the Krabby Patty. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.

Critical reception for Plankton and Karen has been positive, with praise directed toward their voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main [[antagonist]]s. The Planktons play central roles in the [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie|2004 theatrical film]], which promoted them both to main cast members in its credits, and the [[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water|2015 sequel]]. They have also been featured in a variety of spin-off media, including tie-in publications, playsets and other merchandise.

Plankton is the [[archenemy|nemesis]] and the former best friend of Mr. Krabs.&lt;ref name="Friend"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Friend or Foe|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=5|number=81|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=April 13, 2007|credits=Writers: Casey Alexander, Zeus Cervas, Mike Mitchell, [[Steven Banks]], [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He operates the Chum Bucket, located directly across the street from Krabs' restaurant, the [[Krusty Krab]].&lt;ref name="Komputer Overload"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Komputer Overload|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=6|number=118b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=March 19, 2009|credits=Writers: [[Aaron Springer]], Richard Pursel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chum Bucket primarily sells [[chumming|chum]] (bait consisting of fish parts), which is considered mostly inedible by the other characters. As a result, his restaurant is a commercial failure. Plankton's primary goal in the series is to put Krabs out of business and secure a [[monopoly]] on the fast food industry. His villainous efforts to do this are widely known within the show; fellow character [[Squidward Tentacles]] refers to Plankton as "the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom".&lt;ref name="F.U.N."&gt;{{cite episode|title=F.U.N.|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=10b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=September 18, 1999|credits=Writers: [[Sherm Cohen]], [[Aaron Springer]], Peter Burns|quote=How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?!}} "Get moving, genius, don't let him get away." "Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!"&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[running gag]] throughout the series is the fact that Plankton is smaller than the other regular characters; he is easily stepped on and sent flying back to the Chum Bucket with a mere flick of the finger.&lt;ref name="Truth or Square"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Truth or Square|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=6|number=123/124|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=November 6, 2009|credits=Writers: [[Luke Brookshier]], [[Nate Cash]], [[Steven Banks]], [[Paul Tibbitt]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His small size has led him to develop a [[Napoleon complex]], which is occasionally manifested as a desire for global domination.&lt;ref name="Absorbing"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT7VzFW0acE|title=The Absorbing Tale Behind "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie"|last=Lawrence|first=Doug|author-link=Mr. Lawrence|date=March 1, 2005|time=9:50–9:58|quote=Plankton's about this big, a little cyclops&amp;nbsp;... he's got a little bit of a Napoleon complex, I'd say.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a skillful inventor and regularly builds machines, both to help him in his plots, and for his own personal gain. Although he uses his intellect for evil, Plankton did not start out as a villainous scientist; he built Karen, his first invention, when he was friends with Mr. Krabs in grade school.&lt;ref name="Friend"/&gt; Prominent in his earliest appearances, Plankton's catchphrase is "I went to college!", uttered to illustrate the character's intelligence.&lt;ref name="Beck107"/&gt;

Plankton's roles are not exclusively antagonistic. In ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'', Plankton discards his enmity for SpongeBob and works with him towards a common goal. The movie has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "buddy film" between Plankton and SpongeBob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water-first-look-review|title=The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water first look review – superhero slugfest drags a good sequel down|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last=Hoffman|first=Jordan|date=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] considers Plankton "more of a caricature of a villain" than a truly evil character.&lt;ref name="Beck102"/&gt;

===Development===
When ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' premiered, Plankton was not part of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, [[Mr. Lawrence]], has stated that after producing Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: "We'll probably do another [Plankton episode] next year," &lt;ref name="Beck111"/&gt; Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he "was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character".&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138093814/|title=Meet the voice behind a 'SpongeBob' character|newspaper=[[Courier News]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|last=Bourbeau|first=Mary Ann|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg. From then on, Plankton began to appear more often. Lawrence considers the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 3)|third season]] the first in which Plankton is a main character.&lt;ref name="Beck111"/&gt;

During production on ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s early seasons, Lawrence was the only staff member writing premises and outlines involving Plankton. At the time, he felt he "had to prove Plankton could survive as more than a one-note character".&lt;ref name="Beck105"/&gt; Since then, multiple writers have written for Plankton without Lawrence's involvement, including the teams of writers responsible for Plankton's starring roles in both ''SpongeBob'' films. Lawrence continues to write Plankton episodes, having said in 2015, "I'm not just his voice. I get to create how the character is written and how he evolves over time."&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt;

Preliminary design sketches for Plankton depict him in a robotic suit, with Karen's system built into it; that suit does not appear in the series.&lt;ref name="BoytoBob"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=From Boy to Bob|magazine=[[Nickelodeon Magazine|Nick Mag Presents: SpongeBob SquarePants]]|publisher=[[Viacom International]]|date=June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit functioned as a way to increase Plankton's presence, as one of Hillenburg's original intentions was for the character to be too small to see without a magnifying glass.&lt;ref name="Lawrence2015"&gt;{{cite interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRuj3zHSwyE|title=Interview with Mr. Lawrence|last=Lawrence|first=Doug|subject-link=Mr. Lawrence|interviewer=Robert Dente|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series progressed, the animators enlarged Plankton's size, feeling that being microscopic was "not conducive to him interacting with other characters".&lt;ref name="Lawrence2015"/&gt;

===Voice===
[[File:Mr. Lawrence on Panel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mr. Lawrence]] (right) and [[Jill Talley]] (left), the voices of Plankton and Karen.]]
Plankton's voice is provided by American actor Doug Lawrence, normally credited as "Mr. Lawrence." The voice originated as an imitation of one of his deep-voiced high school friends.&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; On television, Lawrence first used this voice for incidental characters on ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]''. Fellow voice actor [[Tom Kenny]] found it amusing, leading to Lawrence's decision to use it when auditioning for roles on ''SpongeBob''.&lt;ref name="Beck105"/&gt; Lawrence initially tried out for the role of SpongeBob during the series' pre-production, but Stephen Hillenburg wanted a more innocent voice for the character and turned him down.&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; Lawrence continued to work on the show, voicing minor characters, eventually leading to him being offered the role of Plankton for the "Plankton!" episode.&lt;ref name="courier"/&gt; He describes Plankton's voice as a "combination of [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Tony the Tiger]]."&lt;ref name="Beck105"/&gt;

When the "Plankton!" episode was pitched to [[Nickelodeon]], Hillenburg had already decided that he wanted Lawrence to play Plankton. However, network executives wanted a guest star to provide his voice since he was set to appear in only one episode.&lt;ref name=MrLawrenceInt&gt;{{cite interview|last=Lawrence|first=Doug|subject-link=Mr. Lawrence|interviewer=[[Thomas F. Wilson]]|date=April 2012|title=Big Pop Fun #22: Mr. Lawrence|url=http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/8/0/b/80ba5601f7d09e93/BPF22_Mr._Lawrence.mp3?c_id=4442198&amp;expiration=1396087344&amp;hwt=77616525493ac25efba1ba04f5cd6efc|format=mp3|medium=Podcast|publisher=[[Nerdist Industries]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OQnV9e4n?url=http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/8/0/b/80ba5601f7d09e93/BPF22_Mr._Lawrence.mp3?c_id=4442198&amp;expiration=1396087344&amp;hwt=77616525493ac25efba1ba04f5cd6efc|archivedate=March 29, 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence mentioned in an interview with fellow ''SpongeBob'' actor [[Thomas F. Wilson]] that the studio said, in his words, "'we could [[stunt casting|stunt-cast]] this. You know, we could have [[Bruce Willis]] do this voice.' And Steve [Hillenburg] was just like, 'it's Doug, don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'"&lt;ref name=MrLawrenceInt/&gt;

===Reception===
The Plankton character has garnered a generally positive reception over the run of ''SpongeBob SquarePants''. In his review of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 4)|fourth season]], Paul Mavis of ''[[DVD Talk]]'' stated that adult viewers would likely find Plankton more amusing than others, praising his "hilariously stentorian" voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/25858/spongebob-squarepants-season-4-vol-2/|title=SpongeBob SquarePants - Season 4, Vol. 2 review|work=[[DVD Talk]]|last=Mavis|first=Paul|date=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the season six episode "[[Clash of Triton]]," Mavis called Plankton "the only secondary ''SpongeBob'' character who can [successfully] anchor his own short".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/44570/spongebob-squarepants-tritons-revenge/|title=SpongeBob SquarePants - Triton's Revenge review|work=[[DVD Talk]]|last=Mavis|first=Paul|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bettijane Levine of ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote positively of Plankton's portrayal calling it poignant rather than genuinely immoral, describing him as a "town meanie&amp;nbsp;... but mean is different than evil. There is no evil, not even a sense of menace, in SpongeBob's soggy, safe world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/apr/07/news/lv-spongebob7/2|title=Adults Find Their Inner Sponge|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc|Tronc, Inc.]]|date=April 7, 2002|last=Levine|first=Bettijane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hagman Cardinal of [[Blogcritics]] praised the character, rhetorically asking in a 2007 review, "who isn't tickled by the tight-jawed, [[Kirk Douglas]]-voiced Plankton with his silent moviesque evil plans to steal the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/spongebob-philosopherpants/|title=SpongeBob PhilosopherPants|publisher=Critical Lens Media|work=[[Blogcritics]]|date=October 30, 2007|last=Cardinal|first=Ann Hagman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402170251/http://blogcritics.org/spongebob-philosopherpants/|archivedate=April 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston.com]] writer Jamie Loftus had mixed feelings about Plankton in a 2015 article, asserting that while "almost every episode featuring tiny supervillain Plankton is highly formulaic," he never "gets old".&lt;ref name="bdcwire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdcwire.com/best-spongebob-episodes/|title=The Complete Guide to SpongeBob's Greatest Episodes|work=[[Boston.com|BDCWire]]|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|last=Loftus|first=Jamie|date=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Poniewozik]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine commented on Plankton in a 2001 article. He noted that "no one thinks it's strange that the town villain, the megalomaniacal Plankton, is a one-celled organism" as part of the "colorful, goofy" atmosphere of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187600,00.html|title=Soaking Up Attention|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=December 9, 2001|last=Poniewozik|first=James|author-link=James Poniewozik}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Zack Handlen stated that "the humor of Plankton comes from how his operative ambitions are constantly thwarted by a naïve, trusting kid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/spongebob-squarepants-built-its-undersea-empire-on-201164|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'' built its undersea empire on nonsense and enthusiasm|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The Onion|Onion, Inc.]]|date=February 17, 2014|last=Handlen|first=Zack}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Hillary Busis named Plankton one of the most devious characters on television, adding in her commentary that he is "voiced to wicked perfection by Doug Lawrence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/gallery/devious-schemers-tv-characters/plankton-spongebob/|title=TV's most devious schemers|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=March 1, 2015|last=Busis|first=Hillary}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{ill|José Antonio Gómez Marín|es|José Antonio Gómez Marín|vertical-align=sup}} of ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' favorably compared Plankton's plans to the stories of [[Georges Simenon]] in a 2013 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2013/11/13/5283704d684341532f8b4574.html|title=La cruz del sur: Bob Esponja|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|publisher=[[Unidad Editorial]]|date=November 13, 2013|author=José Antonio Gómez Marín|author-link=:es:José Antonio Gómez Marín|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2011 book ''[[Open Court Publishing Company#Popular Culture &amp; Philosophy series|SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy]]'', political scientist Joseph J. Foy argues that "Plankton may actually be the unsung hero of the series, and SpongeBob the true villain." He compares the character to the [[Übermensch|Nietzschean ''Übermensch'']], taking note of his mental superiority compared to the other characters in the show, and questions how Plankton is only "judged as bad because, no matter how many great things he accomplishes, his intentions are deemed ignoble". Foy concludes his analysis by criticizing the fact that "SpongeBob is praised as noble for trying to hold Plankton back."&lt;ref name="Foy73-80"/&gt;

==Karen==
===Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''===
Sheldon Plankton is married to a [[supercomputer]] named Karen Plankton, who is also his sidekick and best friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DIfzd7YnW_oC|title=SpongeBob Exposed!: The Insider's Guide to SpongeBob SquarePants|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|last=Banks|first=Steven|others=Schigiel, Gregg (illustrator)|date=September 21, 2004|page=15|isbn=978-0-689-86870-2|author-link=Steven Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen is Plankton's own invention, assembled from a calculator and a mass of wires.&lt;ref name="Komputer Overload" /&gt; She was Plankton's first invention when he was in grade school, and they dated before he became evil.&lt;ref name="Friend"/&gt; Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton can communicate while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus [[UNIVAC]] with 256 gigabytes of [[random-access memory]].&lt;ref name="singlecell"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Single Cell Anniversary|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=6|number=122b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=June 3, 2009|credits=Writers: [[Luke Brookshier]], [[Nate Cash]], [[Richard Pursel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen assumes various jobs at the Chum Bucket, including [[busser]], chef and cashier; she rarely has to fulfill them because of the restaurant's unpopularity. She also tends to stay more focused than Plankton on the core mission of stealing Krabs' formula. Karen often reminds him to stay on task&lt;ref name="F.U.N." /&gt; and encourages him to keep going when he loses confidence.&lt;ref name="Truth or Square" /&gt; Since she lacks a heart, Karen is usually unable to feel empathy for the people around her.&lt;ref name="Friend"/&gt; Her interactions are not limited to helping Plankton, however; she is a friend of [[Sandy Cheeks]], who is also intelligent and interested in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Salsa Imbecilicus|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=3|number=41a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=March 22, 2002|credits=Writers: [[Aaron Springer]], [[C.H. Greenblatt]], [[Merriwether Williams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen has a habit of addressing SpongeBob as "the SpongeBob."&lt;ref name="F.U.N."/&gt;

Karen is more competent than Plankton in formulating plots to steal the Krabby Patty recipe. Most of his effective plans have come from Karen, including "Plan Z"—the only scheme to result in Plankton successfully stealing the formula and using it to his advantage—in ''[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]''. Nonetheless, he tends to take credit for them, much to her dismay. Karen has effortlessly stolen Krabs' formula without Plankton's help on many occasions, but her husband always inadvertently gets in the way.&lt;ref name="singlecell"/&gt; Because of their contrasting behaviors, Plankton and Karen have a tendency to argue. Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, has called their marriage "''[[The Honeymooners|Honeymooners]]''-like," comparing them to the bickering couple from the sitcom ''The Honeymooners''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/spongebob-squarepants-tom-kennys-top-20/id321575301 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613220206/https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/spongebob-squarepants-tom-kennys-top-20/id321575301 |archivedate=June 13, 2017 |title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Tom Kenny's Top 20 |work=[[iTunes]] |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=May 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a computer on the ocean floor, Karen's ability to operate underwater has not been explained in any of the series' episodes. Tom Kenny addressed this in a 2004 interview with the [[Associated Press]], stating that Karen's functionality is a "don't-ask-why" aspect of ''SpongeBob'' and that "logic doesn't have a place" in the series' universe.&lt;ref name="today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/ten-secrets-spongebob-movie-wbna6494823|title=Ten secrets of the SpongeBob movie|author=Associated Press|author-link=Associated Press|publisher=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=November 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Karen was also created by Stephen Hillenburg, who named the character after his wife. Hillenburg initially designed a laboratory for Plankton to convey the character's technological abilities, leading to Karen's development as his lab's central computer system.&lt;ref name="BoytoBob"/&gt; Like Plankton, she was not initially intended to be a main character; her role in the series grew as Lawrence wrote ideas to give the Planktons more personality. Throughout the series' first and second seasons, Karen is not defined as Plankton's wife; Plankton's official biography from 2000 simply states that he works "with the help of his computer, Karen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/reader/0689840187|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'' Trivia Book|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|last=Fain|first=David|date=September 1, 2000|page=13|isbn=978-0-689-84018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series' third season opener, 2002's "[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 3)#ep41a|The Algae's Always Greener]]," Plankton refers to Karen as his wife for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Algae's Always Greener|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=3|number=41a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=March 22, 2002|credits=Writers: [[Aaron Springer]], [[C.H. Greenblatt]], [[Merriwether Williams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of their marriage, such as their anniversary and their honeymoon, have become the frequent focus of episodes since then.&lt;ref name="Beck110"/&gt; In early episodes, Karen is always supportive and friendly toward her husband. But, as the series progresses, she becomes more cynical and sarcastic because of Plankton's relentless obsession with the Krabby Patty formula.&lt;ref name="Foy67"/&gt; However, she remains loving and affectionate toward him.

Many episodes written by Lawrence develop and explore the relationship between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, "I want more Karen on the show&amp;nbsp;... The married life of an evil genius is the funniest thing to me, so in that regard [Karen] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than just your typical bad guy."&lt;ref name="nicknz" /&gt;

Most of Karen's appearances in the first four seasons depict her as a large, blue monitor in the Chum Bucket's laboratory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Plankton!|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=1|number=3b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=July 31, 1999|credits=Writers: Ennio Torresan, [[Erik Wiese]], [[Doug Lawrence]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at other times, only her voice is heard from within Plankton's robotic creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Imitation Krabs|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=2|number=24b|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=December 28, 2000|credits=Writers: [[Walt Dohrn]], [[Paul Tibbitt]], [[Doug Lawrence]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'', a mobile unit is introduced to allow Karen to interact more easily with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Stephen Hillenburg]]|type=Motion picture|title=[[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie]]|language=English|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]]|date=November 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showrunner [[Vincent Waller]] stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/VincentWaller72/status/866382329056555011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613213722/https://twitter.com/VincentWaller72/status/866382329056555011 |archivedate=June 13, 2017 |title=Vincent Waller on Twitter |author=Vincent Waller |author-link=Vincent Waller |date=May 21, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karen alternates between her multiple forms in most episodes produced after the film. As of the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 10)|tenth season]], her wall monitor is no longer used and her mobile form is always equipped with a pair of robotic arms.&lt;ref name="Plankton Retires"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Plankton Retires|series=SpongeBob SquarePants|season=10|number= 211a|network=Nickelodeon|airdate=March 25, 2017|credits=Writer: [[Mr. Lawrence]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice===
Karen is voiced by American actress [[Jill Talley]], who is also the wife of SpongeBob's voice actor, Tom Kenny. Talley uses a [[Midwestern American English|Midwestern accent]] for the character.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/spongebobsquarepants/tp/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Cast.htm|title='SpongeBob SquarePants' Cast: Who Does What Voice?|work=[[About.com]]|last=Basile|first=Nancy|date=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever Karen talks, her voice is mixed over electronic sound effects by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Lawrence, Doug|date=2002|title=F.U.N. backstage featurette, Nautical Nonsense|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her voice, which was more monotonous in earlier episodes, has been described as "deadpan" by the Associated Press.&lt;ref name="today" /&gt; Some of Karen's conversations with Plankton are improvised between Talley and Lawrence. The latter described this improvisation as one of his "favorite part[s] of the voice over" in 2009.&lt;ref name="nicknz"&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.nicknz.co.nz/SpongeBob/Backstage/Blog/ |title=Andy interviews Mr Lawrence aka "the Slasher" |last=Lawrence |first=Doug |subject-link=Mr. Lawrence |interviewer=Andy Goodman |work=[[Nickelodeon (New Zealand)|Nick NZ]] |date=2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611022322/http://www.nicknz.co.nz/SpongeBob/Backstage/Blog/ |archivedate=June 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, "I always enjoy the back-and-forth. [Talley and I] start to actually overlap so much talking to each other that [the voice directors] have to tell us, 'hey, stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'"&lt;ref name=MrLawrenceInt/&gt; Lawrence also feels that voicing the characters for so long has built a close relationship between the two actors. On the topic, he said, "This on-TV marriage we have, the whole world knows us being married&amp;nbsp;... We start becoming a married couple [when recording]."&lt;ref name=MrLawrenceInt/&gt;

===Reception===
Karen has received generally positive reactions from critics. In a 2010 review of ''[[SpongeBob's Last Stand]]'', DVD Talk's Paul Mavis wrote highly of Karen and Plankton's dialogue, stating that the two "could have their own sitcom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/41486/spongebobs-last-stand/|title=SpongeBob's Last Stand review|work=[[DVD Talk]]|last=Mavis|first=Paul|date=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandie Angulo Chen of [[Common Sense Media]] praised the amount of screen time given to Karen in ''Sponge Out of Water'', calling her "hilarious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/the-spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water|title=The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water Review|work=[[Common Sense Media]]|last=Chen|first=Sandie Angulo|date=February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Boston.com's Jamie Loftus cited Karen as her reason for naming 2002's "Welcome to the Chum Bucket" one of the sixteen greatest ''SpongeBob'' episodes.&lt;ref name="bdcwire" /&gt; [[Gizmodo]]'s Ryan Lufkin wrote in 2016 that ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s "90s-level weirdness" is proven by characters like Plankton and Karen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/02/90s-cartoons-were-weird-as-hell-and-i-loved-it/|title='90s Cartoons Were Freakin' Weird, and I Loved It|work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Univision Communications]]|last=Lufkin|first=Ryan|date=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[About.com|The About Group]]'s Nancy Basile commended Jill Talley's portrayal of the character, saying that it is "no surprise she plays [the role] so well" due to her earlier work with [[the Second City|Second City]] and ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David|Mr. Show]]''.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

In an analysis of how the show has changed throughout its run, [[Channel Frederator Network|Channel Frederator]] argued that the main characters of ''SpongeBob''–specifically Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Karen–have been reduced from multidimensional to reliant on single traits. According to this view, "Karen is now a full-blown nag" in newer episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oaGJ7cUqx4|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Then vs. Now|work=[[Channel Frederator Network]]|publisher=[[Frederator Networks, Inc.]]|date=March 20, 2017|last1=Polk|first1=Christina|last2=Tarzi|first2=Nahreen}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect of Karen's character has also been criticized by author Joseph J. Foy, in his book ''SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy''. He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the program, writing that "the motif of the nagging wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mr. Krabs#Pearl|Pearl]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the stupid best friend &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Patrick Star|Patrick]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;".&lt;ref name="Foy67"/&gt;

Lampooning a [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)#Criticism and controversy|controversy surrounding SpongeBob's sexuality]], essayist Dennis Hans wrote a 2005 satirical piece for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' focusing on the marriage of Plankton and Karen. He remarked, in jest, that SpongeBob's sexual orientation was a lesser issue compared to the positive representation of Plankton's "[[technosexuality]]". Hans identified instances where both Planktons were portrayed as a loving couple and joked: "the subliminal message from SpongeBob's insidious creators&amp;nbsp;... [is that] the technosexual lifestyle means bonding forever with your one true love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/021805/021805q.php|title=Plankton's insidious technosexual agenda|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|last=Hans|first=Dennis|date=February 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Renata Muratovna Litvinova''' ({{lang-ru|Рената Муратовна Литвинова}}; born 12 January 1967) is a [[Russia]]n actress, director, and screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LITVINOVA Renata (Actress)|url=http://persona.rin.ru/eng/view/f/0/19020/LITVINOVA-Renata|website=Celebrities|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Litvinova was born in Moscow to [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]] father Murat Aminovich Vergazov and an [[Russians|ethnic Russian]] mother, Alisa Mikhailovna Litvinova.&lt;ref name="rusact"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renata Litvinova|url=http://www.rusactors.ru/l/litvinova/index.shtml|website=Rusactors|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her parents were doctors by profession. They divorced when Renata was just one year old.
She attended [[VGIK]] in 1984 and graduated in 1989.&lt;ref name="Cosmopolitan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of the Stars - Renata Litvinova|url=http://www.cosmo.ru/stars/biography/renata-litvinova/#|website=Cosmopolitan|publisher=Cosmopolitan|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the same year as fellow screenwriters and directors Roman Kachanov and Arkady Vysotsky.&lt;ref name="rusact"/&gt; It is here where she worked on her first film as a screenwriter for the film ''The Much Loved rita. The Last Meeting with Her'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolobrotov|first1=Aleksei|title=Renata and Death|url=http://svpressa.ru/culture/article/63600/|website=The Free Press|publisher=The Free Press|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Screenwriter ===
She began her film career as a screenwriter, writing films from 1988 to 1998. None of her earlier projects such as ''Truck Drivers 2'' (1992) achieved any critical or commercial acclaim.&lt;ref name="rusact"/&gt;
She was discovered by fellow director Kira Muratova in 1994 after Muratova had come across Litvinova's thesis she had written for VGIK. 
Meeting one another at a local festival, Muratova changed her mind and instead wanted Litvinova to star in one of her films.&lt;ref name="rusact"/&gt;
Litvinova auditioned for the role of the female protagonist Violet but was deemed unsuitable. 
However, Muratova wanted her in the film and allowed her to write a role for herself. Litvinova wrote herself into the film as a nurse.&lt;ref name="rusact"/&gt;
She continued to write screenplays after her role, which included both ''Male Revelations'' (1995) and ''Principled and Compassionate View'' (1995). The latter film won the Jury prize at the "Window to Europe" Film festival and was showcased in a number of other festivals around the world such as Japan and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tokyo International Film Festival|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000655/1996|website=Internet Movie Database|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She collaborated with Muratova again in 1997 and 1998, writing two screenplays that Muratova directed. 
Letanova's screenplay ''Three Stories'' was turned into a film in 1997, she also played the role of Opha in it. Her story ''To Own and Belong'' was adapted into the critically acclaimed crime film ''Country of the Deaf'' in 1998.&lt;ref name="rusact"/&gt; In 2017 Renata made her full debut in theatre with her own piece called "The North Wind" in Moscow Art Theatre. She was the director and screenwriter, as well as she played the key role in "The North Wind".

=== Actress ===

In 2000, she gained popularity after transitioning from a screenwriter to an actress, playing the role of Albino Crow in the show ''The Border''&lt;ref name="Cosmopolitan"/&gt; She wrote screenplays for films sparingly after this role and starred in all of the films she wrote. Litvinova became acclaimed in the mid-2000s when she was nominated for her roles in ''Sky. Plane. Girl.''

She made her directorial debut in 2000 with the documentary ''There is No Death For Me''. The film focused on the experiences of Litvinova's favorite Soviet Era actresses and gave insight into her views on their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There Is No Death For Me|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/culture/2008/07/07/a_2776017.shtml|website=Newspaper.ru|publisher=Newspaper.ru|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with her screenwriting, she directed sparingly in between her acting roles, directing six films since 2000.  She directed her first feature film in 2004, ''[[Goddess: How I fell in Love|The Goddess]]'', which she also wrote and starred in.&lt;ref name="spsbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://renatalitvinova.ru/%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%84%d0%b8%d1%8f/|website=Renata Litvinova|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she directed her first short film, ''Rado''.&lt;ref name="spsbio"/&gt; Litvinova made her first foray into concert films in 2008 when she directed the film ''Green Theatre in Zemfira''. The film was created using footage from a concert of one of Litvinova's friends, musical artist Zemfira Ramazanova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lapteva |first1=Elena |title=Zemfira without bills |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/24038/97405/ |website=WebCite |accessdate=6 April 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679kuuVNc |archivedate=April 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won "music film of the year" from independent music award show "Steppenwolf".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Theatre in Zemfira named best musical film|url=http://korrespondent.net/showbiz/cinema/495432-zelenyj-teatr-v-zemfire-nazvan-luchshim-muzykalnym-filmom|website=Correspondant.net|publisher=Correspondent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two collaborated again in 2010 to create another Ramazanova concert film directed by Litvinova called ''Moscow. Crokus/Arrow''.&lt;ref name="spsbio"/&gt; Finally, Ramazanova served as the composer on Litvinova's second full-length feature film ''Rita's Last FairyTale'' (2012), which deals with "universal themes of love, hate and search for love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rita's Last Fairytale|url=http://oiff.com.ua/en/films-2012/1801.htm|website=Odessa International Film Festival|publisher=Odessa International Film Festival|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creators|url=http://ritaslastfairytale.ru/authors.html|website=Rita's Last Fairytale|publisher=Renata Litvinova|accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice Actress===
She lent her voice to the film ''$8.50'' (1999) to be used as a voiceover for the character Xenia who was played by Natalia Adreichenko. Her voice appeared in a number of other films in the 2000s including ''Frog's Paradise''
(2007) and ''Peregrine'' (2008).&lt;ref name="spsbio"/&gt;

'''Richard Gibson''' (1615-1690), known as "Dwarf Gibson", was a painter of [[portrait miniature]]s and a [[court dwarf]] in England during the reigns of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], and [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].

Both [[Andrew Marvell]] and [[Edmund Waller]] wrote poems addressed to him.

==Life==
His early life is undocumented, but he is said to have been a page in the service of a lady in Mortlake, who recognised his artistic talent. She supported him to study art under [[Francis Cleyn]], director of design at the [[Mortlake Tapestry Works]].&lt;ref name = "gro"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/richard-gibson Richard Gibson, Grove Dictionary of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1630s, Gibson was working for [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke]], who was the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. He is referred to as "little Dick, my lord Chamberlain's page" in notebooks recording a number of copies he made of existing paintings in royal and aristocratic collections. At the same time he was producing original portrait paintings for aristocratic clients. Herbert was his most important early patron, and may have introduced him to [[Peter Lely]], with whom Gibson would enjoy a close and productive relationship. Lely painted several portraits of Gibson.&lt;ref name = "gro"/&gt;

Gibson was appointed "Page of the Back Stairs" under Charles I. During the [[English Civil War]] Gibson stayed in London with Pembroke, and thus became associated with the Parliamentary faction. By the 1650s Gibson appears to have been closely linked to [[Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon]], grandson of the Earl of Pembroke.&lt;ref name = "burl"&gt;John Murdoch and V. J. Murrell, "The Monogramist DG: Dwarf Gibson and His Patrons", ''The Burlington Magazine'',  Vol. 123, No. 938, May, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; During Cromwell's regime he remained active as a painter at the Protector's court. However, Gibson's patrons in the 1650s are typically Royalists, but generally of the faction that had been supporters of parliament early in the war.&lt;ref name = "burl"/&gt;

His association with Cromwell did not affect his career under Charles II. Gibson was employed as drawing-master to [[Mary II of England|Princess Mary]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], the daughters of Charles' brother James (later King James II). He went with Mary to the Netherlands for her marriage to [[William III of England|William of Orange]] in 1677. He came back to England in 1688 when William and Mary became monarchs after the overthrow of James II.

==Family==
[[File:Van Dyck Mary Villiers.jpg|thumb|Gibson's wife Anne Shepherd, seen on the left serving [[Mary Stewart, Duchess of Richmond]] in a portrait by [[Anthony Van Dyck|Van Dyck]]]] Gibson married Anne Shepherd, who was known as the "queen's dwarf", as she was in the service of Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]]. The couple were both said to be 3&amp;nbsp;ft 10 inches tall. The wedding was held at court, and the bride was given away by King Charles I. The event was the occasion of a poem by [[Edmund Waller]], in which the pair are described as literally made for each other ("Design or chance make others wive, / But nature did this match contrive").

The couple had nine children, of whom three became successful painters. The best known of these was Gibson's daughter Susan, who also worked as a miniature painter, using her married name of [[Susan Penelope Rosse]].&lt;ref&gt;Saywell, David; Simon, Jacob, ''National Portrait Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue'', 2004, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; All the Gibson children were of typical size.

==Style==
[[File:Richard Gibson miniature.jpg|thumb|left|Miniature of an unknown gentleman in armour by Gibson]]The Grove Dictionary of Art states that "the miniatures assigned to Gibson are characterized by the thick pigment and parallel striations that give his work an impastoed quality".&lt;ref name = "gro"/&gt; His colours are typically soft and muted, anticipating the miniaturists of the 18th century. During the 1650s Gibson may have become so successful that he had to employ assistants, suggested by the existence of "Gibson-style but not Gibson-quality works" at this period. His children might have learned their skills this way.&lt;ref name = "burl"/&gt; He also seems to have been adopting a "brighter palette" at this time, to suit the tastes of the Restoration court.&lt;ref name = "burl"/&gt; W. Sanderson's book ''Graphice'' (1658) describes Gibson as one of the most eminent of modern "limners".

Art historians John Murdoch and V. J. Murrell say that the distinguishing feature of Gibson's style is the "diagonal striation in the flesh painting".

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even by the naked eye, the coloured strokes of the brush over the carnation ground can be seen to consist of long broad hatches, which have often the tendency, especially in the flat plane of the forehead and the shadowing of the throat below the chin line, to move in diagonal parallel groups of hatches, stroked downwards from right to left....[Gibson's paint] is "impasted" in the manner of oil painting and is quite different from the traditionally transparent and linear technique of the limners.&lt;ref name = "burl"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These techniques probably imply the influence of Lely. His adoption of a more "wide eyed" look in his Restoration-era works may also show the influence of Lely.&lt;ref name = "burl"/&gt;

===Marvell poem===
[[Andrew Marvell]], in his [[mock epic]] poem ''The Third Advice to a Painter'', addresses Gibson, joking on the fact that the artist who painted miniatures was himself of miniature stature. He refers to him as the "admiral" of his "navy small, of marshalled shells", whose small-scale works demonstrate by "drawing in little, how we do yet less". The poem becomes an extended satire on recent political and military events, especially the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. Marvell suggests that Gibson should paint miniaturised epic works about events, to represent the minuscule achievements of the real admirals and statesmen in the war. Lely could not paint the works because he is tainted by his own Dutch origin, but Gibson represents authentically tiny English aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Smith (ed), ''The Poems of Andrew Marvell'', Pearson Education, 2007, pp.244ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==DG monogram==
[[File:Richard Gibson with wife Anne.jpg|thumb|Engraving by A. Walker after Lely's portrait of Gibson and his wife Anne]]
It has been argued that a number of miniatures signed with the monogram "DG" are the work of Gibson, on the grounds that they are "stylistically inseparable" from his known work of a later period, which is usually signed "RG". The "DG" miniatures appear to date from the artist's early career when no examples of his work with his usual "RG" monogram are known. If this is so, it is possible that the artist proudly adopted the nickname "Dwarf Gibson" as his signature. Alternatively, it may have stood for "Dick Gibson", the version of his name by which he was known in his youth.&lt;ref name = "burl"/&gt;

The '''Rolls family''' were substantial landowners and benefactors in and around [[Monmouth]] in south east [[Wales]].  [[Charles Stewart Rolls]] was the co-founder of the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] company.  The ascent of the family to the aristocracy was through marriage.

The family's [[Coat of arms|arms]] were described in 1852 as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iWRHAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1143&amp;dq=%22john+rolls%22+1801&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wdGPT4z_BMSV8gO36KjDBA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22john%20rolls%22%201801&amp;f=false  Sir Bernard Burke, ''A genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the landed gentry of Great Britain &amp; Ireland for 1852'', Colburn and Company, 1852, p.1143].  Accessed 19 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==James James and his descendants==
James James of the parish of [[Llanvihangel-Ystern-Llewern]], [[Monmouthshire]], son of John James the Elder, purchased several farms and parcels of land in Llanvihangel-Ystern-Llewern and [[Llangattock-Vibon-Avel]] between 1639 and 1648.  He settled in London and acquired a valuable estate in along the area of [[Old Kent Road]] between the parishes of Bermondsey and Camberwell (both now part of Southwark) Surrey.&lt;ref name="Archive Wales"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=36&amp;coll_id=1190&amp;expand= | title=Gwent Record Office, Documents relating to the Rolls family, barons Llangattock, of The Hendre | work=Archives Wales | author= | date= | accessdate=22 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523024948/http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=36&amp;coll_id=1190&amp;expand= | archivedate=23 May 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his will published in 1677 he left his estate to his only surviving child, Sarah, who was the wife of Dr Elisha Coysh, a physician from London.&lt;ref name="Archive Wales"/&gt; Their daughter married William Allen, who also bought land in Monmouthshire.&lt;ref name="Archive Wales"/&gt; William Allen's daughter and heir married her cousin Thomas Coysh.&lt;ref name="Archive Wales"/&gt;

They were succeeded by their son Richard, who was succeeded by his sister [[Sarah Coysh]] (d. 1801), the eventual sole heir of the families of Coysh, Allen and James. Sarah married [[John Rolls]] (1735–1801) of the Grange, [[Bermondsey]], and of the Hendre, Monmouthshire, [[High Sheriff of Monmouthshire]] in 1794, bringing him much property both in Monmouthshire and London. John Rolls died the day after his wife.

==John Rolls and "The Hendre"==
{{Main|The Hendre}}
John was succeeded by his son [[John Rolls of The Hendre|John Rolls]] (1776–1837) who, with his wife Martha, built the finest country estate in Monmouthshire: The Hendre ({{lang-cy|Yr Hendre}}). It was a shooting lodge that was expanded throughout the next one hundred years.  It is Monmouthshire's only full-scale [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[country house]], constructed in the [[Victorian Gothic]] style.  It is located in the [[civil parish|parish]] of Llangattock-Vibon-Avel, some {{convert|4|mi}} north-west of the town of Monmouth. The first of three expansions by the Rolls family began with the architect [[George Vaughan Maddox]] who rebuilt parts of the south wing in 1830. John Rolls' successor, John Etherington Welch Rolls, continued the mansion's development, using [[Thomas Henry Wyatt]] as his architect.

John was succeeded by his son John Etherington Welch Rolls (4 May 1807 – 27 May 1870), [[High Sheriff of Monmouthshire|sheriff of Monmouthshire]]. In 1842 he married Elizabeth Mary Long, granddaughter of [[William Carnegie, 7th Earl of Northesk]]. He was succeeded by his son, also named John.

==John Allan Rolls==
{{Main|John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock}}
[[File:Monmouth Library First Baron Llangattock.jpg|thumb|[[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock]]]]
[[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|John Allan Rolls]] (19 February 1837 – 24 September 1912), sheriff in 1875 and MP for Monmouthshire, 1880–1885, created [[Baron Llangattock]] of the Hendre, 1892.

John Allan Rolls's ennoblement brought the family, and the house, to its social apogee, culminating in a visit from the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[George V of England|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), who stayed with Lord and [[Lady Llangattock]] at the Hendre in late October&amp;nbsp;– early November 1900. The Duke and Duchess were taken on motor car excursions by [[Charles Rolls]], probably the first time that the royal couple had been in a car. This was an important event in the family's social history, confirming their elevation to the upper echelons of society.

Of John Allan's three sons, the most famous was Charles, the co-founder of Rolls Royce.

Rolls' autocar with [[George V|HRH The Duke of York]], [[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|Lord Llangattock]] (Rolls' father), Sir Charles Cust and the Hon. C.S. Rolls as occupants", taken by John Howard Preston. [[Charles Stewart Rolls]] went on to co-found [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] in 1904. The photograph shows [[The Hendre]], the family's gothic mansion in [[Monmouthshire]].]]
[[Charles Stewart Rolls]] (27 August 1877 - 12 July 1910) was a motoring and aviation pioneer. Together with [[Henry Royce|Frederick Henry Royce]] he co-founded the Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in a flying accident, when the tail of his [[Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display near [[Bournemouth]], England. He was aged 32.
As well as his interests in cars and aeroplanes, Charles was a keen balloonist, the Flight Magazine of January 1909 recording a flight from Monmouth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ballooning Home''. On Saturday last the Hon. C. S. Rolls gave an exhibition of the possibilities of ballooning by taking his mother, Lady Llangattock, home by balloon. The ascent was made at Monmouth in the balloon " Mercury," the occupants of the basket being Lady Llangattock, Hon. C. S. Rolls, Hon. Mrs. Assheton&amp;nbsp;– Harbord, Mr. Claud Crompton, and Mr. Charles Freeman, and the balloon landed on the lawn in front of Lord Llangattock's house, The Hendre.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 1910, Charles Rolls was killed when his plane crashed during a flight display at Bournemouth, the first Englishman to be killed in a flying accident.

==John Maclean Rolls==
Lord Llangattock died in 1912.  His heir was his first son [[John Maclean Rolls, 2nd Baron Llangattock|John Maclean Rolls]] (1870–1916, dsp.), 2nd Baron Llangattock. He died at Boulogne in 1916 from wounds received at the [[Battle of the Somme]].  With his younger brother, Henry Alan, having died four months previously, and none of Lord Llangattock's three sons having had children, the direct male line ended. John Maclean Rolls was succeeded by his sister Eleanor Georgiana (d. 1961), wife of John Courtown Edward Shelley.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gwent Archives|Gwent County Records Office]]: Reference code(s): GB 0218 ROLLS D361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harding-Rolls==
With the death of Charles Rolls, Henry Allen Rolls and John Maclean Rolls and the extinction of the barony and surname in the male line, the estate passed back up the family through the closest member of the family with surviving descendants, Patricia Rolls, sister of John Allan Rolls. She had married John Taylor Harding of Pentwyn, vicar of Rockfield and Canon of Llandaff, son of John Harding of Henbury and Jane Morgan, and they had four children (John Reginald Harding, Charles Allan Harding, Francis Henry Harding and George Valentine Harding). John Reginald Harding in turn married Elizabeth Margaret Saunders (daughter of Captain John Saunders of [[Fuzhou]], China) and had five children. Upon the extinction of the Rolls branch, the estate came down to his son, John Charles Etherington Harding (born 1898, [[Xiamen]]), the first cousin once removed of the 2nd Baron Llangattock, who inherited the house, estate and surrounding farmland, changing his family name to Harding-Rolls for this purpose.

[[File:Hendre 1983.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Hendre]] in the summer of 1983]]
The Harding-Rolls branch of the family continued to live at The Hendre until 30 August 1984 when, following a failed [[time-share]] operation, it was sold to Effold Properties Limited. The mansion is now the focal point of the Rolls of Monmouth golf course.

'''Ronald Lynsdale Pereira''' (1923–1993) was the 9th [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of Naval Staff]]. He was the Chief of Naval Staff from 1979 to 1982. He belongs to the Pereira family of [[Kannur]], Kerala. Admiral Pereira held the appointments of Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet (FOCEF), Flag Officer Commanding of the [[Southern Naval Command]] and the Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the [[Western Naval Command]]. In 1971 he was awarded the [[Ati Vishisht Seva Medal]] (AVSM) and in 1977 was awarded the [[Param Vishisht Seva Medal|Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM)]]. He is a keen sportsman having represented the Indian Navy in [[Field hockey|Hockey]] in 1946 and in Golf in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/personnel/chiefs/138-rl-pereira.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born on 25 May 1923,at [[Kannur]], at the northern tip of [[Kerala]] about fifteen years before [[World War II|World War-II]], he grew up in rural India with simple and achievable ambitions, either to be a doctor like his father, or become a dentist. But somewhere during his teen years, the salt laden sea breeze in [[Kannur]] and the hype of [[World War II|World War-II]] instilled in him a wander lust, quest for adventure, a perception that soldiering was more interesting than doctoring.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salute.co.in/remembering-ronnie/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Navy career ==
Admiral Ronald Lynsdale Pereira was commissioned into the Royal Indian Navy on his 20th birthday (May 25, 1943), given command of a homemade, quickly fitted out, leaky wooden fishing trawler masquerading as a gun boat, with a dozen sailors as raw as Ronnie, and immediately sent to fight the might of the [[Japanese Navy]] in the [[Bay Of Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salute.co.in/remembering-ronnie/&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], he saw active service aboard gunboats in [[Burma]] and [[Malaysia]] between 1943–45 and thereafter, continued at sea with an amphibious task group based in [[Iraq]], till 1946.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/personnel/chiefs/138-rl-pereira.html&lt;/ref&gt;
After Independence in 1947, Admiral Pereira served for several years as a Gunnery Specialist, both afloat and ashore, before taking over as Officer-in-Charge of the Gunnery School, Cochin in 1956. A graduate of the [[Defence Services Staff College]], he has served as Deputy Commandant of the [[National Defence Academy]] in Pune and as the Director of Combat Policy &amp; Tactics at Naval HQ. He commanded the Indian Navy's Flag Ship, [[INS Delhi (C74)|INS Delhi]] and commanded an anti-submarine warfare frigate, INS Khutar. He is considered as one the architects of the modern Indian Navy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/personnel/chiefs/138-rl-pereira.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Ronald married Phyllis Pereira IN 1952, however the couple did not have any children, they came to love every young man they met in [[National Defence Academy|NDA]], especially the mavericks who were sent to him for displeasure. Ronnie addressed them as ‘Son’, a tradition that came to be in all services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salute.co.in/remembering-ronnie/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In due course, he retired. He simply went home to a house called ‘At last’ in Bangalore, drove around on a ‘[[Lambretta]]’ scooter from which he often fell off, broke most of his bones, caught cancer and died on Oct 14, 1993 at the age of 70&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salute.co.in/remembering-ronnie/&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the multitude of Admirals, Generals and Air Marshals, junior service officers in uniform crowding his funeral service, there was also a large gathering of ordinary sailors and civilian officials.

== Awards ==
In 1971 he was awarded the [[Ati Vishisht Seva Medal|Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM)]] and in 1977 was awarded the [[Param Vishisht Seva Medal|Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/personnel/chiefs/138-rl-pereira.html

Shen Tong moved from Massachusetts to New York in year 2000 focusing more exclusively on businesses with impact and purpose,&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodtank.com/news/2016/04/ten-questions-with-shen-tong-founder-and-managing-partner-of-food-future Ten Questions with Shen Tong, Founder and Managing Partner of Food Future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.specialtyfood.com/news/article/shen-tong-accelerating-change-q/ Shen Tong: Accelerating Change &amp;#91;Q&amp;A&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; and creative writing. He founded Food-X and FoodFutureCo in New York City working closely with [[Danielle Nierenberg]], [[Dan Barber]], [[Dorothy Cann Hamilton]], [[Michael Moss]], and [[Michel Nischan]].  His has several dozen publicly known commercial and impact investments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tong-shen#/entity CB Investment tracking]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the founder and president of the company [[VFinity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197000853 Information Week: High Five: Meet Shen Tong, President Of VFinity, Jan, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; which makes software tools and web applications for multimedia and multilingual search, media production, archiving, and media distribution. He is known for his promotion of "Context Media" partially due to his keynote speech at a super session of [[National Association of Broadcasters]] in Las Vegas, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pqhp.com/nab/nab07/ NAB Super Session Keynote Speech: Social Media in the 21st Century by Shen Tong (CEO, VFinity)]&lt;/ref&gt;  His media businesses in 1990s included TV production [[B&amp;B Media Production]], with the Boston-based foundation he chaired being the lead investor and providing senior management, and investment in bookstore and publishing in [[Beijing]]. B&amp;B Media Production had created and produced several highly circulated and acclaimed TV programs, including No.1 rated national weekend prime time show Tell It Like It Is&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1791340/ 14 years running talk show "Tell It Like It Is"  as No.1 rated show in China 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; during its first season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cctv.com/program/talkshow/index.shtml CCTV 实话实说节目]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and social activism==
In 2011, Shen voiced support for and participated in the [[Occupy Wall Street]] Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204358004577030701555317344 The Wall Street Journal profile]&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered a main proponent of non-violence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-battle-for-the-soul-of-occupy-wall-street-20120621 RollingStone June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; of social media movement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2012/occupy-movement No.7 in World Most Innovative 50 by Fast Company]&lt;/ref&gt; with nationally coordinated organization working with broad alliances,&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8664696 99% Solidarity national bus project, ABC News Chicago]&lt;/ref&gt; for strategic messaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcoexist.com/1678982/occupy-wall-streets-philosopher-in-residence-on-the-future-of-the-movement Fast Company Profile, Occupy Wall Street’s Philosopher-In-Residence]&lt;/ref&gt;

He co-chaired the committee on dialog with the government during the 1989 pro-democracy movement in China. He was on Changan Avenue when Chinese troops opened fire on the students. He had earlier obtained a Chinese passport to study biology at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]] in the United States, so even though he was wanted by the Chinese government he was able to board a plane six days after the massacre on June 4, 1989. He was able to walk undisguised through police and security officials in the Beijing airport, possibly indicating broader support for the student democracy movement than the Chinese government contended at the time. Some of the biographical works about Shen Tong are Tiananmen Exiles,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Tiananmen-Exiles-Struggle-Democracy-Palgrave/dp/1137438304/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me= Tiananmen Exiles, by Perry Link &amp; Rowena Xiaoqing He]&lt;/ref&gt; Standoff at Tiananmen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982320302 Standoff at Tiananmen by Eddie Cheng]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his arrival in the United States, Shen Tong held a press conference at the Walker Center for Ecumenical Exchange in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], giving the first detailed eye-witness account by a student leader of the Tiananmen Square massacre and of the events that led up to it.

During his studies in Massachusetts he founded the [[Democracy for China Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-07-21/news/9103210572_1_favored-nation-pressure-china-tiananmen-square-massacre Use Trade Policy To Pressure China July 21, 1991|By Shen Tong, Chairman, Democracy for China Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; to support democratic movements in China and to promote ideas of political freedom and human rights.  American NGO activist Marshall Strauss, and program coordinator Juanita Scheyett-Cheng, helped Shen Tong in founding and operating of the Fund.

The Congressional Human Rights Delegation to China in 1991 headed by Nancy Pelosi was organized by the Democracy for China Fund with the help and funding from Hong Kong Democrats. His 1992 trip back to China led to the arrest of him and his associates. He was released and immediately exiled after only two months of imprisonment under mounting international pressure especially from the US Congress, the Presidential Campaign of [[Bill Clinton]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]], and European governments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74054661.html?dids=74054661:74054661&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+11%2C+1992&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=74+Senators+Urge+China+to+Free+Activist%3B+Shen+Tong%2C+Others+Arrested+as+They+Tried+to+Open+Rights+Office&amp;pqatl=google 74 Senators Urge China to Free Activist; Shen Tong, Others Arrested as They Tried to Open Rights Office]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TKowRrrz5BIC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=%22Shen+Tong%22&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiarK27joDWAhVs8IMKHYwaABY4ChDoAQhXMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shen%20Tong%22&amp;f=false The New Chinese Empire: And What It Means For The United States, by Ross Terrill]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1993, days before the renewal of China's [[Most Favored Nation]] trading status by the US government, Shen Tong was scheduled to give a speech at the United Nations press club,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/26/world/un-chief-bars-chinese-dissident.html U.N.

'''Thomas A. McKean''' is an American [[autistic]] author and lecturer. He is a poet, a singer-songwriter, an international speaker and a writer. He is the author of ''Soon Will Come the Light: A View From Inside the Autism Puzzle'' and ''Light On the Horizon: A Deeper View From Inside the Autism Puzzle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Joanne|title=AUTHORS, ONE AUTISTIC, DISCUSS CONDITION, HOW TO RESPOND TO IT|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11854732.html|accessdate=9 March 2016|agency=Dayton Daily News|date=15 April 2002|ref=dayton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="soon"/&gt; McKean has claimed that he did not speak until he was 16, but was able to describe how autism was like to him. He constantly fights various symptoms such as making strange noises, and says that perception of the senses causes low-intensity pain. McKean at one time earned a living traveling about and doing conferences and consulting work on autism. He has been described as having the unusual ability to be in the world of autism, yet also possesses the communication skills to describe what that world is like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlstone|first1=Linda Mae|title=Autistic Writer Finds Voice, Delivers A Message Of Hope|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-07-28/news/9407280243_1_mckean-autistic-children-autism-society|accessdate=9 March 2016|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=28 July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boyett|first1=Frank|title=Autistic Author Offers Insight into Disorder Few People Understand|agency=The Gleaner|date=14 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fiely|first1=Dennis|title=Man Now Speaks For Those Who Suffer in Silence|agency=Columbus Dispatch|date=13 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pegram|first1=Cynthia|title=Speaker Puts Face on Autism|agency=Lynchburg News &amp; Advance|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnhart|first1=John|title=Man sees life in picasso-vision|agency=Bedford Bulletin|date=6 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
McKean claimed that he was never given a formal diagnosis growing up, so he was often punished, even though he knew there was something wrong with him. He spent the first half of his elementary school career in a regular classroom, then was in special-education classrooms until the sixth grade. He also claimed to be unpopular in school, and dreaded gym and recess. McKean then spent three years in a psychiatric institution starting at age 14. However, he was eventually elected to the board of the [[Autism Society of America]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asperger Syndrome or High-functioning Autism?|date=2013|publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-1461374503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He started his advocacy career after discovering that he was on the spectrum, through attending Autism Society of America chapter meetings and receiving attention for being able to talk about his own experiences as an autistic person.&lt;ref name="soon"/&gt;

Thomas McKean was a guest on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2001. On the show, he said that he was lonely as a child, had to learn emotions, and said that his sensitivity to certain sensations and colors was exaggerated.&lt;ref name="healthcentral"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ledgin|first1=Norm Ledgin ; foreword by Temple Grandin ; illustrations by Marsha M.|title=Asperger's and Self-Esteem : Insight and Hope through Famous Role Models|date=2002|publisher=Future Horizons|location=Arlington, Tex.|isbn=9781885477859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coleman|first1=Amy|title=The Producers|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/The-Producers|website=Oprah|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKean|first1=Thomas|title=Thomas on Oprah|url=http://thomasamckean.com/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=20|website=Thomas A. McKean|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKean was also featured in ''Esquire'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What it Feels like to have Autism|date=1 June 2001|url=http://archive.esquire.com/issue/20010601/#!&amp;pid=99|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In ''Soon Will Come the Light: A View From Inside the Autism Puzzle'', a winner of the Autism Society of America's Literary Achievement Award, he described the years that he faced confusion around his disorder. He also claimed to have talents in fields such as computers and technical design, in addition to his passion for writing.  This book was one of the first autobiographies to provide unique insight into the world of autism.&lt;ref name="soon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKean|first1=Thomas A.|title=Soon will come the light : a view from the autism puzzle.|date=1994|publisher=Future Horizone, Inc.|location=Arlington, Texas|isbn=978-1885477118|edition=[Rev.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janis M. Serak, a member of the Autism Society of America, Board of Directors, reviewed the book in ''The Advocate'', the [[Autism Society of America]]'s newsletter in 1994. Serak claimed that few books had been written by autistics, and that this book could be useful to parents of autistic children for its first-person portrayal of autism. Overall, he wrote that McKean had sought to understand himself better through writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serak|first1=Janis|title=Soon Will Come The Light|journal=The Advocate|date=May 1994|volume=26|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on Autism and Neurodiversity==
McKean has stated that some people who claim to have autism on the internet portray a very distorted and unrealistic view of what autism really is. These people say autism is the best thing ever and some of them even say it places above the general population and makes them better or superior in some way. He has described the politics of autism as a distraction from the therapies and support needed to treat those who have it.&lt;ref name="healthcentral"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kalning|first1=Diane|title=My Interview with Thomas McKean, author and advocate for those on the Autism Spectrum|url=http://www.healthcentral.com/adhd/c/849319/69238/interview-advocate/|website=HealthCentral|publisher=Remedy Health Media, LLC|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2006 essay "A Danger in Speaking" that McKean questions autistic speakers that have been self-diagnosed. Critics say that this ignores the obstacles and stigma that some autistics face in getting diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeregau|first1=Melanie|title=Circle Wars: Reshaping the Typical Autism Essay|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2010|volume=30|issue=1|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/1063/1222|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timothy Archambault''' (also known as '''Tim Archambault'''; born [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]], February 9, 1971) is an American [[Native American flute|Native American flutist]], architect, and [[composer]].

==Background==
Archambault is a member of the [[Kichesipirini]] [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] [[First Nations|First Nation]]. He graduated with two degrees (bachelor of architecture and bachelor of fine arts) from the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], taking courses in [[music theory]] at [[Brown University]] during this time. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Musical career==
Archambault began playing the Native American flute in 1989 and has devoted intensive study to the earliest recordings of the instrument, dating back to the early 20th century. He has also studied informally with the Native American flutists [[Kevin Locke (musician)|Kevin Locke]] ([[Lakota people|Lakota]]) and [[Edmund Wayne Nevaquaya]]&lt;!--Or is it Edmond?--&gt; ([[Comanche]]), and has collected songs of his Kichesipirini heritage, from elders in Canada as well as from archival [[wax cylinder]] recordings made in the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

In addition to performing in traditional styles, since the early 21st century he has achieved notoriety for being one of the few Native American flutists to perform [[contemporary classical music]] on the instrument. He is able to play complex [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] music on the Native American flute, and is the first enrolled member of a North American indigenous nation to master this style. He has performed the music of Native American composers David Yeagley, [[George Quincy]], and [[Raven Chacon]]. His recording of Yeagley's ''Wessi vah-peh'', for Native American flute and orchestra, performed with the [[National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra Katowice]], will be released by [[Opus One Records]] in late 2008. He was the first person to use the old [[Native American flute#The Warble|warble]] technique (in which a single flute tone "splits" into a [[multiphonic]] oscillation) within the context of contemporary classical music.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

Archambault is planning to record, in late 2008, a solo album of compositions by David Yeagley entitled ''Suite Tragique'' which is dedicated to the Kichesipirini Algonquin First Nation, as well as a collaborative composition utilizing traditional [[Anishinaabe]]g [[musical notation]] with the Navajo composer Raven Chacon. He recorded an orchestral work entitled ''The Choctaw Diaries'' by the Choctaw composer George Quincy, which was released by Lyrichord Classical on June 17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pocahontas At the Court of King James the I and Choctaw Diaries|url = http://lyrichord.com/pocahontasatthecourtofkingjames1andthechoctawdiaries.aspx|website = Lyrichord Discs Inc|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he joined an all-Native American orchestra called The Coast Orchestra.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

As a composer, in the spring of 2007 he composed a work for solo cello for the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] cellist, as a part of her North American Indian Cello Project; this work will be released on CD in late 2008.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

Archambault is a member of the [[First Nations Composer Initiative]] and performed at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in November 2006. In August 2007, he recorded traditional Kichesipirini flute songs for the National Museum of the American Indian archives, and in 2008 he was one of the First Nations Composer Initiative judge panelists who awarded several grants to American Indian&lt;!--Only U.S. musicians or also Canadian ones?--&gt; musicians.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

==Architectural career==
Archambault lives in [[Beijing]], [[China]], where he is a project manager at the Beijing office of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture; he is currently designing a large-scale architectural project in Southeast Asia. Before taking this position he worked as a Project Architect in [[Rotterdam]] and [[New York City]], working on the designs for the [[Prada]] [[SoHo|Soho]] Store, the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]] (commissioned in 2001 and completed in 2002), and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre at the [[Dallas Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] (commissioned in 2004 and scheduled to be completed in 2008). Prior to joining OMA in 1999, and helping to establish its New York office, he worked for Pasanella+Klein Stolzman+Berg Architects in New York on the Pratt Stabile Hall Dormitory, and for Frank O. Gehry and Associates in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] on the [[Samsung Museum of Contemporary Art]] and the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Personal life==
Archambault is a hereditary senator of the Kichesipirini Algonquin First Nation, and is active in tribal issues, keeping close ties with the nation, which is based in [[Pembroke, Ontario]]. He is married to fine-art photographer [[CYJO]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

'''Tjyongoui Yi''' (1884–1924(?)), also known as '''Yi Wi-jong''', was a [[Korea]]n [[diplomat]] and military officer. His name in Russian is '''Vladimir Sergeyevich Li''' ({{lang|ru|Владимир Сергеевич Ли}}). His father [[Yi Beom-Jin]] was a politician. Yi Wi-Jong took part in [[World War I]] as a 2nd lieutenant(''Podporuchik'') of [[Imperial Russian Army]] and served on [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Post-WWI, Yi joined the [[Bolshevik]]s and fought in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].

== Life ==
Yi was born in 1884. In 1907 he, [[Yi Tjoune]], and [[Sangsul Yi]] were delegated by [[Emperor Gojong]] to attend the [[Second Hague Peace Conference]] at [[The Hague]]. At that time, he was proficient in seven languages. However, they were barred from joining the conference due to the Imperial Japan's objections as the supreme Asian power of the time. However, with the assistance of the Journalists Association, Yi was able to present speech in English to 150 journalists at The Hague concerning Japan's invasions of Korea and its void legality. Tjyongoui Yi buried [[Yi Tjoune]] at [[The Hague]] and went to the [[United States]] with [[Sangsul Yi]], and from there to [[Vladivostok]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

In 1911, after his father killed himself, he became a military officer of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and participated in [[World War I]]. After the outbreak of the [[October Revolution]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Yi joined the [[Bolshevik]]s and fought in the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. In the process, he cut off all communication with his erstwhile aristocratic wife and his family members. He fought in battle around [[Irkutsk]] against [[Alexander Kolchak]]'s [[White Army]]. After the war, he served as an [[apparatchik]] in [[Krasnoyarsk]] and [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] until 1924. Not much is known of Yi's life after 1924.

== Family ==
His father [[Yi Beom-Jin]] was a Korean politician and diplomat. He married a [[Russia]]n noble, Elizabeta Noelke (1888-1942), in 1906. The couple had three daughters; Vera (1906-1920), Nyna (1909-1940), Zena (1912- ?). Their descendants still live in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hong |first1=Sungkyun |title=네 조부는 한국 귀족 (My grandfather were a Korean aristocrat) |url=http://newslibrary.naver.com/viewer/view.nhn?editNo=15&amp;printCount=&amp;publishDate=1991-12-23&amp;officeId=00032&amp;pageNo=3&amp;printNo=14267&amp;publishType=00010&amp;articleId=&amp;serviceStartYear=1920&amp;serviceEndYear=1999 |website=Naver News Library |publisher=Kyunghyang Shinmun |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomás Echenique Mascardo''' (born '''Tomás Mascardo y Echenique''') (October 9, 1871 – July 7, 1932) was a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] general during the [[Philippine Revolution]] and [[Philippine-American War]].  He joined the fight against the [[Spain|Spaniards]] since the start of the revolution.  He later became a one-term governor of [[Cavite]] from 1910 to 1912.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Tomás Mascardo was born in the town of Cavite del Viejo (now [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]], [[Cavite]] province) to Valentín Mascardo and Dolores Echenique. The affluent couple, a landowner and a rice dealer, respectively, had a total of seven children.  Tomás finished his teacher's diploma from Escuela Normal in [[Manila]] and became a teacher at the [[Barangay|barrio]] school of Halang in [[Amadeo, Cavite]].&lt;ref name=webcite&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/kabitenyo1/kabite5e.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:08:43 "Tomas Mascardo (1871–1932)"]. Webcitation. Retrieved on 2013-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philippine revolution ===

Mascardo joined the revolution against the Spaniards from the beginning.  He became the chief of the revolutionary intelligence service in Manila, succeeding [[Miguel Liedo]] who was captured and sentenced to death by the Spaniards.  He was ordered by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] to attack a Spanish stronghold in [[Tanauan City|Tanauan]], [[Batangas]], where the general was awed by Mascardo’s courage.  In time, he was promoted to [[brigadier general]].  Mascardo, together with his commander, General [[Edilberto Evangelista]], fought at the [[Battle of Zapote Bridge (1897)|Battle of Zapote Bridge]] on February 17, 1897 where Evangelista was killed and Mascardo wounded.&lt;ref name=webcite/&gt;

===Philippine-American War===

During the [[Philippine-American War]], Mascardo was assigned as commanding general of the revolutionary forces in [[Pampanga]], [[Bataan]], and [[Zambales]] provinces with barracks in [[Bagac, Bataan]].  Following Aguinaldo's capture by the [[United States|Americans]] on March 23, 1901 in [[Palanan, Isabela]], he ordered his subordinate, Major [[Manuel L. Quezon]], to surrender as well so he can verify the capture and if so, consult Aguinaldo for final orders as there was also an order for Mascardo to surrender.  Quezon was able to meet Aguinaldo in a room at the [[Malacañang Palace]] where he was detained.  After relaying Mascardo’s message, Aguinaldo instructed Quezon that the decision to surrender is up to Mascardo himself.  On May 15, 1901, he surrendered to the Americans. He calculated that their deficiency in weaponry would mean sure defeat from the well-armed Americans.&lt;ref name=webcite/&gt;

===Political career and death===

Mascardo returned to Cavite following his release by the Americans.  He was influenced to enter politics, and won the gubernatorial seat of Cavite, a post he held from 1910 to 1912.   He retired and lived a private life after only one term. On July 7, 1932, he died from a heart disease.&lt;ref name=webcite/&gt;

==Personal life==
Tomás Mascardo was married to Carmen Topacio of [[Imus, Cavite]].  The couple had eight children –  Modesto, Dominador (who became a general), Petra, Pura, Jaime, Tomás, Salvador (a former collector of customs at the Manila International Airport), and Emiliano.&lt;ref name=webcite/&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=October 2012}}

'''Uno Åhrén''' (6 August 1897 [[Stockholm]] – 8 October 1977 [[Arvika]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nationalencyklopedin]] , [http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/lång/uno-åhren]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Swedish architect and city planner, and a leading proponent of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] in [[Sweden]].  

In 1930 Åhrén was one of the designers for the Housing Exhibition of the [[Stockholm International Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm International Exhibition]], and in 1931 he was one of the six co-authors of the ''Acceptera!'', or ''Accept!'', manifesto, a plea for acceptance of functionalism, standardization, and mass production as a cultural change in Sweden. 

[[Image:Ford Motor Comp.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Ford Motor Company Building, 1930]]

Åhrén collaborated with the sociologist, reformer and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] winner [[Gunnar Myrdal]] from 1932 though 1935 on a social housing commission, and in 1934 they co-authored ''The Housing Question as a Social Planning Problem'', a work that would prove influential in the structuring of the Social Democratic Swedish society, the [[Folkhemmet]].  In fact Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]], who coined the word Folkhemmet, himself moved into an Åhrén-designed functionalist house in 1936.  

From 1947 through 1963 he served as Professor of City Planning for the Technical University at Stockholm.

A few minor references to Uther appear in [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]] [[Medieval Welsh literature|poems]], but his biography was first written down by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), and Geoffrey's account of the character was used in most later versions. He is a fairly ambiguous individual throughout the literature, but is described as a strong king and a defender of the people.

According to [[Arthurian Legend]], [[Merlin]] magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy [[Gorlois]], enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady [[Igraine]]. Thus Arthur, "the once and future king", is an illegitimate child (though later legend, as found in Malory, emphasizes that the conception occurred after Gorlois's death and that he was legitimated by Uther's subsequent marriage to Igraine&lt;ref&gt;http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/MaloryWks2/1:3.6?rgn=div2;view=fulltext&lt;/ref&gt;). This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. The theme of [[illegitimacy|illegitimate conception]] is repeated in Arthur's siring of [[Mordred]] by his own half-sister [[Morgause]] in the later prose romances; it is Mordred who mortally wounds [[King Arthur]] in the [[Battle of Camlann]].

==Epithet==
Uther's epithet ''Pendragon'' (composed of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen'', "head, chief, top" and ''dragon'', "dragon; warrior"; borrowed from the Latin word ''dracō'', plural ''dracōnēs'', "dragon[s]") literally means "Chief-Dragon" or "Head-Dragon", but in a figurative sense, "chief leader", "chief of warriors", "commander-in-chief", "generalissimo", or "chief governor".&lt;ref&gt;Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, University of Wales Press, Vol III, 1994, p. 2726-2739, "pen", "pendragon"; Vol I, 1963 p. 1081, "dragon".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromwich512"&gt;Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 512–513.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was misinterpreted by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] in  ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' to mean "dragon's head".&lt;ref name="Bromwich512"/&gt; According to Geoffrey and works based on his version, Uther acquired the epithet when he witnessed a portentous [[dragon]]-shaped comet, which inspired him to use dragons on his [[flag|standards]]. According to [[Robert de Boron]]&lt;ref&gt;de Boron, Robert. ''Merlin and the Grail''. Tr. Nigel Bryant. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and the cycles based on his work, it was Uther's older brother (elsewhere called [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]]) who saw the comet and received the name "Pendragon", Uther taking his epithet after his death.

==Early Welsh poetry==
Though the Welsh tradition of the Arthurian legend is fragmentary, some material exists through the [[Welsh Triads]] and various poems. Uther appears in these fragments, where he is associated with Arthur and, in some cases, even appears as his father.

He is mentioned in the circa-10th-century Arthurian poem "[[Pa gur|Pa gur yv y porthaur?]]" ("What man is the gatekeeper?"), where it is only said of him that [[Mabon ap Modron|Mabon son of Modron]] is his servant. He is also memorialized with "The Death-song of Uther Pen" from the ''[[Book of Taliesin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/t48.html "The death-song of Uther Pendragon"]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter includes a reference to Arthur, so the marginal addition of "dragon" to Uther's name is probably justified. "The Colloquy of Arthur and the Eagle," a poem contemporary with but independent of Geoffrey, mentions another son of Uther named Madoc, the father of Arthur's nephew [[Eliwlod]].&lt;ref name="Bromwich512"/&gt;

In Triad 28, Uthyr is named the creator of one of the Three Great Enchantments of the Island of Britain, which he taught to the wizard [[Menw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/triads1.html The Hergest Triads]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Menw is a shapeshifter according to ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', it might be that Uther was one as well. If this is so, it opens up the possibility that Geoffrey of Monmouth's narrative about Uther impregnating Igerna with [[Merlin]]'s help (see below) was taken from a Welsh legend where Uthyr changed his own shape, Merlin possibly being added to the story by Geoffrey.&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Uthyr's other reference, Triad 51, however, shows influence from Geoffrey's ''Historia''. It follows Geoffrey's description of Uther as son of [[Constantine III (usurper)#Legend|Constantine III]], now called "Custennin the Blessed", and brother of both [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] ("Emrys Wledig") and [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans II]] ("Custennin the Younger").&lt;ref&gt;Bromwich, ''Trioedd Ynys Prydein'', pp. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Historia Regum Britanniae''==
[[File:History of the Kings (f.72) Uthr Bendragon.jpg|thumb|left|Uther Pendragon in a crude illustration from a 15th-century Welsh version of ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'']]
Uther is best known from Geoffrey's ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' (1136) where he is the youngest son of King of Britannia, Constantine III. His eldest brother Constans succeeds to the throne on their father's death, but is murdered at the instigation of his adviser [[Vortigern]], who seizes the throne. Uther and his other brother, [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]], still children, flee to [[Brittany]]. Vortigern makes an alliance with the [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxons]] under [[Hengest|Hengist]], but it goes disastrously wrong. Aurelius and Uther return, now adults. Aurelius burns Vortigern in his castle and becomes king.

With Aurelius on the throne, Uther leads his brother in arms to [[Celtic Ireland|Ireland]] to help [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] bring the stones of [[Stonehenge]] from there to Britain. Later, while Aurelius is ill, Uther leads his army against Vortigern's son Paschent and his Saxon allies. On the way to the battle, he sees a comet in the shape of a dragon, which Merlin interprets as presaging Aurelius's death and Uther's glorious future. Uther wins the battle and takes the epithet "Pendragon", and returns to find that Aurelius has been poisoned by an assassin. He becomes king and orders the construction of two gold dragons, one of which he uses as his standard. 

He secures Britain's frontiers and quells Saxon uprisings with the aids of his retainers, one of whom is [[Gorlois]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]. At a banquet celebrating their victories, Uther becomes obsessively enamoured of Gorlois' wife Igerna (Igraine), and a war ensues between Uther and his vassal. Gorlois sends Igerna to the impregnable castle of [[Tintagel]] for protection while he himself is besieged by Uther in another town. Uther consults with Merlin who uses his magic to transform the king into the likeness of Gorlois and thus gain access to Igerna at Tintagel. He spends the night with her and they conceive Arthur, but the next morning it is discovered that Gorlois had been killed. Uther marries Igerna and they have a daughter called Anna (in later romances she is called [[Morgause]] and is usually Igerna's daughter by her previous marriage). Morgause later marries [[King Lot]] and becomes the mother of [[Gawain]] and [[Mordred]].

Uther later falls ill and the wars begin to go badly against the Saxons. He insists on leading his army himself, propped up on his horse. He defeats Hengist's son [[Octa of Kent|Octa]] at [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]), despite the Saxons calling him the "Half-Dead King". However, the Saxons soon contrive his death by poisoning a spring which he drinks from near Verulamium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], ''Historia Regum Britanniae'' [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 6#5|6.5-9]], [[Wikisource:History of the Kings of Britain/Book 8#1|8.1-24]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Uther's family is based on some historical figures; Constantine on the historical Constantine III, a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] claimant to the Roman throne from 407–411, and Constans on his son. Aurelius Ambrosius is Ambrosius Aurelianus, mentioned by [[Gildas]], though his connection to Constantine and Constans is unrecorded.

==Other medieval literature==
In [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''[[Merlin (poem)|Merlin]]'' Uther Pendragon kills Hengist after an assassination attempt by the Saxon leader and Merlin creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] for him. In the ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' Uther Pendragon claims to have been born in [[Bourges]]. He takes an army to [[Brittany]] to fight against King [[Claudas]] of Bourges, a situation resembling that of the historical ruler [[Riothamus]] who went to Brittany to fight ravagers based in Bourges.

There is an alternative account of Uther Pendragon's background in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s ''[[Parzival]]''. A certain Mazadân went with a fairy named Terdelaschoye to the land of Feimurgân. (This looks like a garbling of some source that told of Mazadân's alliance with the [[Morgan the Fay|Fay Morgan]] in Terre de la Joye; the "Land of Joy".) Mazadân becomes father of two sons, Lazaliez and Brickus. Brickus becomes father of Utepandragûn, father of Arthur, while the elder son, Lazaliez, becomes father of Gandin of [[Anjou]], father of Gahmuret, father of Parzival ([[Percival]]). Uther Pendragon and Arthur here appear as the scions of the junior branch of an unattested House of [[Anjou]].

Uther also appears in the [[chivalric romance]] ''[[Sir Cleges]]'' as the king to whom Sir Cleges brings the Christmas cherries, obtained by miracle.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England''. New York Burt Franklin, 1963. p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern works==
[[File:Pelleas and Igraine.jpg|thumb|Uther, on horseback and disguised as Pelleas, watches [[Igraine]] picking flowers in ''Uther and Igraine'' by [[Warwick Deeping]], illustrated by [[Wladyslaw T. Benda]]]]

Uther Pendragon remains a widely used character in modern [[List of books about King Arthur|Arthurian literature]] and other fiction. 

*In [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', Uther the Conqueror is the Norman King of England.
*[[Mary Stewart (novelist)|Mary Stewart]]'s first two books in her Arthurian saga, ''[[The Crystal Cave]]'' and ''[[The Hollow Hills]]'', feature Uther Pendragon as [[Merlin]]'s uncle, Merlin being his brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Ambrosius]]' illegitimate son. Uther is depicted as a mostly decent but rather oversexed character, who becomes impotent in later life because of a groin injury, a [[Fisher King]] figure. 
*In [[Bernard Cornwell]]'s ''[[The Warlord Chronicles]]'', Uther is the King of [[Dumnonia]] as well as the High King of Britain ruling from [[Dumnonia]]. In these novels, Arthur is his illegitimate son and Morgan is his illegitimate daughter. Cornwell's Uther is highly skeptical of Christianity.
*In [[Jack Whyte]]'s ''[[The Camulod Chronicles]]'', Uther is King of the Pendragon, the Celtic people of South Cambria, cousin to Caius Merlyn Britannicus and Ambrose Ambrosianus Britannicus. Whyte's novel "Uther", written in 2000, revolves around a fictionalized version of Uther's life.
*In contrast to traditional versions, [[Stephen R. Lawhead]]'s ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' makes Uther's brother [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]], whose widow ([[Igraine|Ygerna]]) he marries, Arthur's true father.
*In [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'', Uther is the nephew of [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelianus]] instead of his brother; while Aurelianus is the son of a [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]], Uther has no Roman blood. 
*In [[Valerio Massimo Manfredi]]'s ''[[The Last Legion]]'', Uther is himself the last Roman Emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]]. While the real Romulus Augustus disappeared from history after being deposed by [[Goths]], in the novel he escapes to Britain, where he adopts the name Pendragon and eventually sires Arthur.
*In D. J. MacHale's ''Pendragon'' series, the main character, Bobby Pendragon, is the reincarnation of either Uther or his son Arthur.
*In [[John Boorman]]'s film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', [[Gabriel Byrne]] plays an ambitious but somewhat obtuse Uther Pendragon, whose uncontrollable lust for Igrayne, while necessary for the birth of Arthur, proves also his own undoing.
*In the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Merlin (TV series)|Merlin]]'', Uther, played by [[Anthony Head]], has banned magic in Camelot and slaughtered any who openly practise the art. It is revealed his wife Ygraine was unable to conceive, so [[Nimueh]], a sorceress and friend, helped in the conception of Arthur. However, to keep balance in the world, a life had to be taken in exchange. Thus, Ygraine died at Arthur's birth, and Uther's guilt spurred him to purge all magic from Camelot. His wanton cruelty eventually causes his ward [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]], who possesses magic herself, to turn against him. She is later revealed as his illegitimate daughter, and covets control of Camelot from then on. In series 4, Uther is wounded during an assassination attempt on Arthur. Merlin tries to heal him but due to Morgana's meddling, the spell instead kills him.
*In the television series ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' Uther is poisoned by Morgana in the first episode. Here she is his daughter, but was sent to the convent after he married Igraine.

*In [[Guy Ritchie]]'s 2017 film ''[[King Arthur: Legend of the Sword]]'', [[Eric Bana]] plays Uther Pendragon, betrayed and murdered by his brother [[Vortigern]] for control over Camelot.

'''Walter Audisio''' (June 28, 1909 – October 11, 1973) was an [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisan]] and communist politician. He was imprisoned before World War II for his anti-fascist activities. As a senior partisan he was involved in the [[death of Benito Mussolini]], possibly being the individual who killed the dictator and his mistress. After the war he served as an Italian deputy and later as a senator.

==Biography==
===Early activities===
In school, Audisio rose to the top of his class, and first worked making [[Borsalino]] hats. Next he worked for years as an [[Accountancy|accountant]] before entering a group of clandestine [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascists]] in 1931.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The local group was discovered by the Italian [[secret police]], the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism (''Organizzazione per la Vigilanza e la Repressione dell'Antifascismo'', or [[OVRA]]) and in 1934, Audisio was sentenced to five years confinement on the island of [[Ponza]]. Released during [[World War II]], he resumed his activities against the government of [[Benito Mussolini]], and in September 1943 he started to organize the first bands of partisans in [[Casale Monferrato]]. During this time he held jobs in the Fascist civil service.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

===Killing of Mussolini===
During the war, he joined the [[Italian Communist Party]] and became the inspector of the Garibaldi Brigades, a faction of the [[National Liberation Committee]] (CNL), commanding the formations operating in the [[Province of Mantova]] and the [[Po Valley]]. By January 1945, he had become the principal figure of the [[Italian resistance movement]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9192204 |title= Walter Audisio Biography |work= [[Biography.com]] |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-04-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the ''[[Nom de guerre]]'' "Comandante Valerio", a name possibly also used by [[Luigi Longo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/28/guardianobituaries.italy |title= Urbano Lazzaro, The partisan who arrested Mussolini |first= John |last= Hooper |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= February 28, 2006 |accessdate= 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an official of the National Liberation Committee, he received an order on April 28, 1945 to enter [[Dongo, Italy|Dongo]] and enforce the [[capital punishment]] that had been decreed against Mussolini and others in the [[Fascism|fascist]] hierarchy.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5314574.stm |title= Mussolini heir calls for inquest |work= [[BBC News]] |date= September 5, 2006 |accessdate= 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Mussolini remains shrouded in mystery today, but Audisio always claimed that he was the one who shot and killed the dictator and his mistress, [[Claretta Petacci]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804084,00.html |title= What Price Brutus? |work= [[Time Magazine]] |date= April 7, 1947 |accessdate= 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war career===
After the war Audisio continued working with the communist movement, and in 1948, was elected to the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies]] for [[Alessandria]] with the [[Italian Communist Party]] as part of the [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|Popular Democratic Front]]. He supported the party until 1963, when he entered the [[Italian Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820490,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title= Battle on the Floor |work= [[Time Magazine]] |date= December 15, 1952 |accessdate= 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he left to work for Italian [[gasoline]] company [[Eni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anpi.it/uomini/audisio_walter.htm |title=Walter Audisio |work=ANPI |date=January 9, 2006 |accessdate=2008-04-08 |language=Italian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605201455/http://www.anpi.it/uomini/audisio_walter.htm |archivedate=2008-06-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died five years later in 1973 of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vipatients.com/patient_info.php?patient_id=3158 |work= VIPatients |title= Audisio, Walter |year= 2008 |publisher= GIDEON Informatics, Inc |accessdate= 2008-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; His memoirs, titled ''In nome del popolo italiano'', were published two years after his death, in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_and_memory/v018/18.1ventresca.html |title= Mussolini's Ghost: Italy's Duce in History and Memory |first= Robert A. |last= Ventresca |publisher= Indiana University Press |journal= History &amp; Memory |volume=18 |issue= 1 |year= 2006 |pages= 86–119 |accessdate= 2008-04-08 |doi= 10.1353/ham.2006.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zevs Cosmos''' (also found as '''Zeus''') (born '''Esyedepeea Aesfyza''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[social nudity]] [[activist]] and the founder of the '''Nudist Christian Church of the Blessed Virgin Jesus''' (NCCBVJ).

== Early activism ==

"Zevs Cosmos" appeared at [[Iowa State University]] around 1982, often preaching on central campus, sometimes drawing crowds away from "[[Brother Jed|Brother Jed Smock]]", another traveling evangelistic preacher who also made regular appearances on campus. During this time, Cosmos would often be seen teaching his ideas about nudism on street corners in [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]], [[Iowa City]], and [[Des Moines, Iowa]].&lt;ref name = Lawrence&gt;Rachel Lawrence, "Bearded 'Bishop' Praises Nudist Life", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', 1984-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to himself as the "founder and bishop" of the Nudist Christian Church of the Blessed Virgin Jesus.&lt;ref name = Lawrence/&gt; By the end of 1984, he claimed to have attracted 50 followers in Ames.&lt;ref name = Lawrence/&gt;

== Nudist Christian Church of the Blessed Virgin Jesus ==

=== Early events ===

Cosmos was referring to himself as the bishop of the NCCBVJ as early as November 1984.&lt;ref name = Lawrence/&gt; In 1985, Cosmos said that God commanded him to travel to the [[Utah]]–[[Arizona]] border; while in this area, Cosmos says that [[God]] and an [[angel]] named Ephygeneia appeared to him naked and told him to go to a [[cave]] on a nearby ridge.&lt;ref name = Lewis&gt;{{cite book|author=James R. Lewis|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC|year=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books, Publishers|isbn=978-1-61592-738-8|page=541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Melton&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Gordon Melton|title=Encyclopedia of American religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FicvAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Gale Research|page=958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While in the cave, God and the angel appeared again and gave Cosmos a [[revelation]], which Cosmos recorded and named the '''Book of Zevs''' (also found as the '''Book of Zeus'''). The NCCBVJ teaches that the Book of Zevs is [[scripture]] that adds to and complements the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name = Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name = Melton/&gt;

=== Teachings ===

==== Book of Zevs ====

The Book of Zevs instructs Cosmos to build a [[nudist community]] city called "Cosmos", which was to be situated northwest of the [[Grand Canyon]].&lt;ref name = Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name = Melton/&gt; The book also condemns [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]] near the Utah–Arizona border for their practice of [[plural marriage]] and their belief in the [[Blacks and the Latter Day Saint movement|inferiority]] of [[black people]].&lt;ref name = Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name = Melton/&gt;

==== Other teachings ====

The NCCBVJ teaches that nudity is a foundational state of being for leading a good life. It teaches that problems with sexuality, body image, [[pornography]], and crime would all be solved if society would adopt a nudist lifestyle.&lt;ref name = Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name = Melton/&gt; Cosmos and the church have also led protests against [[female genital mutilation]] and [[male circumcision]], which are viewed as equally undesirable.

== Legal incidents ==

In January 1985, Cosmos was investigated by the American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] authorities after complaints were made of Cosmos's preaching and sale of pro-nudity [[bumper sticker]]s and [[T-shirt]]s on street corners in Ames, Iowa. When it was discovered that Cosmos had exceeded the 6-month stay permitted by his visitor's [[Visa (document)|visa]], he was ordered [[deportation|deported]] to Canada. His appeal to a federal immigration judge was rejected and he was flown to [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;David Thompson, "Canadian's Immigration Petition Denied: Nudist Church Founder Packs His Bags", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', 1985-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 1985 Cosmos was stopped by police as he was placing flyers on car windshields near [[Drake University]] in Des Moines. The police told him that a city ordinance forbade the distribution of literature in this manner. In December 1985, the [[Iowa Civil Liberties Union]] filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa]] on behalf of Cosmos, arguing that the ordinance unreasonably limited Cosmos's right to [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nudist Church Chief Backed in Rights Suit", ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'', 1985-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
