The '''2008 Masters Series Monte-Carlo''' (also known as the ''Masters Series Monte-Carlo presented by ROLEX'' for sponsorship reasons) was a men's [[tennis]] tournament played on [[Clay court|outdoor clay courts]]. It was the 102nd edition of the [[Monte Carlo Masters]], and was part of the [[ATP Masters Series]] of the [[2008 ATP Tour]]. It took place at the [[Monte Carlo Country Club]] in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], [[France]], near [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]], from 19 April through 27 April 2008.

The men's field was headlined by [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] and [[2008 Estoril Open|Estoril Open]] winner [[Roger Federer]], [[2008 Miami Masters|Miami]] runner-up and [[2007 Monte Carlo Masters|defending champion]] [[Rafael Nadal]], and [[2008 Australian Open|Australian Open]] and [[2008 Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]] titlist [[Novak Djokovic]]. Other notable names in the field were [[2008 Miami Masters|Miami Masters]] champion [[Nikolay Davydenko]], [[2008 Open de Tenis Comunidad Valenciana|Valencia Open]] winner [[David Ferrer]], [[David Nalbandian]], [[Richard Gasquet]] and [[Mikhail Youzhny]].

==Notable stories==
===Nadal's achievements===
Champion [[Rafael Nadal]] became the first man since [[Anthony Wilding]] in 1914 to win four consecutive titles in [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]], and was therefore the first man to do so in the [[History of tennis#Open era|Open Era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC Sport|title=Nadal fights back to beat Federer| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7369929.stm|date =2008-04-27| accessdate =2008-04-27|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nadal also won the doubles event, forming an unseeded team with [[Tommy Robredo]]. This made him only the second man in [[ATP Masters Series]] history to win both the singles and the doubles events of a tournament, in the same year. The last man to do so was [[Jim Courier]], at the [[1991 Newsweek Champions Cup and the Virginia Slims of Palm Springs|1991 Indian Wells Super 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nadal First to Double Up at Masters Series in 17 Years|url=http://www.ontennis.com/news/nadal-first-double-masters-series-17-years|publisher=OnTennis.com|date=28 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All top seeds in final rounds===
For the second time only in [[ATP Masters Series]] history, the top four seeds ([[Roger Federer]], [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Novak Djokovic]] and [[Nikolay Davydenko]]) all reached the semifinals of the event. The last occurrence of this had taken place at the [[1999 Newsweek Champions Cup and the Evert Cup|1999 Cincinnati Super 9 event]], with [[Pete Sampras]], [[Patrick Rafter]], [[Andre Agassi]] and [[Yevgeny Kafelnikov]] all reaching the final four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=monte-carlo.masters-series.com|title=Djokovic Sets Star-Studded SF Field| url =http://montecarlo.masters-series.com/1/en/news/newsarticle_1068.asp|date =2008-04-25| accessdate =2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''African Rainforest Conservancy''' (ARC), works to conserve and restore [[African rainforest]]s, particularly focusing on the Eastern Arc mountains of [[Tanzania]] located about {{convert|200|km}} southeast of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]].  These lush mountains are among the oldest and most biodiverse in the world.  The forests themselves are in jeopardy from local logging, used mostly in the surrounding villages for fuel. In addition, [[poaching]] activities endanger several rare species.  ARC works to protect these mountains by training the community to be caretakers of the forest, developing the many sustainable business opportunities that exist in the region.  Concurrently large scale train planting projects work both to reforest denuded native trees and create timber plantations in non-rainforest areas that can be managed sustainably for generations to come.

Despite the fact that 70% of the original rainforest cover has gone, the Eastern Arc mountains hold thousands of species that have not yet been named as well as the highest density of endangered animals anywhere in the world.  These findings were presented by a group of scientists in the [[Journal of Biological Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V5X-4M3J0YC-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1a0e1a6aed75fea4afa842d98a8597ae/ Science Direct]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Luxemburgish]] '''Spuerkeess''', in French '''Banque et Caisse d'Épargne de l'État''', is the leading national financial institution founded in 1856 and governed by the law of March 24, 1989. BCEE is a commercial bank wholly owned by the Luxembourgish State.

Nowadays, it provides all the functions of a [[commercial bank]], including [[retail banking]] and [[private banking]]. In terms of total assets BCEE is the third-largest bank in Luxembourg and the largest bank with domestic capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebanks.eu/articles/banks-in-Luxembourg Banks in Luxembourg]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Spuerkees was founded by [[William III of the Netherlands|Grand Duke William III]] as "Caisse d'Épargne de l'État du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg" due to a Law on February 21. 1856. The board of directors had three members and had their first meeting on August 18. 1859 under the presidency of Professor [[:lb:Nicolas Martha|Nicolas Martha]]. Headquarters of the Spuerkees at that time were seated in [[Haus Ketter]] in [[:lb:Dräikinneksgaass|Dräikinneksgaass]] in the city, while their desk offices were at the [[Krautmaart]], at the headquarters of the government commission, which is today's [[Grand Ducal Palace, Luxembourg|Palais]].

Since 1862 it was allowed that foreigners could deposit their money at the Spuerkees. The trust of the Public was high from the first day on, one of the reasons the deposit already reached an amount of one Million [[Franc]] in 1869.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''Central American Bank for Economic Integration''' - CABEI ([https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Centroamericano_de_Integraci%C3%B3n_Econ%C3%B3mica BCIE] in spanish) was founded in 1960. Is an international multilateral development financial institution. Its resources are invested in projects that foster development to reduce poverty and inequality; strengthen regional integration and the competitive insertion of its member countries in the global economy; providing special attention to environmental sustainability. Its headquarters are in [[Tegucigalpa]](Honduras) and has regional offices in 
[[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]].

==Mission==

CABEI is a [[multilateral development bank]] (MDB) whose mission&lt;ref name="CABEI_INFO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=CABEI|title=Institutional Information|url=https://www.bcie.org/en/about-us/general-information/|website=Central American Bank for Economic Integration|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to promote the economic integration and the balanced economic and social development of the Central American region, which includes the founding countries and the non-founding regional countries, attending and aligning itself with the interests of all of its member countries.

==Vision==

CABEI's vision&lt;ref name="CABEI_INFO"/&gt; consists of being the strategic ally of its member countries in the provision of financial solutions that contribute to the creation of employment and improvement of the wellbeing and quality of life of its citizens.

==Members==

*'''Founding countries''': Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. These countries signed the Founding Covenant which establishes the CABEI, in the decision frame adopted by their Governments to promote regional economic integration.
*'''Non-founding regional countries''': [[Panama]] and [[Dominican Republic]], which take part in the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA in its Spanish initials) and are represented before CABEI's Board of Directors and Governors' Assembly.
*'''Non-regional countries''': [[Mexico]], [[Taiwan]], [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]] and [[Spain]]. They have deemed important to join CABEI with the aim of having a permanent regional presence, thus enlarging their international projection through supporting founding countries' development. They also have named representatives before CABEI's Board of Directors and Governors' Assembly.
*'''Beneficiary countries''': [[Belize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CABEI|title=Belize|url=https://www.bcie.org/en/member-countries/regional-non-founding-members/belize/|website=Central American Bank for Economic Integration|publisher=CABEI|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has joined the CABEI to receive loans and guarantees, same as regional countries, but, unlike them, Belize has not bought shares of the institution.

Apart from regional countries, Argentina and Colombia enjoy the capacity of receiving CABEI's loans and guarantees.

==Functions==

CABEI is the development bank for Central America, its strategic partner and the main purveyor of resources: by late 2009, it had approved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodas-Martini|first1=Pablo et al.|title=Contribución del BCIE al Desarrollo de Centroamérica: 50 Años de Historia|date=December 2010|publisher=CABEI|location=Tegucigalpa, Honduras|isbn=978-99926-665-6-2|page=20|url=http://www19.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/PE/2011/09275.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; $14,603.3 millon since its inception for the development of the region

As a regional financing institution, CABEI supports both public and private sectors and specializes in raising and channeling external money to promote investment in its action areas, which are:

* Energy and production infrastructure
* Agriculture and rural development
* Human development and social infrastructure
* Industry, urban development and services for competitiveness
* Financial trading and development finance

==Structure==

CABEI's maximum authority is the Governors' Assembly, integrated by Ministers of Economy and central bank Governors of member countries.

Besides, CABEI's Founding Covenant includes other authorities: Directory, as the organ responsible for the Bank's direction; President, elected by the Governors' Assembly; Vice president, elected by the Directory; and other officials deemed necessary for the institution's correct functioning.

'''Crème chiboust''' is a [[crème pâtissière]] (pastry cream) lightened with stiffly beaten [[egg white]]s. Though occasionally using [[whipped cream]] to lighten it, this is traditionally a [[millefeuille]] cream.

Crème chiboust can be flavoured with [[vanilla]], [[orange zest]], or [[liqueur]]s. Mixed with fruit, it becomes [[crème plombières]].

It was supposedly created and developed by the pastry Chef M. Chiboust of the pastry shop that was located on the Paris street [[Rue Saint-Honoré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les meilleurs Saint-Honoré de Paris|url=http://blogs.lexpress.fr/styles/bec-sucre-parigot/2013/05/02/les-meilleurs-saint-honore-de-paris/|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=L'Express|date=2 May 2013|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If gelatin is bloomed and incorporated to the chiboust or ''plombieres'', it can be used as a Bavarian. The chiboust or the plombieres can also double as [[soufflé]] filling, as long as egg whites are the base; the mix will "puff up" and provide a creamy soufflé.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1824">[[Image:Risør komm.svg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Risør. The official version has a silver [[mural crown]].]]
The '''Coat of arms of [[Risør]]''' was approved by King [[Oscar II of Norway]] on 18 July 1891. It depicts a fortification protruding from the sea. This fortification is a symbol of Holmen battery which was built in 1788 and manned during the [[Napoleonic wars]] of 1807 to 1814. The coat of arms was approved in a very unusual way as it was first used as a decoration on the dinner menus used for the King's visit to Risør in 1891. During the course of dinner the king approved the design by writing ''Våbnet approberes Oscar 1891 18/7'' (The coat of arms is approved) on one of the menus. This was the first new approval of a Norwegian coat of arms in 150 years and the only time it happened outside state council. The coat of arms had been in the making for quite some time and the design had been approved by the National archive of Norway (the heraldic authority) and later by the city council on 13 July. One architect Thorsen of [[Oslo|Christiania]] is credited with the idea and artist [[Wilhelm Krogh]] did the final design.

'''''DV''''' ('''''Dagblaðið Vísir''''') is a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper in [[Iceland]] published by DV ehf. It came into existence in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sul-sfx.stanford.edu/sfxlcl41?url%5Fver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx%5Fver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx%5Fenc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&amp;rfr%5Fid=info:sid/sfxit.com:opac%5F856&amp;url%5Fctx%5Ffmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;sfx.ignore%5Fdate%5Fthreshold=1&amp;rft.object%5Fid=1000000000753184&amp;svc%5Fval%5Ffmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:sch%5Fsvc&amp; |title=Find it at Stanford (SFX Services) |publisher=Sul-sfx.stanford.edu |date=1980-09-27 |accessdate=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; when two formerly independent newspapers, [[Vísir]] and [[Dagblaðið]], merged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1548795 |title=Öllum sagt upp í Blaðaprenti |publisher=''[[Morgunblaðið]]'' |date=1981-11-29 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pubId=255 |title=Sameinað og stærra blað á markaðin |publisher=''[[Dagblaðið Vísir]]'' |date=1981-11-26 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''DV'' also has an online publication at DV.is.

It was one of the biggest newspapers in Iceland early on and at one point had a 64% readership in Iceland. In the [[nineties]] its readership started to dwindle and in 2003 its publisher was decleared bankrupt. It was resurrected a week later by the publisher of [[Fréttablaðið]]. In 2006 it was changed from a daily newspaper into a weekly one. Since then it has changed publishers regularly and in 2018 its publisher, DV ehf., went bankrupt. Its assets were bought by a new publisher, {{Proper name|Frjáls fjölmiðlun ehf}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brynjólfur Þór Guðmundsson|title=235 milljóna króna kröfur í þrotabú DV|url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/235-milljona-krona-krofur-i-throtabu-dv|accessdate=24 May 2018|work=[[RÚV]]|date=24 May 2018|language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper has changed dramatically since its inception. Today it is published weekly and focuses mainly on sensational crime stories, astrology, and domestic and foreign celebrity news. Its editorial policy has sparked public controversies in Iceland.

== Report of the Special Investigation Commission ==
In the [[The Report of the Althingi Special Investigation Commission|report of the Special Investigation Commission]] that was formed by [[Alþingi]], ''DV'' was specially noted as almost the only newspaper in Iceland that questioned the Icelandic banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rna.is/media/skjol/RNABindi8.pdf |title=Aðdragandi og orsakir falls íslensku bankanna 2008 og tengdir atburðir |author=Rannsóknarnefnd Alþingis  |publisher=''[[Althing]]'' |date=2010-04-10 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the paper acquired broader readership.

== Previous controversy ==
In January 2006, ''DV'' ran a cover story claiming that former elementary school teacher Gísli Hjartarson had sexually abused two or more boys in his home town of [[Ísafjörður]], Northwest Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=5543577 |title=Heimakennari kærður fyrir að nauðga piltum |publisher=''[[Dagblaðið Vísir]]'' |date=2006-01-10 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hjartarson, who had not been charged with the abuse, committed suicide the same day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visir.is/g/2013130129678/strakarnir-i-isafjardarmalinu-stiga-fram-thad-snerist-allt-um-helvitis-dv-og-aumingja-madurinn- |title=Strákarnir í Ísafjarðarmálinu stíga fram: "Það snérist allt um helvítis DV og aumingja maðurinn" |publisher=''[[Vísir.is]]'' |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cited the coming news coverage as his reason in a letter he left for his family, although he did not name ''DV'' specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=350054&amp;pageId=5543697 |title=Nefndi ekki DV sem ástæðu|publisher=''[[Dagblaðið Vísir]]'' |date=2006-01-13 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tragedy caused popular uproar against ''DV'' with 30 thousand people (about 10% of the Icelandic population) signing an online petition demanding a new editorial policy. The editors were forced to resign.

On 4 June 2008, ''DV'' reported that The State Committee of Compensations had paid compensation to two boys in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=6508379 |title=Kynferðisbrotin teljast óupplýst |publisher=''[[Dagblaðið Vísir]]'' |author=Erla Hlynsdóttir |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(Additional answer: WLW is both an FCC clear-channel station, and owned by Clear Channel.) --&gt; [[WLW]] from 1984 to 2004, and it was carried by a small network of similarly high-powered stations across the United States. Sommers discontinued playing music on his nightly show, focusing on general and truck news, and talk from his listeners. Sommers announced his retirement from radio in 2004, but [[XM Satellite Radio]] was successful in getting him to do an afternoon truck show, which aired on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and XM from 4 PM to 7 PM [[Eastern time zone|Eastern time]]. Sommers retired from XM/Sirius on June 21, 2012, only to return for the last time on July 16, 2012.

==Biography==

===History===
Born Glen Council&lt;ref name="RIP20120824"/&gt; in [[Humboldt, Tennessee]], Sommers moved to Cincinnati with his family at the age of 15. The next year (1959), be began working for WAEF. Sommers worked for other local radio stations in Cincinnati, as well as in [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Seattle]], [[San Diego]], [[Miami]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], before settling back at WLW in 1984.&lt;ref name="E20040422"/&gt; His nickname '''"The Truckin' Bozo"''' reportedly came from his former boss at WLW, [[Randy Michaels]]. During a station remodeling, Michaels saw Sommers kick a wall. Unfortunately, its supports had been removed and it came crashing down across a desk, prompting Michaels to call Sommers “a [[Bozo the Clown|bozo]].”&lt;ref name="E20040422"/&gt; Sommers retired from WLW in 2003 but shortly thereafter assumed work at XM, joining the Open Road channel in a daytime slot. Sommers would remain with the channel through its merger with Sirius's [[Road Dog Trucking]] channel up until shortly before his death.

===Catching a robber===
"The Bozo" made national headlines when he helped to catch a robber at a [[convenience store]] in [[Camilla, Georgia]]. Sommers was talking live on the air with regular caller Linda Driskill, known as "Mississippi Lady" to listeners, when he heard Driskill admonish someone not to come behind her counter. She then hung up the phone. Sommers was concerned for her safety, so he called the Camilla police (who knew Driskill from Sommers' show). The police responded to Driskill's store and quickly apprehended the robber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Kiesewetter|publisher=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|title=WLW turns 80|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/03/17/tem_wlw_700_turns_80.html|date=2002-03-17|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on Mexicans===
Sommers has raised some controversy among Mexican truckers for his apparent negative comments on the radio regarding cross-border trucking. He was often heard supporting bans on Mexican trucks in the United States.&lt;ref name=MTO20080115&gt;{{cite web|first=|title=Trucking Bozo spreading more fear and hate!|url=http://mexicotrucker.com/trucking-bozo-spreading-more-fear-and-hate|publisher=Mexico Trucker Online|accessdate=2012-08-24|date=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and health==
Sommers was married to Sharon "Lumpy" Cox Sommers for 35 years. Sharon ran a travel agency until May 2004 and retired from the travel business. She died Aug. 10, 2016, at her home in Mason, Ohio. &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.landlinemag.com/Story.aspx?StoryID=31731#.V64XOlsrJpg Sharon 'Lumpy' Sommers dies unexpectedly]" Land Line Magazine, Aug. 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;Dale and Sharon spent approximately nine months a year in Florida and the summer months in Cincinnati. Sommers had a studio in his Florida home and also in his Cincinnati home so he could continue working from both locations.

Sommers is survived by his wife, sons Steve Sommers (born c. 1965; host of ''[[America's Trucking Network]]''), media executive [[Sean Compton]], David Sommers (who runs the travel business founded by his mother), Kevin Sommers, and Jason Sommers, stepson Brian Mitchell, and his daughter, Krissie Sommers Kastle who currently resides in Indiana. He had 19 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="LLM20120824"&gt;{{cite web|last=Soendker|first=Sandi|title=Breaking News: Trucking radio icon Dale Sommers signs off|url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Story.aspx?StoryID=24071|publisher=Land line magazine|date=August 24, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Sommers was diagnosed with [[Addison's disease]] and insulin-dependent diabetes, which factored into his retirement from terrestrial radio.&lt;ref name="E20040422"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/04/22/loc_bozo22.html|title=Truckin' Bozo's buggin' out for good|last=Johnston|first=John|date=April 22, 2004|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc|accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his health difficulties, he maintained his satellite radio show until shortly before his death.

==Death==
On the morning of August 24, 2012, Sommers died in a [[hospice]] facility near his home in [[Hernando, Florida]] at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="LLM20120824"/&gt;

'''Edward W Nelson''' (1883–1923) was an [[invertebrate]] [[zoologist]] and [[polar explorer]].
He worked at the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom]] (MBA) in Plymouth  and in 1910, in association with E. J. Allen, developed a simple method for culturing [[phytoplankton]].

==Polar expedition==

In 1910, he joined the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13|British Antarctic Expedition]] (popularly known as "The Terra Nova Expedition") led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]], and served as a biologist. He took part in a [[Sledding|sledging]] journey to "One Ton Depot", carrying food supplies for the returning polar party. He also conducted tidal observations while at [[Cape Evans]] and was later awarded the [[Polar Medal]]. He has been commemorated with "Nelson Cliff" at the west side of the [[Simpson Glacier]] (71°14′S, 168°42′E).

==Later career==

On his return from the Antarctic, Nelson worked as Senior [[Naturalist]] at the laboratory in Plymouth, taking leave to fight with the [[British 63rd (Royal Naval) Division]] in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli campaign]], then later in the trenches of France. In 1920 the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] approached the MBA to propose that the Association undertake the manufacture of a large number of "Drift Bottles", to be used in tracking the movement of the waters of the [[North Sea]]. By this time, Nelson was the Scientific Superintendent of the "[[Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency|Fisheries Board for Scotland]]", and wrote a paper on the manufacture of the drift bottles for the Association's Journal. He committed suicide by lethal injection in 1923 when he was only 39. An inquest into his death was reported in The Times newspaper.{{clarify|date=December 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''Eubulus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Εὔβουλος}}, ''Euboulos'') was an [[Athens|Athenian]] "[[Middle Comedy|Middle Comic]]" [[poet]], victorious six times at the [[Lenaia]], first probably in the late 370s or 360s BC (''IG'' II2 2325.144; just before Ephippus)

According to the ''[[Suda]]'' (test. 1), which dates him to the 101st [[Olympiad]] (i.e. 376/2) and identifies him as "on the border between the Middle and the [[Old Comedy]]", he produced 104 comedies and won six victories at the [[Lenaia]]. An obscure notice in a ''[[scholia|scholium]]'' on [[Plato]] (test. 4) appears to suggest that some of his plays were staged by [[Aristophanes]]’ son [[Philippus (son of Aristophanes)|Philippus]]. He attacked [[Philocrates]], [[Callimedon]], [[Cydias]], and [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius]] the tyrant of Syracuse.

Eubulus's plays were chiefly about mythological subjects and often parodied the tragic playwrights, especially [[Euripides]].

==Surviving Titles and Fragments==
150 fragments (including three ''dubia'') of his comedies survive, along with fifty-eight titles:

'''Series 2042''' is a diesel locomotive series on [[Croatian Railways]] ({{lang-hr|hrvatske željeznice, HŽ}}).

This series is not substantively different from the [[HŽ series 2041|series 2041]], except that they have a stronger engine. With the upgrade in motor, this locomotives changed the traction behavior. These are four-axle locomotives with every axle separately powered. This series is built for hauling of lighter freight trains and for heavy maneuvering.

'''Kihnu Airfield''' {{airport codes||EEKU}} is an [[airfield]] on [[Kihnu|Kihnu island]] in [[Estonia]]. The airfield is situated near the village of [[Sääre, Pärnu County|Sääre]] and is {{Convert|22|NM|lk=in}} southwest of [[Pärnu]].&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; It has no [[IATA airport code]].

The airfield has two crossing [[runway]]s; 04/22 {{convert|600|x|20|m|abbr=on}} and 15/33 {{convert|567|x|60|m|abbr=on}}, both with grass surface.&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; There are no landing lights or navigational systems on the airfield. Therefore, the airfield is only certified for [[Visual flight rules|VFR]] in daylight.&lt;ref name="AIP"/&gt; There are no regular flights to Kihnu since [[Air Livonia]] stopped operating. Small private planes use the airfield for general flights in the summer. Also LFH does charter flights to Kihnu.

Kihnu Airfield is owned by AS Pärnu Lennujaam ([[Pärnu Airport]] Ltd).

The operators of the airfield warn that the airfield is not fenced in, so pilots who wish to land outside of the airfield's operational hours need to make sure that there are no people, animals or other obstacles on the runways before landing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eepu.ee/index.php?sitesig=PILEN&amp;page=PILEN_013_Kihnu_Airfield&amp;subpage=PILEN_002_Runway eepu.ee]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zealandia, topographic map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Topographic map of Zealandia showing the Norfolk Ridge]]
The '''Norfolk Ridge''' is a long [[submarine ridge]] running between [[New Caledonia]] and [[New Zealand]], about 1300&amp;nbsp;km off the east-coast of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].

It is part of a complex region of ridges between the crust of the Pacific Basin and the continental crust of Australia. Little is known about the Norfolk Ridge; however, it generally lies about 2000 m below [[sea level]] and consists of [[Late Cretaceous]] [[continental crust]]. It is part of [[Zealandia (continent)|Zealandia]], a submerged [[continent]] that sank 60-85 million years ago.

'''RDP Internacional - Rádio Portugal''' (abbreviated as '''RDPi'''), is an international radio broadcasting station of [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]]. It aims at overseas Portuguese communities in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[South America]], [[North America]], India/[[Middle East]] as well as [[East Timor]].

==Overview==
[[File:RDP Internacional logo.svg|200px|thumb|right|RDP Internacional logo from 2004 to 2016.]]
RDPi is available worldwide via [[satellite]] and [[Internet]], serving most Portuguese-speaking communities in Europe, Africa, North America (United States/ Canada), South America ([[Brazil]]), [[Venezuela]] and India/Middle East. In Díli (East Timor), RDPi broadcasts also on 105.3 FM, but some programmes are also relayed by [[Radio-Televisão Timor Leste|Radio Timor Leste]], together with local broadcasts.

RDP International ceased its world shortwave transmissions on 1 June 2011.

RTP main shortwave broadcasting centre, known as "CEOC - Centro Emissor de Onda Curta" (lit. SW transmitting centre) was located near Pegões, Portugal, has four 300&amp;nbsp;kW shortwave transmitters (1 TELEFUNKEN S 4005 and 3 THALES TSW 2300) and four 100&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters as backup, which served 6 transmitting antennas. Broadcasts to Venezuela and India/Middle East used only 100&amp;nbsp;kW because of technical limitations: antennas cannot handle powers above 100&amp;nbsp;kW. Transmissions to Europe, America and Africa used 300&amp;nbsp;kW.

RDPi also used ProFunk GmbH centre in Sines, as part of an agreement made between the Portuguese State and Deutsche Welle; since January 2009, weekend broadcasts from Sines used Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) targeting central Europe.

Although RDP had a radio channel dedicated to Portuguese-speaking Africa countries, [[RDP África]], RDPi covered those countries on shortwave, even in areas not served by RDP África. Nonetheless, some African radios relay some programmes from RDPi, specially Portuguese football games.

Some programmes, in particular newscasts and football games broadcast on RDPi and RDP Antena 1 were also relayed on many Portuguese-speaking radios around the world, like Radio Alfa - 98.6 FM [[Paris]] (France) and WJFD (Radio Globo) - 97.3 FM [[Massachusetts]] (United States).

[[File:Narutowicz Pilsudski.jpg|220px|right|thumb|[[Gabriel Narutowicz]] and [[Józef Piłsudski]] are 20th century descendants of the Samogitian nobility]]
The term '''Samogitian nobility''' refers to the [[nobility|noble class]] living in the region of [[Samogitia]], in [[Lithuania]] and an integral part of [[Lithuanian nobility]]. Historically, the local [[szlachta|Polish-Lithuanian gentry]] was formed of people of various ethnic backgrounds, including Lithuanian, Polish, Tartar, German and Ruthenian.&lt;ref name="Tazbir"&gt;{{Cite book| author =[[Janusz Tazbir]] | editor =  | title =Państwo bez stosów i inne szkice | year =2000| pages =393 | chapter =Szlachta a teologowie | publisher =Universitas | location =Kraków | isbn=83-7052-751-5 |language=pl}}, also published in English as: {{Cite book| author =Janusz Tazbir |author2=Alexander T.

As the [[Duchy of Samogitia]] maintained a certain level of autonomy within the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]],&lt;ref name="Postilla"&gt;{{Cite web| author=Simas Suziedielis | title=Samogitia | publisher=The State Committee for theCommemoration of the 400th Anniversary of the Postile | year=1999 | work=Postilla 400 | url=http://postilla.mch.mii.lt/Tevuzeme/samogitia.en.htm | accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; its nobility was considered a separate subject of the laws, on par with the nobility of other lands of the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Budka"&gt;{{Cite journal| author =Włodzimierz Budka | year =1921 | title =Kto podpisał Konfederację Warszawską 1573 r.? | journal =Reformacja w Polsce | volume =1 | issue =4 | pages =314–319 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samogitian nobility, especially the lower class of it, preserved very well the knowledge of the [[Lithuanian language]] and the  ([[Samogitian dialect]]).&lt;ref name='caru'&gt;{{Cite book| last =Aleksandravičius | first =  Egidijus  | authorlink = Egidijus Aleksandravičius |author2=Antanas Kulakauskas  | title = Carų valdžioje | publisher = Baltos lankos| year = 1996 | location = Vilnius| pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9986-403-69-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Italian language|Italian]] being the official language, along with strong financial and ethno-cultural connections, San Marino maintains close ties to its much larger neighbour; it is located close to the [[riviera]] of [[Rimini]], one of Italy's main coastal resort areas.

The country derives its name literally from [[Saint Marinus]], a [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] originating from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colony on the island of [[Rab]], in modern-day [[Croatia]]. In AD 257,{{clarification needed|reason=does the legend really claim that he started working over a 100 years before his death in 366? this site gives that impression http://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/history/origins-of-san-marino/, but, is that an error, from wikipedia, or the actual legend? also, the site is clear with it probably not being correct, which should be made clearer in this article.|date=January 2018}} Marinus, according to legend, participated in the reconstruction of [[Rimini]]'s city walls after their destruction by [[Liburnians|Liburnian]] [[pirates]]. Marinus then went on to found an independent monastic community on [[Monte Titano]] in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to be the oldest extant sovereign state as well as the oldest constitutional [[republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe's Micro-States: (04) San Marino|url=http://www.dw.de/europes-micro-states-04-san-marino/av-17804426|accessdate=28 July 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marino is governed by the [[Constitution of San Marino]] (''Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini''), a series of six books written in [[Latin]] in the late 16th century, that dictate the country's political system, among other matters. The country is considered to have the earliest written governing documents, or constitution, still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/08/jon-huntsman/oldest-surviving-one-document-text/ |title=The United States has "the longest surviving constitution." |publisher=PolitiFact.com |date=|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's economy mainly relies on [[finance]], [[industry]], [[Service_(economics)|services]] and [[tourism]]. It is among one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (per capita)]], with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions. San Marino is considered to have a highly stable economy, with one of the lowest [[unemployment]] rates in Europe, no [[national debt]] and a budget surplus.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{CIA World Factbook link|sm|San Marino}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[List of countries by vehicles per capita|only country with more vehicles than people]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of San Marino}}
[[File:Marino als steinhauer.png|thumb|left|Illustration of [[Saint Marinus]], the founder of the Republic of San Marino, and prominent cultural figure]]
[[Saint Marinus]] left the island of [[Rab]] in present-day [[Croatia]] with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of [[Rimini]] as a stonemason. After the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby [[Monte Titano]], where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino, which is sometimes still called the "Titanic Republic".&lt;ref&gt;Charles, comte de Bruc, [https://archive.org/details/republicsanmari00brucgoog ''The Republic of San Marino''] (Cambridge: 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The official date of the founding of what is now known as the Republic is 3 September 301. In 1320 the community of [[Chiesanuova]] chose to join the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/castles/chiesanuova SanMarinoSite. Chiesanuova.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1463 San Marino was extended with the communities of [[Faetano]], [[Fiorentino]], [[Montegiardino]], and [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]], after which the country's border have remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/San-Marino.html/ San Marino]. Countries and their Cultures.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1631, its independence was recognized by the [[Papacy]].

The advance of [[Napoleon]]'s army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty thanks to one of its Regents, [[Antonio Onofri]], who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Thanks to his intervention, Napoleon, in a letter delivered to [[Gaspard Monge]], scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the Regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' [[revanchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/napoleone.html |title=From 1500 to beginning 1800, Napoleon in San Marino |publisher=Sanmarinosite.com |date= |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518123316/http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/napoleone.html |archivedate=18 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire abrégée des traités de paix entre les puissances de l'Europe depuis la Paix de Westphalie'', Christophe-Guillaume Koch, ed., Paris, 1817, vol.

During the later phase of the [[Italian unification]] process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification. In recognition of this support, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] accepted the wish of San Marino not to be incorporated into the new Italian state.

The government of San Marino made [[United States]] President [[Abraham Lincoln]] an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that "government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring."&lt;ref name="SanMarinoAbrahamLincoln1"&gt;{{cite web

During [[World War I]], when Italy declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]] on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of [[Carabinieri]] in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educazione.sm/scuola/servizi/CD_virtuali/lavori_scuole/sanmarino/prima_guerra_mondiale.htm |title=San Marino e la Prima Guerra Mondiale |publisher=Educazione.sm |date=|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1923 to 1943, San Marino was under the rule of the [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]] (PFS).

[[File:Guerra1.JPG|thumb|left|British troops at [[Monte Titano]] during the battle of San Marino, September 1944]]
During [[World War II]], San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it had declared war on the [[United Kingdom]] on 17 September 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://209.157.64.200/focus/chat/2591636/posts |title=GALES SCATTER NAZI CHANNEL FLEETS; ITALIANS THRUST DEEPER INTO EGYPT (9/18/40) |publisher=209.157.64.200 |date=18 September 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=dp292&gt;[[#refDiplomatic|''Diplomatic papers, 1944'']], p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

Three days after the fall of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The Fascists regained power on 1 April 1944 but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the [[Royal Air Force]], in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDiplomatic|''Diplomatic papers, 1944'']], p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the [[Gothic Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/storia/guerremo.html |title=Guerre Mondiali e Fascismo nella storia di San Marino |publisher=Sanmarinosite.com |date= |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410122359/http://www.sanmarinosite.com/storia/guerremo.html |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the [[Battle of San Marino]].

San Marino had the world's first democratically elected [[communism|communist]] government – a coalition between the [[Sammarinese Communist Party]] and the [[Sammarinese Socialist Party]], which held office between 1945 and 1957.&lt;ref name="Desai2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manali Desai|title=State Formation and Radical Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60m9znJQmmkC&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=27 November 2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-96774-4|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayne1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan James Mayne|title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marino is the world's smallest [[republic]], although when [[Nauru]] gained independence in 1968 it challenged that claim, Nauru's [[land mass]] being only {{convert|21|sqkm|abbr=on}}. However Nauru's jurisdiction over its surrounding waters covers {{convert|431,000|sqkm|abbr=on}}, an area thousands of times greater than the territory of San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_NR/en|title=Fishery and Aquaculture Country Profiles: Nauru|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marino became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1988 and of the [[United Nations]] in 1992. It is neither a member of the [[European Union]], nor of the [[Eurozone]] although it uses the [[euro]] as its currency.

{{Main article|Politics of San Marino}}
{{See also|Foreign relations of San Marino|Constitution of San Marino|Capital punishment in San Marino|San Marino passport|Law enforcement in San Marino|Elections in San Marino}}
[[File:Parliament San Marino.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Pubblico (San Marino)|Palazzo Pubblico]], seat of the government of San Marino]]
[[File:Captains Regent Tomassoni, Rossi, Mancini and Selva.jpg|thumb|Four former Captains Regent: from left to right, [[Mirko Tomassoni]], [[Alessandro Rossi (politician)|Alessandro Rossi]], [[Alessandro Mancini]], and [[Alberto Selva]]]]
San Marino has the political framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]]: the [[captain regent|Captains Regent]] are both [[Head of state|heads of state]] and [[Head of government|heads of government]], and there is a [[Diversity (politics)|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Grand and General Council]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

San Marino was originally led by the [[Arengo]], initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two Captains Regent were nominated by the Council. {{As of|2016}}, this method of nomination is still in use.

The legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (''Consiglio grande e generale''). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old [[parish]]es of the republic.

[[Citizen]]s 18 years or older are eligible to vote. Beside general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the Captains Regent, the State Congress (composed of ten Secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councillors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.

Every six months, the council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the Captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.

The practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Council is equivalent to the [[Roman Senate]]; the Captains Regent, to the [[consul]]s of ancient [[Rome]]. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.

San Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing [[Pact for San Marino]], led by the [[San Marinese Christian Democratic Party]]; and the left-wing [[Reforms and Freedom]], led by the [[Party of Socialists and Democrats]], a merger of the [[Socialist Party of San Marino]] and the former communist [[Party of Democrats]]. The [[Sammarinese general election, 2008|2008 general election]] was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.

On 1 October 2007, [[Mirko Tomassoni]] was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as [[Captains Regent|captain regent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/esteri/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino.html |title=San Marino, primo capo di Stato disabile "Via tutte le barriere architettoniche" – esteri |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marino has had more [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female heads of state]] than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino [Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino] exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups, such as women, have fared in the legal field. 

===Administrative divisions===

====Municipalities====
[[File:San Marino.png|thumb|[[Administrative division]]s of San Marino]]
San Marino is divided into the following nine [[municipalities]], known locally as ''{{lang|it|castelli}}'' (meaning "castles"):
* [[City of San Marino|San Marino]] (City of San Marino, officially ''{{lang|it|Città di San Marino}}'') is the capital.

There are also eight minor municipalities:
* [[Acquaviva (San Marino)|Acquaviva]]
* [[Borgo Maggiore]]
* [[Chiesanuova]]
* [[Domagnano]]
* [[Faetano]]
* [[Fiorentino]]
* [[Montegiardino]]
* [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]]

The largest settlement of the Republic is [[Dogana]], which is not an autonomous ''{{lang|it|castello}}'', but rather belongs to the Castello of [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]].

In a similar way to an Italian ''{{lang|it|[[comune]]}}'', each ''{{lang|it|castello}}'' includes a main settlement, called ''{{lang|it|capoluogo}}'', which is the seat of the ''{{lang|it|castello}}'', and some even smaller localities known as ''{{lang|it|[[frazione|frazioni]]}}''.

====Curacies====

===Military===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
{{Main article|Military of San Marino}}

San Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of [[Military of Italy|Italy's armed forces]]. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The [[Civil Police (San Marino)|police]] are not included in the military of San Marino.

====Crossbow Corps====
Once at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of [[crossbow]] shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.

====Guard of the Rock====
[[File:Guardia di Rocca al Palazzo Pubblico San Marino.jpg|thumb|[[Guardia di Rocca|Guards of the Rock]]]]
The [[Guardia di Rocca|Guard of the Rock]] is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino City]], the seat of national government.

In this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of [[Changing the Guard]]. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as "Criminal Police Officers" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.

====Guard of the Grand and General Council====
The Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the "Guard of Nobles", formed in 1740, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the [[Captains Regent]]s, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.

====Company of Uniformed Militia====
In former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.

The uniform is dark blue, with a [[kepi]] bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.

====Military Ensemble====
Formally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 50 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.

====Gendarmerie====
Established in 1842, the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of San Marino|Gendarmerie]] of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.

The entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the ''Corpi Militari Volontari'', or Voluntary Military Force.

==Economy==
{{Main article|Economy of San Marino|Sammarinese euro coins|List of banks in San Marino}}
[[File:Via Basilicus din San Marino2.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Tourism and banking are the country's main source of revenue.]]

Although San Marino is not a [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its currency by arrangement with the [[Council of the European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of [[Sammarinese euro coins]], as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].

San Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of [[Italy]]. Key industries include [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]]. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.

San Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and are an important source of income. San Marino is a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].

===Taxation===
The corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19%. Capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax; interest is subject to a 13% [[withholding tax]].

In 1972, a [[value-added tax]] (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.

Under the [[European Union Customs Union|European Union customs agreement]], San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods. Also, a general VAT was introduced, in replacement of the Italian VAT.

===Tourism===

The [[tourism]] sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]],&lt;ref name="rtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinortv.sm/economia/default.asp?id=33&amp;id_n=39203|title=Turismo: San Marino fa i conti con la recessione economica, l'Italia guarda con fiducia al 2010|date=11 January 2010|publisher=San Marino RTV |language=Italian|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourists flows|url=http://www.statistica.sm/contents/instance15/files/document/14079659Tav_Afflusso_tur.pdf|website=statistica.sm|publisher=Statistical Office of San Marino|accessdate=16 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082104/http://www.statistica.sm/contents/instance15/files/document/14079659Tav_Afflusso_tur.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventions with Italy===
San Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/home/trattati-internazionali/convenzioni-bilaterali/convenzioni-bilaterali---accordi-bilaterali-con-litalia.html|title=Convenzioni Bilaterali – Accordi bilaterali con l'Italia|publisher=Segreteria di stato per gli affari esteri e politici|language=Italian|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104183908/http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/home/trattati-internazionali/convenzioni-bilaterali/convenzioni-bilaterali---accordi-bilaterali-con-litalia.html|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.
Cultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's [[government monopoly]] are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden: all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use [[Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato|Italy's mint]]. Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is currently one legally operating casino.

In exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, and at cost, sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).&lt;ref name="esteri1980"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/normative/Normativa_Consolare/ServiziConsolari/Servizio_Militare/san_marino_1980.pdf|title=Convenzione di amicizia e buon vicinato 1939 (1980 transcript)|year=1980|language=Italian|accessdate=28 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/normative/Normativa_Consolare/ServiziConsolari/Servizio_Militare/san_marino_1980.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the border there are no formalities with Italy.  However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their [[passport]]s.

== Population ==

=== Demographics ===
{{Main article|Demographics of San Marino}}

San Marino has a population of approximately 33,000, with 4,800 foreign residents, most of whom are Italian citizens. Another 12,000 Sammarinese live abroad (5,700 in Italy, 3,000 in the US, 1,900 in [[France]] and 1,600 in [[Argentina]]).

The first census since 1976 was held in 2010. Results were expected by the end of 2011.  However, 13% of families did not return their forms.

=== Religion ===
{{main article|Religion in San Marino}}
[[File:San Marino katedra.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Marino Cathedral]]]]
San Marino is a predominantly Catholic state&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;—over 97% of the population profess the Roman Catholic faith, but Catholicism is not an [[established religion]]. Approximately half of those who profess to be Catholic practice the faith.&lt;ref name="Cavendish"&gt;{{cite book|title=World and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcYVmUyHG2AC&amp;pg=PA856|year=2009 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=0-7614-7893-0|page=856}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no [[episcopal see]] in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian [[diocese]]s, mostly in the [[Diocese of Montefeltro]], and partly in the [[Diocese of Rimini]]. In 1977, the border between [[Montefeltro]] and [[Rimini]] was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The [[bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino]] resides in [[Pennabilli]], in Italy's province of [[Pesaro e Urbino]].

However, there is a provision under the income tax rules that the taxpayers have the right to request for allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to "other" charities. The churches include the two religious groups of the [[Waldensian Church]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro]] was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dsmmi|Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current diocese includes all the [[parish]]es of San Marino. The earliest mention of [[Montefeltro]], as ''Mona Feretri'', is in the diplomas by which [[Charlemagne]] confirmed the [[donation of Pepin]]. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at [[San Leo]]. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the [[archdiocese of Urbino]].&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10528a.htm|title=Diocese of Montefeltro|last=Knight|first=Kevin|year=2009|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1988, there is formally an [[apostolic nunciature]] to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.

There has been a [[Jew]]ish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.&lt;ref name="JewishEncyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13163-san-marino|title=San Marino|work=1906 Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publibook.com/librairie/livre-universitaire.php?isbn=9782748372236|title=La|work=Publibook|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009115356/http://www.publibook.com/librairie/livre-universitaire.php?isbn=9782748372236|archivedate=9 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were permitted official protection by the government.

During [[World War II]], San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Italians and Jews (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution. Today, only a few Jews remain.&lt;ref name="jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/san_marino.html|title=Virtual Jewish history tour: San Marino|last=Sheib|first=Ariel|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
{{Main article|Transport in San Marino}}
There are {{convert|220|km|abbr=on}} of roads in the country, the main road being the [[San Marino Highway]]. Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive [[Vehicle registration plates of San Marino|Sammarinese license plates]], which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is "RSM".

There are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private [[Torraccia airfield|airstrip located in Torraccia]] and an international heliport located in [[Borgo Maggiore]]. Most tourists who arrive by air land at [[Federico Fellini International Airport]] close to the city of [[Rimini]], then make the transfer by bus.

Two rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.

===Public transport===
San Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at [[Rimini railway station]] and San Marino coach station.

A limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,&lt;ref&gt;Licensed taxi companies are listed on the {{cite web |url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 |title=Government tourism website |accessdate=2007-09-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501005409/http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.

[[File:San-Marino-Gondola-1283.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial tramway to [[Monte Titano]]]]
There is a {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} aerial tramway connecting the [[City of San Marino]] on top of [[Monte Titano]] with [[Borgo Maggiore]], a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, [[Dogana, San Marino|Dogana]], via the local bus service.

Two aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.

===Railway===
Today, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before [[World War II]], it had a single narrow-gauge line called the [[Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino]] which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of [[Valdragone]], but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifef.free.fr/provo/if2005-6.pdf ''Internacia Fervojisto''] (''International Railways''), 2005.6, p. 85. In Esperanto&lt;/ref&gt;
An advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers, but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes.

==Culture==
{{Culture of San Marino}}
[[File:Pompeo batoni san marino risolleva la repubblica by stefano bolognini.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A painting in the Museo di Stato di San Marino by [[Pompeo Batoni]]]]
The [[Three Towers of San Marino]] are located on the three peaks of [[Monte Titano]] in the capital. They are depicted on both the [[Flag of San Marino]] and its [[Coat of Arms of San Marino|coat of arms]]. The three towers are: ''[[Guaita]]'', the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century ''[[Cesta]]'', located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century ''[[Montale (San Marino)|Montale]]'', on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.

===University===
The ''Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino'' ([[University of the Republic of San Marino]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unirsm.sm/ |title=Università degli Studi di San Marino |publisher=Unirsm.sm |date=|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the main university, which includes the ''[[Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino]]'' (Advanced School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by professor Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the ''Istituto Musicale Sammarinese'' (Sammarinese Musical Institute)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ims.sm/ |title=Istituto Musicale Sammarinese |publisher=Ims.sm |date=|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino]] or ''Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino'' (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ais-sanmarino.org/ |title=Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze |publisher=Ais-sanmarino.org |date=|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is known for adopting [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning).

Italian author [[Umberto Eco]] had attempted to create a "university without physical structures" in San Marino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liquidsky.net/convivio/eco.htm |title=Umberto Eco biography |publisher=Liquidsky.net |date=16 January 1994 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport===
{{Main article|Sport in San Marino}}
{{See also|San Marino at the Olympics|Football in San Marino}}
In San Marino [[association football|football]] is the most popular sport. [[Basketball]] and [[volleyball]] are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the [[San Marino Football Federation]], the [[San Marino Basketball Federation]] and the [[Federazione Sammarinese Pallavolo|San Marino Volleyball Federation]].

Despite being the most popular sport, the [[San Marino national football team]] has had little success, being made up of part-timers, never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAN MARINO VS. LIECHTENSTEIN 1 – 0|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2004/04/28/world/friendlies/san-marino/liechtenstein/633279/|website=Soccerway|accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=San Marino v Turkey|url=https://scoreshelf.com/gjbb/en/San_Marino/1994fwcSMR_v_TUR|website=Scoreshelf|accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=45|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316114734/https://scoreshelf.com/gjbb/en/San_Marino/1994fwcSMR_v_TUR|archivedate=16 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being among the worst teams in the world, they used to hold the record for the fastest goal scored in international football (since broken by [[Christian Benteke]]), with David Gualtieri scoring 8.3 seconds after the start of a match against the [[England national football team]] in 1993, which they went on to lose 7–1, in the final round of the same World Cup qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Benteke nets fastest international goal in 8.1 seconds|url=http://www.espnfc.com/belgium/story/2969713/christian-benteke-nets-fastest-international-goal-in-81-seconds|website=Espnfc.com|accessdate=16 March 2017|ref=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GP Imola2005 SchumiAlonso.jpg|thumb|2005 [[San Marino Grand Prix]] held in [[Imola]], Italy]]

A [[Formula One]] race, the [[San Marino Grand Prix]], was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]] in the Italian town of [[Imola]], about {{convert|100|km|-1|abbr=on}} northwest of San Marino. This international event was removed from the calendar in [[2007 Formula One season|2007]].

The [[San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix]] was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the [[Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli]], as does San Marino's round of the [[World Superbike Championship]].

San Marino has [[San Marino (baseball team)|a professional baseball team]] which plays in [[Italian Baseball League|Italy's top division]]. It has participated in the [[European Cup (baseball)|European Cup]] tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and [[2007 European Cup (baseball)|2007]]. It won the championship in 2006 and was a runner-up in [[2010 European Cup (baseball)|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mister-baseball.com/2008-misterbaseball-final-european-top-50/ |title=2008 Mister-Baseball Final European Top 50 – fact, certain, about, 2008, European, baseball, season, club, dominated, This |publisher=Mister Baseball |date=6 November 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Italy, San Marino will host the [[2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]], with teams playing at the [[Stadio Olimpico (San Marino)|Stadio Olimpico]] in [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]].

San Marino has had [[San Marino at the Olympics|little success]] at the [[Olympic Games]], winning no medals.

===Cuisine===
{{Main article|Sammarinese cuisine}}
[[File:Piadina.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A ''[[piadina]]'', a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino]]
The cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], especially that of the adjoining [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Marche]] regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the ''[[Torta Tre Monti]]'' ("Cake of the Three Mountains" or "Cake of the Three Towers"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the [[Three Towers of San Marino]]. The country also has a small [[Sammarinese wine|wine]] industry.

===UNESCO===
The site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage List in 2008. The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]] composed of 21 Countries convened in Québec, Canada.

===Music===
{{Main article|Music of San Marino|San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest}}
The country has a long and rich musical tradition, closely linked to that of Italy, but which is also highly independent in itself. In the 17th century, composers including the Sammarinese [[:it:Francesco Maria Marini|Francesco Maria Marini di Pesaro]] wrote some of the finest pieces of the era.

[[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest|San Marino]] has taken part in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] eight times, achieving its first final in 2014 with the third participation of [[Valentina Monetta]] and the song "[[Maybe (Valentina Monetta song)|Maybe]]".

Today forming the [[Central Siberian Plateau]], it formed an independent continent before the [[Permian]] period.

Angaraland was named in the 1880s by Austrian geologist [[Eduard Suess]] who erroneously believed that in the Paleozoic there were two large continents in the Northern Hemisphere: "Atlantis", North America connected to Europe by a peninsula (=Greenland and Iceland); and "Angara-land", eastern Asia, named after the [[Angara River]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Precambrian history==
About 2.5 billion years ago ([[Siderian]]), Siberia was part of a continent of [[Arctica]], along with the [[Canadian Shield]]. Around 1.1 billion years ago ([[Stenian]]), Siberia became part of the major [[supercontinent]] of [[Rodinia]], a state of affairs which lasted until the [[Cryogenian]] about 750 million years ago when it broke up, and Siberia became part of the minor supercontinent of [[Protolaurasia]]. During the [[Ediacaran]] Period around 600 million years ago, Protolaurasia became part of the major southern supercontinent of [[Pannotia]] but around 550 million years ago, both Pannotia and Protolaurasia split up to become the continents of [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and Siberia.

==Paleozoic history==
Siberia was an independent continent through the lower Paleozoic until, during the [[Carboniferous]] Period, it collided with the minor continent of [[Kazakhstania]]. A subsequent collision with [[Baltica]] during the [[Permian]] completed the formation of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. The [[Siberian Traps]] formed.

==Mesozoic and Cenozoic history==
Pangaea split up during the [[Jurassic]] though Siberia stayed with [[Laurasia]]. Laurasia gradually split up during the [[Cretaceous]] with Siberia remaining part of present-day northeastern [[Eurasia]]. Today, Siberia forms part of the minor supercontinent of [[Afro-Eurasia]]. In around 250 million years from now Siberia may be in the [[subtropical]] region and part of a new supercontinent of [[Pangaea Ultima]].
