'''Aden Jefferies''' is a fictional character from the Australian [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Todd Lasance]]. He debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 4 August 2005. Aden was introduced in 2005 as a recurring character and as part of [[Cassie Turner|Cassie Turner's]] ([[Sharni Vinson]]) storylines. Lasance was offered the role after previously auditioning for a separate character. In 2007, Lasance was asked to return on another guest contract, though was promoted to the regular cast soon after.

Aden is characterised as a "bad boy" who goes on a journey to become one of the "good guys". Aden's backstory played a substantial role in his early material. His childhood was plagued with sexual abuse at the hands of his grandfather, while Aden's father, Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson) became an alcoholic. Lasance and scriptwriters have both pointed out that these events impacted on Aden's life and contribute to his destructive personality. As Aden begins to trust others again, he gains a close circle of friends including [[Nicole Franklin]] ([[Tessa James]]), Roman Harris ([[Conrad Coleby]]) and [[Morag Bellingham]] ([[Cornelia Frances]]). He also has a nemesis throughout his tenure in the form of [[Geoff Campbell]] ([[Lincoln Lewis]]). However, his main relationship is with [[Belle Taylor]] ([[Jessica Tovey]]); when the actors first heard that their on-screen counterparts would enter a relationship, they both complained to producers. Both felt like it would not work out and be ill-received by viewers. However, the two realised they had chemistry as a duo and took a chance. The couple became popular with viewers and fans coined the term "Adelle" to refer to the pair.

Other storylines include holding those closest to him as hostages and being admitted to a psychiatric ward. He is also forced to cope with Belle's death after their wedding and a subsequent relationship with his best friend Nicole. Certain media outlets enjoyed Aden and Belle's romance citing the moment they were torn apart as a "sad loss". Aden also gained recognition as being a popular "bad boy" from ''[[Inside Soap]]''. For his portrayal of Aden, Lasance won the award for the "Most Popular Actor" at the 2009 [[Logie Awards]].

==Casting==
In 2005, Todd Lasance auditioned for the role of [[Jack Holden (Home and Away)|Jack Holden]]; however, actor [[Paul O'Brien]] secured the role. The serial's producers called Lasance back, offering him the part of Aden, which was a guest role lasting six weeks.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Aaron |title=Episode 41: An interview with Todd Lasance, star of the ABC1 drama 'Crownies' |url=http://www.tvcentral.com.au/2011/07/06/episode-41-an-interview-with-todd-lasance-star-of-the-abc1-drama-crownies/ |work=TV Central |accessdate=26 September 2011 |date=6 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822153246/http://www.tvcentral.com.au/2011/07/06/episode-41-an-interview-with-todd-lasance-star-of-the-abc1-drama-crownies/ |archivedate=22 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Michelle|title=Long way from home, Todd confirms Summer Bay stay|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH0508027Q5LH34DL6I|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aden was brought into the serial to play a part of [[Cassie Turner|Cassie Turner's]] ([[Sharni Vinson]]) storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Todd Lasance|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/homeandaway/cast_toddlasance.html|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|publisher=([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]])|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasance had not previously watched the serial, but upon learning of his part he said he watched it "religiously" and carried out research on the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Belinda-Jane|title=Todd strikes gold with Hollywood role|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SHD080224EU5M251B1RE|work=[[The Sun-Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011|date=24 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, ''[[The Newcastle Herald]]'' announced that Lasance would return to filming with ''Home and Away''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Amy|title=Todd can peck his roles|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH0704267PEQS4HM5N5|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011|author2=Beaumont, Anita|date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was signed another guest contract.

However, he chose to re-join ''Home and Away'' because did not want to take the risk of losing both roles.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;

In August 2009, ''[[TV Week]]'' reported that Lasance had quit ''Home and Away'' to pursue a career overseas when he signed with a [[Los Angeles]] talent agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Darren|title=Todd Lasance to quit 'Home and Away'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a168974/todd-lasance-to-quit-home-and-away.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a spokesperson for the serial said there were no immediate plans for Lasance to be written out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Darren|title=Lasance not leaving 'Home and Away'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a169169/lasance-not-leaving-home-and-away.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His official departure was later made public and he filmed his final scenes on 15 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Rebecca|title='Home and Away' star makes Hollywood bid|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a190371/home-and-away-star-makes-hollywood-bid.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasance said he was glad Aden was not killed off because it was a "realisation of his potential". While he had no immediate plans to return, he also said he would like to return one day to "see what Aden's up to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H&amp;A star glad character wasn't killed off|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2010/0428/homeandaway.html|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|publisher=([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character development==

===Characterisation===
{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote="[As Aden] I've been in a car accident, I nearly killed my dad, I've been abused, my dad got held at gunpoint, my dad was an alcoholic and the diner collapsed on me so I've been in hospital three times. We're talking 12 months here so he's had a pretty rough trot. I think everyone in Summer Bay needs a bit of therapy."&lt;ref name=sl/&gt;|source=— Lasance on Aden's storyline development. (2008)}}
When Lasance secured the role, he said "Aden causes a bit of mischief in the Bay but he's really a good guy."&lt;ref name=new/&gt; Aden has been described as a "good looking guy with a smile that melts every heart." Aden is initially portrayed as an "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions.&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Aden Jefferies|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/homeandaway/character_adenjefferies.html|work=[[RTÉ.ie]]|publisher=([[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]])|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him "believable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Amy|title=The word|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH0704281CUN76PN6A3|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=16 October 2011|author2=Beaumont, Anita|date=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" despite his "different facets".&lt;ref name=sl&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazarevic|first=Jade|title=Take 10 - Todd Lasance|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH081115MR25T361T7A|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=16 October 2011|date=15 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse===
One of Aden's most notable storylines highlighted the issue of sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles to cope with the sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the "taboo issue".&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline "one hundred percent justice" because there are people, "more than we probably realise" in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhirter|first=Erin|title=Home and Away's Todd Lasance breaks taboo of abuse|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/tv-radio/breaking-the-taboo/story-e6frf9ho-1111118561840|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=([[The Herald and Weekly Times]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though "the huge rebellion years" and the subsequent attempts to "reconnect with those people who had betrayed you." Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used "haunting" techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to show US agents his acting abilities.&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;

Lasance explained that a common theme in Aden's life is something bad happening just after each time he rebuilds his life. One such bad event is the re-emergence of his alcoholic father, Larry. His arrival sets Aden "on the back foot" again, as most of Aden's childhood issues stemmed from his father's addiction to alcohol.&lt;ref name=larry/&gt; He also explained that alcohol abuse is often seen in victims of abuse, so Aden is angered when Larry admits Aden's grandfather abused him too. "Aden loses it" with Larry, because he has had his last chance in Aden's view. Aden holds his father hostage and withdraws his medication to punish him. Aden has had so much trouble from Larry that those "experiences have made him the way he is now", and the story comes to a culmination with Aden giving up on his father.&lt;ref name=larry&gt;{{cite journal|title=Has Aden lost it?|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=23–29 August 2008|pages=9|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aden is admitted into psychiatric care after the incident. However he initially makes little progress and prefers to help fellow patient [[Melody Jones]] ([[Celeste Dodwell]]) with her treatment. Lasance said that Aden had been "protective of Melody after [[Axel Hay]] ([[Trent Dalzell]]) took advantage of her." The pair share an "unspoken bond" because of their past experiences and he "understands exactly what she's going through."&lt;ref name=melody/&gt;

In one storyline Aden's colleague [[Joey Collins]] ([[Kate Bell (Australian actress)|Kate Bell]]) is sexually assaulted by [[Robert Cruze|Robbo Cruze]] ([[Aidan Gillett]]).&lt;ref name=robbo/&gt; Aden and Joey do not get on with each other, however when he finds out about Joey's rape he becomes protective of her. The incident leaves Aden "tormented by his childhood abuse" and he sets out to gain justice for Joey. Lassance said that Aden nearly gives up until he finds out she is a lesbian, and says "he thinks he can prove her case". However, when Robbo threatens Joey, "It's the final straw and Aden snaps", attacking Robbo.&lt;ref name=robbo&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aden attacks Robbo|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=21–27 March 2009|pages=24|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friends and enemies===
Aden's main enemy throughout his duration is [[Geoff Campbell]] ([[Lincoln Lewis]]). Aden did not like Geoff because he is talented at football. As Geoff is a strict Christian, Aden sees Geoff representing the "hypocrisy of society". He also believes Geoff is as "full of sin" and "flawed" as everyone else.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; While their characters clashed on-screen Lasance and Lewis were close friends in real life and learned lines together while they critiqued each other's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neil|first=Alicia|title=Home and Away's Lincoln Lewis and Todd Lasance|url=http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/who/celebrity-interviews/article/-/5918846/home-and-aways-lincoln-lewis-and-todd-lasance/|work=[[Who (magazine)|Who]]|publisher=([[Pacific Magazines]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one storyline, Aden loans money from "shady bookie" [[Clint Mailer]] ([[Matt Zeremes]]). Clint then forces Aden to throw football matches so Clint can win bets. Aden is described as being desperate for money so goes along with the plan. Geoff finds out and is "appalled" by Aden's behaviour, as the storyline progresses Clint tries to force him to end Geoff's career. Lasance added, "Aden tries to get him off the field, but that backfires - and Geoff scores the winning try." This results in Aden being badly assaulted by Clint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home And Away's Aden gets beaten up|url=http://www.tv.com/news/home-and-aways-aden-gets-beaten-up-16554/|work=[[TV.com]]|publisher=([[CBS Interactive]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aden forms an unlikely friendship with [[Morag Bellingham]] ([[Cornelia Frances]]). In the storyline, Morag wants to know why he has problems because she had "taken a bit of a shine to him". Aden initially doesn't want her help.&lt;ref name=morag1/&gt; Whilst interviewed by [[Digital Spy]] Frances stated: "There's lots of lovely dialogue that goes on between him and I - I take him under my wing and I find out what's wrong with him." He eventually looks up to her and moves in with her. Frances said: "So I sort of adopt him in a way."&lt;ref name=morag1&gt;{{cite web|last=Dadds |first=Kimberley |title=Cornelia Frances |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/interviews/a82603/cornelia-frances.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]) |accessdate=5 October 2016 |date=12 February 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xHoUIwdN?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/interviews/a82603/cornelia-frances.html |archivedate=18 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morag is known for her feisty persona, Lasance said Frances was one of his favourite colleagues to work with because she is the complete opposite of Morag. As a pairing they have "collision chemistry" because "they don't really get along, but they do have respect for each other."&lt;ref name=morag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Todd Lasance at your mercy!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=28 February – 6 March 2009|pages=46, 47|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Belle Taylor===
Aden's main relationship in the programme is with [[Belle Taylor]] ([[Jessica Tovey]]).  When Lasance and Tovey found out their characters would become involved together, both did not think it would work. They both separately approached producer [[Cameron Welsh]] and unbeknownst to each other, told him of their concerns about the pairing. However the pair discovered they shared a "great" dynamic while working together and Lasance said when their storylines intertwined it was "fantastic".&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Lasance also said they found much of their early screen time comical because "one minute they're in bed, the next they're fighting in the diner."&lt;ref name=morag/&gt; Aden and Belle became so popular with viewers that they "coined a phrase" to name the couple, which was "Adelle". Lasance said that "The Adelle mayhem is crazy. I get a lot of feedback on the internet about it." For the couple to have such a following, he felt like it was a compliment to his and Tovey's work.&lt;ref name=adelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Amy|title=Todd's all fired up|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH090119AN6SL2SSDS4|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011|author2=Beaumont, Anita|date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jessica Tovey3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jessica Tovey (''pictured'') plays Aden's main love interest, Belle Taylor.]]

After Aden's breakdown and admission to psychiatric care, Belle grows close to [[Angelo Rosetta]] ([[Luke Jacobz]]). Tovey said Aden will always be "the love of Belle's life", but she is traumatised by the previous events. Aden witnesses Belle kissing Angelo, which destroys their relationship. Belle is left unsure what to do because she sees Angelo has her "safety net" and Aden "brings out the passion in her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Belle snogs Angelo!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=25–31 October 2008|pages=21|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that Angelo doesn't compare with her love for Aden, that her relationship with Aden was the "most beautiful" on the programme and that she would never escape her feelings for Aden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|title=Belle moves on with Angelo|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=6–12 September 2008|pages=6|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aden later "jumps on Belle" and tells her they are in love and should be together. Tovey said Belle gets "caught in the moment" and they make love. Tovey was unhappy with the fact that Belle cheated, as she thought it was out of character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|title=Back with Aden|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=18–24 October 2008|pages=6|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Angelo finds out the truth, he publicly humiliates Belle. He later goes around to her home and becomes violent. Belle is later found badly beaten and although Angelo is not responsible, he gets the blame. Jacobz said the under the circumstances he would have thought the same. He added that Aden "hates" Angelo. After Angelo verbally abused Belle, Aden does not "see eye to eye with Angelo" and decides to testify as a witness against Angelo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|author2=Carroll, Penelope|title=Angelo snaps: Has he killed Belle?|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=8–14 November 2008|pages=4, 5|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aden and Belle are involved in a storyline where the school's formal is set on fire. Belle becomes trapped and her injuries have "consequences that change their relationship" forever. Lasance had previously been in caught up in a real house fire; he said the director of the episode "milked" the fictional situation to make it seem more dramatic than a real fire. He also stated that in the months following there would be a lot of "tense moments" between the pair. Aden and Belle can acknowledge what they have found in each other - so "it would be hard to split them up".&lt;ref name=adelle/&gt; After the attack and fire, Belle refuses to leave the hospital, even with Aden supporting her, because it is the only place she "feels secure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|title=Crash horror!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=31 January – 6 February 2009|pages=10|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them. Tovey said she does not want Aden to know because of the "shame" and she doesn't want him to know she has failed. She further explained that "addicts withdraw from those around them - which is exactly what she is doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|title=Rock bottom!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=14–20 March 2009|pages=38|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Aden discovers the truth he ends their relationship. Following on with theme of those closest to him battling addiction, Lasance said it reminds Aden of his father's relationship with alcohol. Though Lasance previously said it "would take a lot" to break Belle and Aden up forever, he opined addiction might be the one thing that could.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbison|first=Jason|title=Aden dumps Belle!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=11–17 April 2009|pages=38|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Aden later gives Belle a second chance when she recovers. With this Lasance later reaffirmed his belief that "no matter what there is always a deep-rooted connection that can't be broken" between Aden and Belle. Belle is the first person Aden "trusted and fully gave his heart to after the abuse from his grandfather." Aden gives up the chance of attending university to stay with Belle and takes up a "job of convenience" working on the prawn trawler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Todd Lasance: Aden loves Belle|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/634440-todd-lasance-aden-loves-belle|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and Belle's death===
{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote="They say there's a fine line between love and hate, and don't these two know it!

Belle finds out Aden borrowed money from Clint to pay for her ring. Lasance said it is a "heart-felt moment" and a turning point in their stories, because Belle realises "how far he's willing to go for her". Belle asks Aden to marry her, Lasance explained that it is hard for Aden because "he is blown away" as he wants to marry Belle, but he has traditional values and thought that "the man" should have asked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chegwidden|first=Yvette|title=Aden bashed!|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=4–10 July 2009|pages=13|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Tovey announced that she had filmed her final scenes with ''Home and Away''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Darren|title=Tovey films final 'Home and Away' scenes|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a155505/tovey-films-final-home-and-away-scenes.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasance said he was sad but "fortunate" to work alongside Tovey. He credited their off-screen friendship as making Aden and Belle's dynamic develop successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Darren|title=Lasance sad at Tovey 'H&amp;A' departure|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a168013/lasance-sad-at-tovey-ha-departure.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks before filming her final scenes, Tovey asked Welsh how Belle would be written out. It was then she found out that Belle would die shortly after her wedding with Aden. Tovey said she was teary, but pleased with the way Belle would depart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Scott|title='Til death do us part|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SHD090726E558T98E1I0|work=[[The Sun-Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011|date=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tovey said that filming her exit scenes were more emotional. Her last scene with Lasance required her to portray Belle's death scene. She added "I had my eyes closed and he was holding me really tight", after the director cut the scene they pair could not separate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Darren|title=Tovey reveals "heartbreaking" final scenes|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s15/home-and-away/news/a171994/tovey-reveals-heartbreaking-final-scenes.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storyline played out on-screen when Belle discovers she has cancer. Aden only discovers the truth just before their wedding. Belle refuses treatment because her cancer is so advanced she does not want to "prolong her agony".&lt;ref name=wedding/&gt; Aden is "confused, devastated, and completely and utterly heartbroken". Lasance said Aden is "destroyed" and feels like he is also dying in the process, because Aden has never given himself to anyone - he feels Belle is a part of him. Tovey explained that Belle is worried about Aden's frame of mind on their wedding day. The scriptwriters played the scenes in a way that kept viewers unsure whether or not Aden would attend his wedding. While Belle "truly believes he will show up", Tovey explains the tone and mood of the wedding is unhappy. Aden marries Belle, and she dies a couple of weeks later.&lt;ref name=wedding&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|title=Belle and Aden's wedding off?|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=25–31 July 2009|pages=6, 7|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Nicole Franklin===
Aden's best friend during most of his duration was [[Nicole Franklin]] ([[Tessa James]]).&lt;ref name=bel/&gt; Nicole is the daughter to his surrogate father Roman Harris ([[Conrad Coleby]]). When Roman is blinded in a car accident, he takes his anger out on Aden and Nicole. Subsequently, they become "each other's support network" and Lasance said it was not long until they "slipped between the sheets".&lt;ref name=bel/&gt; One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this makes the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial because of the strong fan base for his relationship with Belle - which meant he knew it would "cause a stir" and divide the audience.&lt;ref name=bel&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aden sleeps with Nicole|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=2–8 May 2009|page=17|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January&amp;nbsp;2010, Nicole and Aden "get up close and personal" and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together.&lt;ref name="BayLove"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|date=9–15 January 2010|title=Welcome to the Bay of Love|journal=[[TV Week]]|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]|issue=2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the two share another kiss, James told ''[[TV Week]]'' that there are "a lot of complications" for them. She said that no one knew what was going to happen next and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend.&lt;ref name="BayLove"/&gt; James explained that the pairing with Aden was "a bit more serious and in-depth than Nicole's usual relationships."&lt;ref name="BayLove"/&gt; James opined that Aden was also the one of the "nicer guys" for Nicole.&lt;ref name="BayLove"/&gt; When the pair embarked on a relationship. James opined that Aden and Nicole were great together and explained, "they started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tessa James is at your mercy!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=22 March 2010|issue=12|pages=48, 49|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicole declared her love for Aden early on in their romance, so he did not reciprocate the gesture. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by ''TV Week'' stating: "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden."&lt;ref name=adenn/&gt; Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration though Aden realises she meant it.&lt;ref name=adenn&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nicole and Aden: Over Already?|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=6–12 February 2010|page=15|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Aden meets Cassie and flirts with her. He ensures that her previous relationship with [[Ric Dalby]] ([[Mark Furze]]) is definitely over, then asks Cassie out. Her acceptance makes Ric jealous, so during a game of rugby, he tackles Aden so hard that he is knocked unconscious and hospitalised. Aden's brother [[Sean Jefferies|Sean]] (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric in retaliation, and when Aden recovers, he gives Sean a false alibi. Cassie discovers the truth and breaks up with him. Aden next appears as a rival of Geoff's on the school football team. Annoyed that PE teacher [[Tony Holden (Home and Away)|Tony Holden]] ([[Jon Sivewright]]) favours Geoff, Aden spikes Geoff's drink and locks him in the boot of Tony's car. Tony throws Aden off the team, so Aden vandalises Geoff's grandfather's farm, and bullies Geoff and his younger sister [[Annie Campbell|Annie]] ([[Charlotte Best]]).

After a party Aden attends with his classmate [[Matilda Hunter]] ([[Indiana Evans]]), Cassie drives them home. She is under the influence of alcohol, and when Aden becomes high on marijuana and taunts her, she crashes. Aden sustains a leg injury that ends his chance of becoming a professional footballer. When Geoff refuses the chance to take up professional football, Aden intensifies his bullying of him. In return, Geoff punches Aden and knocks him out. Aden later helps an inebriated Annie, who has had her drink spiked.  Tony and Geoff presume that Aden was responsible as he was previously involved in similar prank with Tamsyn Armstrong ([[Gabrielle Scollay]]), and Annie lies to get Aden into trouble. The rest of the town believe he is to blame, so he seeks help from local lawyer Morag. Annie's guardian [[Irene Roberts]] ([[Lynne McGranger]]) hits Aden and injures his bad leg, which prompts him to file a claim against her. Annie admits that she lied, hoping that Aden will drop the lawsuit, but he refuses. He speaks to a journalist about Irene, which annoys Belle, Irene's lodger who is also a journalist. Belle writes an article of her own about Aden's war veteran grandfather, Stan, much to Aden's distress. He attacks Belle, sets fire to her article and cries.

[[Alf Stewart]] ([[Ray Meagher]]) tells Aden that he should behave in a manner his grandfather would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has [[HIV]], Aden becomes irate at the prospect that she may have infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, [[Rachel Armstrong]] ([[Amy Mathews]]), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with [[Angelo Rosetta]] ([[Luke Jacobz]]), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins to come to terms with his abuse.

Belle and Aden grow close again, and begin seeing one another in secret, as Belle is still dating Angelo. Aden's relationship with her deteriorates when Belle develops [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] after being attacked. She later refuses to leave hospital after being injured in a fire, and becomes addicted to the prescription medication that she takes for anxiety. Aden's feelings for Nicole are reignited, and they have sex several times before being caught together by Belle. Roman throws Aden out for sleeping with his daughter. Drug addict [[Liam Murphy]] ([[Axle Whitehead]]) deepens the rift between Aden and Belle, but they eventually reconcile and become engaged. In order to pay for a wedding ring, Aden takes a loan from corrupt bookmaker Clint, and loses several football matches on Clint's instruction. He refuses to ruin Geoff's career by injuring him, however, so Clint has Aden beaten up. Belle learns that she has terminal cancer and pushes the wedding forward, but does not tell Aden. He is devastated to learn of her condition the day before the ceremony, but is convinced to go ahead with the wedding by Roman. He and Belle spend four weeks together as husband and wife before she dies. Following her death, Aden becomes reclusive. He eventually returns to work, and is saved by Geoff when he almost drowns in an accident, which results in them becoming friends.

Several months after Belle's death, Aden and Nicole begin a relationship, which becomes strained when Nicole tells him that she loves him, but Aden does not return the sentiment. A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and they are able to get their romance back on track. Aden's brother [[Justin Jefferies|Justin]] ([[Matthew Walker (Australian actor)|Matthew Walker]]) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to admit that he too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car at the time of the accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.

==Reception==
Lasance was nominated in the category of "Best Bad Boy" at the 2008 [[Inside Soap Awards|''Inside Soap'' Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miles|first=Tina|title=Love at the 2008 Soap Award nominations|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2008/07/15/love-at-the-2008-soap-award-nominations-100252-21341848/2/|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=2 October 2011|date=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasance won the award for "Most Popular Actor" at the 2009 [[Logie Award]]s, for his portrayal of Aden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Darren|title=Ian Smith misses out on Gold Logie|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a154765/ian-smith-misses-out-on-gold-logie.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nominated in the same category at the 2010 ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Rebecca|title=In full: Logies 2010 - The Winners|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a217866/in-full-logies-2010-the-winners.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' said that Aden and Belle were "star-crossed lovers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soap stories|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0202977208|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That if "there's one thing guaranteed to ruin a wedding it's the news that the bride has got weeks to live." They opined that Aden was "blissfully unaware" for weeks and it "burst his bubble", which led them to question if he would actually turn up for the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soap stories|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0207253888|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later said they felt sympathy for Aden and Justin, because they have been "through an awful lot". They added Aden should feel "slightly relieved" when Charlie questions him about his car accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soap stories|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0225295088|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=25 September 2011|date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also adding that  they were "thankful" Aden was there to give Justin some "much needed support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Soap stories|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0224749685|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amy Edwards of ''The Newcastle Herald'' opined that Aden and Belle's wedding was a "tear-jerker of an episode". She added that losing Belle was a "sad loss for many fans" because Aden and Belle were a popular couple of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Amy|title=Todd turns on tears|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH090728B46FF60LSG6|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011|date=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Victoria Jack from the publication said Aden is the serial's "bad-boy-turned-good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jack|first=Victoria|title=Highlights|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=age&amp;kw=todd+lasance&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=NCH090129746TV4EA566|work=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=([[Fairfax Media]])|accessdate=17 October 2011|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''TV Week'' readers voted Aden as the character they were most concerned about in the aftermath of the formal explosion.&lt;ref name=melody&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Carolyn|title=Is it all over for Belle and Aden?|journal=[[TV Week]]|date=30 August – 5 September 2008|pages=5|publisher=[[ACP Magazines]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holy Soap]] said Aden's most memorable moment was "having a breakdown and threatening to kill his father while holding Belle and Rachel hostage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aden Jefferies played by Todd Lasance|url=http://holysoap.five.tv/cast/aden-jefferies-417|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=([[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]])|accessdate=21 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628101714/http://holysoap.five.tv/cast/aden-jefferies-417|archivedate=28 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Nami''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أحمد بن عبد الله النعمي, {{transl|ar|''Aḥmad bin ‘Abdullāh an-Nāmī''}}; also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alnami'''; August 17, 1977 – September 11, 2001)&lt;/span&gt; was one of four [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. 

Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], Nami had served as a [[muezzin]] and was a college student. He left his family in 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but later went to [[Afghanistan]] bound for an [[al-Qaeda]] training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.

He arrived in the [[United States]] in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in [[Florida]] up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, Nami boarded [[United Airlines Flight 93|United 93]] and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]].

==History==
Nami, much like [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], [[Wail al-Shehri]], [[Waleed al-Shehri]] and [[Mohand al-Shehri]], was born in the [['Asir Province]] in [[Saudi Arabia]].  Born to the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] tribe of [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name="willalOmari"&gt;Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others&lt;/ref&gt; Nami served as a [[muezzin]] at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he left his family home in [[Khamis Mushayt]] in the summer of 2000 to complete the [[Hajj]], but never returned – instead travelling to the [[Al Farouq training camp]] in [[Afghanistan]] where he met  and befriended [[Waleed al-Shehri|Waleed]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]], two brothers from Khamis Mushayt, and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. The four reportedly pledged themselves to [[Jihad]] in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail – who had dubbed himself ''Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi'' after one of [[Muhammad]]'s companions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boston Globe]], [http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml Driving a Wedge: Part I]&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed "Abu Hashim", Nami was considered "gentle in manner" by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a [[mare]] along with [[Muhammad]], and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.&lt;ref name="willalOmari"/&gt;

During his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]]'s details that Nami had recently had [[laser eye surgery]], an uncited fact that does not reappear. 

By October he had taken a prospective hijacker [[Mushabib al-Hamlan]] from [[Afghanistan]] to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 tourist/business visas on October 28 – but Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as ''student'' but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as [[Los Angeles]] – in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his [[passport]] (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to [[Afghanistan]]) as "lost", and procured a new one from [[Jeddah]] (C505363).  He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa.&lt;ref name="visa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Monograph.pdf |title=Staff Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |publisher=9/11 Commission |year=2004|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application.  Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.

In mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that Nami, [[Wail al-Shehri|Wail]] and [[Waleed al-Shehri]], all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to [[Beirut]] and then onward to [[Iran]] where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get "clean" passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.  

While in the [[United Arab Emirates]], Nami purchased [[traveler's cheque]]s presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Wail al-Shehri]].

===2001===
In March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an [[al-Qaeda]] farewell video showing 13 of the "muscle hijackers" before they left their training centre in [[Kandahar]]; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.

On April 23, Nami was recorded obtaining a new US visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/911/911Report-542.html |title=Page 542 |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, Nami arrived in the United States from [[Dubai]] with fellow-hijackers [[Mohand al-Shehri]] and [[Hamza al-Ghamdi]]. By early June, Nami was living in apartment 1504 at the Delray Racquet Club condominiums with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] in [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. He [[telephone]]d his family in 'Asir shortly after arriving in the country.

In June, he phoned his family for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A19549-2001Sep24&amp;notFound=true | work=The Washington Post | title=Some Light Shed On Saudi Suspects | first1=Caryle | last1=Murphy | first2=David B. | last2=Ottaway | date=September 25, 2001 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on June 29 received either a Florida State Identification Card or Drivers License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf |title=Chapter 2- Chronology |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He may have been one of three hijackers that listed the Naval Air Station in [[Pensacola, Florida]] as their permanent address on drivers' licenses, though other sources claim he listed the Delray condominium.

On August 28, Nami and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] reportedly bothered a [[Delray Beach]] resident, Maria Siscar Simpson, to let them through her apartment to retrieve a towel that had fallen off their balcony onto hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/01/911/Florida__terror_s_lau.shtml |title=911: Florida: terror's launching pad |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020905151317/http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/01/911/Florida__terror_s_lau.shtml |archivedate=September 5, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, Nami and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]] purchased tickets for a September 7 flight to [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]] at Mile High Travel on Commercial Boulevard—paying cash for their tickets. [[Ziad Jarrah]] and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] also purchased tickets for the same flight from Passage Tours.

On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from [[Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Newark International Airport]] aboard [[Spirit Airlines]].

==Attacks==
{{Main|United Airlines Flight 93}}

On September 11, 2001, Nami arrived in Newark to board [[United Airlines Flight 93]] along with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Ziad Jarrah]]. Some reports suggest Haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras at the time has compounded the problem. Nami boarded the plane between 7:39&amp;nbsp;am and 7:48&amp;nbsp;am; seated in First Class 3C, next to Saeed al-Ghamdi.

Due to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].  The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. The hijackers crashed the plane into the [[Pennsylvania]]n countryside rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.

==Aftermath==
After the attacks, an employee of [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] named Ahmed al-Nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.

==In popular culture==
He has been portrayed by British actor [[Jamie Harding]] in the 2006 film ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'' and Asim Wali in the film ''[[Flight 93 (2006 film)|Flight 93]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">'''Luis Alfonso Robelo Callejas''' (born October 11, 1939), a [[Nicaraguan]] [[businessman]], was the founder of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Movement]] (MDN).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ameringer | first = Charles D. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Political Parties of the Americas, 1980s to 1990s: Canada, Latin America... | publisher = Greenwood Press | year = 1992 | location = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-313-27418-5| page = 465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the "moderates" on the five-members [[Junta of National Reconstruction]] that the [[Sandinista]]s claimed would rule Nicaragua following the overthrow of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]]. However, Robelo found that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate.

After resigning from the Junta on April 22, 1981, Robelo went into exile in 1982. He brought his MDN into [[Edén Pastora]]'s rebel [[Democratic Revolutionary Alliance]]. Later, he split with Pastora, and joined the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO) with [[Arturo Cruz]], and [[Adolfo Calero]] of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]]. After UNO's collapse, he joined the directorate of the new [[Contras|Contra]] umbrella group, the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]].

During the political turmoil, Robelo's first marriage, to Indiana Cardenal Caldera, ended in divorce. They had four children: Indiana Margarita, Luis Alfonso (who died at a year and a half old), Eliza, and Alejandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.euram.com.ni/pverdes/entrevista/indiana_cardenal_caldera.htm |title=Indiana Cardenal Caldera |access-date=2008-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108013130/http://www.euram.com.ni/pverdes/entrevista/indiana_cardenal_caldera.htm |archive-date=2008-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarried a Costa Rican.

Following the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement|Esquipulas accord]], President [[Oscar Arias]] of Costa Rica announced in January 1988 that Contra leaders could no longer live in his country. With his pregnant wife opposing a move from Costa Rica, he resigned from the directorate in early February.

The post-Sandinista government of [[Violeta Chamorro]] appointed Robelo to be ambassador to Costa Rica. In 1993, he was taken hostage during a standoff at the embassy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Former member of the RN Directorate.  Politician, businessman.  Born in Leon on October 11, 1939.  Earned a degree in chemical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, N.Y.) in 1961.  Rector of the University of Central America 1970-1972 and President of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce until 1975.  He then headed the Nicaraguan Development Institute, long active in the development of independent agricultural and small business cooperatives.  Following the assassination of La Prensa editor [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal|Pedro Joaquin Chamorro]], Robelo cofounded the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, a social-democratic political party of businessmen, industrialists, and professionals opposed to the Somoza regime.  A leader and main spokesman for FAO working openly against the Somoza regime, he was arrested and publicly labeled a "subversive" by Somoza.  After the revolution Robelo was one of the five members of the original 1979 post-Somoza junta.  Resigned in April 1980 because of the Marxist tendencies in the FSLN-dominated government and the growing Cuban influence in the country.  Became President of the Democratic Coordinating Board.  Harassed by the FSLN after his resignation from the junta and detained by the Sandinistas when he sought to travel abroad in 1982, he was finally forced into exile later that year, and his property was confiscated.  In 1982, he joined with Edén Pastora and others in founding the ARDE, seeking to achieve the original democratic goals of the revolution.  Robelo was elected to the Nicaraguan Resistance Directorate in May 1987.  Resigned from the RN Directorate in January 1988.

'''Amedy Coulibaly''' ({{IPA-fr|amɛdi kulibali}}; 27 February 1982 – 9 January 2015) was a [[Malians in France|Malian-French]] man who was the prime suspect in the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Montrouge shooting]], in which [[Municipal Police (France)|municipal police]] officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed, and was the hostage-taker and gunman in the [[Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege]], in which he killed four hostages before being killed by police.

He was a close friend of [[Charlie Hebdo shooting#Ch.C3.A9rif and Sa.C3.AFd Kouachi|Saïd and Chérif Kouachi]], the gunmen in the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]], to which Coulibaly's shootings were connected.

==Shootings on 7–9 January 2015==

Coulibaly is said to be responsible for three shootings, and he said he synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt; In the shootings, five people were killed and eleven others were wounded.

The first shooting was of a jogger who was wounded on the evening of 7 January in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. Shell casings found at the scene were later linked to the weapon carried by Coulibaly in his kosher supermarket attack.&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;

The second shooting occurred in [[Montrouge]] on 8 January. Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed French policewoman, was killed, and a street sweeper was critically injured. DNA found at the scene was a match to Coulibaly.&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="davidgauthier-villarsinparis,asafitchindubaiandrajaabdulrahiminbeirut1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diondassanayake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/551314/Jewish-supermarket-siege-Paris-hero-hostage-tried-to-shot-Amedy-Coulibaly|title=Jewish supermarket siege: Heroic hostage executed after trying to turn weapon on gunman |author=Dion Dassanayake|work=Daily Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third shooting took place at [[Porte de Vincennes]], east Paris, on 9 January.

After [[Mali]] refused to accept Coulibaly's body for burial, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Muslim section of a cemetery in [[Thiais]].&lt;ref name="coloradonewsday.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/23/terrorist-buried-near-paris-after-mali-rejects-corpse/|title=Terrorist buried near Paris after Mali rejects corpse|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife, [[Hayat Boumeddiene]], is currently being sought by French police as a suspected accomplice of Coulibaly, alleged to have helped him commit his attacks. She arrived in Turkey five days before the attacks.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She has been described by newspapers as "France's most wanted woman". She was last tracked on 10 January 2015 to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]-controlled border town of [[Tell Abyad]] in Syria.

{{eastern name order|Hegedüs András}}

'''András Hegedüs''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈɒndraːʃ ˈhɛɡɛdyʃ}}; 31 October 1922 – 23 October 1999) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Communist politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Chairman of the Council of Ministers]] from 1955 to 1956. He fled to the Soviet Union on 28 October, the fifth day of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], but returned in 1958 and taught sociology.&lt;references/&gt;

==Early years==
Coming from a poor family, he finished high school in [[Sopron]] at the Evangelical Academy. Hegedüs first became involved in the underground communist movement during his university years when he studied railway engineering at [[Budapest]] Technical University in 1942. He was not able to finish his studies and was put under house arrest in the August 1944 for two years but managed to escape at the end of November. He became part of the interim government on 24 June 1945.

==1945–1990==
In 1947 he married Zsuzsanna Hölzel; they had six children. From 1948 onwards Hegedüs became involved with the [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] eventually taking on leading roles. From the early 1950s he took on numerous ministerial portfolios and served as Prime Minister from 18 April 1955 to 24 October 1956. Hegedüs was 32 years old at the time of his appointment, making him the youngest Prime Minister in Hungarian history.
[[File:HegedusAndras.jpg|thumb|left|András Hegedüs in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building|Parliament]] in summer 1956.]]
After signing the document asking Soviet troops for assistance during the revolution on 24 October, the government and people overwhelmingly supported him handing power to [[Imre Nagy]]. He became the most hated man in [[Hungary]] and was advised to flee by Soviet ambassador [[Yuri Andropov]] to the [[Soviet Union]] along with other Hungarian hardliners such as [[Ernő Gerő]]. In Moscow, he worked as part of the philosophy department at the Soviet Academy of Sciences between 1957 and 1958. In the November 1956 the interim committee of the Communist party shut him out of the party but by September 1958 he was able to return home.

From the late 1950s he held numerous academic posts and worked in various research institutes:
1958–61: Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) Economic Institute
1961–63: Central Statistics Institute
1963–68: Founded and led the HAS Sociology Research Institute
1966: [[Karl Marx]] Economics University
1968–73: Industry Studies

In 1968 he objected to the [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] during the [[Prague Spring]]. He was dismissed from his position at the Sociology Research Institute and later in 1973 was shut out of the Communist Party for his differing political and ideological views. He became a pensioner from 1975 to 1982 when he was allowed to teach at the Economics University.

==Post-communism==
Following the collapse of Communism in 1990, Hegedüs founded the Worker's Academy. He was often interviewed about the events of 1956 by local and foreign news teams, as he was one of the few survivors from the government of that time. He died on the anniversary of the start of the Hungarian revolution.

In [[Christianity]], the '''Antichrist''' ({{Lang-el|Ἀντίχριστος|translit=antichristos}}) is the antagonist of the [[Messiah]], specifically [[Christ (title)|the Christ]]. The [[Glossary of Christianity|term]] is found five times in the [[New Testament]], solely in the [[First Epistle of John|First]] and [[Second Epistle of John]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20John%202:18 BibleGateway.com: translations of 1 John 2:18]&lt;/ref&gt; (once in plural form&lt;ref name=blue&gt;{{cite web|title=KJV Search Results for Antichrists|publisher=The [[Blue Letter Bible]]|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/search/search.cfm?Criteria=antichrists&amp;t=KJV#s=s_primary_0_1|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four times in the singular).&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;

The first mention of the "antichrist" appears in the [[First Epistle of John]], where he is announced as the one "who denies the Father and the Son". Before announcing the [[Great Tribulation]], Jesus in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] ([[Matthew 24#Jesus predicts the destruction of the Temple|chapter 24]]) alerts his disciples not to be deceived by the [[False prophet#Christianity|false prophets]], which will claim themselves as being [[Christ (title)|Christ]], operating "great [[Sign#Christianity|signs]] and [[Miracle#Religious views|wonders]]".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 24:3-5, 24 (KJV)&lt;/ref&gt; One image of the antichrist, commonly understood to rise in power in the [[End time#Christianity|last days]] and often associated with the "little horn" in [[Daniel's final vision]], is found as the "[[man of sin]]" in [[Paul the Apostle]]'s [[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chrysostom|first1=John|title=Homily 4 on Second Thessalonians|url=http://newadvent.org/fathers/23054.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islamic eschatology]], [[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]] (المسيح الدجال) is an anti-messiah figure (similar to the Christian concept of an antichrist), who will appear to deceive humanity before the second coming of "[[Isa (name)|Isa]]", [[Jesus in Islam|as Jesus is known]] by Muslims.

The concept of an antichrist is absent in traditional [[Judaism]], although in some medieval texts the symbolic figure [[Armilus]] appears.

==Etymology==
The word "antichrist" combines two [[root (linguistics)|root]]s: [[wikt:αντι-#Greek|αντί]] (''anti'') + [[wikt:Χριστός|Χριστός]] (''Khristos''). "Αντί" can mean not only "against" and "opposite of", but also "in place of".&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0072%3Aentry%3Da%29nti%2F Lexicon to Pindar]. Related terms as noted by the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' include: antibasileus - a king who fills an [[interregnum]]; antistrategos - a [[propraetor]]; anthoupatos - a [[proconsul]]; antitheos - in [[Homer]], one resembling a god in power and beauty (in other works it stands for a hostile god).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian views==
{{Christian Eschatology}}

===New Testament===
Whether the New Testament contains an individual Antichrist is disputed. The Greek term ''antikhristos'' originates in 1 John.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Horbury]], ''Messianism Among Jews and Christians: Biblical and Historical Studies'' 2003 Page 333 "Against this background it can be seen that the technical Greek term ''antichristos'', although it is known only from Christian … ''Antichristos'' first occurs in the Johannine epistles, and it is not used by other Greek Jewish or early Christian writings ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The similar term ''pseudokhristos'' ("False Messiah") is also first found in the New Testament, and, for example, never used by [[Josephus]] in his accounts of various false messiahs.&lt;ref name=pseudochrist&gt;Ulrich Mauser (1992). ''The Gospel of Peace: A Scriptural Message for Today's World''. p. 70. "From Josephus's writings we collect, first of all, without much critical comment, some statements showing the close affinity of the … nowhere in his extensive accounts of the Jewish–Roman war uses the word "pseudo-Christ" (pseudochristos)."&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an ''antikhristos'' is not found in Jewish writings in the period 500 BC–50 AD. However, Bernard McGinn conjectures that the concept may have been generated by the frustration of Jews subject to often-capricious [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] or [[Roman Judaea|Roman rule]], who found the nebulous Jewish idea of a [[Satan]] who is more of an opposing angel of God in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]] insufficiently humanised and personalised to be a satisfactory incarnation of evil and threat.{{sfn|Cabinet|2001}}{{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}}

The five uses of the term "antichrist" or "antichrists" in the [[Johannine epistles]] do not clearly present a single latter-day individual Antichrist. The articles "the deceiver" or "the antichrist" are usually seen as marking out a certain category of persons, rather than an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Yarbrough ''1-3 John'' Page 344 2008 "The articles in front of "deceiver" (ὁ πλάνος, ''ho planos'') and "antichrist" (ὁ ἀντίχριστος, ''ho antikhristos'') should be seen as marking out a certain category of persons (Wallace 1996: 227–30). This is a common Johannine usage (1 John 2:23;  "&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour.|1 John 2:18 [[Douay-Rheims]]}}

{{quote|Many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh; any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist!|2 John 1:7 [[NRSV]] (1989)}}

{{quote|Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.|1 John 2:22 NRSV (1989)}}

Consequently, attention for an individual Antichrist figure focuses on the second chapter of [[2 Thessalonians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey A. D. Weima|Jeffrey Alan David Weima]], [[Stanley E. Porter]] Annotated Bibliography of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians - Page 263 1998 "(2) Does the New Testament support the notion of an individual Antichrist in whom all the anti-Christian strife of all ages will be concentrated? 2 Thess 2 answers the second question in the affirmative: an individual Antichrist will bring evil to its ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony A. Hoekema]] The Bible and the Future - Page 159 - 1979 "Whereas [[Berkouwer]] states, "There is no reason to posit with certainty on the basis of the New Testament that the antichrist ... 2. particularly his statements about the "restrainer," compel us to believe that there will be a future, individual antichrist."&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "antichrist" is never used in this passage:

{{quote|As to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we beg you, brothers and sisters, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as though from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here. Let no one deceive you in any way; for that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the lawless one is revealed, the one destined for destruction. He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God.|2 Thessalonians 2:1–4 NRSV (1989)}}

{{quote|For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who now restrains it is removed. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming.

Although the word "antichrist" (Greek ''antikhristos'') is used only in the Epistles of John, the similar word "pseudochrist" (Greek ''pseudokhristos'', meaning "false messiah") is used by Jesus in the [[Gospel]]s:&lt;ref name=pseudochrist/&gt;

{{quote|For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce great signs and omens, to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.|Matthew 24:24 and Mark 13:22 NRSV (1989)}}

===Early Church===
{{See also|Early Christianity}}
The only one of the late 1st/early 2nd century [[Apostolic Fathers]] to use the term is [[Polycarp]] (c. 69 – c. 155) who warned the [[Philippian]]s that everyone who preached false doctrine was an antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Polycarp's letter to the Philippians (Lightfoot translation)|Polycap's Letter to the Philippians]], paragraph 7&lt;/ref&gt; His use of the term Antichrist follows that of the New Testament in not identifying a single personal Antichrist, but a class of people.&lt;ref&gt;The Early Christians In Ephesus From Paul To Ignatius - Page 268 Paul Trebilco - 2004 "Finally, Hartog notes that the Johannine Letters are the only NT writings to use the term "antichrist" (1 Jn 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 Jn 7) and Polycarp is also the only Apostolic Father to use the term. He notes "Thus, the tests of 'density' and 'singularity' ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irenaeus]] (2nd century AD – c. 202) wrote ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]'' to refute the teachings of the [[Gnostic]]s. In Book V of ''Against Heresies'' he addresses the figure of the Antichrist referring to him as the "recapitulation of [[apostasy]] and rebellion." He uses "[[666 (number)#The Number of the Beast|666]]", the [[Number of the Beast]] from Revelation 13:18, to [[Numerology|numerologically]] decode several possible names. Some names that he loosely proposed were "Evanthos", "Lateinos" ("Latin" or pertaining to the [[Roman Empire]]). In his [[exegesis]] of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:21, he stated that the ten horns of the beast will be the Roman empire divided into ten kingdoms before the Antichrist's arrival. However, his readings of the Antichrist were more in broader theological terms rather than within a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Kevin L.|title=Constructing antichrist : Paul, biblical commentary, and the development of doctrine in the early Middle Ages|year=2005|publisher=[[Catholic University of America Press]]|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780813214153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ttvHhsEkXoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Irenaeus+antichrist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ShfdyBdG1&amp;sig=gsfge15eTm71Ua8v181Qp2Rr5ic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QBY7UNvSL-X5iwLxyYCIDg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Irenaeus%20antichrist&amp;f=false|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Testament apocrypha|non-canonical]] [[Ascension of Isaiah]] presents a detailed exposition of the Antichrist as [[Belial]] and [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Standard Bible Encyclopedia]]: A-D - Page 140 [[Geoffrey W. Bromiley]] - 1979 "The fullest exposition of the ideas associated with the antichrist in the early decades of Christian history is to be found in the Ascension of Isaiah. In this we are told that "Beliar" (Belial) would enter into "the matricide king" (Nero), who would work great wonders and do much evil."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] (c. 160 – c. 220 AD) held that the Roman Empire was the restraining force written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7–8. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and the disintegration of the ten provinces of the Roman Empire into ten kingdoms were to make way for the Antichrist.

{{quote|By, "For that day will not come unless the rebellion comes first," he [Paul] means indeed this present empire, "and the man of lawlessness is revealed"—that is to say, the Antichrist, "the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or religion, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, declaring himself to be God. Do you not remember that I told you these things when I was still with you? And you know what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed when his time comes. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but only until the one who now restrains it is removed." What obstacles are there but the Roman state, the rebellion of which, by being scattered into the ten kingdoms, will introduce the Antichrist upon its own ruins? "And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth, annihilating him by the manifestation of his coming. The coming of the lawless one is apparent in the working of Satan, who uses all power, signs, lying wonders, and every kind of wicked deception for those who are perishing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.viii.xxiv.html |title=On the Resurrection, chp 24 |publisher=Ccel.org |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100628020454/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.viii.xxiv.html| archivedate= 28 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c. 170 – c. 236) held that the Antichrist would come from the [[tribe of Dan]] and would [[Third Temple|rebuild the Jewish temple]] on the [[Temple Mount]] in order to reign from it. He identified the Antichrist with the Beast out of the Earth from the book of Revelation.

{{quote|By the beast, then, coming up out of the earth, he means the kingdom of Antichrist; and by the two horns he means him and the false prophet after him. And in speaking of "horns like a lamb," he means that he will make himself like the Son of God, and set himself forward as king. And the terms, "it spoke like a dragon," mean that he is a deceiver, and not truthful.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus's [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Extant Works and Fragments of Hippolytus/Dogmatical and Historical/Treatise on Christ and Antichrist|Treatise on Christ and Antichrist, part 2]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Origen]] (185–254) refuted [[Celsus]]'s view of the Antichrist. Origen utilized Scriptural citations from Daniel, Paul, and the Gospels. He argued:
{{quote|Where is the absurdity, then, in holding that there exist among men, so to speak, two extremes—the one of virtue, and the other of its opposite; so that the perfection of virtue dwells in the man who realizes the ideal given in Jesus, from whom there flowed to the human race so great a conversion, and healing, and amelioration, while the opposite extreme is in the man who embodies the notion of him that is named Antichrist?... one of these extremes, and the best of the two, should be styled the Son of God, on account of His pre-eminence; and the other, who is diametrically opposite, be termed the son of the wicked demon, and of Satan, and of the devil. And, in the next place, since evil is specially characterized by its diffusion, and attains its greatest height when it simulates the appearance of the good, for that reason are signs, and marvels, and lying miracles found to accompany evil, through the cooperation of its father the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Origen|1872|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Post-Nicene Christianity===
{{See also|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}

[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], in the mid-4th century, delivered his [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf207.ii.xix.html 15th] [[Cyril of Jerusalem#Catechetical lectures|Catechetical lecture]] about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, in which he also lectures about the Antichrist, who will reign as the ruler of the world for three and a half years, before he is killed by Jesus Christ right at the end of his three-and-a-half-year reign, shortly after which the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will happen.

[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] (c. 298–373)  wrote that [[Arius]] of Alexandria is to be associated with the Antichrist, saying, "And ever since [the Council of Nicaea] has Arius's error been reckoned for a heresy more than ordinary, being known as Christ's foe, and harbinger of Antichrist."&lt;ref&gt;from Athanasius' "[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/28161.htm Four Discourses]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Chrysostom]] (c. 347–407) warned against speculating about the Antichrist, saying, "Let us not therefore enquire into these things". He preached that by knowing Paul's description of the Antichrist in 2 Thessalonians, Christians would avoid deception.&lt;ref&gt;Chrysostom [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume XIII/On Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians/On 2 Thessalonians/Argument|Homily 1 on the 2nd Epistle of St. Paul the Apostle to the Thessalonians]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome]] (c. 347–420) warned that those substituting false interpretations for the actual meaning of Scripture belonged to the "synagogue of the Antichrist".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893b|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "He that is not of Christ is of Antichrist", he wrote to [[Pope Damasus I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that "the mystery of lawlessness" written about by Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 was already in action when "every one chatters about his views."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893c|p=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Jerome, the power restraining this mystery of lawlessness was the Roman Empire, but as it fell this restraining force was removed. He warned a noble woman of [[Gaul]]:

{{quote|He that letteth is taken out of the way, and yet we do not realize that Antichrist is near. Yes, Antichrist is near whom the Lord Jesus Christ "shall consume with the spirit of his mouth." "Woe unto them," he cries, "that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days."... Savage tribes in countless numbers have overrun all parts of Gaul. The whole country between the Alps and the Pyrenees, between the Rhine and the Ocean, has been laid waste by hordes of [[Quadi]], [[Vandals]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Alans]], [[Gepids]], [[Heruli|Herules]], [[Saxons]], [[Burgundians]], [[Alemanni]], and—alas for the commonweal!—even [[Pannonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1893d|pp=236–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his Commentary on Daniel, Jerome noted, "Let us not follow the opinion of some commentators and suppose him to be either the Devil or some demon, but rather, one of the human race, in whom Satan will wholly take up his residence in bodily form."&lt;ref name="Commentary on Daniel"&gt;{{harvnb|Jerome|1958|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of rebuilding the Jewish Temple to reign from, Jerome thought the Antichrist sat in God's Temple inasmuch as he made "himself out to be like God."&lt;ref name="Commentary on Daniel" /&gt; He refuted [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry's]] idea that the "little horn" mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 was [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] by noting that the "little horn" is defeated by an eternal, universal ruler, right before the final judgment.&lt;ref name="Commentary on Daniel" /&gt; Instead, he advocated that the "little horn" was the Antichrist:

{{quote|We should therefore concur with the traditional interpretation of all the commentators of the Christian Church, that at the end of the world, when the Roman Empire is to be destroyed, there shall be ten kings who will partition the Roman world amongst themselves. Then an insignificant eleventh king will arise, who will overcome three of the ten kings... after they have been slain, the seven other kings also will bow their necks to the victor.&lt;ref name="Commentary on Daniel" /&gt;}}

Circa 380, an apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy [[pseudepigraphy|falsely attributed]] to the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]] describes Constantine as victorious over [[Gog and Magog]]. Later on, it predicts:
{{quote|When the Roman empire shall have ceased, then the Antichrist will be openly revealed and will sit in the House of the Lord in Jerusalem.  While he is reigning, two very famous men, Elijah and Enoch, will go forth to announce the coming of the Lord. Antichrist will kill them and after three days they will be raised up by the Lord. Then there will be a great persecution, such as has not been before nor shall be thereafter. The Lord will shorten those days for the sake of the elect, and the Antichrist will be slain by the power of God through Michael the Archangel on the Mount of Olives.&lt;ref name="Sibyl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://http-server.carleton.ca/~jopp/3850/1-1.htm |title=Latin Tiburtine Sibyl |publisher=Http-server.carleton.ca |accessdate=2010-06-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702171945/http://http-server.carleton.ca/~jopp/3850/1-1.htm |archivedate=2 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Pope Gregory I]] wrote to the [[Maurice (emperor)|Byzantine Emperor Maurice]] in A.D. 597, concerning the titles of bishops, "I say with confidence that whoever calls or desires to call himself 'universal priest' in self-exaltation of himself is a precursor of the Antichrist."&lt;ref&gt;quote from McGinn, Bernard, Visions of the End.

By the end of the tenth century, [[Adso of Montier-en-Der]], a Benedictine monk, compiled a biography of Antichrist based on a variety of exegetical and Sibylline sources; his account became one of the best-known descriptions of Antichrist in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard Kenneth|last=Emmerson|title=Antichrist in the Middle Ages|publisher=U of Washington P|location=Seattle|year=1981|chapter=The Life and Deeds of Antichrist|pages=74-107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emmerson&gt;{{cite journal|title=Antichrist as Anti-Saint: The Significance of Abbot Adso's ''Libellus de Antichristo''|first=Richard Kenneth|last=Emerson|journal=[[American Benedictine Review]]|pages=175–90|year=1979|volume=30|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arnulf (archbishop of Reims)|Arnulf, archbishop of Reims]] disagreed with the policies and morals of [[Pope John XV]]. He expressed his views while presiding over the [[Council of Reims#Council of Reims, 991|Council of Reims in A.D. 991]]. Arnulf accused John XV of being the Antichrist while also using the [[2 Thessalonians 2|2 Thessalonians passage]] about the "[[Man of Sin|man of lawlessness]]" (or "lawless one"), saying: "Surely, if he is empty of charity and filled with vain knowledge and lifted up, he is Antichrist sitting in God's temple and showing himself as God." This incident is history's earliest record of anyone identifying a pope with the Antichrist (see [[Historicism (Christianity)|Christian Historicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn (2000), ''Anti-Christ: Two Thousand Years of the Human Fascination With Evil'', [[New York City|New York]]: [[Columbia University Press]], p. 100. and {{harvnb|Schaff|Schley Schaff|1885|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory VII]] (c. 1015 or 1029 – 1085), struggled against, in his own words, "a robber of temples, a perjurer against the Holy Roman Church, notorious throughout the whole Roman world for the basest of crimes, namely, [[Antipope Clement III|Wilbert]], plunderer of the holy church of [[Ravenna]], Antichrist, and arch-[[Heresy in Christianity|heretic]]."&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=EgRbpkgRSZAC&amp;pg=PA162 The Correspondence of Pope Gregory VII] trans. [[Ephraim Emerton]]. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990., p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal [[Beno of Santi Martino e Silvestro|Benno]], on the opposite side of the [[Investiture Controversy]], wrote long descriptions of abuses committed by Gregory VII, including [[necromancy]], torture of a former friend upon a bed of nails, commissioning an attempted assassination, executions without trials, unjust [[excommunication]], doubting the [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]], and even burning it.&lt;ref&gt;From long quotations in {{harvnb|Foxe|1583|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benno held that Gregory VII was "either a member of Antichrist, or Antichrist himself."&lt;ref&gt;quoted by David M.

Eberhard II von Truchsees, [[Archbishopric of Salzburg#Prince-Archbishopric|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]] in 1241, denounced [[Pope Gregory IX]] at the Council of [[Regensburg]] as "that man of perdition, whom they call Antichrist, who in his extravagant boasting says, I am God, I cannot err."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YTAuAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA305,M1 The Methodist Review Vol. XLIII], No. 3, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the ten kingdoms that the Antichrist is involved with&lt;ref&gt;See Daniel {{bibleverse-nb||Daniel|7:23-25|31}}, Revelation {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|13:1-2|31}}, and Revelation {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|17:3-18|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the "Turks, Greeks, Egyptians, Africans, Spaniards, French, English, Germans, Sicilians, and Italians who now occupy the provinces of Rome."&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of the Bible"&gt;Article on "Antichrist" from Smith and Fuller, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zM0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA147,M1 A Dictionary of the Bible], 1893, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; He held that the papacy was the "little horn" of Daniel 7:8:&lt;ref&gt;Daniel {{bibleverse-nb||Daniel|7:8|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"A little horn has grown up" with "eyes and mouth speaking great things", which is reducing three of these kingdoms (i.e. Sicily, Italy, and Germany) to subserviency, is persecuting the people of Christ and the saints of God with intolerable opposition, is confounding things human and divine, and is attempting things unutterable, execrable.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of the Bible" /&gt;}}

[[Protestant Reformers]], including [[John Wycliffe]], [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[John Thomas (Christadelphian)|John Thomas]], [[John Knox]], [[Roger Williams]], [[Cotton Mather]], and [[John Wesley]], as well as most [[Protestants]] of the 16th-18th centuries, felt that the [[Early Christianity|Early Church]] had been led into the [[Great Apostasy]] by the [[Papacy]] and identified the [[Pope as Antichrist|Pope with the Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="Johnstone"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnstone |first1=Nathan |date=June 2009 |title=The Devil and Demonism in Early Modern England |chapter=The synagogue of Satan: anti-Catholicism, false doctrine and the construction of contrariety |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=[[Cambridge]] |pages=27–59 |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511495847.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Joseph A.

So, rather than expecting a single Antichrist to rule the earth during a future [[Great Tribulation|Tribulation]] period, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers saw the Antichrist as a present feature in the world of their time, fulfilled in the Papacy.&lt;ref name="Johnstone"/&gt;{{Sfn |Froom|1948| pp= 244–45 | ps =: "The reformers were unanimous in its acceptance. And it was this interpretation of prophecy that lent emphasis to their reformatory action. It led them to protest against Rome with extraordinary strength and undaunted courage. [...] This was the rallying point and the battle cry that made the Reformation unconquerable."}}

Among the others who interpreted the Biblical prophecy historistically there were many [[Church Fathers]]; [[Justin Martyr]] wrote about the Antichrist: "He Whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time and times and an half, is even now at the door".&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogue with Trypho'', ch. 32, in Ante-Nic. Fath. I:210.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] wrote in ''[[Against Heresies]]'' about the coming of the Antichrist: "This Antichrist shall ... devastate all things ... But then, the Lord will come from Heaven on the clouds ... for the righteous".&lt;ref&gt;''Against Heresies'', III: 7:2, in Ante-Nic. Fath. Ib., V:30:3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] looking to the Antichrist wrote: "He is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being god. In our view, he is Antichrist as taught us in both the ancient and the new prophecies; and especially by the [[Apostle John]], who says that 'already many false-prophets are gone out into the world' as the fore-runners of Antichrist".&lt;ref&gt;''Against Marcion'', V:16, in Ante-Nic. Fath. III:463f.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''Treatise on Christ and Antichrist'' wrote: "As Daniel also says (in the words) 'I considered the Beast, and look! There were ten horns behind it – among which shall rise another (horn), an offshoot, and shall pluck up by the roots the three (that were) before it.' And under this, was signified none other than Antichrist."&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on Christ and Antichrist'', chs. 25 to 63, in Ante-Nic. Fath. V:209-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fragments from Commentaries'', 2:1-3, in Ante-Nic. Fath. V:178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] clearly hold to the historical view in his many writings; in ''The Deposition of Arius'', he wrote: "I addressed the letter to Arius and his fellows, exhorting them to renounce his impiety.... There have gone forth in this diocese at this time certain lawless men – enemies of Christ – teaching an apostasy which one may justly suspect and designate as a forerunner of Antichrist".&lt;ref&gt;''The Deposition of Arius'', paras. 2 &amp; 4, in Nic. &amp; Post-Nic. Fath., 2nd Ser., IV:69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] wrote: "Says the apostle [Paul in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians], 'Unless the [[Roman Empire]] should first be desolated, and antichrist proceed, Christ will not come.'"{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He also identifies the [[Daniel 7|Little horn]] of {{Bibleverse||Daniel|7:8|ESV}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Daniel|7:24–25|ESV}} which "shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law" as the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Adam. ''Commentary on the Old Testament'', Vol. IV, p. 596.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Franciscan]]s had considered the Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] a positive Antichrist who would purify the Catholic Church from opulence, riches and clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches| first = Marvin | last = Harris | author-link = Marvin Harris | page =196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the debated features of the Reformation's Historicist interpretations reached beyond the Book of Revelation. They included the identification of:
* the Antichrist ([[First Epistle of John|1]] and [[Second Epistle of John|2 John]]);
* the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]] of [[Revelation 13]]; 
* the [[Man of Sin]], or Man of Lawlessness, of [[2 Thessalonians 2]] ({{Bibleverse-nb||2 Thessalonians|2:1-12|ESV}}); 
* the "Little horn" of [[Daniel 7]] and [[Daniel 8|8]];
* The [[Abomination of desolation]] of [[Daniel 9]], [[Daniel 11|11]], and [[Daniel 12|12]]; and
* the [[Whore of Babylon]] of [[Revelation 17]].

The Protestant Reformers tended to hold the belief that the Antichrist power would be revealed so that everyone would comprehend and recognize that the Pope is the real, true Antichrist and not the vicar of Christ. Doctrinal works of literature published by the [[Lutherans]], the [[Reformed Churches]], the [[Presbyterians]], the [[Baptists]], the [[Anabaptists]], and the [[Methodists]] contain references to the Pope as the Antichrist, including the [[Smalcald Articles]], Article 4 (1537),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/smalcald.html#article4|title=Smalcald Articles - Book of Concord|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]]'' written by [[Philip Melanchthon]] (1537),&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Melanchthon]], ''[[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]]'' ([http://www.bookofconcord.com/treatise.html full text]) in the Triglot translation of the [[Book of Concord]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Westminster Confession]], Article 25.6 (1646), and the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith]], Article 26.4. In 1754, [[John Wesley]] published his ''[[Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament]]'', which is currently an official Doctrinal Standard of the [[United Methodist Church]]. In his notes on the [[Book of Revelation]] (chapter 13), he commented: "The whole succession of Popes from [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] are undoubtedly Antichrists. Yet this hinders not, but that the last Pope in this succession will be more eminently the Antichrist, the Man of Sin, adding to that of his predecessors a peculiar degree of wickedness from the bottomless pit."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070202121310/http://archives.umc.org/interior.asp?mid=1648 Archived copy] at the [[Library of Congress]] (May 8, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.umc.org/frames.asp?url=http://www.livingweb.com/library/projects/notes/index.html|title=UMC.org : the official online ministry of The United Methodist Church|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In calling the pope the "Antichrist", the early [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] stood in a [[Antichrist#Pre-Reformation Western Church accusers|tradition that reached back into the eleventh century]]. Not only dissidents and [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]] but even saints had called the bishop of Rome the "Antichrist" when they wished to castigate his [[abuse of power]]. What Lutherans understood as a [[Papal supremacy|papal claim to unlimited authority]] [[Temporal power (papal)|over everything and everyone]] reminded them of the [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic imagery]] of [[Daniel 11]], a passage that even prior to the Reformation had been applied to the pope as the Antichrist of the [[End time#Christianity|last days]].&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;}}

The identification of the Pope with the Antichrist was so ingrained in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Era]], that Luther himself stated it repeatedly:

{{quote|"This teaching [of the supremacy of the pope] shows forcefully that the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ, because he will not permit Christians to be saved without his power, which, nevertheless, is nothing, and is neither ordained nor commanded by God".&lt;ref&gt;Smalcald Articles, II.&lt;/ref&gt;}} and,

{{quote|"nothing else than the [[Whore of Babylon|kingdom of Babylon]] and of the very Antichrist. For who is the man of sin and the son of perdition, but he who by his teaching and his ordinances increases the sin and perdition of souls in the church; while he yet sits in the church as if he were God? All these conditions have now for many ages been fulfilled by the papal tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther, ''First Principles'', pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Calvin]] similarly wrote:

{{quote|"Though it be admitted that Rome was once the mother of all Churches, yet from the time when it began to be the seat of Antichrist it has ceased to be what it was before. Some persons think us too severe and censorious when we call the Roman Pontiff Antichrist. But those who are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the same charge of presumption against Paul himself, after whom we speak and whose language we adopt ... I shall briefly show that (Paul's words in II Thess. 2) are not capable of any other interpretation than that which applies them to the Papacy."&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', Vol. 3, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Knox]] wrote on the Pope:

{{quote|"Yea, to speak it in plain words; lest that we submit ourselves to Satan, thinking that we submit ourselves to Jesus Christ, for, as for your Roman kirk, as it is now corrupted, and the authority thereof, whereon stands the hope of your victory, I no more doubt but that it is the synagogue of [[Satan]], and the head thereof, called the pope, to be that man of sin, of whom the apostle speaks."&lt;ref&gt;John Knox, ''[[The History of the Reformation in Scotland]]'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas Cranmer]] on the Antichrist wrote:

{{quote|"Whereof it followeth Rome to be the seat of Antichrist, and the pope to be very antichrist himself. I could prove the same by many other scriptures, old writers, and strong reasons."&lt;ref&gt;''Works by Cranmer'', Vol. 1, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Wesley]], speaking of the identity given in the Bible of the Antichrist, wrote:

{{quote|"In many respects, the Pope has an indisputable claim to those titles. He is, in an emphatical sense, the man of sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure. And he is, too, properly styled, the son of perdition, as he has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers, destroyed innumerable souls, and will himself perish everlastingly. He it is that opposeth himself to the emperor, once his rightful sovereign; and that exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped – Commanding angels, and putting kings under his feet, both of whom are called gods in scripture; claiming the highest power, the highest honour; suffering himself, not once only, to be styled God or vice-God. Indeed no less is implied in his ordinary title, "Most Holy Lord," or, "Most Holy Father." So that he sitteth – Enthroned. In the temple of God – Mentioned Rev. xi, 1. Declaring himself that he is God – Claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone."&lt;ref&gt;John Wesley, ''[[Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament]]'', p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Roger Williams]] wrote about the Pope:

{{quote|"the pretended [[Vicar of Christ]] on earth, who sits as God over the Temple of God, exalting himself not only above all that is called God, but over the souls and consciences of all his vassals, yea over the Spirit of Christ, over the Holy Spirit, yea, and God himself ... speaking against the God of heaven, thinking to change times and laws; but he is the Son of Perdition."&lt;ref&gt;Froom, ''The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers'', Vol. 3, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The identification of the Roman Catholic Church as the apostate power written of in the Bible as the Antichrist became evident to many as the Reformation began, including [[John Wycliffe]], who was well-known throughout Europe for his opposition to the [[Catholic theology|doctrine and practices of the Catholic Church]], which he believed had clearly deviated from the original teachings of the early Church and to be contrary to the Bible. Wycliffe himself tells (''Sermones'', III. 199) how he concluded that there was a great contrast between what the Church was and what it ought to be, and saw the necessity for reform. Along with John Hus, they had started the inclination toward ecclesiastical reforms of the Catholic Church.

When the [[Swiss Reformation|Swiss Reformer]] [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the pastor of the [[Grossmünster]] in [[Zurich]] (1518) he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church.  Zwingli, who was a Catholic priest before he became a Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the Antichrist. He wrote: "I know that in it works the might and power of the Devil, that is, of the Antichrist".&lt;ref&gt;''Principle Works of Zwingli'', Vol. 7, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Reformation|English Reformer]] [[William Tyndale]] held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise ''The Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.&lt;ref&gt;Tyndale, William, ''Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008) at pages 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the "Man of Lawlessness" reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,&lt;ref&gt;"Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2", R. Davis, [[Matthew Bible#Literature|New Matthew Bible Project]]; a shorter version of this article was also published in the Tyndale Society Journal No. 36, Spring 2009, under the title ''Tyndale, the Church, and the Doctrine of Antichrist'').&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Authorized King James Version#Committees|King James Bible committee]], which followed the [[Vulgate]] more closely.

In 1870, the newly formed [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the remaining [[Papal States]], depriving the Pope of his [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]]. However, the Papal rule over Italy was later [[Lateran Treaty|restored]] by the [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922–1943)#Roman Catholic Church|Italian Fascist regime]]&lt;ref name="Feinstein"&gt;{{Cquote|In the period following the signing of the 1929 Lateran Pact, which declared Catholicism as Italy's state religion in the context of a comprehensive regulation of Vatican and Italian government relations, Catholic cultural support for Mussolini is consolidated.|author=Wiley Feinstein|source=''The Civilization of the Holocaust in Italy: Poets, Artists, Saints, Anti-semites'' (2003), p. 19, [[London]]: [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]], {{ISBN|0-8386-3988-7}}.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the [[Vatican City]] state;&lt;ref name="Feinstein"/&gt; under [[Mussolini]]'s [[dictatorship]], Roman Catholicism became the [[State religion]] of Fascist Italy&lt;ref name="Feinstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kertzer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kertzer |first=David I. |date=2014 |title=[[The Pope and Mussolini: The Secret History of Pius XI and the Rise of Fascism in Europe]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=[[Random House]] |pp=196–198 |isbn=978-0-8129-9346-2 |author-link=David I.

{{quote|There are two principles that mark the papacy as the Antichrist. One is that [[Papal supremacy|the pope takes to himself the right to rule the church]] that belongs only to [[Christ]]. He can make laws forbidding the marriage of priests, eating or not eating meat on Friday, birth control, divorce and remarriage, even where there are not such laws in the Bible. The second is that he teaches that salvation is not by faith alone but by faith and works. The present pope upholds and practices these principles. This marks his rule as [[Anti-Christian|antichristian rule]] in the church. All popes hold the same office over the church and promote the same antichristian belief so they all are part of the reign of the Antichrist. The Bible does not present the Antichrist as one man for one short time, but as an office held by a man through successive generations. It is a title like King of England.&lt;ref name=WELS-CL&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=19&amp;cuItem_itemID=4242 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title=Roman Catholic |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=5 July 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927213220/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=19&amp;cuItem_itemID=4242 |archivedate=27 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Counter-Reformation]],  Preterism and [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurism]], was advanced by Catholic Jesuits beginning in the 16th century in response to the identification of the Papacy as Antichrist. These were rival methods of prophetic interpretation: the futurist and the preterist systems both of which are in conflict with the historicist method and the interpretations derived thereby.

Historically, preterists and non-preterists have generally agreed that the Jesuit [[Luis del Alcázar|Luis de Alcasar]]  (1554–1613) wrote the first systematic preterist exposition of prophecy—''Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi'' (published in 1614)—during the [[Counter-Reformation]].

Preterism interprets the [[Book of Daniel]] as referring to events of the past, that happened in the 2nd century BC, while seeing the prophecies in the [[Book of Revelation]] as events that happened in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century AD]]. Preterism holds that [[Ancient Israel]] finds its [[Supersessionism|continuation or fulfillment]] in the [[Christian church]] at the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70]].
 
The view of [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|Futurism]], that the events happen in the end time, was advanced by [[Francisco Ribera]], a [[Jesuit]] priest, who developed this theory in ''In Sacrum Beati Ioannis Apostoli, &amp; Evangelistiae Apocalypsin Commentarij'', his 1585 treatise on the Book of Revelation. Saint [[Robert Bellarmine]] codified this view, giving in full the Catholic theory set forth by the Greek and Latin Fathers, of a personal Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be accepted by the [[Jew]]s and enthroned in the temple at [[Jerusalem]] — thus endeavoring to dispose of the exposition which saw Antichrist in the pope. Most premillennial [[dispensationalism|dispensationalists]] now accept Bellarmine's interpretation in modified form.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Widespread Protestant identification of the Papacy as the Antichrist persisted in the USA until the early 1900s when the [[Scofield Reference Bible]] was published by [[Cyrus Scofield]]. This commentary promoted Futurism, causing a decline in the Protestant identification of the Papacy as Antichrist.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states:

{{quote|675 Before Christ's second coming the Church must pass through a final trial that will shake the faith of many believers. The persecution that accompanies her pilgrimage on earth will unveil the "mystery of iniquity" in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth. The supreme religious deception is that of the Antichrist, a pseudo-messianism by which man glorifies himself in place of God and of his Messiah come in the flesh.

676 The Antichrist's deception already begins to take shape in the world every time the claim is made to realize within history that messianic hope which can only be realized beyond history through the eschatological judgment. The Church has rejected even modified forms of this falsification of the kingdom to come under the name of millenarianism, especially the "intrinsically perverse" political form of a secular messianism.}}

===Old Believers===
After [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] reformed the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the second half of the 17th century, a large number of [[Old Believers]] held that [[Peter the Great]], the [[Tsar]] of the [[Russian Empire]] until his death in 1725, was the Antichrist because of his treatment of the Orthodox Church, namely subordinating the church to the state, requiring clergymen to conform to the standards of all Russian civilians (shaved beards, being fluent in French), and requiring them to pay state taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/pe/Peter1-Rus.html|title=Peter I, czar of Russia|publisher=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2008-02-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080212044338/http://www.bartleby.com/65/pe/Peter1-Rus.html| archivedate= 12 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===
Bernard McGinn noted that complete denial of the Antichrist was rare until the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Following frequent use of "Antichrist" laden rhetoric during religious controversies in the 17th century, the use of the concept declined{{explain|date=June 2018|reason=How come?}} in the 18th century. Subsequent eighteenth-century efforts{{explain|date=June 2018|reason=Efforts of whom and why?}} to cleanse Christianity of "legendary" or "folk" accretions effectively removed the Antichrist from discussion in mainstream Western churches.{{sfn|Cabinet|2001}}

===Mormonism===
In [[Mormonism]], the "Antichrist" is anyone or anything that counterfeits the true gospel or [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] and that openly or secretly is set up in opposition to Christ. The great antichrist is [[Lucifer]], but he has many assistants&lt;ref&gt;[[Korihor]] is directly referred to in ''The Book of Mormon'' as an anti-Christ ([[Book of Alma|Alma]] 30:6)&lt;/ref&gt; both as spirit beings and as mortals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LDS|first=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|title=Bible Dictionary: Antichrist|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/antichrist?lang=eng|publisher=[[Intellectual Reserve]], Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latter-day Saint]]s use the New Testament scriptures, 1 John 2:18, 22; 1 John 4:3–6; 2 John 1:7 and the [[Book of Mormon]], [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]] 7:1–23, [[Book of Alma|Alma]] 1:2–16, Alma 30:6–60, in their [[exegesis]] or interpretation of the Antichrist.

===Seventh-day Adventists===
[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] teach that the "Little Horn Power", which (as predicted in the Book of Daniel) rose after the break-up of the Roman Empire, is the [[Papacy]]. In 533, [[Justinian I]], the emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (sometimes referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire), legally recognized the bishop (pope) of Rome as the head of all the Christian churches.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the [[Arianism|Arian]] domination of some of the Roman Empire by barbarian tribes, the bishop of Rome could not fully exercise such authority. In 538, [[Belisarius]], one of Justinian's generals, [[Siege of Rome (537–38)|freed the city of Rome]] from its Arian barbarian [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] besiegers and the bishop of Rome could begin establishing universal civil authority. So, by the military intervention of the Eastern Roman Empire, the bishop of Rome became all-powerful throughout the area of the old Roman Empire.

Like many [[Reformation Era|reformation-era]] Protestant leaders, the Adventist pioneer [[Ellen G. White]] (1827–1915) spoke of the [[Catholic Church]] as a fallen church in preparation for its nefarious eschatological role as the antagonist against God's true church and saw the pope as the Antichrist.  Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther, John Knox, William Tyndale and others held similar beliefs about the Catholic Church and the papacy when they broke away from the Catholic Church during the reformation.&lt;ref name="whitehorsemedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44|title=Articles - White Horse Media|work=White Horse Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellen White writes,

:His word has given warning of the impending danger; let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to escape the snare. She is silently growing into power. Her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls, in the churches, and in the hearts of men. She is piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated. Stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further her own ends when the time shall come for her to strike. All that she desires is vantage ground, and this is already being given her. We shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the Roman element is. Whoever shall believe and obey the word of God will thereby incur reproach and persecution.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book

Seventh-day Adventists view the length of time the apostate church's unbridled power was permitted to rule as shown in Daniel 7:25: "The little horn would rule a time and times and half a time" or 1,260 years. They regard papal rule as supreme in Europe from 538 (when the Arian Ostrogoths retreated from Rome into temporary oblivion) until 1798 (when the French general [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] took [[Pope Pius VI]] captive)—a period of 1,260 years.

===Other Christian interpretations===

===Martin Wight===
Devout Christian and political theorist [[Martin Wight]], writing immediately after World War Two, favoured the revival of the Antichrist doctrine; not as a person, but as a recurrent situation featuring 'demonic concentrations of power'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hall, The international thought of Martin Wight, palgrave Mcmillan, 2006, p37&lt;/ref&gt;

====As "man of lawlessness"====
{{main|Man of sin}}
The Antichrist has been equated with the "man of lawlessness" or "lawless one" of 2 Thessalonians 2:3, though commentaries on the identity of the "man of lawlessness" greatly vary.&lt;ref&gt;Schink, W.F. "The Scriptural Doctrine of the Antichrist." ''Our Great Heritage: Vol. 3'' Ed. Lange, Lyle and Albrecht, Jerome G. Milwaukee: [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod#Publishing|Northwestern Publishing House]], 1991. p. 572.&lt;/ref&gt; The "man of lawlessness" has been identified with [[Caligula]],&lt;ref name="netbible"/&gt; Nero,&lt;ref&gt;St. John Chrysostom, Homilies on II Thess., Nicene-Post Nicene Fathers&lt;/ref&gt; and the end times Antichrist. Some scholars believe that the passage contains no genuine prediction, but represents a speculation of the apostle's own, based on contemporary ideas of the Antichrist.&lt;ref name="netbible"&gt;[http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=MAN%20OF%20SIN Net Bible: Man of sin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707075356/http://net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=MAN%20OF%20SIN |date=July 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As "being in league with other figures"====
Several American [[evangelical]] and [[fundamentalist]] theologians, including Cyrus Scofield, have identified the Antichrist as being in league with (or the same as) several figures in the Book of Revelation including the Dragon (or [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]), the Beast, the False Prophet, and the [[Whore of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;See footnotes in [http://www.studylight.org/com/srn/view.cgi?book=re Revelation 7 and 13] in the ''Scofield Reference Bible'', 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  Voices in the [[Emerging Church]], such as [[Rob Bell]], reject the identification of the Antichrist with any one person or group. They believe a loving Christ would not view anyone as an enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Rob; Golden, Don ''Jesus Wants to Save Christians'' 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====As Satan====
Bernard McGinn described multiple traditions detailing the relationship between the Antichrist and [[Satan#Christianity|Satan]]. In the dualist approach, Satan will become incarnate in the Antichrist, just as [[Incarnation (Christianity)|God became incarnate in Jesus]]. However, in [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] thought, this view was problematic because it was too similar to Christ's incarnation. Instead, the "indwelling" view became more accepted. It stipulates that the Antichrist is a human figure inhabited by Satan, since the latter's power is not to be seen as equivalent to God's.{{sfn|Cabinet|2001}}

==Non-Christian views==
{{Eschatology}}

===Judaism===
There are warnings against [[false prophet]]s in the [[Hebrew Bible]], but no personal anti-Messiah figure.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Lorein (2003). ''The Antichrist Theme in the Intertestamental Period''. p. 31. "Deuteronomy 13:1–6.... The functional equation of the religious aspect of the Beast, of the False Prophet and of the Antichrist in the book of Revelation is already being prepared here. There are also remarkable links with the Antichrist passage in the First Epistle of John.172 b."&lt;/ref&gt;

A parodic anti-Messiah type figure known as [[Armilus]], said to be the offspring of Satan and a [[Miraculous births#Christianity|virgin]], appears in some non-legalistic, philosophical schools of [[Jewish eschatology]], such as the 7th century CE [[Sefer Zerubbabel]] and 11th century CE [[Midrash Vayosha]] (also: "''Midrash wa-Yosha''"). He is described as "a monstrosity, bald-headed, with one large and one small eye, deaf in the right ear and maimed in the right arm, while the left arm is two and one-half ells long." Being [[Gog and Magog|Gog]]'s successor, his inevitable destruction by a "[[Messiah ben Joseph]]" (Messiah, son of Joseph (son of Jacob)), symbolizes the ultimate victory of good over evil in the [[Messianic Age]].&lt;ref name="armilus"&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1789&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Armilus Jewish Encyclopedia: Armilus]:&lt;/ref&gt; This is confronted with the medieval Christian Antichrist and Islamic [[Masih ad-Dajjal|Dajjal]], who will conquer Jerusalem and persecute the Jews.

===Islam===
''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' ({{lang-ar|الدّجّال}}, literally "The Deceiving Messiah"), is an evil figure in [[Islamic eschatology]]. Although not mentioned in the Quran the details of his coming and life is explicitly mentioned in the authentic [[hadith]] hence [[Muslims]] believe he is to appear pretending to be the Messiah then God at a time in the future, before "Yawm al-Qiyamah" (The Day of Resurrection, Judgement Day). He will travel around the globe entering every city except [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Mount Sinai]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Then Isa (Jesus) will descend from the sky to the white minaret (commonly held as being in the [[Umayyad Mosque]]) east of Damascus (as referred to in ''[[hadith]]''), placing his hands on the backs of two angels, at the time of the [[Fajr prayer|Fajr (dawn) prayer]]. This will happen at the time of the Dajjal and Isa (Jesus) will be the one to eventually defeat the Dajjal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|41|7023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ahmadiyya====
''See also'': [[Dajjal#Ahmadiyya|''Dajjal in Ahmadiyya Islam'']]

Prophecies concerning the emergence of the Antichrist (''Al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl'') are interpreted in [[Ahmadiyya]] teachings as designating a specific group of nations centred upon falsehood instead of an individual, with the reference to the Antichrist as an individual indicating its unity as a class or system rather than its personal individuality. As such, Ahmadi Muslims identify the Antichrist collectively with the missionary expansion and colonial dominance of [[European Christianity]] throughout the world that was propelled by the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|last2=Smith|first2=Huston|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2003|publisher=Altamira Press|isbn=0-7591-0190-6|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_New_Encyclopedia_of_Islam.html?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;redir_esc=y|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valentine|first=Simon|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya jamaʻat: history, belief, practice|year=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-70094-8|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaiil.org"&gt;Muhammad Ali.

While the term ''Dajjāl'' is taken as a reference to the forces of falsehood in matters of ideology and religious belief, prophecies concerning [[Gog and Magog]] (or ''Yaʾjūj Maʾjūj'') are taken as relating to the duplicity in the realm of politics and the shattering of world peace by the same forces – whose ancestors are thought to be the [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] peoples – and are seen as embodied by the political dominance of European powers.&lt;ref name="Wessels 2013 214–15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wessels|first=Anton|title=The Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: Three Books, Two Cities, One Tale|year=2013|publisher=Wm.

===Baha'i===
The Antichrist is considered to subvert the religion of God from the inner reality of man as [['Abdu'l-Baha]] narrates: "Christ was a divine Center of unity and love. Whenever discord prevails instead of unity, wherever hatred and antagonism take the place of love and spiritual fellowship, Antichrist reigns instead of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1='Abdu'l-Baha|first1=Abbas Effendi|title=Some Answered Questions|url=http://www.bahai.org/r/901747607|website=bahai.org|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ben Thompson''' (November 2, 1843 – March 11, 1884) was a [[gunfighter|gunman]], [[gambler]], and sometimes [[Law enforcement officer|lawman]] of the [[Old West]]. He was a contemporary of [[Buffalo Bill|"Buffalo" Bill Cody]], [[Bat Masterson]], [[John Wesley Hardin]], and [[James Butler Hickok|"Wild Bill" Hickock]], some of whom considered him a friend, others an enemy.  Thompson fought for the [[Confederate States Army|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and later for [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] in Mexico.  When hired in 1881 as [[Marshal#State and local marshals|marshal]] in [[Austin, Texas]], the crime rate reportedly dropped sharply.  Thompson was murdered at the age of 40 in [[San Antonio, Texas]], in the "[[Vaudeville Theater Ambush]]."

==Early life==
Thompson was born in [[Knottingley]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|England]] to William and Mary Ann [nee Baker] Thompson, in November 1843.&lt;ref&gt;The 1851 Knottingley census records; Records notes that both Ben and Billy were enrolled in school.&lt;/ref&gt;  The family settled in Austin in late 1852.  Ben was 8 years old, William 6, and Mary Jane 4 years old at the time.

Thompson worked for the ''Austin Rambler'' as a news printer's assistant while in his teens.  Once he discovered gambling, however, Thompson began traveling and earning a living as a professional gambler.

==Military service==
On June 12, 1861, Thompson enlisted in the Confederate States Army at San Antonio, and became a private in the 2nd Regiment,Texas Mounted Rifles, Company H.&lt;ref&gt;Note: The company was organized on April 17, 1861, and was known as Captain Hamner's Company.  In April 1862, the company became the 2nd Texas Cavalry, Company F, under the command of Captain Tobin.  Subsequently, the regiment became Company I, Morgan's Regiment, Texas Cavalry.&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, [[Billy Thompson (gunman)|Billy Thompson]], joined the same regiment.

On January 1–2, 1863, Thompson participated in the [[Battle of Galveston]], where the [[USRC Harriet Lane (1857)|U.S.S. Harriet Lane]] was captured. Thompson was wounded during the battle, and was treated for six weeks in a military hospital at Niblett's Bluff (located west of [[Vinton, Louisiana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Note: Its corresponding address today is 3409 Nibletts Bluff Road.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year, Thompson took part in the [[Battle of LaFourche Crossing]] (June 20, 1863), near [[Thibodaux, Louisiana]].  The two Thompson brothers "found themselves at night separated from the living and standing among the dead."{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}  After this battle, Thompson returned home to Austin.  He re-enlisted in Company F in September 1863, and served out the remainder of the war stationed along the banks of the [[Rio Grande]].

==Post war life==

===Mexico===
After the conclusion of the Civil War, Thompson fought in the armed forces of Emperor Maximilian against the Mexican revolutionaries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Imprisonment===
In 1868 Thompson received word that his wife was being physically abused by her brother, Jim Moore. Soon after his return to Texas, he confronted Moore, and severely injured him.  Charged with attempted murder, the 25-year-old Thompson was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison.  He served time at [[Huntsville Unit|Huntsville Prison]], but eventually received a full pardon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Abilene, Wild Bill, and John Wesley Hardin===
{{main|Wild Bill Hickok|John Wesley Hardin}}
In 1870, Thompson left Texas for [[Abilene, Kansas]], which had become a [[boomtown]] due to the expanding cattle trade.  In 1871, Thompson opened the "[[Bulls Head Saloon]]" in Abilene, with friend and [[Business partner|partner]], [[Phil Coe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keys |first=Jim |title=Wild Bill Hickok |url=https://www.thehistoryherald.com/Articles/American-History/Civil-War-American-Indian-Wars-Pioneers-1801-1900/wild-bill-hickok/Page-2 |date=January 28, 2013 |access-date=December 27, 2017 |journal=The History Herald |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Western saloon|saloon]] prospered due to the many [[cattle drives]] that gave Abilene a steady stream of [[cowboy]]s' passing through who were anxious to drink and gamble.

It was at the Bulls Head Saloon that Thompson and Coe made the acquaintance of John Wesley Hardin, and actively recruited him in an attempt to rid the town of its marshal, "Wild" Bill Hickok.  The two entrepreneurs had painted a picture of a bull with a large erect penis on the side of their establishment as a form of advertisement.  Citizens of the town had complained to Hickok.  When Thompson and Coe refused his request to remove the bull, Hickok had altered it himself.  Infuriated, Thompson tried to incite Hardin by exclaiming to him: "He's a damn Yankee. Picks on [[Johnny Reb|rebels]], especially Texans, to kill."  Hardin, then living under the assumed name of "Wesley Clemmons" (but better known to the townspeople by the alias, "Little Arkansas"), replied, "If Wild Bill needs killin', why don't you kill him yourself?"[sic]&lt;ref name="Hardin Autobiography"&gt;{{cite book | first = John Wesley | last = Hardin | title = The Life of John Wesley Hardin: As Written By Himself | isbn = 978-0-8061-1051-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jLM-AAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+wesley+hardin#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = Smith &amp; Moore |location=Seguin, Texas | year = 1896 | accessdate = 2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that night, Hardin was confronted by Hickok, who told him to hand over his guns, which he did.  Hickok had no knowledge at the time of Hardin being a wanted man, and he advised "Clemmons" to avoid problems while remaining in Abilene.

Soon afterward, Thompson was injured in a fall from a horse.  While he was recuperating, Coe was involved in a fatal ''[[shootout]]'' with Hickok. Thompson never confronted Hickok over the shooting of Coe, and both men left Abilene soon afterward.

===Altercation in Ellsworth ===
{{Main|Billy Thompson (gunman)}}
Thompson moved to [[Ellsworth, Kansas]], which was also prospering as a cattle boomtown.  On August 15, 1873, Thompson's younger brother, Billy, shot and killed Sheriff Chauncey Whitney.  Whitney was standing near the two Thompson brothers, who were facing off against a local police officer, John "Happy Jack" Morco, and a gambler, John Sterling.  The confrontation had developed over a gambling dispute.  Whitney was a friend to both brothers, and numerous witnesses confirmed that Whitney stated before he died that the shooting was accidental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofyorkshire.co.uk/famous_people/ben_thompson/billy_thompson.htm "Billy Thompson"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517070115/http://www.imagesofyorkshire.co.uk/famous_people/ben_thompson/billy_thompson.htm |date=2008-05-17 }}, Images of Yorkshire online; accessed August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wyatt Earp]] claimed in an interview with his future biographer, [[Stuart N. Lake|Stuart Lake]], that he had arrested Thompson after the altercation although contemporary news accounts and Thompson's own biography describing the episode don't mention his presence at all.&lt;ref name=earpnet&gt;{{cite web | first=Steve |last=Gatto |url=http://www.wyattearp.net/ |title=Wyatt Earp History Page |publisher=WyattEarp.Net |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Lake's story ''[[Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal]]'', published two years after Earp's death, has been found by modern researchers to be a largely fictionalized biography,&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;{{cite book | title=Wyatt Earp |first=Michael |last=Goodman| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4Bq2Uoi6MgC&amp;pg | page=95 |date= July 30, 2005 |isbn=1583413391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the story he described of Earp's role in arresting Thompson was likely an "exaggerated account".&lt;ref name=myers&gt;{{cite web | last1=Myers| first1=Roger| title=Did Wyatt Earp Arrest Ben Thompson?| url=http://www.larned.net/rogmyers/ben_earp.htm| accessdate=27 August 2014| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208115547/http://www.larned.net/rogmyers/ben_earp.htm|archivedate=February 8, 2007| year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Roberts| first1=Gary| title=Did Wyatt Earp Arrest Ben Thompson In Ellsworth In 1873?| url=http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/benthompson/garyroberts.htm| accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morco filed charges of assault against Ben Thompson the following day, due to Thompson's having fired in his direction prior to Whitney being shot.  Officer Ed Hogue arrested Ben Thompson.  That same week, police officer Ed Crawford killed Thompson's friend, Cad Pierce, in an incident that Crawford reportedly provoked.   Morco and Hogue soon ran another Thompson friend, Neil Cain, out of town.  The town council dismissed Morco, Hogue, and Crawford, for inappropriate behavior.  Soon after, newly appointed police officer, J.C. "Charlie" Brown, killed Morco when he pulled a gun during a disturbance.  Friends of Cad Pierce soon killed Crawford.  Ed Hogue left town.  Billy Thompson fled [[Kansas]], too, but eventually was returned to be unsuccessfully tried for the death of Sheriff Whitney.

==Later life==

===Return to Texas===
In 1875, Ben Thompson returned to Texas, staying at [[Fort Elliott, Texas|Fort Elliott]], in the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]].  There he met and befriended [[Bat Masterson]].  When Masterson shot and killed a [[US Cavalry|cavalry]] [[Corporal#United States|Corporal]] Melvin King in a dispute over a woman, Thompson stepped in to prevent other soldiers from attacking Masterson.  After that incident, the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] hired both gunmen to intercede in a right-of-way dispute between that railroad and the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad|Rio Grande Railroad]].

After the railway dispute ended, Thompson returned to Austin, where he opened the Iron Front Saloon.  One of his competitors was the Capital Theater, owned and operated by Mark Wilson.  On Christmas Eve 1876, Thompson and friends were at the Capital Theater drinking when a fight erupted involving other patrons.  When Thompson tried to intervene, Wilson produced a shotgun and fired at Thompson but missed.  Thompson then killed Wilson.  A bartender, Charley Matthews, fired a Winchester rifle and grazed Thompson's hip.  Thompson returned fire, hitting Matthews.  Though seriously wounded, Matthews survived.  Thompson was not arrested, as the shooting was ruled self defense.

In June 1880, Ben Thompson asked Masterson to go to [[Ogallala, Nebraska]] (then "the end of the Texas Trail"), to rescue his younger brother Billy, who was in trouble again as a result of being involved a shootout.  Masterson, Ben, and Billy Thompson escaped from Ogallala, and headed to [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reminiscences of a Ranchman''; by [[Edgar Beecher Bronson]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Austin, Texas===
In 1881, Thompson was hired by the city of Austin to serve as a city marshal.  The following year, Thompson was involved in a dispute with Vaudeville Variety Theater owner, Jack Harris, in San Antonio.  Thompson shot and killed Harris.  Thompson was [[indicted]] for murder, and resigned his position as marshal.  He was tried and acquitted, after which he returned to Austin.  He was welcomed by the citizens, but he did not return to his law enforcement job.&lt;ref&gt;Note: One of the defense lawyers for Thompson was [[William M. Walton]], who later wrote a biography, ''The Life and Adventures of Ben Thompson''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murdered in San Antonio==

{{Main|Vaudeville Theater Ambush}}
While on business in San Antonio, on March 11, 1884, Thompson ran into rancher, [[King Fisher]].  The two men, who had known one another for several years, decided to attend shows at the Turner Hall Opera House, and later at the Vaudeville Variety Theater.  A local lawman, Jacob Coy, sat with them.  Thompson wanted to see Joe Foster, a theater owner who had been a friend of Harris's.  Thompson had already spoken to Billy Simms, another theater owner, and Foster's new partner.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;[http://ddfa.org/kingfisher.html ''John King Fisher – Gunfighter, Lawman''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910085900/http://ddfa.org/kingfisher.html |date=September 10, 2006 }}; Texas;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher and Thompson were directed upstairs to meet with Foster.  Coy and Simms also joined them in the theater box.  Foster refused to speak with Thompson.  Fisher allegedly noticed that something was not right, when suddenly Simms and Coy stepped aside.  As they did, a hail of bullets from an adjoining box hit Thompson and Fisher.  Thompson fell, and either Coy or Foster ran up to him and shot him in the head with a pistol.  Thompson died almost immediately.  Fisher was shot thirteen times, but fired one round in retaliation, possibly wounding Coy, who was crippled for life.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: the fatal shot may have actually been friendly fire.&lt;/ref&gt;  While trying to draw his pistol, Foster had shot himself in the leg, which was later amputated.  He died soon after the surgery.

==Burial==
Thompson's body was returned to Austin.  He is buried in [[Oakwood Cemetery (Austin, TX)|Oakwood Cemetery]] in Austin.

==Fate of Thompson's property==
Thompson's will deeded all his property to his business partner.  Among Thompson's gun collection was a custom made and engraved [[Stevens Arms#Target pistols|Stevens-Lord No. 36 target pistol]], given to him as a gift from Buffalo Bill.

On January 13, 2007, Ben Thompson's [[roulette]] table was sold at auction in Waco, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;"Western-themed items set for auction today"; C. Culp;   January 17, 2007; ''Waco Tribune-Herald''; retrieved .&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported that the table was used by Thompson in a gambling house he opened above the Iron Front Saloon, which had been located on Congress Avenue in Austin.&lt;ref&gt;"Rare auction items linked to San Antonio"; J. Zarazua; January 12, 2007; ''San Antonio Express-News''; retrieved .&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television portrayal==
Thompson's character is played by [[Denver Pyle]] in seven episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]], ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', with [[Hugh O'Brian]] in the title role.  In one episode "The Time for All Good Men" (June 4, 1957), the actor [[Mike Ragan]] played [[Clay Allison]], who joins Thompson and [[John Wesley Hardin]] ([[Phillip Pine]]) in coming to Earp's aid in a shootout with the owner and foreman, respectively, of the Big T Ranch, Rance Purcell ([[Richard Devon]]) and Gus Andrews ([[Grant Withers]]).  [[Walter Coy]] played Thompson in a single 1959 episode of the same series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2242">'''Bentley Layton''' (born 12 August 1941), is  Professor of Religious Studies (Ancient Christianity) and Professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations (Coptic) at [[Yale University]] (since 1983). He is a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated scholar who has been central to the late 20th-century ''Rediscovery of [[Gnosticism]]'', which was the title of the international conference he hosted at Yale in 1980 and the volume that came of it. His interests lie in the [[History of Christianity]] from its origins until the rise of Islam, Gnostic studies and [[Coptic language|Coptic]].

With a ''summa cum laude'' thesis on the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]] Gnostic Coptic [[Treatise on the Resurrection]], which he presented in a critical edition in 1978, he has moved on to present critical editions of other texts: ''[[The Hypostasis of the Archons]], Or, The Reality of the Rulers...'', serialized in ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 67 (1974) 351—425 and 69 (1976) 1—71, and others. His most accessible book is ''The Gnostic Scriptures: A New Translation with Annotations'' (Garden City: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1987), which presents some of the enigmatic literature of gnostic Christianity for nonspecialists. He sets his selection of gnostic scripture, the writings of [[Valentinius|Valentinus]] and his followers, and related writings that display gnostic tendencies within the broader context of [[Early Christianity]] and Hellenistic Judaism, with generous introductions and plentiful annotations.

For specialists, Layton's Coptic grammar is a standard text. He catalogued all the Coptic manuscripts in the [[British Library]]. He is a board member on the '' Harvard Theological Review'' and the ''Journal of Coptic Studies''.

'''William Hayes''' (born April 3, 1947) is an American writer, actor, and film director. He is best known for his autobiographical book ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'', about his experiences in and escape from a Turkish prison after being convicted of smuggling [[hashish]]. He was one of hundreds of U.S. citizens in foreign jails serving drug charge sentences following a drug smuggling crackdown by foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904284-1,00.html|title=Americans Abroad: The Jail Scene|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=April 13, 1970|accessdate=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hayes, an American student, was caught trying to smuggle four pounds of [[hashish]] out of [[Turkey]] on October 7, 1970. He was originally sentenced to four years and two months in a Turkish prison; with his release date weeks away, he learned that the authorities had chosen to penalize him with a [[life sentence]] for smuggling instead of possession.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Hayes was imprisoned at [[Sultanahmet Jail|Sağmalcılar Prison]] in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=228251&amp;dt=2474&amp;dl=1345 INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM HAYES/CODEL MURPHY / 030925Z MAY 74], U.S. State Department, Ankara, May 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Following an incident in prison, he was transferred in 1972 to [[Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital]], described as a "lunatic asylum." The [[United States Department of State]] on several occasions pressured Turkey to transfer sentencing to the United States, however Turkish foreign minister [[Melih Esenbel]] stated that the United States was not in a position to dispute a sentence issued by a Turkish court.&lt;ref name="hayescase"&gt;[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=249841&amp;dt=2476&amp;dl=1345 HAYES CASE / 190938Z MAR 75], U.S. State Department telegram, Ankara, March 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Esenbel stated privately to officials that a release might be possible on humanitarian grounds if Hayes' physical or mental health was deteriorating, but in a private consultation, Hayes stated to U.S. diplomats that his experience at Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital in 1972 was highly traumatic and he did not have confidence that the hospital would certify him for early release;&lt;ref name="hayescase" /&gt; Hayes also stated that he felt attempts to win early release would jeopardize his prospects of being transferred to a more desirable half-open prison. On May 12, 1975, the [[Turkish Constitutional Court]] declared amnesty for all drug offenses, which shortened Hayes' sentence from life to 30 years. He was transferred to [[İmralı|İmralı Prison]] on July 11, 1975.

Declassified State Department telegrams indicated that in discussions between the U.S. embassy and Vahap Aşıroğlu, Turkish Director of Consular Affairs, Aşıroğlu believed Hayes would probably be released from prison on parole in October 1978, which in practice meant that a local prosecutor would declare him [[persona non grata]] and expel him from the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aad.archives.gov/aad/createpdf?rid=273843&amp;dt=2476&amp;dl=1345 BILATERAL AGREEMENT FOR REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN NATIONAL PRISONERS TO COMPLETE SENTENCING IN OWN COUNTRY / 091243Z MAY 75], U.S. State Department, Ankara, May 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

He escaped from İmralı on October 2, 1975, via taking a [[rowboat]] at night to [[Bandirma]], blending in with locals and then heading westbound across the border to [[Greece]]. He was deported from [[Thessaloniki]] to [[Frankfurt]]{{why|date=February 2017}} on October 20, 1975 after several weeks' detention and interrogation about what [[military intelligence]] Hayes possessed about Turkey.

==Book==
Hayes wrote a book on his experiences, ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'', which was later adapted into the 1978 [[Midnight Express (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]]. The film was directed by [[Alan Parker]], with a screenplay by [[Oliver Stone]]. The movie differs from Hayes' account in his book. Among the differences is a scene in which Hayes kills the prison guard Hamidou "the Bear" (portrayed by [[Paul L. Smith]]), the main antagonist of the story. In fact, the prison guard was killed in 1973 by a recently released prisoner, whose family Hamidou insulted while beating the prisoner, years before Hayes' actual escape.

For legal reasons,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} the book and film adaptation were deliberately inaccurate. In one interview, Hayes admitted making several trips to Turkey to bring hash back to the United States. His lawyer informed him that he could be arrested again for such claims. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2010, in an episode of [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''[[Banged Up Abroad|Locked Up Abroad]]'', titled "The Real Midnight Express",&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/videos/the-real-midnight-express/ [[Banged Up Abroad|Locked Up Abroad]]: The Real Midnight Express] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103095240/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/videos/the-real-midnight-express/ |date=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes tells his version of the full story about being sent to the infamous Turkish Sağmalcilar prison, eventually escaping from the [[Marmara Sea]] prison on [[İmralı]] island. Hayes has now written the sequel books, ''Midnight Return (Escaping Midnight Express)'' and ''The Midnight Express Letters--from a Turkish Prison, 1970-1975'', a collection of the original letters written home to family and friends during his imprisonment.

==Acting and writing==
Hayes is still {{When|date=April 2018}} active in the entertainment industry, specifically acting and writing. One of his successes was writing and directing 2003's ''Southside'' (later released as ''Cock and Bull Story'' in the US), which won numerous awards, including the 2002 L.A. Drama Critics' Circle award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riding The Midnight Express With Billy Hayes|url=https://www.plays411.com/newsite/castcrew/play_castcrew.asp?show_id=2708|publisher=plays411.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 30, 2010, the National Geographic television channel aired ''[[Banged Up Abroad|Locked Up Abroad: The Real Midnight Express]]''.  
Billy Hayes has been traveling the world with his one-man show, ''Riding the Midnight Express with Billy Hayes,'' since it premiered at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in August 2013.

==Interview on ''Midnight Express'' film==
During the 1999 [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[Alinur Velidedeoğlu]], a Turkish advertiser, met Billy Hayes by chance and [[Midnight Express (film)#Billy Hayes interviewed|interviewed]] him on the film ''Midnight Express''. Hayes expressed his disappointment with parts of the film adaptation, especially its portrayal of all Turks as bad, and his regret that Turkey's image was negatively affected by the film. Hayes also displayed affection for Turkey and [[Istanbul]]. Although the [[Interpol]] warrant for him had by then been set aside, he explained that while he wanted to return, he hesitated to do so out of concern that many Turks might blame him for the negative publicity the movie had generated.

The video was made available on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|WMsNPCVbNhw|Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|_JTRs8e-FRk|Interview Part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes did finally return to Turkey on June 14, 2007, to attend the 2nd Istanbul Conference on Democracy and Global Security, organized by the [[Turkish National Police]] (TNP) and the [[Turkish Institute for Police Studies]] (TIPS), to amend the negative implications of his book. He held a press conference on June 15 and made an apology to the Turkish people.&lt;ref name="TORONTOSTAR2007"&gt;Handelman, Stephen, [https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/06/24/revisiting_the_land_of_midnight_express.html "Revisiting the land of 'Midnight Express'"], ''[[Toronto Star]]'', June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles James "Chuck" Hailey''' is an experimental astrophysicist and Pupin Professor of Physics at [[Columbia University]]. He earned his BA in Physics from [[Cornell University]] in 1977 and his PhD from Columbia in 1983, with a thesis entitled "The Development of an Imaging Gas Scintillation Proportional Counter for Use in X-ray Astronomy." He received tenure from Columbia University in 1995.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://physics.columbia.edu/people/profile/408|title = Charles Hailey Faculty Profile|work=Columbia University Department of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hailey's research focuses on [[High energy astronomy|high energy astrophysics]] and experimental [[particle physics]]. He is Co-Director of the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory, where he works on [[gamma-ray]] and X-ray research.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

Hailey led the team that built the NASA [[Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array]] (NuSTAR) telescope.&lt;ref name="scienceline"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://scienceline.org/2013/02/capturing-the-invisible/|title="Capturing the invisible"|work = "Scienceline"}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of NuSTAR's main advantages, the use of [[slumping|slumping glass]] instead of polishing to achieve high resolution, was developed by Hailey himself.&lt;ref name=craig&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=David|title=X-Ray Specs|url=http://magazine.columbia.edu/features/spring-2010/x-ray-specs?page=0,0|accessdate=26 January 2015|work=Columbia Magazine|date=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continues to be very involved in the project, investigating emissions from the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way as well as the sources of other X-ray and gamma emissions. Hailey is the chair of the NuSTAR Galactic Plane Survey working group.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-333|title=NASA's NuSTAR Spots Flare from Milky Way's Black Hole|date=October 23, 2012|work=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hailey is also Principal Investigator and leader of the [[General Antiparticle Spectrometer]] (GAPS) experiments, for which he works on developing new [[X-ray fluorescence#Si(Li) detectors|Si(Li) detectors]] for X-ray detection.&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamma0.astro.ucla.edu/gaps/|title = General Antiparticle Spectrometer|work=UCLA Department of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of the project is to attempt to detect [[dark matter]] and elucidate its composition by sending a balloon-suspended apparatus to search for anti-deuterons in the cosmic rays. The project had a successful prototype run in 2012 in Japan and is scheduled for a full run from Antarctica in 2019.&lt;ref name="scienceline" /&gt;

Hailey previously served as V/L-Division program leader for Space Science and Technology at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], where he worked from 1986 to 1995. In addition, he held the post of associate program leader for Intelligence and National Security Technology in the Nonproliferation, Arms Control and International Security Directorate until joining the faculty at Columbia.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt;  At Livermore, Hailey received the prestigious Outstanding Achievement Award three times.&lt;ref name="archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol21/vol21_iss6/record2106.13.html|title=Sciences Names Scholars to 14 Tenured Faculty Positions|work=Columbia University Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, he was employed as a research scientist in a now-defunct private firm building X-ray detectors.&lt;ref name="scienceline" /&gt;

He has made a variety of contributions to physics outside GAPS and NuSTAR. He has built or helped to build telescopes such as the three-meter telescope at the [[Lick Observatory]] and the [[High-Energy Focusing Telescope]].&lt;ref name=thieme&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thieme|first1=Trevor|title=High-Flying Telescope|work=Popular Science|date=February 2001|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[UK Dark Matter Collaboration]] and collaborated with two other Columbia faculty members to build the liquid scintillator veto shield for the [[ZEPLIN-III]] dark matter detector.&lt;ref name=thieme2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thieme|first1=Trevor|title=A Flash in the Dark|work=Popular Science|date=April 2001|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a collaboration between researchers at Harvard and Columbia, Hailey worked on the EXIST All-Sky Sky Gamma-ray
Survey mission study in 2000 at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name="aas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aas.org/archives/BAAS/v33n1/054331basr.pdf|work = American Academy of Sciences|title=American Academy of Sciences Annual Report (Columbia University)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hailey holds several patents for his work on NuSTAR and GAPS, among other projects, and has authored over 200 publications. He teaches an undergraduate quantum mechanics course at Columbia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5638">{{distinguish|text=an attorney who works on contracts; see [[Commercial law]]}}
{{refimprove|date=December 2007}}
A '''contract attorney''' is a [[lawyer]] who works on legal cases on a [[contract]] basis.  Such work is generally of a temporary nature, often with no guaranteed employment term.

A contract attorney is
{{quote|An attorney temporarily hired by the law office for a specific job or period.  When the job or period is finished, the relationship is over.|Brent D. Roper&lt;ref&gt;Brent D. Roper, ''Practical Law Office Management'', 3rd ed., pp. 5 (2007 Thomson Learning).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Civil litigation==
The work of contract attorneys often varies.  They can be engaged activities such as [[document review]] in response to a document [[subpoena]]s or [[request for production]] of documents. In such projects, contract attorneys may review tens of thousands, if not millions, of pages of documents and mark them as responsive to a particular request, or protected as attorney [[Work-product doctrine|work product]] or under the [[attorney–client privilege]]. Large firms have learned that contract attorneys can perform this work much more cost effectively than high-priced associates.

Many contract, or freelance, attorneys perform [[legal research]], draft [[Brief (law)|legal briefs]], and provide a full range of other services to law firms of all sizes. These attorneys typically work for themselves, rather than for temporary agencies, and provide their services to other law firms on an as-needed basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trialhelper.com/Site/Welcome.html |title= Full Service Freelance Litigation Support Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people who hold [[juris doctor]] degrees, but who are awaiting [[Admission to the bar|bar admission]], work as temporary professionals in law firms doing the same type of work as contract attorneys. In other situations, a law firm may, due to a conflict of interest, be required to hire a contract attorney as ''[[Cumis counsel]]'' in certain cases.
  
Contract attorneys typically work on a project-by-project basis and are not full-time law firm employees.  However, they also develop long-lasting relationships with firms that regularly or semi-regularly send work to the contract attorney.  Many small firms find that the use of contract attorneys provides them the flexibility to grow their business without hiring salaried employees. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Velazquez|first1=Ashley|url=https://hireanesquire.com/magazine/small-firms-benefit-contract-attorneys/|website=Hire an Esquire|accessdate=7 March 2017 |title= Small Firms: The Benefit of Contract Attorneys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[American Bar Association]], law firms can add a surcharge to the fees of their contract attorneys so long as the final fee charged to the client is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trialhelper.com/Site/ABA_Op._00-420.html |title= Summary of American Bar Association Formal Opinion 00-420:  Surcharge to Client for Use of a Contract Lawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in a slowing economy, the use of contract attorneys gives firms a competitive edge in the marketplace, helping them to control costs while increasing profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trialhelper.com/Site/Freelance_Legal_Services_Preserve_Profit_Margins.html |title= The Myth of Associate Profitability: Why Freelance Legal Services Preserve Profit Margins in an Uncertain Economic Climate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{undue|section|date=December 2012}}
In writing about the disparity between CEO and worker pay, ''New York Times'' best-selling author and social critic [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] said:
{{quote|Similarly, the legal profession, which is topped by law firm partners billing hundreds of dollars an hour, now has a new proletariat of temp lawyers working for $19-25 an hour in sweatshop conditions. On sites like &lt;nowiki&gt;http://temporaryattorney.blogspot.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;, temp lawyers report working 12 hours a day, six days a week, in crowded basements with inadequate sanitary facilities. According to an article in ''American Lawyer'', a legal temp at a major New York firm reports being 'corralled in a windowless basement room littered with dead cockroaches,' where six out of seven exits were blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-ehrenreich/going-to-extremes-ceos-v_b_49791.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Barbara | last=Ehrenreich | title=Going to Extremes: CEOs vs. Slaves | date=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Assigned counsel work in criminal defense==
In counties without a [[public defender]], or without an [[Conflict of interest|alternate defender]], a contract attorney may be hired to do [[Of counsel|assigned counsel]] work.  A [[legal aid]] group may be hired to do such work as if a [[Temporary work|temporary work agency]], such as the [[Legal Aid Society]] of [[New York City]].  Other states or counties may have a panel of lawyers who act as contract attorneys.  Some critics of this system have accused the method of leading to [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] in [[Criminal law|criminal cases]].

==Contract legal assistant==
{{main|Paralegal}}

A law firm may, under certain circumstances, hire a [[freelance]] [[paralegal]], commonly known as a contract legal assistant, to perform many of the tasks that a contract attorney might perform.&lt;ref&gt;Brent D. Roper, ''Practical Law Office Management'', 3rd ed., pp. 8-9, 147 (2007 Thomson Learning).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bose himself died in an airplane crash trying to reach Japanese-occupied territory in the last months of the war. His romantic saga, coupled with his defiant nationalism, has made Bose a near-mythic figure, not only in his native Bengal, but across India.

===Last months with the Indian National Army===
[[File:Map showing Subhas Chandra Bose's exit from Burma in late April 1945.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Map of Central Burma showing the route taken by Subhas Chandra Bose and his [[Indian National Army]] (INA) group of 500 from [[Yangon|Rangoon]] to [[Moulmein]]. The group traveled in a Japanese military convoy until they reached the river [[Sittaung River|Sittang]]. After crossing the river, they walked the remaining 80 miles. At Moulmein, Bose, his party, and another INA group of 500, boarded Japanese trains on the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]] (which had been constructed earlier by British, Australian, and Dutch prisoners of war) to arrive in [[Bangkok]] in the first week of May 1945.]]
During the last week of April 1945, Subhas Chandra Bose along with his senior [[Indian National Army]] (INA) officers, several hundred enlisted INA men, and nearly hundred women from the INA's [[Rani of Jhansi Regiment]] left [[Rangoon]] by road for [[Moulmein]] in Burma.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=372}} Accompanied by Lieutenant General Saburo Isoda, the head of the Japanese-INA liaison organization [[Hikari Kikan]], their Japanese military convoy was able to reach the right bank of the [[Sittaung River|Sittang river]], albeit slowly.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=373}} (See map 1.) However, very few vehicles were able to cross the river because of American strafing runs. Bose and his party walked the remaining {{convert|80|mi}} to Moulmein over the next week.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=373}} Moulmein then was the terminus of the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]], constructed earlier by British, Australian, and Dutch prisoners of war, linking Burma to [[Siam]] (now Thailand).{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=373}} At Moulmein, Bose's group was also joined by 500 men from the X-regiment, INA's first guerrilla regiment, who arrived from a different location in [[Lower Burma]].{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=374}}

A year and a half earlier, 16,000 INA men and 100 women had entered Burma from [[British Malaya|Malaya]].{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=374}} Now, less than one tenth that number left the country, arriving in [[Bangkok]] during the first week of May.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=374}} The remaining nine tenths were either killed in action, died from malnutrition or injuries after the battles of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]]. Others were captured by the British, turned themselves in, or simply disappeared.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=374}} Bose stayed in Bangkok for a month, where soon after his arrival he heard the news of [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's surrender]] on May{{nbsp}}8.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=376}} Bose spent the next two months between June and July 1945 in Singapore,{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=376}} and in both places attempted to raise funds for billeting his soldiers or rehabilitating them if they chose to return to civilian life, which most of the women did.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|pp=376–380}} In his nightly radio broadcasts, Bose spoke with increasing virulence against Gandhi, who had been released from jail in 1944, and was engaged in talks with British administrators, envoys and [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] leaders.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|pp=377–379}} Some senior INA officers began to feel frustrated or disillusioned with Bose and to prepare quietly for the arrival of the British and its consequences.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|pp=377–379}}

During the first two weeks of August 1945, events began to unfold rapidly. With the British threatening to invade Malaya and with daily American aerial bombings, Bose's presence in Singapore became riskier by the day. His chief of staff [[J. R. Bhonsle]] suggested that he prepare to leave Singapore.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} On 3{{nbsp}}August 1945, Bose received a cable from General Isoda advising him to urgently evacuate to [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] in Japanese-controlled [[French Indochina]] (now Vietnam).{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} On 10{{nbsp}}August, Bose learnt that the Soviet Union had entered the war and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]]. At the same time he heard about the atomic bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]].{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=380}} Finally, on 16{{nbsp}}August, after being informed of the unconditional surrender of Japan, Bose decided to leave for Saigon along with a handful of his aides.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}}

===Last days and journeys===
[[File:Flight paths of Subhas Chandra Bose on 16, 17, and 18 August 1945.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The last airplane journeys of Subhas Chandra Bose. Paths of completed flights are shown in blue. On 16 August 1945, he left [[Singapore]] for [[Bangkok]], [[Siam]] (now Thailand). On either the 16th itself or on the 17th morning, he flew from Bangkok to [[Saigon]], now Ho Chi Minh City. On the 17 August afternoon, he flew from Saigon to [[Tourane]], [[French Indo-China]], now Da Nang, Vietnam. Early next morning at 5 AM, he left Tourane for [[Taipei#Japanese rule|Taihoku]], [[Formosa]], now Taipei, Taiwan. At 2:30 PM on 18 August, he left for [[Dairen]], [[Manchukuo]], now Dalian, China, but his plane crashed shortly after take off, and Bose died within a few hours in a Japanese military hospital. Had the crash not occurred the plane would have dropped off Bose at Dairen and proceeded to Tokyo along a flight path shown in red.]]

Reliable strands of historical narrative about Bose's last days are united up to this point. However, they separate briefly for the period between 16 August, when Bose received news of Japan's surrender in Singapore, and shortly after noon on 17 August, when Bose and his party arrived at Saigon airport from Saigon city to board a plane.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=382}} (See map 2.)

In one version, Bose flew out from Singapore to Saigon, stopping briefly in Bangkok, on the 16th. Soon after arriving in Saigon, he visited Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], head of the Japanese forces in Southeast Asia, and requested him to arrange a flight to Soviet Russia.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} Although until the day before, Russia had been a belligerent of Japan, it was also seen, at least by Bose, as increasingly anti-British,{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=21}} and, consequently, a possible base of his future operations against the [[British Raj]].{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} Terauchi, in turn, cabled Japan's [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (IGHQ) in Tokyo for permission, which was quickly denied.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} In the words of historian [[Joyce Lebra|Joyce Chapman Lebra]], the IGHQ felt that it "would be unfair of Bose to write off Japan and go over to Russia after receiving so much help from Japan. Terauchi added in talking with Bose that it would be unreasonable for him to take a step which was opposed by the Japanese."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} Privately, however, Terauchi still felt sympathy for Bose—one that had been formed during their two-year-long association.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}} He somehow managed to arrange room for Bose on a flight leaving Saigon on the morning of 17 August 1945 bound for Tokyo, but stopping en route in [[Dairen]], [[Manchuria]]—which was still Japanese-occupied, but toward which the Soviet army was fast approaching—where Bose was to have disembarked and to have awaited his fate at the hand of the Russians.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=194–195}}

In another version, Bose left Singapore with his party on the 16th and stopped en route in Bangkok, surprising INA officer in-charge there, [[J. R. Bhonsle]], who quickly made arrangements for Bose's overnight stay.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=382}} Word of Bose's arrival, however, got out, and soon local members of the [[Indian Independence League]] (IIL), the INA, and the Thai Indian business community turned up at the hotel.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=382}} According to historian [[Peter W. Fay|Peter Ward Fay]], Bose "sat up half the night holding court—and in the morning flew on to Saigon, this time accompanied by General Isoda ..."{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=382}} Arriving in Saigon, late in the morning, there was little time to visit Field Marshal Terauchi, who was in [[Da Lat|Dalat]] in the Central Highlands of [[Vietnam|French Indo-China]], an hour away by plane.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=382}} Consequently, Isoda himself, without consulting with higher ups, arranged room for Bose on a flight leaving around noon.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=382}}

In the third sketchier version, Bose left Singapore on the 17th.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=21}} According to historian [[Christopher Bayly]] and Tim Harper, "On 17 August he issued a final order of the day, dissolving the INA with the words, 'The roads to Delhi are many and Delhi still remains our goal.' He then flew out to China via French Indo-China. If all else failed he wanted to become a prisoner of the Soviets: 'They are the only ones who will resist the British. My fate is with them'."{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=21}}
[[File:Ki-21 97juubaku b.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] twin-engine heavy bomber ([[Allies of World War II|Allies]] code name [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Sally]]) that Subhas Chandra Bose and Habibur Rahman boarded at Saigon airport around 2 PM on 17 August 1945.]]

Around noon on 17 August, the strands again reunite. At Saigon airport, a [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] heavy bomber, of the type [[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|code named]] ''Sally'' by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was waiting for Bose and his party.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}}{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=383}} In addition to Bose, the INA group comprised Colonel [[Raja Habib ur Rahman Khan|Habibur Rahman]], his secretary; [[S. A. Ayer]], a member of his cabinet; Major [[Abid Hasan (diplomat)|Abid Hasan]], his old associate who had made the hazardous submarine journey from Germany to Sumatra in 1943; and three others.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} To their dismay, they learned upon arrival that there was room for only one INA passenger.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=383}} Bose complained, and the beleaguered General Isoda gave in and hurriedly arranged for a second seat.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=383}} Bose chose Habibur Rahman to accompany him.{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=383}} It was understood that the others in the INA party would follow him on later flights. There was further delay at Saigon airport. According to historian Joyce Chapman Lebra, "a gift of treasure contributed by local Indians was presented to Bose as he was about to board the plane. The two heavy strong-boxes added overweight to the plane's full load."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} Sometime between noon and 2 PM, the twin-engine plane took off with 12 or 13 people aboard: a crew of three or four, a group of Japanese army and air force officers, including Lieutenant-General [[Tsunamasa Shidei]], the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, which although fast retreating in Manchuria still held the Manchurian peninsula, and Bose and Rahman. Bose was sitting a little to the rear of the [[portside]] wing;{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} the bomber, under normal circumstances, carried a crew of five.

That these flights were possible a few days after Japan's surrender was the result of a lack of clarity about what had occurred. Although Japan had unconditionally surrendered, when Emperor Hirohito had made his announcement over the radio, he had used formal Japanese, not entirely intelligible to ordinary people and, instead of using the word "surrender" (in Japanese), had mentioned only "abiding by the terms of the [[Potsdam Declaration]]." Consequently, many people, especially in Japanese-occupied territories, were unsure if anything had significantly changed, allowing a window of a few days for the Japanese air force to continue flying. Although the Japanese and Bose were tight lipped about the destination of the bomber, it was widely assumed by Bose's staff left behind on the tarmac in Saigon that the plane was bound for Dairen on the Manchurian peninsula, which, as stated above, was still under Japanese control. Bose had been talking for over a year about the importance of making contact with the communists, both Russian and Chinese. In 1944, he had asked a minister in his cabinet, [[A. M. Sahay|Anand Mohan Sahay]] to travel to Tokyo for the purposes of making contact with the Soviet ambassador, [[Jacob Malik]].{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} However, after consulting the Japanese foreign minister [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]], Sahay decided against it.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} In May 1945, Sahay had again written to Shigemitsu requesting him to contact Soviet authorities on behalf of Bose; again the reply had been in the negative.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} Bose had been continually querying General Isoda for over a year about the Japanese army's readiness in Manchuria.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}} After the war, the Japanese confirmed to the British investigators and later Indian commissions of inquiry, that plane was indeed bound for Dairen, and that fellow passenger General Shidea of the Kwantung Army, was to have disembarked with Bose in Dairen and to have served as the main liaison and negotiator for Bose's transfer into Soviet controlled territory in Manchuria.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=195–196}}{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=21}}

The plane had flown north. By the time it was near the northern coast of French Indo-China, darkness had begun to close in, and the pilot decided to make an unscheduled stop in [[Da Nang|Tourane]] (now Da Nang, Vietnam).{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} The passengers stayed overnight at a hotel, and the crew, worried that the plane was overloaded, shed some 500 pounds of equipment and luggage, and also refueled the plane.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} Before dawn the next morning, the group flew out again, this time east to [[Taipei|Taihoku]], [[Formosa]] (now Taipei, Taiwan), which was a scheduled stop, arriving there around noon on 18 August 1945.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} During the two-hour stop in Taihoku, the plane was again refueled, while the passengers ate lunch.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} The chief pilot and the ground engineer, and Major Kono, seemed concerned about the portside engine, and, once all the passengers were on board, the engine was tested by repeatedly throttling up and down.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}}{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=540}} The concerns allayed, the plane finally took off, in different accounts, as early as 2 PM,{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} and as late as 2:30 PM,{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=540}}{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=384}} watched by ground engineers.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}}

===Death in plane crash===
[[File:Japanpaper111.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Clipping from Japanese newspaper, published on 23 August 1945, reporting the death of Bose and General [[Tsunamasa Shidei]] of the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] in Japanese-occupied Manchuria.]]

Just as the bomber was leaving the standard path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=540}}{{Sfn|Fay|1995|p=384}} The mechanics on the tarmac saw something fall out of the plane.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}}{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=540}} The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}}{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=540}} Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and General Shidea were instantly killed.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}}{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=541}} Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door but found it blocked by the luggage.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=541}} They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=541}} The ground staff, now approaching the plane, saw two people staggering towards them, one of whom had become a human torch.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} The human torch turned out to be Bose, whose gasoline-soaked clothes had instantly ignited.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=541}} Rahman and a few others managed to smother the flames, but also noticed that Bose's face and head appeared badly burned.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=541}} According to Joyce Chapman Lebra, "A truck which served as ambulance rushed Bose and the other passengers to the Nanmon Military Hospital south of Taihoku."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} The airport personnel called Dr. Taneyoshi Yoshimi, the surgeon-in-charge at the hospital at around 3 PM.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=541}} Bose was conscious and mostly coherent when they reached the hospital, and for some time thereafter.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|pp=541–542}} Bose was naked, except for a blanket wrapped around him, and Dr. Yoshimi immediately saw evidence of third-degree burns on many parts of the body, especially on his chest, doubting very much that he would live.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|pp=541–542}} Dr. Yoshimi promptly began to treat Bose and was assisted by Dr. Tsuruta.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|pp=541–542}} According to historian [[Leonard A. Gordon]], who interviewed all the hospital personnel later,: &lt;blockquote&gt; "A disinfectant, [[Ethacridine lactate|Rivamol]], was put over most of his body and then a white ointment was applied and he was bandaged over most of his body. Dr. Yoshimi gave Bose four injections of [[Camphor#Medicinal|Vita Camphor]] and two of [[Digitalis#Cardiac|Digitamine]] for his weakened heart. These were given about every 30 minutes. Since his body had lost fluids quickly upon being burnt, he was given [[Ringer's solution|Ringer solution]] intravenously. A third doctor, Dr. Ishii gave him a blood transfusion. An orderly, Kazuo Mitsui, an army private, was in the room and several nurses were assisting. Bose still had a clear head which Dr. Yoshimi found remarkable for someone with such severe injuries.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=542}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Soon, in spite of the treatment, Bose went into a coma.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=542}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} He died a few hours later, between 9 and 10 PM.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=542}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}}

Bose's body was cremated in the main Taihoku crematorium two days later, 20 August 1945.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=543}} On 23 August 1945, the Japanese news agency Domei announced the death of Bose and Shidea.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=196–197}} On 7 September a Japanese officer, Lieutenant Tatsuo Hayashida, carried Bose's ashes to Tokyo, and the following morning they were handed to the president of the Tokyo Indian Independence League, Rama Murti.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=544–545}} On 14 September a memorial service was held for Bose in Tokyo and a few days later the ashes were turned over to the priest of the [[Renkōji Temple]] of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] in Tokyo.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}}{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=545}} There they have remained ever since.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=545}}

Among the INA personnel, there was widespread disbelief, shock, and trauma. Most affected were the young Tamil Indians from Malaya and Singapore, men and women, who comprised the bulk of the civilians who had enlisted in the INA.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p = 21}} The professional soldiers in the INA, most of whom were Punjabis, faced an uncertain future, with many fatalistically expecting reprisals from the British.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p = 21}} In India the [[Indian National Congress]]'s official line was succinctly expressed in a letter [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] wrote to [[Rajkumari Amrit Kaur]].{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p = 21}} Said Gandhi, "Subhas Bose has died well. He was undoubtedly a patriot, though misguided."{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p = 21}} Many congressmen had not forgiven Bose for quarreling with Gandhi and for collaborating with what they considered was [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[fascism]].{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p = 21}} The Indian soldiers in the British Indian army, some two and a half million of whom had fought during the [[Second World War]], were conflicted about the INA. Some saw the INA as traitors and wanted them punished; others felt more sympathetic. The [[British Raj]], though never seriously threatened by the INA, was to try 300 INA officers for treason in the [[INA trials]], but was to eventually backtrack in the face of its own end.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p = 21}}

==Legends of Bose's survival==

===Immediate post-war legends===
Subhas Chandra Bose's exploits had become legendary long before his physical death in August 1945.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|p=197}}{{efn|"THE MYTH: But Bose had become a myth in his own lifetime, dating from the time he eluded house arrest and escaped from India to Afghanistan and Europe. Thousands of Indians refused to believe he was dead. Man is very mortal but myths die hard."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|p=197}}}} From the time he had escaped house arrest in Calcutta in 1940, rumours had been rife in India about whether or not he was alive, and if the latter, where he was and what he was doing.{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|p=197}} His appearance in faraway Germany in 1941 created a sense of mystery about his activities. With Congress leaders in jail in the wake of the [[Quit India Resolution]] in August 1942 and the Indian public starved for political news, Bose's radio broadcasts from Berlin charting radical plans for India's liberation during a time when the star of Germany was still rising and that of Britain was at its lowest, made him an object of adulation among many in India and southeast Asia.{{Sfn|Hayes|2011|p=163}} During his two years in Germany, according to historian Romain Hayes, "If Bose gradually obtained respect in Berlin, in Tokyo he earned fervent admiration and was seen very much as an 'Indian samurai'."{{Sfn|Hayes|2011|p=164}} Thus it was that when Bose appeared in Southeast Asia in July 1943, brought mysteriously on German and Japanese submarines, he was already a figure of mythical size and reach.{{Sfn|Hayes|2011|p=163}}

After Bose's death, Bose's other lieutenants, who were to have accompanied him to Manchuria, but were left behind on the tarmac in Saigon, never saw a body.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}} There were no photographs taken of the injured or deceased Bose, neither was a death certificate issued.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}} According to historian Leonard A. Gordon, &lt;blockquote&gt; The war was ending; all was chaotic in East Asia, and there were no official reports released by the Governments of India or Britain. These governments did nothing to prevent the confusion. Even members of India's Interim Government in 1946 waffled on the matter. Bose had disappeared several times earlier in his life; so rumours began again in 1945 and a powerful myth grew."{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For these two reasons, when news of Bose's death was reported, many in the INA refused to believe it and were able to transmit their disbelief to a wider public.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=22}} The source of the widespread skepticism in the INA might have been Bose's senior officer [[J. R. Bhonsle]].{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=22}} Bhonsle, unlike some other senior officers, had been kept in the dark about Bose's final plans, in part because he had also become an agent for the British. When a Japanese delegation, which included General Isoda, visited Bhonsle on 19 August 1945 to break the news and offer condolences, he responded by telling Isoda that Bose had not died, rather his disappearance has been covered up.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=22}} Even Mohandas Gandhi swiftly said that he was skeptical about the air crash, but changed his mind after meeting the Indian survivor Habibur Rahman.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} As in 1940, before long, in 1945, rumours were rife about what had happened to Bose, whether he was in Soviet-held Manchuria, a prisoner of the Soviet army, or whether he had gone into hiding with the cooperation of the Soviet army.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=22}} [[Lakshmi Sahgal|Lakshmi Swaminathan]], of the all-female [[Rani of Jhansi regiment]] of the INA, later Lakshmi Sahgal, said in spring 1946 that she thought Bose was in China.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} Many rumours spoke of Bose preparing for his final march on Delhi.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=22}} This was the time when Bose began to be sighted by people, one sighter claiming "he had met Bose in a third-class compartment of the Bombay express on a Thursday."{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}

===Enduring legends===
In the 1950s, stories appeared in which Bose had become a ''[[sadhu]]'', or [[Hindu]] renunciant. The best-known and most intricate of the renunciant tales of Subhas Bose, and one which, according to historian Leonard A. Gordon, may "properly be called a myth," was told in the early 1960s.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}} Some associates of Bose, from two decades before, had formed an organization, the "Subhasbadi Janata", to promote this story in which Bose was now the chief sadhu of an ''[[ashram]]'' (or hermitage) in Shaulmari (also Shoulmari) in North Bengal.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}} The Janata brought out published material, including several newspapers and magazines. Of these, some were long lived and some short, but all, by their number, attempted to create the illusion of the story's newsworthiness.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}} The chief sadhu himself vigorously denied being Bose.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=607}} Several intimates of Bose, including some politicians, who met with the sadhu, supported the denials.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=607}} Even so, the Subhasbadi Janata was able to create an elaborate chronology of Bose's post-war activities.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=607}}

According to this chronology, after his return to India, Bose returned to the vocation of his youth: he became a Hindu renunciant.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=607}} He attended unseen Gandhi's cremation in Delhi in early February 1948; walked across and around India several times; became a [[yogi]] at a Shiva temple in [[Bareilly]] in north central India from 1956 to 1959; became a practitioner of herbal medicine and effected several cures, including one of tuberculosis; and established the Shaulmari Ashram in 1959, taking the [[religious name]] Srimat Saradanandaji.{{#tag:ref|From [[Sanskrit]] ''śrīmat'' (voc., hon.) sir '''+''' ''śārǎdā'' 1. ''myth.'' a title of [[Saraswati]], 2.

Others stories appeared, spun by the Janata and by others.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} Bose was still in the [[Soviet Union]] or [[China|the People's Republic of China]]; attended the Indian prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s cremation in 1964, but, this time, neglecting to disallow a Janata-published newspaper to photograph him; and gave notice to the Janta of his return to Calcutta, for which several much publicized rallies were organized.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} Bose did not appear.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} The Janata eventually broke up, its reputation marred by successive non-appearances of its protagonist.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} The real sadhu of Shaulmari, who continued to deny he was Bose, died in 1977.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} It was also claimed that [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had reportedly told an interpreter during his New Delhi visit that Bose can be produced within 45 days if Nehru wishes.{{sfn|Bhattacharjee|2012}}

Still other stories or hoaxes—elucidated with conspiracies and accompanied with fake photographs—of the now-aging Bose being in the Soviet Union or China had traction well into the early 80s.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} Bose was seen in a photograph taken in Beijing, inexplicably parading with the [[Chinese Red Army]].{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=608}} Bose was said to be in a [[Soviet Gulag]]. The Soviet leadership was said to be blackmailing Nehru, and later, [[Indira Gandhi]], with the threat of releasing Bose.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|pp=608–609}} An Indian member of parliament, [[Samar Guha]], released in 1979 what he claimed was a contemporaneous photograph of Bose. This turned out to have been doctored, comprising one-half Bose and one-half his elder brother [[Sarat Chandra Bose]].{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=610}} Guha also charged Nehru with having had knowledge of Bose's incarceration in the Soviet Union even in the 1950s, a charge Guha recanted after he was sued.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=610}}

For the remainder of the century and into the next, the renunciant legends continued to appear. Most prominently, a retired judge, who had been appointed by the Indian Government in 1999 to undertake an enquiry into Bose's death, brought public notice to another [[sannyasi]] or renunciant, "Gumnami Baba,"{{#tag:ref|From [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ''gumnām'' (adj): whose name is lost, anonymous; '''+''' ''bābā'': colloq. a senior or respected male (term of address). In {{citation|last=McGregor|first=Ronald Stuart|authorlink=Ronald Stuart McGregor|title=The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MILAQgAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-864339-5|pages=270–271, 725 resp}}|group=nb}} also known by his religious name, "Bhagwanji,"{{#tag:ref|From [[Sanskrit]], ''bhagwān'': 1 (adj) glorious, divine, to be adored, worshipful; 2 (noun, m.) the supreme being (especially as equated with [[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]]-[[Krishna|Kṛṣṇa]]); ... 4 any revered person (term of address). In {{citation|last=McGregor|first=Ronald Stuart|authorlink=Ronald Stuart McGregor|title=The Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MILAQgAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-864339-5|pages=726}}|group=nb}} who was said to have lived in the town of [[Faizabad]] in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{Sfn|Bose|2011|p=319}} According to historian [[Sugata Bose]], &lt;blockquote&gt; In October 2002, he (the judge) sent letters to members of the Bose family asking them to donate one milliliter of blood for a DNA match with "one Gumnami Baba," who "some persons" had claimed was "none other than Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The evidence naturally did not support this bizarre theory."{{Sfn|Bose|2011|p=319}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Earlier, in 1977, summing up the extant Bose legends, historian [[Joyce Chapman Lebra]] had written, &lt;blockquote&gt; "Stories persist that Netaji has become a ''sannyasi'' (holy man) and has been seen in the [[Naga Hills|Naga hill]] country of [[Assam]]; that he was a member of a Mongolian trade delegation in [[Beijing|Peking]]; that he lives in Russia; that he is in the Chinese Army. ... Pictures have been produced to prove that Netaji is still alive. Bose's family have announced at times that he is in hiding and will return to India when the time is right. In February 1966, Suresh Chandra Bose announced in the press that his brother would return in March. To date, however, Bose has not reappeared to contradict the evidence that he died in the crash on Taiwan. But the myth lives on."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=198–199}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Perspectives on durability of legends===
According to historians Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper: &lt;blockquote&gt;The legend of 'Netaji' Bose's survival helped bind together the defeated INA. In Bengal it became an assurance of the province's supreme importance in the liberation of the motherland. It sustained the morale of many across India and Southeast Asia who deplored the return of British power or felt alienated from the political settlement finally achieved by Gandhi and Nehru.{{Sfn|Bayly|Harper|2007|p=22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Amid all this, Joyce Chapman Lebra,{{Sfn|Lebra|2008b|p=100}} wrote in 2008: &lt;blockquote&gt;" The Japanese have always wished to return the ashes to Bengal, as they believe that a soul will not rest in peace until the ashes are brought home. The prospect of having Netaji's ashes in Bengal, however, has been known to incite rioting, as happened one year at the annual 23 January convention at the [[Netaji Research Bureau]] in Calcutta. Hot-headed young Bengali radicals broke into the convention hall where [[Iwaichi Fujiwara|Fujiwara]], the founder of the INA, was to address the assemblage and shouted abuse at him. Apparently some newspaper had published a rumour that Fujiwara had brought Netaji's ashes back."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008b|p=100}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Enquiries==

===Figgess Report 1946===
Confronted with rumours about Bose, which had begun to spread within days of his death, the [[South East Asia Command|Supreme Allied Command, South-east Asia]], under [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]], tasked Colonel (later Sir) John Figgess, an intelligence officer, with investigating Bose's death.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}} Figgess's report, submitted on 25 July 1946, however, was confidential, being work done in [[Indian Political Intelligence Office|Indian Political Intelligence]] (IPI), a partially secret branch of the Government of India.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}} Figgess was interviewed in the 1980s by historian Leonard A. Gordon and confirmed writing the report.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}} In 1997, the British Government made most of the IPI files available for public viewing in the [[India Office Records]] of the [[British Library]].{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=109}} However, the Figgess report was not among them.  A photocopy of the Figess report was soon anonymously donated for public viewing to the British Library in the European manuscripts collection, as Eur. MSS. c 785.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=110}} Good candidates for the donor, according to historian Leonard Gordon, are Figgess himself, who had died in 1997, or more likely another British intelligence officer in wartime India, Hugh Toye, the author of the book, {{citation|last=Toye|first=Hugh|title=The Springing Tiger: A Study of the Indian National Army and of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ACwkShmNzUC|year=1959|publisher=Allied Publishers|location=Bombay|isbn=978-81-8424-392-5}}.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=110}}

The crucial paragraph in the Figgess report (by Colonel John Figgess, Indian Political Intelligence, 25 July 1946,) is:{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=110}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"As a result of a series of interrogations of individuals named in the following paragraphs it is confirmed as certain that S.C. Bose died in a Taihoku Military Hospital (Nammon Ward) sometime between 1700 hours and 2000 hours local time on the August 18, 1945. The cause of death was heart failure resulting from multiple burns and shock. All the persons named below were interrogated at different times but the several accounts of the event agree both in substance and detail at all points where the knowledge of the subjects could have been deemed to be based on common experience. The possibility of a pre-arranged fabrication must be excluded since most of the individuals concerned had no opportunity of contact with one another prior to interrogation."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The remaining four pages of the Figgess report contain interviews with two survivors of the plane crash, Lt. Cols. Nonogaki and Sakai, with Dr. Yoshimi, who treated Bose in the hospital and with others involved in post-death arrangements.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=110}} In 1979, Leonard Gordon himself interviewed "Lt. Cols. Nonogaki and Sakai, and, (in addition, plane-crash survivor) Major Kono; Dr. Yoshimi ...; the Japanese orderly who sat in the room through these treatments; and the Japanese officer, Lt. Hayashita, who carried Bose's ashes from the crematorium in Taipei to Japan."{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=110}}

The Figgess report and Leonard Gordon's investigations confirm four facts: 
* The crash near Taihoku airport on 18 August 1945 of a plane on which Subhas Chandra Bose was a passenger; 
* Bose's death in the nearby military hospital on the same day; 
* Bose's cremation in Taihoku; and 
* transfer of Bose's ashes to Tokyo.{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|p=110}}

===Shah Nawaz Committee 1956===
With the goal of quelling the rumours about what happened to Subhas Chandra Bose after mid-August 1945, the Government of India in 1956 appointed a three-man committee headed by [[Shah Nawaz Khan (General)|Shah Nawaz Khan]].{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}} Khan was at the time a Member of Parliament as well as a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian National Army and the best-known defendant in the [[INA Trials]] of a decade before.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}} The other members of the committee were S. N. Maitra, [[Indian Civil Service|ICS]], who was nominated by the Government of [[West Bengal]], and Suresh Chandra Bose, an elder brother of Bose.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}} The committee is referred to as the "Shah Nawaj Committee" or the "Netaji Inquiry Committee."{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}

From April to July 1956, the committee interviewed 67 witnesses in India, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}} In particular, the committee interviewed all the survivors of the plane crash, some of whom had scars on their bodies from burns.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} The committee interviewed Dr. Yoshimi, the surgeon at the Taihoku Military Hospital who treated Bose in his last hours.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} It also interviewed Bose's Indian companion on the flight, Habib ur Rahman, who, after the partition, had moved to Pakistan and had burn scars from the plane crash.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} Although there were minor discrepancies here and there in the evidence, the first two members of the committee, Khan and Maitra, concluded that Bose had died in the plane crash in [[Taipei|Taihoku]] on 18 August 1945.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}}

Bose's brother, Suresh Chandra Bose, however, after having signed off on the initial conclusions, declined to sign the final report.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} He, moreover, wrote a dissenting note in which he claimed that the other members and staff of the Shah Nawaz Committee had deliberately withheld some crucial evidence from him, that the committee had been directed by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to infer death by plane crash, and that the other committee members, along with Bengal's chief minister [[B. C. Roy]], had pressured him bluntly to sign the conclusions of their final report.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}}

According to historian Leonard A. Gordon,{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}} &lt;blockquote&gt; "Out of the 181-page repetitious document that constitutes Suresh Bose's report, one main principle for dealing with the evidence emerges: if two or more stories by witnesses have any discrepancies between them, then the whole testimony of the witnesses involved is thereby discredited and assumed to be false. Using this principle, Bose is able to ... find that there was no crash and that his brother lives. There also appears to be one other half-stated assumption: Subhas Bose could not die before India achieved her freedom. Therefore he did not die in the plane crash said to have taken place on August 18, 1945."{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=605}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Khosla Commission 1970===
In 1977, two decades after the Shah Nawaz committee had reported its findings, historian Joyce Chapman Lebra wrote about Suresh Chandra Bose's dissenting note: "Whatever Mr Bose's motives in issuing his minority report, he has helped to perpetuate until the present the faith that Subhas Chandra Bose still lives."{{Sfn|Lebra|2008a|pp=197–198}} In fact, during the early 1960s, the rumours about Subhas Bose's extant forms only increased.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}}

In 1970, the Government of India appointed a new commission to enquire into the "disappearance" of Bose.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}} With a view to heading off more minority reports, this time it was a "one-man commission."{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}} The single investigator was G. D. Khosla, a retired chief justice of the Punjab High Court.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}} As Justice Khosla had other duties, he submitted his report only in 1974.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}}

Justice Khosla, who brought his legal background to bear on the issue in a methodical fashion,{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|pp=110–111}} not only concurred with the earlier reports of Figess and the Shah Nawaz Committee on the main facts of Bose's death,{{Sfn|Gordon|2006|pp=110–111}} but also evaluated the alternative explanations of Bose's disappearance and the motives of those promoting stories of Netaji sightings.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}}  Historian Leonard A. Gordon writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Justice Khosla suggests the motives of many of the story-purveyors are less than altruistic. Some, he says, have clearly been driven by political goals or simply wanted to call attention to themselves. His patience in listening to some tales is surely remarkable. What could he, or anyone, have thought as he listened to the testimony of P. M. Karapurkar, agent of the Central Bank of India at Sholapur, who '... claimed that he receives direct messages from Bose by tuning his body like a radio receiving apparatus.{{Sfn|Gordon|1990|p=606}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mukherjee Commission 2005===
In 1999, following a court order, the Indian government appointed retired Supreme Court judge [[Manoj Kumar Mukherjee]] to probe the death of Bose. The commission perused hundreds of files on Bose's death drawn from several countries and visited Japan, Russia and Taiwan. Although oral accounts were in favour of the plane crash, the commission concluded that those accounts could not be relied upon and that there was a secret plan to ensure Bose's safe passage to the USSR with the knowledge of Japanese authorities and Habibur Rahman. The commission observed that the ashes kept at the Renkoji temple, reported to be Bose's, were of Ichiro Okura, a Japanese soldier who died of cardiac arrest.{{sfn|Ramesh|2006}}

The Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to on November 8, 2005. The report was tabled in the Indian Parliament on May 17, 2006. The Indian Government rejected the findings of the commission{{sfn|Ramesh|2006}}

===Japanese government report 1956, declassified September 2016===

An investigative report by Japanese government titled "Investigation on the cause of death and other matters of the late Subhas Chandra Bose" was declassified on 1 September 2016. It concluded that Bose died in a plane crash in Taiwan on 18 August 1945. The report was completed in January 1956 and was handed over to the Indian embassy in [[Tokyo]], but was not made public for more than 60 years as it was classified. According to the report, just after takeoff a propellor blade on the airplane in which Bose was traveling broke off and the engine fell off the plane, which then crashed and burst into flames. When Bose exited it his clothes caught fire and he was severely burned. He was admitted to hospital, and although he was conscious and able to carry on a conversation for some time he died several hours later.{{sfn|Sonwalkar|2016}}{{sfn|NDTV|2016}}

{{Global surveillance}}
{{NSA surveillance}}

'''Edward Joseph Snowden''' (born June 21, 1983) is an American [[computer professional]], former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] who copied and [[news leak|leaked]] [[classified information]] from the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) in 2013. [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|His disclosures]] revealed numerous [[global surveillance]] programs, many run by the NSA and the [[Five Eyes|Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance]] with the cooperation of [[Telephone company|telecommunication companies]] and European governments.

In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, [[Booz Allen Hamilton]], after previous employment with [[Dell]] and the CIA.&lt;ref name="VanityFair"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Bryan |last1=Burrough |first2=Sarah |last2=Ellison |first3=Suzanna |last3=Andrews |title=The Snowden Saga: A Shadowland of Secrets and Light |date=April 23, 2014 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |website=Vanity Fair |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/05/edward-snowden-politics-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to [[Hong Kong]] after leaving his job at an [[Hawaii Cryptologic Center|NSA facility in Hawaii]], and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists [[Glenn Greenwald]], [[Laura Poitras]], and [[Ewen MacAskill]]. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Further disclosures were made by other publications including ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.

On June 21, 2013, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and theft of government property,&lt;ref name="wapocharges" /&gt; following which the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] revoked his passport.&lt;ref name="KerryPassport" /&gt;  Two days later, he flew into [[Moscow]]'s [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Sheremetyevo Airport]], but Russian authorities noted that his [[United States passport|U.S. passport]] had been cancelled, and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month. Russia ultimately recognized his [[right of asylum]], with a visa for residence for one year.  Repeated extensions have permitted him to stay at least until 2020. In early 2016, he became the president of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]], an organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/reporters-need-edward-snowden/|title=Edward Snowden's New Job: Protecting Reporters From Spies|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=February 2017|first=Andy|last=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, he was living in an undisclosed location in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/18/russia-extends-edward-snowdens-asylum-2020/ |title=Russia Extends Edward Snowden Asylum until 2020 |work=The Telegraph |date=January 18, 2017 |first=Roland |last=Oliphant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a [[whistleblower]], a [[dissident]], a [[treason|traitor]], and a [[patriotism|patriot]]. His disclosures have fueled debates over [[mass surveillance]], [[Secrecy#Government secrecy|government secrecy]], and the balance between [[national security]] and [[information privacy]].

====Employment at CIA====
After attending a 2006 job-fair focused on intelligence agencies, Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA.&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt;&lt;ref name=JacobJijo&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jacob Jijo |title=Edward Snowden Scandal: CIA Sent Him Home But NSA Hired Him Later |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/edward-snowden-scandal-cia-nsa-hired-warning-513190 |publisher=International Business Times |accessdate=January 30, 2014 |date=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt;

In May 2006, Snowden wrote in ''Ars Technica'' that he had no trouble getting work because he was a "computer wizard".&lt;ref name="nyt-ambition" /&gt; After distinguishing himself as a junior employee on the top computer-team, Snowden was sent to the CIA's secret school for technology specialists, where he lived in a hotel for six months while studying and training full-time.&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt;

In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with [[diplomatic cover]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security.&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/06/10/190293209/who-is-edward-snowden-the-nsa-leaker |title=Who Is Edward Snowden, The Self-Styled NSA Leaker? |first=Mark |last=Memmott |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assigned to the [[Diplomatic mission|U.S. mission]] to the [[United Nations]], Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four-bedroom apartment near [[Lake Geneva]].&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt; According to Greenwald, while there Snowden was "considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert" in that country and "was hand-picked by the CIA to support the president at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=No Place to Hide |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |page=43 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Books]] |date=2014 |isbn=978-1627790734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative, stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home.

Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting."&lt;ref name= EditedTranscript&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden interview – the edited transcript |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-interview-transcript |date=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden subsequently told ''Wired'' that while at Dell in 2011, "I would sit down with the [[Chief information officer|CIO]] of the CIA, the [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches. They would tell me their hardest technology problems, and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them."&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt;

Of his time as an NSA analyst, directing the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the "fringe benefits" of the work.&lt;ref name=Ispy&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rusbridger |first1=Alan |last2=MacAskill |first2=Ewen |title=I, spy: Edward Snowden in exile |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/-sp-edward-snowden-interview-rusbridger-macaskill |date=July 18, 2014 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Army General [[Martin Dempsey]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], told the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]], "The vast majority of the documents that Snowden ... exfiltrated from our highest levels of security ... had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities.

According to Snowden, he did not indiscriminately turn over documents to journalists, stating that "I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest.

In June 2014, the NSA's recently installed director, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Michael S. Rogers]], said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden, the damage done was not significant enough to conclude that "the sky is falling."&lt;ref name=SkyNotFalling&gt;Sanger, David E.

''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in February 2015, Rogers said that Snowden's disclosures had a material impact on the NSA's detection and evaluation of terrorist activities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/23/politics/nsa-surveillance-north-korea/ |title=NSA: Snowden leaks hurt ability to track terrorists |publisher=CNN |date=February 23, 2015 |first=Aaron |last=Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2015, UK's ''Sunday Times'' reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than 1 million classified files in the Snowden cache, forcing the UK's [[MI6]] intelligence agency to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries. [[Sir David Omand]], a former director of the UK's [[GCHQ]] intelligence gathering agency, described it as a huge strategic setback that was harming Britain, America, and their NATO allies.

''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications, such as encrypting email, too annoying to employ. Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker [[Laura Poitras]] in January 2013.&lt;ref name="poitras-how"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2013/06/10/qa_with_laura_poitras_the_woman_behind_the_nsa_scoops/ |title=How we broke the NSA story |last=Carmon |first=Irin |date=June 10, 2013 |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her ''New York Times'' article about NSA whistleblower [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Packer |first=George |authorlink=George Packer |authormask= |date=October 20, 2014 |title=The Holder of Secrets |department=Profiles |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |volume=90 |issue=32 |pages=50–59 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/20/holder-secrets}}&lt;/ref&gt; What originally attracted Snowden to both Greenwald and Poitras was a ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras' controversial films had made her a target of the government.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Snowden communicated using [[Email encryption|encrypted email]],&lt;ref name="poitras-how" /&gt; and going by the codename "[[:wikt:verax|Verax]]".

According to Gellman, prior to their first meeting in person, Snowden wrote, "I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions, and that the return of this information to the public marks my end."&lt;ref name="gellman-recount" /&gt; Snowden also told Gellman that until the articles were published, the journalists working with him would also be at mortal risk from the [[United States Intelligence Community]] "if they think you are the single point of failure that could stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information."&lt;ref name="gellman-recount" /&gt;

In May 2013, Snowden was permitted temporary leave from his position at the NSA in Hawaii, on the pretext of receiving treatment for his [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="guardian-reveal" /&gt; In mid-May, Snowden gave an electronic interview to Poitras and [[Jacob Appelbaum]] which was published weeks later by ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.&lt;ref name="Der Spiegel"&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Whistleblower Edward Snowden on Global Spying |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=December 18, 2013 |date=July 8, 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qq1jHlUe?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006.html |archivedate=July 5, 2014 |df=mdy}} (, [http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006-2.html Page 2], [https://www.webcitation.org/6Qq24BvDP?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-whistleblower-edward-snowden-on-global-spying-a-910006-2.html Page 2 Archive]) – Originally published in German in Issue 28/2013, July 8, 2013.

Snowden said in a January 2014 interview with German television that the NSA does not limit its data collection to national security issues, accusing the agency of conducting [[industrial espionage]]. Using the example of German company [[Siemens]], he said, "If there's information at Siemens that's beneficial to US national interests—even if it doesn't have anything to do with national security—then they'll take that information nevertheless."&lt;ref name=ReutersIndustrialEsp&gt;{{cite news |title=Snowden: NSA conducts industrial espionage too |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/26/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |date=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Snowden's revelations and in response to an inquiry from the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]], Germany's domestic security agency [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV)]] investigated and found no concrete evidence that the U.S. conducted economic or industrial espionage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spähangriffe auf deutsche Firmen |url=https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/print_wirtschaft/article131087264/Spaehangriffe-auf-deutsche-Firmen.html |work=Die Welt |date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, documents disclosed by Glenn Greenwald writing for ''The Intercept'' showed the NSA, in cooperation with the GCHQ, has plans to infect millions of computers with [[malware]] using a program called [[TURBINE (US government project)|TURBINE]].&lt;ref name=InterceptMalware&gt;{{cite web |last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |title=How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/ |work=The Intercept |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations included information about [[XKeyscore#Workings|QUANTUMHAND]], a program through which the NSA set up a fake [[Facebook]] server to intercept connections.&lt;ref name=InterceptMalware /&gt;

According to a report in ''The Washington Post'' in July 2014, relying on information furnished by Snowden, 90% of those placed under surveillance in the U.S. are ordinary Americans, and are not the intended targets. The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails, message texts, and online accounts, that support the claim.&lt;ref name="NSAusa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vast majority of NSA spy targets are mistakenly monitored |url=http://www.philadelphianews.net/index.php/sid/223558101/scat/c08dd24cec417021/ht/Vast-majority-of-NSA-spy-targets-are-mistakenly-monitored |accessdate=July 7, 2014 |publisher=''Philadelphia News.Net''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2014 interview, Snowden for the first time disclosed a [[cyberwarfare]] program in the works, codenamed [[MonsterMind]], that would automate detection of a foreign [[cyberattack]] as it began and automatically fire back. "These attacks can be [[Spoofing attack|spoofed]]," said Snowden. "You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?"&lt;ref name=BamfordWired /&gt;

Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.&lt;ref name="VanityFair" /&gt; After the disclosures, his identity was made public by ''The Guardian'' at his request on June 9, 2013.&lt;ref name="politico-journalist-spat" /&gt; "I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded," he said. "My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them."&lt;ref name="snowdenfirstguardianvideo"&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video |title=NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden: 'I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of things' |format=video |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden said he wanted to "embolden others to step forward" by demonstrating that "they can win."&lt;ref&gt;Gellman, Barton. (June 9, 2013) [https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-09/world/39856622_1_intelligence-powers-single-point "Code name 'Verax': Snowden, in exchanges with Post reporter, made clear he knew risks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201065806/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-09/world/39856622_1_intelligence-powers-single-point |date=December 1, 2013 }}. ''The Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the system for reporting problems did not work. "You have to report wrongdoing to those most responsible for it." He cited a lack of whistleblower protection for government contractors, the use of the 1917 [[Espionage Act]] to prosecute leakers, and his belief that had he used internal mechanisms to "sound the alarm," his revelations "would have been buried forever."&lt;ref name=Risen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/18/edward-snowden-us-would-have-buried-nsa-warnings-forever Edward Snowden: US would have buried NSA warnings forever]. ''The Guardian''. (October 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, upon learning that a U.S. federal judge had ruled the collection of U.S. phone metadata conducted by the NSA as likely unconstitutional, Snowden said, "I acted on my belief that the NSA's mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts ... today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans' rights."&lt;ref name=20131217Times&gt;{{cite news |title=Federal Judge Rules Against N.S.A.

In January 2014, Snowden said his "breaking point" was "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directly lie under oath to Congress."&lt;ref name=ARDtranscript /&gt; This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald,&lt;ref name="Maass" /&gt; and nine months after the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads during the summer of 2012&lt;ref name="VanityFair" /&gt;—in which Clapper denied to the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=Watch Top U.S. Intelligence Officials Repeatedly Deny NSA Spying On Americans Over The Last Year (Videos) |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/06/06/watch-top-u-s-intelligence-officials-repeatedly-deny-nsa-spying-on-americans-over-the-last-year-videos/ |work=[[Forbes]] |date=June 6, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden said, "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions.

==Flight from the United States==

In May 2013, Snowden took a leave of absence, telling his supervisors he was returning to the mainland for [[epilepsy]] treatment, but instead left Hawaii for Hong Kong&lt;ref name="RollingStone"&gt;Janet Reitman (December 4, 2013), [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/snowden-and-greenwald-the-men-who-leaked-the-secrets-20131204 Snowden and Greenwald: The Men Who Leaked the Secrets] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;/ref&gt; where he arrived on May 20. Snowden told ''Guardian'' reporters in June that he had been in his room at the [[The Mira Hong Kong|Mira Hotel]] since his arrival in the city, rarely going out. On June 10, correspondent [[Ewen MacAskill]] said Snowden had left his hotel only briefly three times since May 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1306/10/cnr.01.html CNN NEWSROOM Transcripts] ''[[CNN]]'' June 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, [[María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste]], accused Julian Assange of putting Morales's life at risk by intentionally providing to the U.S. false rumors that Snowden was on Morales' plane.

In a July 1 statement published by WikiLeaks, Snowden accused the U.S. government of "using citizenship as a weapon" and using what he described as "old, bad tools of political aggression." Citing Obama's promise to not allow "wheeling and dealing" over the case, Snowden commented, "This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile."&lt;ref&gt;[http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/07/01/alleged-snowden-statement-obama-administration-using-citizenship-as-a-weapon/ Alleged Snowden Statement: Obama Administration 'Using Citizenship As A Weapon' « CBS DC].

==Criminal charges==
On June 14, 2013, United States federal prosecutors filed a criminal complaint against Snowden, charging him with theft of government property and two counts of violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] through unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.&lt;ref name="wapocharges"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-charges-snowden-with-espionage/2013/06/21/507497d8-dab1-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html |title=U.S. charges Snowden with espionage |date=June 21, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |first1=Peter |last1=Finn |first2=Sari |last2=Horwitz |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holderletter /&gt; Each of the three charges carries a maximum possible prison term of ten years. The charge was initially secret and was unsealed a week later.

Snowden was asked in a January 2014 interview about returning to the U.S. to face the charges in court, as Obama had suggested a few days prior. Snowden explained why he rejected the request: "What he doesn't say are that the crimes that he's charged me with are crimes that don't allow me to make my case. They don't allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ... So it's, I would say, illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial."&lt;ref name=ARDtranscript /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transcript corrected from "to my benefit" to "to their benefit" per [http://vimeo.com/85736856 video at 29:20]&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden's legal representative, [[Jesselyn Radack]], wrote that "the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court."

====Government officials====
Numerous high-ranking current or former [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] officials reacted publicly to Snowden's disclosures.

:'''2013'''
:*Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned the leaks as doing "huge, grave damage" to U.S. intelligence capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Blake |first=Aaron |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/09/clapper-leaks-are-literally-gut-wrenching-leaker-being-sought/ |title=Clapper: Leaks are 'literally gut-wrenching,' leaker being sought |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-CIA director [[R. James Woolsey, Jr.|James Woolsey]] said that if Snowden were convicted of treason, he should be hanged.&lt;ref name="Fox News Channel"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/17/ex-cia-director-snowden-should-be-hanged-if-convicted-for-treason/ |title=Ex-CIA director: Snowden should be 'hanged' if convicted for treason |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''2014'''
:*[[House Intelligence Committee]] chairman [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] and ranking member [[Dutch Ruppersberger]] said a classified Pentagon report written by military intelligence officials contended that Snowden's leaks had put U.S. troops at risk and prompted terrorists to change their tactics, and that most files copied were related to current U.S. military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dilanian |first=Ken |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-snowden-intel-20140110,0,4005644.story#axzz2q3PiJALa |title=Snowden leaks severely hurt U.S. security, two House members say |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 9, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*President [[Barack Obama]] said that "our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets. If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy." Obama also objected to the "sensational" way the leaks had been reported, saying the reporting often "shed more heat than light." He went on to assert that the disclosures had revealed "methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2014/01/17/263480199/transcript-of-president-obamas-speech-on-nsa-reforms Transcript Of President Obama's Speech On NSA Reforms] [[NPR]] January 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Former congressman [[Ron Paul]] began a petition urging the Obama Administration to grant Snowden [[clemency]].&lt;ref name=APPaul&gt;{{cite news |title=Ron Paul starts Snowden clemency petition |url=https://news.yahoo.com/ron-paul-starts-snowden-clemency-petition-155138542--politics.html |work=Yahoo |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul released a video on his website saying, "Edward Snowden sacrificed his livelihood, citizenship, and freedom by exposing the disturbing scope of the NSA's worldwide spying program. Thanks to one man's courageous actions, Americans know about the truly egregious ways their government is spying on them."&lt;ref name=WaPoPaul&gt;{{cite news |last=Lee |first=Timothy |title=The Switchboard: Ron Paul starts petition for Snowden clemency |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/02/14/the-switchboard-ron-paul-starts-petition-for-sonwden-clemency/ |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[John Michael McConnell|Mike McConnell]]—former NSA director and current vice chairman at Booz Allen Hamilton—said that Snowden was motivated by revenge when the NSA did not offer him the job he wanted. "At this point," said McConnell, "he being narcissistic and having failed at most everything he did, he decides now I'm going to turn on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hartmann |first=Margaret |title=Booz Allen Exec Describes How Snowden Deceived His Former Employer |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/02/booz-allen-exec-describes-how-snowden-did-it.html |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=February 5, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Former president [[Jimmy Carter]] said that if he were still president today he would "certainly consider" giving Snowden a pardon were he to be found guilty and imprisoned for his leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1= |last1= |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jimmy-carter-if-i-were-president-i-would-consider-pardoning-snowden/ |title=Jimmy Carter: If I Were President, I Would Consider Pardoning Snowden |newspaper=Medialite |date=April 3, 2014 |accessdate=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Former secretary of state [[Hillary Clinton]] said, "[W]e have all these protections for whistleblowers. If [Snowden] were concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate…it struck me as…sort of odd that he would flee to China, because Hong Kong is controlled by China, and that he would then go to Russia—two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships." As Clinton saw it, "turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/defense/hillary-clinton-edward-snowden-s-leaks-helped-terrorists-20140425 |title=Hillary Clinton: Edward Snowden's Leaks Helped Terrorists |publisher=NationalJournal.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton later said that if Snowden wished to return to the U.S., "knowing he would be held accountable," he would have the right "to launch both a legal defense and a public defense, which can of course affect the legal defense."&lt;ref name="ClintonJuly4"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenwood |first=Phoebe |title=Edward Snowden should have right to legal defence in US, says Hillary Clinton |work=The Guardian |date=July 4, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/04/edward-snowden-legal-defence-hillary-clinton-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] said Snowden had "damaged his country very significantly" and "hurt operational security" by telling terrorists how to evade detection. "The bottom line," Kerry added, "is this man has betrayed his country, sitting in Russia where he has taken refuge. You know, he should man up and come back to the United States."&lt;ref name=ManUp&gt;{{cite news |title=Kerry: Edward Snowden should "man up" and come home |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sec-kerry-edward-snowden-should-man-up-and-come-home/ |publisher=CBS News |date=May 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Al Gore]] said Snowden "clearly violated the law so you can't say OK, what he did is all right. It's not. But what he revealed in the course of violating important laws included violations of the U.S. constitution that were way more serious than the crimes he committed. In the course of violating important law, he also provided an important service. ... Because we did need to know how far this has gone."&lt;ref name=GuardianAlGore&gt;{{cite web |last=MacAskill |first=Ewen |title=Edward Snowden's NSA leaks 'an important service', says Al Gore |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/10/edward-snowden-nsa-leaks-important-service-al-gore |work=The Guardian |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*In December, President Obama nominated former [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|deputy defense secretary]] [[Ashton Carter]] to succeed outgoing [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Chuck Hagel]]. Seven months before, Carter had said, "We had a cyber Pearl Harbor. His name was Edward Snowden." Carter charged that U.S. security officials "screwed up spectacularly in the case of Snowden. And this knucklehead had access to destructive power that was much more than any individual person should have access to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitlock |first=Craig |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ash-carter-passed-over-before-gets-picked-by-obama-to-lead-pentagon/2014/12/05/33a2429a-7c95-11e4-9a27-6fdbc612bff8_story.html |title=Ashton Carter, passed over before, gets picked by Obama to be defense secretary |work=The Washington Post |date=December 5, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate====
In the U.S., Snowden's actions precipitated an intense debate on privacy and warrantless domestic surveillance.&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/rieder/2013/06/12/rem-rieder-surveillance/2415753/ Rieder: Snowden's NSA bombshell sparks debate].

In June 2013, U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of Vermont wrote on his blog, "Love him or hate him, we all owe Snowden our thanks for forcing upon the nation an important debate. But the debate shouldn't be about him. It should be about the gnawing questions his actions raised from the shadows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/must-read/why-i-dont-care-about-edward-snowden |title=Why I Don't Care About Edward Snowden |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |work=Sen. Bernie Sanders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snowden said in December 2013 that he was "inspired by the global debate" ignited by the leaks and that NSA's "culture of indiscriminate global espionage ... is collapsing."&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/report-snowden-would-help-brazil-if-given-asylum/2013/12/17/6ca6b7f8-66f0-11e3-997b-9213b17dac97_story.html |title=Snowden bides for political asylum in Brazil - The Washington Post |date=December 17, 2013 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217122329/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/report-snowden-would-help-brazil-if-given-asylum/2013/12/17/6ca6b7f8-66f0-11e3-997b-9213b17dac97_story.html |archivedate=December 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2013, however, ''The Washington Post'' noted that the public debate and its offshoots had produced no meaningful change in policy, with the status quo continuing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

In 2016, on ''The Axe Files'' [[Political podcast|podcast]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Eric Holder]] said that Snowden "performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made." Holder nevertheless said that Snowden's actions were inappropriate and illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/30/politics/axe-files-axelrod-eric-holder/index.html |title=Eric Holder says Edward Snowden performed a 'public service' |last=Jaffe |first=Matthew |date=May 30, 2016 |website=cnn.com |publisher=[[Cable News Network (CNN)]]| access-date = May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, the bipartisan [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] completed a review of the Snowden disclosures and said that the federal government would have to spend millions of dollars responding to the fallout from Snowden's disclosures.&lt;ref name="HouseReport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hpsci_snowden_review_-_unclass_summary_-_final.pdf |title=Executive Summary of Review of the Unauthorized Disclosures of Former National Security Agency Contractor Edward Snowden |publisher=[[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] |date=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also said that "the public narrative popularized by Snowden and his allies is rife with falsehoods, exaggerations, and crucial omissions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2016/0916/Hollywood-and-Washington-battle-to-define-Snowden-s-image |title=Hollywood and Washington battle to define Snowden's image |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was denounced by ''Washington Post'' reporter [[Barton Gellman]], who called it "aggressively dishonest" and "contemptuous of fact."&lt;ref&gt;[[Barton Gellman]] (September 16, 2016), [https://tcf.org/content/commentary/house-intelligence-committees-terrible-horrible-bad-snowden-report/ The House Intelligence Committee’s Terrible, Horrible, Very Bad Snowden Report] ''[[The Century Foundation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential panel====
In August 2013, President Obama said that he had called for a review of U.S. surveillance activities before Snowden had begun revealing details of the NSA's operations,&lt;ref name=CNN081313 /&gt; and announced that he was directing DNI James Clapper "to establish a review group on intelligence and communications technologies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=MacAskill |first=Ewen |title=White House insists James Clapper will not lead NSA surveillance review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/13/white-house-james-clapper-nsa-surveillance-review |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farivar |first=Cyrus |title=Obama's 'outside experts' surveillance review panel has deep ties to gov't |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/08/obamas-reported-outside-experts-surveillance-review-panel-has-deep-ties-to-govt/ |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the task force issued 46 recommendations that, if adopted, would subject the NSA to additional scrutiny by the courts, Congress, and the president, and would strip the NSA of the authority to infiltrate American computer systems using [[backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] in hardware or software.&lt;ref name=reviewpanel&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |title=Obama panel recommends new limits on N.S.A. spying |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/report-on-nsa-surveillance-tactics.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 18, 2013 |author2=Savage, Charlie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panel member [[Geoffrey R.

====Court rulings====
On June 6, 2013, in the wake of Snowden's leaks, conservative public interest lawyer and [[Judicial Watch]] founder [[Larry Klayman]] filed a lawsuit claiming that the federal government had unlawfully collected metadata for his telephone calls and was harassing him. In ''[[Klayman v. Obama]]'', Judge [[Richard J. Leon]] referred to the NSA's "almost-Orwellian technology" and ruled the bulk telephony metadata program to be probably unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=WaPoUnconstitutional&gt;{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |title=Judge: NSA's collecting of phone records is probably unconstitutional |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-nsas-collecting-of-phone-records-is-likely-unconstitutional/2013/12/16/6e098eda-6688-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |date=December 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden later described Judge Leon's decision as vindication.&lt;ref name=PoliticoPulizer&gt;{{cite web |last=Byers |first=Dylan |title=Edward Snowden looms over Pulitzer Prizes |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/edward-snowden-pulitzer-prize-washington-post-guardian-nsa-104608.html |work=Politico |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, alleging that the NSA's phone records program was unconstitutional. In December 2013, ten days after Judge Leon's ruling, Judge [[William H. Pauley III]] came to the opposite conclusion. In ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'', although acknowledging that privacy concerns are not trivial, Pauley found that the potential benefits of surveillance outweigh these considerations and ruled that the NSA's collection of phone data is legal.&lt;ref name=NYTBulkLegal&gt;{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Adam |title=Judge Upholds NSA's Bulk Collection of Data on Calls |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |date=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Schmitt, former staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote that "The two decisions have generated public confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA's data collection program—a kind of judicial 'he-said, she-said' standoff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/tale-two-judges_773264.html |title=A Tale of Two Judges |work=The Weekly Standard |date=January 13, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2015, in the case of ''ACLU v. Clapper'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] said that [[Section 215]] of the [[Patriot Act]] did not authorize the NSA to collect Americans' calling records in bulk, as exposed by Snowden in 2013. The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act. Circuit Judge [[Gerard E. Lynch]] wrote that, given the national security interests at stake, it was prudent to give Congress an opportunity to debate and decide the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/07/usa-security-nsa-idUSL1N0XY1OK20150507 |title=U.S. NSA's phone spying program ruled illegal by appeals court |agency=Reuters |date=May 7, 2015 |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====USA Freedom Act====
On June 2, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed, and President Obama signed, the [[USA Freedom Act]] which restored in modified form several provisions of the [[Patriot Act]] that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies. The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations.&lt;ref name="CNN passes"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=NSA surveillance bill passes after weeks-long showdown |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/02/politics/senate-usa-freedom-act-vote-patriot-act-nsa/ |website=CNN |accessdate=June 12, 2015 |quote="The bill's passage is the culmination of efforts to reform the NSA that blossomed out of NSA leaker Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/02/411534447/senateis-poised-to-vote-on-house-approved-usa-freedom-act |title=Senate Approves USA Freedom Act, After Amendments Fail : The Two-Way : NPR |date=June 2, 2015 |work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Georg Maaßen]], head of the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]], Germany's domestic security agency, said that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diepresse.com/home/politik/aussenpolitik/5012057/Deutscher-Verfassungsschutz_Snowden-womoglich-russischer-Spion |title=German Constitutional Protection: Snowden could be Russian spy (German) |date=June 10, 2016 |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden has rejected this insinuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/edward-snowden-interview-there-is-still-hope-a-1166752.html |title=Interview with Edward Snowden: 'There Is Still Hope - Even for Me' |date=September 12, 2017 |first1=Martin |last1=Knobbe |first2=Jörg |last2=Schindler |newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]] |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveys conducted by news outlets and professional polling organizations found that American public opinion was divided on Snowden's disclosures, and that those polled in Canada and Europe were more supportive of Snowden than respondents in the U.S.

===Recognition===
{{Main|Awards received by Edward Snowden}}
For his global surveillance disclosures, Snowden has been honored by publications and organizations based in Europe and the United States. He was voted as ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s person of the year 2013, garnering four times the number of votes as any other candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/edward-snowden-voted-guardian-person-of-year-2013 Edward Snowden voted Guardian person of the year 2013] The Guardian December 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teleconference speaking engagements===
[[File:Edward Snowden's Surprise Appearance at TED.jpg|thumb|right|Speaking via telepresence robot, Snowden addresses the TED conference from Russia.]]
In March 2014, Snowden spoke at the [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) Interactive technology conference in [[Austin, Texas]], in front of 3,500 attendees. He participated by teleconference carried over multiple routers running the [[Google Hangouts]] platform. On-stage moderators were [[Christopher Soghoian]] and Snowden's legal counsel Wizner, both from the ACLU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/10/tech/web/edward-snowden-sxsw/ |title=Edward Snowden speaks at SXSW, calls for public oversight of U.S. spy programs |last1=Griggs |first1=Brandon |last2=Gross |first2=Doug |date=March 10, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |work=CNN Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden said that the NSA was "setting fire to the future of the internet," and that the SXSW audience was "the firefighters."&lt;ref name=DeLuca2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-03-12/news/48122662_1_edward-snowden-nsa-leaker-snowden-southwest-interactive |title=NSA leaker Snowden is the rock star of SXSW Interactive |last=DeLuca |first=Dan |date=March 12, 2014 |work=The Inquirer |publisher=Philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-03/10/edward-snowden-sxsw |title=Snowden: the NSA is 'setting fire to the future of the internet' |last=Clark |first=Liat |date=March 10, 2014 |work=Wired |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505113952/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-03/10/edward-snowden-sxsw |archivedate=May 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Edward-Snowden-pushes-Web-privacy-at-South-by-5305080.php |title=Edward Snowden pushes Web privacy at South by Southwest |last=Garling |first=Caleb |date=March 11, 2014 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees could use Twitter to send questions to Snowden, who answered one by saying that information gathered by corporations was much less dangerous than that gathered by a government agency, because "governments have the power to deprive you of your rights."&lt;ref name=DeLuca2014 /&gt; Representative [[Mike Pompeo]] (R-KS) of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]], and later [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|director of the CIA]], had tried unsuccessfully to get the SXSW management to cancel Snowden's appearance; instead, SXSW director Hugh Forrest said that the NSA was welcome to respond to Snowden at the 2015 conference.&lt;ref name=DeLuca2014 /&gt;

Later that month, Snowden appeared by teleconference at the [[TED (conference)|TED]] conference in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia. Represented on stage by a robot with a video screen, video camera, microphones and speakers, Snowden conversed with TED curator [[Chris Anderson (entrepreneur)|Chris Anderson]], and told the attendees that online businesses should act quickly to encrypt their websites. He described the NSA's PRISM program as the U.S. government using businesses to collect data for them, and that the NSA "intentionally misleads corporate partners" using, as an example, the [[Bullrun (decryption program)|Bullrun decryption program]] to create backdoor access.&lt;ref name=Rowan2014&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-03/18/snowden-ted |title=Snowden: Big revelations to come, reporting them is not a crime |last=Rowan |first=David |date=March 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowden said he would gladly return to the U.S. if given [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]], but that he was more concerned about alerting the public about abuses of government authority.&lt;ref name=Rowan2014 /&gt; Anderson invited Internet pioneer [[Tim Berners-Lee]] on stage to converse with Snowden, who said that he would support Berners-Lee's concept of an "internet Magna Carta" to "encode our values in the structure of the internet."&lt;ref name=Rowan2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/business/2014/03/ed-snowden-meets-father-web-stage-ted/ |title=Ed Snowden Meets the Father of the World Wide Web |last=Wohlsen |first=Marcus |work=Wired |date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Snowden effect}}
In July 2013, media critic [[Jay Rosen]] defined The Snowden Effect as "Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S."&lt;ref name=RosenSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=The Snowden Effect: definition and examples|url=http://pressthink.org/2013/07/the-snowden-effect-definition-and-examples/|work=Jay Rosen's PressThink|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, ''[[The Nation]]'' wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy.&lt;ref name=NationSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web|last=Alterman|first=Eric|title=What the Press Should Learn From the 'Snowden Effect'|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/177686/what-press-should-learn-snowden-effect#|work=The Nation|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Forbes]]'', the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive [[post-9/11]] domestic intelligence gathering system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Tom|title=The Snowden Effect Hits Congress: Will Effective Crowdsourced Lobbying Follow?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2013/07/18/the-snowden-effect-hits-congress-will-effective-crowdsourced-lobbying-follow/|work=Forbes|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the [[Pew Research Center]] found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref name=PewJuly2014&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/|title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America's Image|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric Frank Russell''' (January 6, 1905 – February 28, 1978) was a [[British people|British]] [[author]] best known for his [[science fiction]] novels and short stories. Much of his work was first published in the United States, in [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' and other [[pulp magazine]]s. Russell also wrote [[horror fiction]] for ''[[Weird Tales]]'' and non-fiction articles on [[Charles Fort|Fortean]] topics. Up to 1955 several of his stories were published under [[pseudonym]]s, at least Duncan H. Munro and Niall(e) Wilde.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;&lt;!-- see TALK#Pseudonyms --&gt;

It is explicitly a Fortean tale, based on [[Charles Fort]]'s famous speculation "I think we're property", Russell explains in the foreword.  An often-repeated legend has it that Campbell, on receiving the manuscript for ''Sinister Barrier'', created ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' primarily as a vehicle for the short novel (pp.&amp;nbsp;9–94).&lt;!--pp. per ISFDB--&gt; There is no real evidence for it, despite a statement to that effect in the first volume of [[Isaac Asimov]]'s autobiography, ''In Memory Yet Green''.&lt;ref name="Ingham" /&gt;

His second novel, ''Dreadful Sanctuary'' (serialized in ''Astounding'' during 1948) is an early example of [[conspiracy fiction]], in which a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] [[delusion]] of global proportions is perpetuated by a small but powerful [[secret society]].&lt;ref name="Langford"&gt;{{cite web |last=Langford |first=David | authorlink=David Langford | title = SF Books of the Damned | work = ''Originally published in ''Fortean Times | year =1996 | url = http://www.ansible.co.uk/writing/damned.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different and mutually incompatible accounts of Russell's military service during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name="Ingham" /&gt; The official, well-documented version is that he served with the [[Royal Air Force]], with whom he saw active service in Europe as a member of a Mobile Signals Unit. However, in the introduction to the 1986 [[Del Rey Books]] edition of Russell's novel ''Wasp'', [[Jack L. Chalker]] states that Russell was too old for active service, and instead worked for Military Intelligence in London, where he "spent the war dreaming up nasty tricks to play against the Germans and Japanese", including [[Operation Mincemeat]]. Russell's biographer John L. Ingham states however that "there is nothing, absolutely nothing, in his R.A.F. record to show that he was anything more than a wireless mechanic and radio operator".&lt;ref name="Ingham" /&gt;

Russell took up writing full-time in the late 1940s. He became an active member of British [[science fiction fandom]] and the British representative of the [[Fortean Society]]. He won the first annual [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]] in 1955 recognizing his humorous "[[Allamagoosa]]" as the year's best science fiction.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;

The 1962 novel ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' won a [[Prometheus Hall of Fame Award]] in 1985&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; — the third naming of two works to the [[libertarian science fiction]] hall of fame. The 1957 novel ''Wasp'' has been a finalist for the honor, which is now limited to one work per year.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt;

The [[EMP Museum#Science Fiction Hall of Fame|Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame]] inducted Russell in 2000, its fifth class of two deceased and two living writers.&lt;ref name=sfhof-old/&gt;

''Into Your Tent'', a thorough and detailed biography of Russell by John L. Ingham, was published in 2010 by Plantech (UK).&lt;ref name="Ingham"/&gt;

==Writings==
[[File:Other worlds science stories 195005.jpg|thumb|right|Russell's novelette "Dear Devil" was the cover story in the May 1950 issue  of ''[[Other Worlds (magazine)|Other Worlds Science Stories]]'']]
[[File:Fantastic 195808.jpg|thumb|right|Russell's essay "Satan's Footprints" was cover-featured on the August 1958 issue  of ''[[Fantastic Stories|Fantastic]]'']]
Russell's full-length fiction includes the following:
* ''[[Sinister Barrier]]'' (1939)
* ''[[Dreadful Sanctuary]]'' (1948)
* ''[[Sentinels From Space]]'' (1953), based on the earlier magazine story ''The Star Watchers'' (1951)
* ''[[Three to Conquer]]'' (1956), based on the earlier magazine serial ''Call Him Dead'' (1955)
* ''[[Men, Martians and Machines]]'' (1955), containing four related novellas
* ''[[Wasp (novel)|Wasp]]'' (1958)
* ''[[Next of Kin (novel)|Next of Kin]]'' (1959), published earlier as ''The Space Willies'' (1958)
* ''[[The Great Explosion]]'' (1962)
* ''[[With a Strange Device]]'' (1964), also published as ''The Mindwarpers''.

Russell also wrote a large number of shorter works, many of which have been reprinted in collections such as ''[[Deep Space (collection)|Deep Space]]'' (1954), ''Six Worlds Yonder'' (1958), ''Far Stars'' (1961), ''Dark Tides'' (1962) and ''Somewhere a Voice'' (1965). His short story "[[Allamagoosa]]"  (1955), which was essentially a science-fictional retelling of a traditional tall story called "The Shovewood", won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story.&lt;ref name="Ingham" /&gt;

Russell wrote numerous non-fiction essays on Fortean themes, some of which were collected in a compendium of Forteana entitled ''Great World Mysteries'' (1957). His second non-fiction book was ''The Rabble Rousers'' (1963), a sardonic look at human folly including the [[Dreyfus affair]] and the [[Florida land boom]]. He also wrote ''Lern Yerself Scouse: The ABZ of Scouse'' (1966) under the pseudonym "Linacre Lane".&lt;ref name="Ingham" /&gt;

Two omnibus collections of Russell's science fiction are available from [[NESFA Press]]: ''Major Ingredients'' (2000), containing 30 of his short stories, and ''Entities'' (2001) containing five novels. [[John Pelan]]'s Midnight House published ''Darker Tides'', a collection of Russell's [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[weird fiction]], in 2006.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;Scott Connors, Review of "''Darker Tides'' by Eric Frank Russell". ''Weird Tales'',October–November 2006. (p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 novel ''Design for Great-Day'', published as by [[Alan Dean Foster]] and Eric Frank Russell, is an expansion by Foster of a 1953 short story of the same name by Russell.

==Writing style and themes==

Russell had an easy-going, colloquial writing style that was influenced in part by American "[[hard-boiled]]" detective fiction of the kind popularized by ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name = "Carr"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carr |first=Terry |authorlink=Terry Carr |title=Classic Science Fiction: The First Golden Age |year=1979 |publisher= [[Robson Books]] |isbn=0-86051-070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although British, Russell wrote predominantly for an American audience, and was often assumed to be American by readers.&lt;ref name="Ashley"/&gt;

Much of Russell's science fiction is based on what might be described as fortean themes, with ''Sinister Barrier'' and ''Dreadful Sanctuary'' the most notable examples.&lt;ref name = "Langford"/&gt; Another common theme is the single resourceful human pitted against a ponderous alien [[bureaucracy]], as in the novels ''Wasp'' and ''Next of Kin'', as well as several shorter works.

Russell is sometimes categorized as a humorous writer, and [[Brian Aldiss]] describes him as John W. Campbell's "licensed jester".&lt;ref name="Aldiss"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldiss |first=Brian W. |title=Billion Year Spree |year=1973 |publisher= [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |isbn=0-297-76555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russell's humour generally has a satirical edge, often aimed at [[authority]] and bureaucracy in its various forms. On other occasions, for example in the short stories "Somewhere a Voice" and "The Army Comes to Venus", his work has a deeper and more serious tone, in which the [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of humanity's endeavours and aspirations shine through.

==Critical Reception==
Scott Connors, reviewing Russell's book ''Darker Tides'', stated that " Russell's prose displays a rare sense of irony and wit...and does the reader the  compliment of presenting the story in an indirect fashion so that he has an  investment in the tale." &lt;ref name="sc" /&gt;

==Cultural influences==

Russell's short story "Jay Score" (1941) is unusual amongst the pulp fiction of its time in presenting a [[Black people|black]] character, the ship's doctor, without any [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotyping]]. Indeed, this story and its sequels (collected in ''[[Men, Martians and Machines]]'') may be considered an early example of the science fiction subgenre in which a spaceship is crewed by a [[Multiethnic society|multi-ethnic]], mixed human/non-human, complement (cf. the much later ''[[Star Trek]]'').

Russell also appears to have originated the colloquial [[initialism]] "MYOB" for "[[mind your own business]]", which appears frequently in the novella ''[http://www.abelard.org/e-f-russell.htm "...&amp;nbsp;And Then There Were None"]'' (''Astounding'', June 1951) and in the novel ''The Great Explosion'' based upon it.

In 1970, Russell was paid £4689 by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]'s company [[Apple Corps]] for the motion picture rights to his novel ''Wasp'', the contract being signed on behalf of Apple by [[Ringo Starr]]. The film was never made, but it remained one of the most lucrative deals Russell ever made.&lt;ref name="Ingham" /&gt;

==Nomination and confirmation==
{{Wikinews|Hillary Clinton nominated as US Secretary of State}}
Within a week after the November 4, 2008, presidential election, President-elect Obama and Clinton discussed over telephone the possibility of her serving as [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] in his administration.&lt;ref name="reut111409"&gt;{{cite news |author=Holland, Steve |url=https://www.reuters.com/articlePrint?articleId=USTRE4AD04820081114 |title=Obama, Clinton discussed Secretary of State job |agency=Reuters|date=November 14, 2008 |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pol101409"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28278.html|title=Hillary Clinton: I'd have hired Barack Obama|author=Barr, Andy|newspaper=[[Politico]]|date=October 14, 2009|accessdate=October 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton later related, "He said I want you to be my secretary of state. And I said, 'Oh, no, you don't.' I said, 'Oh, please, there's so many other people who could do this.'"&lt;ref name="pol101409" /&gt; Clinton initially turned Obama down, but he persisted.&lt;ref name="cbs010710"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/07/60minutes/main6067628.shtml |title=Revelations From The Campaign |work=[[60 Minutes]] |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; Some Democratic senators welcomed the idea of her leaving, having been allied with Obama during the campaign, and believing that Clinton had risked party disunity by keeping her candidacy going for so long.&lt;ref name="wolffe-314" /&gt;

Obama and Clinton held a meeting on the subject on November 11.&lt;ref name="reut111908"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/joeBiden/idUSTRE4AH7W020081119 |title=Bill Clinton offers steps to help wife get State job |author=Holland, Steve |agency=Reuters |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the possibility became public on November 14, it came as a surprising and dramatic move, especially given the long, sometimes bitter battle the two had waged during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].&lt;ref name="reut111409" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE5DF133CF936A25752C1A96E9C8B63 |title=Obama's Talk With Clinton Creates Buzz |author=Calmes, Jackie |author2=Cooper, Helene |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama had specifically criticized Clinton's foreign policy credentials during the contests, and the initial idea of him appointing her had been so unexpected that she had told one of her own aides, "Not in a million years."&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; However, it has been reported that Obama had been thinking of the idea as far back as the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref name="wolffe-313"&gt;Wolffe, ''Renegade'', p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the aggressiveness of the campaign and the still-lingering animosities between the two campaign staffs,&lt;ref&gt;Wolffe, ''Renegade'', pp. 205–207.&lt;/ref&gt; as with many primary battles, the political differences between the candidates were never that great,&lt;ref name="inc-134"&gt;Libert and Faulk, ''Barack, Inc.'', pp. 133–134.&lt;/ref&gt; the two rivals had reportedly developed a respect for one another,&lt;ref name="wolffe-313" /&gt; and she had campaigned for him in the general election.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;

Consideration of Clinton was seen as Obama wanting to assemble a "team of rivals" in his administration, à la [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1860727,00.html |title=
Why Obama Wants Hillary for His 'Team of Rivals' |author=Tumulty, Karen |author2=Calabresi, Massimo |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usa061109" /&gt; The notion of rivals successfully working together also found applicability in other fields, such as [[George Marshall]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in relation to [[Operation Overlord]] during World War II and [[Indra Nooyi]] keeping on her top rival for CEO at [[Pepsico]].&lt;ref name="inc-134" /&gt; At the same time, the choice gave Obama an image of being self-assured.&lt;ref&gt;Libert and Faulk, ''Barack, Inc.'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton was conflicted whether she wanted to take the position or remain in the Senate, and agonized over her decision.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reut111908" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt111808"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/us/politics/19clinton.html |title=Clinton Said to Be Unsure About Cabinet Job |author=Hernandez, Raymond |author2=Luo, Michael |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 18, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Senate leadership had discussed possible leadership positions or other promotions in rank with her even before the cabinet position became a possibility, nothing concrete had been offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/21/us/politics/21obama.html |title=An Option for Clinton: Enhanced Senate Role |author=Baker, Peter |authorlink=Peter Baker (author) |author2=Cooper, Helene |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=April 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prospect of her ever becoming [[Senate Majority Leader]] seemed dim.&lt;ref name="wolffe-314" /&gt; A different complication was [[Bill Clinton]]; she told Obama: "There's one last thing that's a problem, which is my husband. You've seen what this is like; it will be a circus if I take this job", making reference to the volatile effect Bill Clinton had had during the primaries.&lt;ref name="cbs010710" /&gt; In addition, there was a specific concern whether the financial and other involvements of [[Post-presidency of Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's post-presidential activities]] would violate any conflict-of-interest rules for serving cabinet members.&lt;ref name="nyt111808" /&gt; There was as well considerable media speculation about what effect taking the position would have on her political career and any possible future presidential aspirations.&lt;ref name="nyt111808" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.observer.com/2008/politics/secretary-state-prize-rarely-stepping-stone |title=Secretary of State: A Prize, but Rarely a Steppingstone |author=Kornacki, Steve |newspaper=[[The New York Observer]] |date=November 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton wavered over the offer, but as she later related, "But, you know, we kept talking. I finally began thinking, look, if I had won and I had called him, I would have wanted him to say yes. And, you know, I'm pretty old-fashioned, and it's just who I am. So at the end of the day, when your president asks you to serve, you say yes, if you can."&lt;ref name="pol101409" /&gt; [[Chief of Protocol of the United States]] [[Capricia Penavic Marshall]], who had known Clinton since her First Lady days, later confirmed the same rationale: "When asked to serve, she does. And her president asked."&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;

On November 21, reports indicated that Clinton had accepted the position.&lt;ref name="npr112108"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97327730 |title=Obama Set On Key Cabinet Nominees |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, President-elect Obama formally announced that Clinton would be his nominee for Secretary of State.&lt;ref name="sky120108"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Barack-Obama-Makes-Hillary-Clinton-Secretary-Of-State-And-Unveils-Defence-Team/Article/200812115168344?lpos=World_News_First_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15168344_Barack_Obama_Makes_Hillary_Clinton_Secretary_Of_State_And_Unveils_Defence_Team |title=Obama Confirms Hillary In Top Job |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=December 1, 2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207203221/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Barack-Obama-Makes-Hillary-Clinton-Secretary-Of-State-And-Unveils-Defence-Team/Article/200812115168344?lpos=World_News_First_World_News_Article_Teaser_Region_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15168344_Barack_Obama_Makes_Hillary_Clinton_Secretary_Of_State_And_Unveils_Defence_Team |archivedate=February 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said she was reluctant to leave the Senate, but that the new position represented a "difficult and exciting adventure".&lt;ref name="sky120108" /&gt; As part of the nomination, Bill Clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the [[William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park|Clinton Presidential Center]] and [[Clinton Global Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/washington/30clinton.html |title=Bill Clinton to Name Donors as Part of Obama Deal |author=Baker, Peter |authorlink=Peter Baker (author) |work=The New York Times |date=November 29, 2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before taking office, Clinton was working together with Bush administration officials in assessing national security issues. The night before the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of the new president]], contingency plans against a purported plot by [[Somali people|Somali]] extremists against Obama and the inauguration was being discussed. Clinton argued that typical security responses were not tenable: "Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address? I don't think so."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/magazine/17Terror-t.html |title=Obama's War Over Terror |author=Baker, Peter |authorlink=Peter Baker (author) |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The threat turned out to not exist.)

==Staff==
During the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama presidential transition]], Clinton described her own transition as "difficult ... in some respects, because [she] never even dreamed of it."&lt;ref name="usa061109" /&gt; Then, and in the early days of her tenure, there was considerable jockeying for jobs within the department among those in "[[Hillaryland]]", her longtime circle of advisors and staff aides, as well as others who had worked with her in the past, with not as many jobs as those desiring of them.&lt;ref name="pol021009"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0209/18642.html |title=Clintonites jostle for jobs at State |author=Parnes, Amie |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=February 10, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tnr-crowley" /&gt; Obama gave Clinton more freedom to choose her staff than he did to any other cabinet member.&lt;ref name="wolffe-314"&gt;Wolffe, ''Renegade'', p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inc-134" /&gt;

Clinton's former campaign manager, [[Maggie Williams]], handled the staff hiring process.&lt;ref name="pol021009" /&gt; Longtime counsel to both Clintons [[Cheryl Mills]] served as the secretary's Counselor and Chief of Staff.&lt;ref name="tnr-crowley"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/hillarys-state-0 |title=Hillary's State |author=Crowley, Michael |authorlink=Michael Crowley (journalist) |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James B.

Much like she did at [[Senate career of Hillary Clinton#First term|the beginning of her Senate career]], Clinton kept a low profile during her early months and worked hard to familiarize herself with the culture and institutional history of the department.&lt;ref name="tnr-crowley" /&gt; She met or spoke with all of the living former secretaries, and especially relied upon her close friendship with [[Madeleine Albright]].&lt;ref name="tnr-crowley" /&gt;

At the start of her tenure, Obama and Clinton announced several high-profile special envoys to trouble spots in the world, including former [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] as Mideast envoy and [[Richard Holbrooke]] as envoy to South Asia and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="pol012209"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17811.html |title=U.S. foreign policy: Who's in charge? |author=Smith, Ben |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 27, 2009, Secretary of State Clinton appointed [[Todd Stern]] as the department's Special Envoy for Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/01/115409.htm|title=Secretary Clinton Announces Appointment of Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern|publisher=|access-date=July 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111201834/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/01/115409.htm|archive-date=November 11, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2009, Clinton and the Obama administration intended to nominate [[Paul Farmer]], co-founder of [[Partners in Health]], as Administrator of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/05/15/health_pioneer_may_get_obama_post/ |title=Health pioneer may get Obama post |author=Smith, James F. |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by August 2009 his nomination was reportedly scotched by the White House for reasons unknown.&lt;ref name="fp080409"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/08/04/paul_farmer_out_for_usaid/ |title=Paul Farmer out for USAID? |author=Rozen, Laura |magazine=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wi111109"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://washingtonindependent.com/67461/new-usaid-chief-faces-internal-skepticism |title=New USAID Chief Faces Internal Skepticism |author=Ackerman, Spencer |authorlink=Spencer Ackerman |newspaper=[[The Washington Independent]] |date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330220414/http://washingtonindependent.com/67461/new-usaid-chief-faces-internal-skepticism |archivedate=March 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Clinton, while visiting USAID, to publicly criticize the long vetting process for administration appointments&lt;ref name="fp080409" /&gt; calling it a "nightmare" and "frustrating beyond words."&lt;ref name="wi111109" /&gt; In November 2009, an unconventional choice was nominated instead, [[Rajiv Shah]], a young [[Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics]].&lt;ref name="wi111109" /&gt; Clinton said, "He has a record of delivering results in both the private and public sectors, forging partnerships around the world, especially in Africa and Asia, and developing innovative solutions in global health, agriculture, and financial services for the poor."&lt;ref name="wi111109" /&gt;

Despite some early press predictions,&lt;ref name="tnr-crowley" /&gt; in general Clinton's departmental staff has avoided the kind of leaks and infighting that troubled [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|her 2008 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="pol-5-things"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29210.html |title=Five things learned from Hillary Clinton's trip |author=Rozen, Laura |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possibly lingering line of internal tension was resolved in early 2011 when State Department spokesperson [[P.

Nides]] (Lew would eventually become [[White House Chief of Staff]] and then the pick for [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] for Obama's second term),&lt;ref name="pol-lew" /&gt; and Steinberg left in mid-2011 and was replaced as Deputy Secretary by career diplomat [[William Joseph Burns|William J.

==Early themes and structural initiatives==
During the transition period, Clinton sought to build a more powerful State Department.&lt;ref name="nyt122208"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/us/politics/23diplo.html |title=Clinton Moves to Widen Role of State Dept. |author=Landler, Mark |author2=Cooper, Helene |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began a push for a larger international affairs budget and an expanded role in global economic issues.&lt;ref name="nyt122208" /&gt; She cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the [[United States Defense Department|U.S. Defense Department]] had conducted diplomatic missions.&lt;ref name="nyt122208" /&gt; [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] agreed with her, and also advocated larger State Department budgets.&lt;ref name="time-stateof" /&gt; Indeed, the two, and their respective departments, would have a productive relationship, unlike the often fraught relations between State and Defense and their secretaries seen in prior administrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Gates |authorlink=Robert Gates |title=Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War |publisher=Alfred A.

In the Obama administration's proposed [[2010 United States federal budget]] of February 2009, there was a proposed 9.5&amp;nbsp;percent budget increase for the State Department and other international programs, from $47.2&amp;nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2009 to $51.7&amp;nbsp;billion in fiscal year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123566588886384023 |title=Budget Plan Is Short on State Department Specifics |author=Dreazen, Yochi J. |authorlink=Yochi Dreazen |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=February 26, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy10/pdf/budget/state.pdf |title=Department of State and Other International Programs |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]] |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106171228/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy10/pdf/budget/state.pdf |archivedate=January 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Clinton's May 2009 testimony before the [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs]], numbers had been restated following rounds of general federal budget cuts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/us/politics/08budget.html |title=Obama Unveils New Budget Cuts |author=Calmes, Jackie |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the proposed fiscal year 2010 budget request for the State Department and [[USAID]] was $48.6&amp;nbsp;billion, a 7&amp;nbsp;percent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/05/123679.htm |title=FY 2010 Budget for the Department of State: Hillary Rodham Clinton, Secretary of State, Before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs |author=Clinton, Hillary Rodham |authorlink=Hillary Clinton |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124042510/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/05/123679.htm |archive-date=November 24, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That became the amount of increase that was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Clinton announced a new State Department initiative, the [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]], to establish specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/july/125949.htm |title=Town Hall Meeting to Announce the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) |author=Clinton, Hillary Rodham |authorlink = Hillary Rodham Clinton |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most ambitious of Clinton's departmental reforms, it is modeled after the Defense Department's [[Quadrennial Defense Review]], which Clinton was familiar with from her days on the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]].&lt;ref name="cbs071709"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/17/opinion/diplomatic/main5169849.shtml |title=Hillary Clinton's 6-Month Checkup |author=Wolfson, Charles |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=July 17, 2009 |accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review#The first review|The first such Review]] came out in December 2010.

In September, Clinton unveiled the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative at the annual meeting of her husband's [[Clinton Global Initiative]].&lt;ref name="state092509"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/09/129644.htm |title=Remarks at the Clinton Global Initiative Closing Plenary |author=Clinton, Hillary Rodham |authorlink=Hillary Rodham Clinton |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107185230/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/09/129644.htm |archive-date=November 7, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afp092509"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvW_Cw0mHaP8QNmbccjJk62ZCT3Q |title=Clinton unveils US food security initiative |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the new initiative is to battle hunger worldwide on a strategic basis as a key part of U.S. foreign policy, rather than just react to food shortage emergencies as they occur.&lt;ref name="afp092509" /&gt; The secretary said that "Food security is not just about food. But it is all about security: economic security, environmental security, even national security. Massive hunger poses a threat to the stability of governments, societies and borders."&lt;ref name="state092509" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afp092509" /&gt; The initiative seeks to develop agricultural economies, counter malnourishment, increase productivity, expand trade, and spur innovation in developing nations. Clinton said that women would be placed at the center of the effort, as they constitute a majority of the world's farmers.&lt;ref name="afp092509" /&gt; The next month, to mark [[World Food Day]], Clinton said, "Fighting hunger and poverty through sustainable agricultural development, making sure that enough food is available and that people have the resources to purchase it, is a key foreign policy objective of the Obama administration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hMX65hK0wFXqZf-8cPRS9qzOUx_Q |title=Fight against hunger key to security: Clinton |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=October 26, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 2009, Clinton said, "this is a great job. It is a 24/7 job"&lt;ref name="wapo101309"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/12/AR2009101202868.html |title=Clinton Says No to Another Presidential Bid |author=Kornblut, Anne E. |authorlink=Anne E. Kornblut |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "this job is incredibly all-encompassing."&lt;ref name="pol101409" /&gt; She said she never thought about if she were making the same foreign policy decisions as president, and had no intention of ever running for that office again.&lt;ref name="pol101409" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo101309" /&gt; While some friends and former advisers thought she was primarily saying that to focus attention on her current role and that she might change her mind about running for president in the future, others felt that she was genuinely content with the direction her career and life had taken and no longer had presidential ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Kornblut, ''Notes from the Cracked Ceiling'', pp. 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the close of 2009 there were 25 female ambassadors posted by other nations to Washington; this was the highest number ever.&lt;ref name=hillaryeffect&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/10/AR2010011002731.html|title='Hillary effect' cited for increase in female ambassadors to U.S.|author=Mary Jordan|work=The Washington Post|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was dubbed the "Hillary effect" by some observers: "Hillary Clinton is so visible" as secretary of state, said [[Amelia Matos Sumbana]], the [[Mozambique – United States relations|Mozambique Ambassador to the United States]], "she makes it easier for presidents to pick a woman for Washington."&lt;ref name=hillaryeffect /&gt; An added fact, of course, was that two other recent U.S. Secretaries of State were women, but Clinton's international fame from her days as First Lady of the United States made her impact in this respect the greatest of the group.&lt;ref name=hillaryeffect /&gt;

Clinton also included in the State Department budget for the first time a breakdown of programs that specifically concerned themselves with the well-being of women and girls around the world.&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; By fiscal 2012, the department's budget request for such work was $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion, of which $832&amp;nbsp;million was for global health programs.&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; Additionally, she initiated the [[Women in Public Service Project]], a joint venture between the State Department and the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters colleges]]. The goal was to entice more women into entering public service, such that within four decades an equal number of men and women would be working in the field.&lt;ref name="elle-2012" /&gt;

One specific cause Clinton advocated almost from the start of her tenure was the adoption of [[cookstove]]s in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women. In September 2010, she announced a partnership with the [[United Nations Foundation]] to provide some 100&amp;nbsp;million such stoves around the world within the next ten years, and in subsequent travels she urged foreign leaders to adopt policies encouraging their use.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/hillary-clintons-last-tour-as-a-rock-star-diplomat.html |title=Last Tour of the Rock-Star Diplomat |author=Myers, Steven Lee |magazine=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=July 1, 2012 |pages=18–23, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 testimony before the [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs|Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs]], Secretary Clinton complained about the slow pace of Senate confirmations of Obama's nominations to diplomatic positions, a number of which were delayed for political reasons and had been subject to [[Secret hold|holds]] by individual Republican senators.&lt;ref name="abc022410"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/washington-political-battles-hurt-us-image-and-obama-agenda-says-sec-clinton.html |title=Washington Political Battles Hurt U.S. Image and Obama Agenda, says Sec. Clinton |author=Radia, Kirit |author2=Blakely, Jonathan |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said the problem damaged America's image abroad: "It became harder and harder to explain to countries, particularly countries of significance, why we had nobody in position for them to interact with."&lt;ref name="abc022410" /&gt;

In 2009, and again in 2010 and 2011, Clinton stated that she was committed to serving out her full term as secretary, but would not commit to serving a second term should Obama be re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/hillary-clinton-wont-commit-to.html |title=Hillary Clinton reaffirms: I won't commit to a second term (video) |author=Kolawole, Emi |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 19, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later used U.S. allies and what she called "convening power" to help keep the Libyan rebels unified as they eventually overthrew the [[Gaddafi regime]].&lt;ref name="time-smart" /&gt;

Throughout her tenure, Clinton has looked towards "[[smart power]]" as the strategy for asserting U.S. leadership and values, combining military strength with U.S. capacities in global economics, development aid, and technology.&lt;ref name="time-smart" /&gt; In late 2011 she said, "All power has limits. In a much more networked and multipolar world we can't wave a magic wand and say to China or Brazil or India, 'Quit growing. Quit using your economies to assert power' ... It's up to us to figure out how we position ourselves to be as effective as possible at different times in the face of different threats and opportunities."&lt;ref name="time-smart" /&gt;

Clinton has also greatly expanded the State Department's use of [[social media]], including [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], both to get its message out and to help empower people vis à via their rulers. Clinton said, "We are in the age of participation, and the challenge ... is to figure out how to be responsive, to help catalyze, unleash, channel the kind of participatory eagerness that is there." She has tried to institutionalize this change, by making social media a focus for foreign service officers and up to the ambassadorial level. (Other Clinton initiatives were run solely out of her office and were at risk of disappearing after she left office.) By late 2011, the department had 288 Facebook accounts and 192 Twitter feeds. The change was enough for daughter [[Chelsea Clinton]] to refer to the secretary as "TechnoMom".&lt;ref name="time-smart" /&gt;

In February 2009, Clinton made her first trip as secretary to Asia, visiting Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, and China on what she described as a "listening tour" that was "intended to really find a path forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/22/content_10868987.htm |title=A glance at features of Hillary Clinton's Asian tour |author=Zhao Yi |agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=February 22, 2009 |accessdate=March 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225031820/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/22/content_10868987.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to travel heavily in her first months in office, often getting very enthusiastic responses by engaging with the local populace.&lt;ref name=nyt040109&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/world/europe/02diplo.html |title=Lower Profile for Clinton, but Her Influence Rises |author=Landler, Mark |work=The New York Times |date=April 1, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/world/asia/21diplo.html |title=Clinton Reshapes Diplomacy by Tossing the Script |author=Landler, Mark |work=The New York Times |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton returned to the diplomatic scene and responded to the ongoing [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]], in which plans for the [[Honduran fourth ballot box referendum]] had led to the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]], and which was becoming Latin America's worst political crisis in some years.&lt;ref name="nyt-hond-deal" /&gt; In early July, she sat down with ousted [[President of Honduras]] [[Manuel Zelaya]], who agreed on a U.S.-backed proposal to begin talks with the ''de facto'' [[Roberto Micheletti]] government.&lt;ref name=ReutersJuly7&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE56424C20090707?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0|title=Honduras' Zelaya says to meet coup backers on Thursday|agency=Reuters|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in September, Zelaya returned to the country, and [[President of Costa Rica]] [[Óscar Arias]], who had become a mediator in the matter, as well as Clinton expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government. In particular, Clinton said, "Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances – get on with the election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-09-21/world/honduras.ousted.president_1_president-zelaya-brazilian-embassy-honduras?_s=PM:WORLD |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130120081236/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-09-21/world/honduras.ousted.president_1_president-zelaya-brazilian-embassy-honduras?_s=PM:WORLD |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 20, 2013 |title=Zelaya returns to Honduras |publisher=CNN |date=September 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of October, Clinton took a leading role in convincing Micheletti to accept a deal – which she termed an "historic agreement" – in which Zelaya would return to power in advance of general elections in which neither figure was running.&lt;ref name="nyt-hond-deal" /&gt; Micheletti said that Clinton had been insistent on this point: "I kept trying to explain our position to her, but all she kept saying was, 'Restitution, restitution, restitution.'"&lt;ref name="nyt-hond-deal"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/world/americas/31honduras.html |title=Deal Set to Restore Ousted Honduran President |author=Thompson, Ginger |author2=Malkin, Elisabeth |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That agreement broke down, despite efforts of the State Department to revive it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091111/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_honduras_coup |title=US diplomat in Honduras trying to revive pact|date=November 11, 2009 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Yahoo!

Clinton co-chaired the high-level [[U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue]] in Washington, D.C. on July 27–28, 2009 and led the Strategic Track for the United States.

In August 2009, Clinton embarked on her longest trip yet, to a number of stops in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/08/03/clinton.africa.trip/index.html |title=Clinton's trip to Africa her biggest yet |author=Dougherty, Jill |publisher=CNN |date=August 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, at a public event in [[Kinshasa]], a Congolese student asked her what her husband, "Mr Clinton", thought of a Chinese trade deal with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Clinton looked irritated at the question and replied, "Wait, you want me to tell you what my husband thinks? My husband is not the secretary of state, I am. So you ask my opinion, I will tell you my opinion. I am not going to be channeling my husband." The incident was played in newsrooms around the world. Clinton aides suggested there might have been a mistranslation, but that was not the case; however the student had later apologized to her, saying he had meant to ask what "Mr Obama" thought.&lt;ref name="nyt-pique"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/world/africa/13clinton.html |title=Clinton's Flash of Pique in Congo |author=Gettleman, Jeffrey |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Clinton's intervention – including juggling conversations on two mobile phones while sitting in a limousine&lt;ref name="nyt-me-test" /&gt; – overcame last-minute snags and saved the signing of an [[2009 Armenia–Turkey Accord|historic Turkish–Armenian accord]] that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two long-hostile nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1929584,00.html |title=Turkey, Armenia Sign Historic Accord |author=Lee, Matthew |agency=Associated Press |magazine=Time |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104182204/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1929584,00.html |archivedate=November 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2009/10/20091010181935891322.html|title=Turkey-Armenia ink historic accord|date=October 10, 2009|accessdate=October 10, 2009|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hillary Rodham Clinton in Pakistan.jpg|thumb|Clinton with Pakistani Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] during an October 2009 visit to [[Islamabad]].]]
In late October 2009, Clinton travelled to Pakistan, where she had staged a memorable visit in 1995 while First Lady.&lt;ref name="time-stateof" /&gt; Her arrival was followed within hours by the [[28 October 2009 Peshawar bombing]]; in response, Clinton said of those responsible, "They know they are on the losing side of history but they are determined to take as many lives with them as their movement is finally exposed for the nihilistic, empty effort that it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/10/28/pakistan.blast/index.html |title=Survivors recount narrow escape from deadly Peshawar market bombing |publisher=CNN |date=October 29, 2009 |accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to meeting with Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]], she also staged numerous public appearances.&lt;ref name="time-stateof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pol-5-things" /&gt; In those, she let students, talk show hosts, and tribal elders repeatedly complain about and criticize American foreign policy and American actions.&lt;ref name="time-stateof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pol-5-things" /&gt; Occasionally, she pushed back in a more blunt fashion than usual for diplomats, explicitly wondering why Pakistan had not been more successful in combating [[al Qaeda]] "if they wanted to."&lt;ref name="pol-5-things" /&gt; Member of Parliament and government spokesperson [[Farahnaz Ispahani]] said, "In the past, when the Americans came, they would talk to the generals and go home. Clinton's willingness to meet with everyone, hostile or not, has made a big impression – and because she's Hillary Clinton, with a real history of affinity for this country, it means so much more."&lt;ref name="time-stateof" /&gt;

On the same trip, Clinton visited the Middle East, in an effort to restart the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. &lt;!-- This needs more, need to sort this mess out --&gt;

In November 2009, Secretary Clinton led the U.S. delegation at the [[Berlin Wall#20th Anniversary celebrations|20th anniversary celebrations]] of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/11/06/hillary-clinton-to-lead-u-s-delegation-at-berlin-wall/ |title=Hillary Clinton To Lead U.S. Delegation At Berlin Wall |author=Weber, Christopher |newspaper=[[Politics Daily]] |date=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she said: "Our history did not end the night the wall came down, it began anew. ...

We cannot allow oppression defined and justified by religion or tribe to replace that of ideology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/6527791/Berlin-Wall-anniversary-Hillary-Clinton-calls-for-greater-freedom-throughout-the-world.html |title=Berlin Wall anniversary: Hillary Clinton calls for greater freedom throughout the world |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 8, 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Clinton attended the [[Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference]], where she pushed forward a last-minute proposal of significant new amounts of foreign aid to help developing countries deal with the effects of global warming, in an attempt to unstick stuck negotiations and salvage some sort of agreement at the conference.&lt;ref name="wapo121809"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/17/AR2009121700165.html |title=U.S. pledges aid, urges developing nations to cut emissions |first=Juliet |last=Eilperin |first2=Anthony |last2=Faiola |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date= December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30723.html |title=Hillary Clinton tries to save Copenhagen talks |author=Thrush, Glenn |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secretary said, "We're running out of time.

Secretary Clinton finished the year with very high approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30679.html |title=Poll: Clinton approval soars |author=Javers, Eamon |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=December 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also narrowly edged out former Alaska Governor [[Sarah Palin]] in being [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll|America's most-admired woman, per a Gallup finding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-12-29-admire-gallup-poll_N.htm |title=Poll: Americans most admire Obama, Clinton, Palin |author=Page, Susan |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ClintonAmorim.JPG|right|thumb|Secretary Clinton met with [[Celso Amorim]], [[Foreign Minister of Brazil]], in March 2010 at the [[Palácio do Itamaraty]] in [[Brasília]]]]
In January 2010, Secretary Clinton cut short a trip to the [[Asia-Pacific]] region in order to see firsthand the destructive effects of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] and to meet with President of Haiti [[René Préval]].&lt;ref name=hillarytohaiti&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60E5NA20100115?type=politicsNews|title=Hillary Clinton to go to Haiti on Saturday |agency=Reuters|date=January 15, 2010 |first=Andrew |last=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said she would also evaluate the relief effort and help evacuate some Americans. She stressed that her visit was designed not to interfere with ongoing efforts: "It's a race against time. Everybody is pushing as hard as they can."&lt;ref name=hillarytohaiti /&gt; The Clintons had a special interest in Haiti going back decades, to their delayed honeymoon there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/more-info/story/1001856.html |title=Clintons honeymoon in Haiti |work=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=April 2009}} {{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; up to Bill Clinton being the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti at the time of the earthquake.

In a major speech on January 21, 2010, Clinton, speaking on behalf of the U.S., declared that "We stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas", while highlighting how "even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm |title=Remarks on Internet Freedom |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |author=Clinton, Hillary Rodham |date=January 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103202130/https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2010/01/135519.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also drew analogies between the [[Iron Curtain]] and the free and unfree Internet.&lt;ref name="lat012310" /&gt; Her speech, which followed a controversy surrounding [[Google]]'s changed policy toward [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China and censorship]], appears to mark a split between authoritarian capitalism and the Western model of free capitalism and Internet access.&lt;ref name="lat012310"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-fg-google-china23-2010jan23,0,3919601.story |title=Sino-U.S. ties hit new snag over Internet issues |first=Paul |last=Richter |first2=David |last2=Pierson |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

By early 2010, the Obama administration's efforts towards forging a new relationship with Iran had failed to gain headway, and the U.S. adopted a policy of adopting international sanctions against it and isolating it diplomatically in order to curtail the [[Nuclear program of Iran|that country's nuclear program]].&lt;ref name="nyt-021710-iran"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/world/middleeast/17diplo.html |title=Iran Policy Now More in Sync With Clinton's Views |first=Mark |last=Landler |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a policy more in line with Clinton's thinking and went back to disagreements she and Obama had had during the 2008 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="nyt-021710-iran" /&gt; Clinton was put in charge of rallying support in the United Nations for these sanctions&lt;ref name="nyt-021710-iran" /&gt; and spent considerable time over the following months and years doing so.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pol-hrc-iran"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/hillary-clinton-iran-nuclear-deal-120078.html |title=Hillary Clinton endorses nuclear deal |first=Michael |last=Crowley |work=Politico |date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times Clinton suggested the possibility of military action against Iran should economic and diplomatic actions fail to deter it from its nuclear ambitions.&lt;ref name="pol-hrc-iran" /&gt;

In February 2010, Clinton made her first visit to Latin America as secretary. The tour would take her to Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Costa Rica and Guatemala and Argentina. She first visited [[Buenos Aires]] and talked to Argentine President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]]. They discussed [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|Falkland Islands sovereignty]] and the issue of oil in the Falklands.&lt;ref name="cnn030210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/03/02/falkland.clinton/index.html |title=Clinton pushes talks in Falklands dispute |publisher=CNN |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said that "We would like to see Argentina and the United Kingdom sit down and resolve the issues between them across the table in a peaceful, productive way."&lt;ref name="cnn030210" /&gt; Clinton offered to help facilitate such discussions, but did not agree to an Argentinian request that she mediate such talks.&lt;ref name="cnn030210" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc030210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8544634.stm |title=UK rejects Hillary Clinton's help in Falklands dispute |publisher=BBC News |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 12 hours of Clinton's remarks, [[Downing Street]] categorically rejected a U.S. role: "We welcome the support of the secretary of state in terms of ensuring that we continue to keep diplomatic channels open but there is no need for [direct involvement]."&lt;ref name="bbc030210" /&gt; Clinton then went on to [[Santiago]], Chile to witness the aftereffects of the [[2010 Chile earthquake]] and to bring some telecommunications equipment to aid in the rescue and recovery efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2010/0302/Chile-earthquake-Hillary-Clinton-arrives-with-satellite-phones |title=Chile earthquake: Hillary Clinton arrives with satellite phones |author=Llana, Sara Miller |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, there was a flurry of speculation that Clinton would be nominated to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to fill the vacancy created by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]' retirement, including a plug from ranking [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] member [[Orrin Hatch]].&lt;ref name="abc041310" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pol041310"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0410/35686.html |title=A Hillary Clinton trial balloon's short flight |author=Ben Smith |authorlink=Ben Smith (journalist) |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion was quickly quashed by the White House, which said, "The president thinks Secretary Clinton is doing an excellent job as secretary of state and wants her to remain in that position."&lt;ref name="abc041310"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Supreme_Court/obamas-supreme-court-short-list-includes-women/story?id=10359170 |title=Obama's Supreme Court Short List Includes Six Women |author=Tapper, Jake |authorlink=Jake Tapper |work=[[Good Morning America]] |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A State Department spokesperson said that Clinton "loves her present job and is not looking for another one."&lt;ref name="pol041310" /&gt;

By mid-2010, Clinton and Obama had clearly forged a good working relationship without power struggles; she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside, and was careful to make sure that neither she nor her husband would upstage him.&lt;ref name="elle-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-relat"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/us/politics/19policy.html |title=From Bitter Campaign to Strong Alliance |author=Landler, Mark |author2=Cooper, Helene |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He in turn was accommodating to her viewpoints and in some cases adopted some of her more hawkish approaches.&lt;ref name="nyt-relat" /&gt; She met with him weekly, but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents, such as [[Condoleezza Rice]] with [[George W.

Bush]], or [[Henry Kissinger]] with [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref name="nyt-relat" /&gt; Nevertheless, he had trust in her actions.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;

During an early June 2010 visit to [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]], Clinton dealt with questions at every stop about the recently passed and widely controversial [[Arizona SB 1070]] anti-illegal immigration law, which had damaged the image of the U.S. in Latin America.&lt;ref name="nyt061810" /&gt; When answering a question from local television reporters in [[Quito]] about it, she said that President Obama was opposed to it and that "The Justice Department, under his direction, will be bringing a lawsuit against the act."&lt;ref name="nyt061810"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/us/politics/19arizona.html |title=Justice Dept.

While at a hotel bar in [[Lima]], she completed an agreement with a representative of China over which companies could be specified in a UN resolution sanctioning the [[nuclear program of Iran]].&lt;ref name="nyt-me-test" /&gt; Returning to SB 1070, in August 2010 she included the dispute over it in a report to the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], as an example to other countries of how fractious issues can be resolved under the rule of law.&lt;ref name="fox083010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/08/30/state-department-stands-decision-include-arizona-human-rights-report/ |title=State Department Stands By Decision to Include Arizona in U.N.

Too many nations – especially Afghanistan – have suffered too many losses to see this country slide backward."&lt;ref name="wapobg072110" /&gt; She then went on to [[Seoul]] and the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] where she and Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] met with South Korean Foreign Minister [[Yu Myung-hwan]] and Minister of National Defense [[Kim Tae-Young (R.O.K. Army general)|Kim Tae-young]] in a '2+2 meeting' to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the [[Korean War]]. There she said that the U.S. experience in staying in Korea for decades had led to a successful result, which might also be applicable to Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="nyt072310" /&gt; Finally, she went to [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], for the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]], wrapping up what ''[[The New York Times]]'' termed "a grueling trip that amounted to a tour of American wars, past and present".&lt;ref name="nyt072310"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/world/asia/24diplo.html |title=Offering to Aid Talks, U.S. Challenges China on Disputed Islands |author=Landler, Mark |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she injected the U.S. into the long-running disputes over the sovereignty of the [[Paracel Islands]] and [[Spratly Islands]], much to the displeasure of the Chinese who view the [[South China Sea]] as part of their core interests, by saying "The United States has a national interest in freedom of navigation, open access to Asia's maritime commons and respect for international law in the South China Sea."&lt;ref name="nyt072310" /&gt;

By this time, Secretary Clinton was quite busy with another role of a kind, "M.O.T.B." as she wrote in State Department memos, making reference to her being the mother of the bride in daughter [[Chelsea Clinton]]'s July 31, 2010, wedding to Marc Mezvinsky.&lt;ref name="nyt072510"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/nyregion/26rhinebeck.html |title=Wedding Is Talk of the Town, but Nobody's Talking |author=Foderaro, Lisa W. |author2=Haughney, Christine |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She confessed in an interview in [[Islamabad]] less than two weeks before the wedding that she and her husband were both nervous wrecks, and that "You should assume that if he makes it down the aisle in one piece it's going to be a major accomplishment.

In a September 2010 speech before the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Clinton emphasized the continuing primacy of American power and involvement in the world, declaring a "new American moment".&lt;ref name="nyt-cfr10"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/world/09diplo.html |title=In a Speech on Policy, Clinton Revives a Theme of American Power |author=Landler, Mark |authorlink=Mark Landler |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 9, 2010 |page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making reference to actions from reviving the Middle East talks to U.S. aid following the [[2010 Pakistan floods]], Clinton said that "The world is counting on us" and that "After years of war and uncertainty, people are wondering what the future holds, at home and abroad. So let me say it clearly: The United States can, must, and will lead in this new century."&lt;ref name="nyt-cfr10" /&gt;

With Democrats facing possible large losses in the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]] and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] led to the notion that Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-12/obama-needs-hillary-clinton-as-vp-to-win-in-2012/?cid=hp:mainpromo2 |title=Obama Needs Hillary Clinton as VP to Win in 2012 |author=Varadarajan, Tunku |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won.&lt;ref name="nyt-cfr10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704388504575419421407147424 |title=Hillary for Vice President? |author=Fund, John |authorlink = John Fund |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That it would ever happen was unlikely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/08/12/don-t-believe-the-hillary-for-vp-meme.html |title=Don't Believe the Hillary Clinton–for–VP Meme |work=[[Newsweek]], The Gaggle |date=August 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815235141/http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-gaggle/2010/08/12/don-t-believe-the-hillary-for-vp-meme.html |archivedate=2010-08-15 |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, she smiled and shook her head.&lt;ref name="nyt-cfr10" /&gt; A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was "completely unfounded" and that "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama says he's sticking with Biden |work=[[USA Today]]: [[Asbury Park Press]] |date=October 20, 2010 |page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff [[William M.

In October, Clinton embarked on a seven-nation tour of Asia and Oceania.

In late November, [[United States diplomatic cables leak|WikiLeaks released confidential State Department cables]], selections of which were then published by several major newspapers around the world. The leak of the cables led to a crisis atmosphere in the State Department, as blunt statements and assessments by U.S. and foreign diplomats became public.&lt;ref name="wapo-dctl"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/29/AR2010112906258.html |title=Clinton treads carefully in leading massive damage-control campaign |author=Sheridan, Mary Beth |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton led the damage control effort for the U.S. abroad, and also sought to bolster the morale of shocked Foreign Service officers.&lt;ref name="wapo-dctl" /&gt; In the days leading up to the publication of the cables, Clinton called officials in Germany, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Afghanistan, Canada, and China to alert them to the pending disclosures.&lt;ref name="wapo-dctl" /&gt; She did note that some foreign leaders were accepting of the frank language of the cables, with one telling her, "Don't worry about it.

[[Spying on United Nations leaders by United States diplomats|A few of the cables released by WikiLeaks concerned Clinton directly]]: they revealed that directions to members of the foreign service had gone out in 2009 under Clinton's name to gather biometric details on foreign diplomats, including officials of the United Nations and U.S. allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/28/us-embassy-cables-spying-un |title=US diplomats spied on UN leadership |author=Booth, Roger |author2= Borger, Julian|date=November 28, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit card numbers, frequent flier account numbers, work schedules, and other targeted biographical information in a process known as the National Humint Collection Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cables show US sought personal info of foreign diplomats at UN |date=November 29, 2010 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-29/us/28233885_1_unsc-national-humint-collection-directive-foreign-diplomats |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |agency=[[Press Trust of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-cables"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29spy.html |title=U.S. Expands Role of Diplomats in Spying |author=Mazzetti, Mark |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; State Department spokesman [[Philip J.

Upon the December 13 death of veteran U.S. diplomat [[Richard Holbrooke]] (who had initially fallen ill during a meeting with her), Clinton presided over a spontaneous gathering of some forty senior State Department personnel and Holbrooke aides at [[George Washington University Hospital]], reminiscing about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1210/Clinton_aides_gather_to_remember_Holbrooke.html |title=Clinton, aides gather to remember Holbrooke |author=Rozen, Laura |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a memorial service for him days later, both Clinton and her husband praised Holbrooke's work, and she said, "Everything that we have accomplished that is working in Afghanistan and Pakistan is largely because of Richard."&lt;ref name="nyt-hol"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/18/nyregion/18holbrooke.html |title=Sharing Stories of a Man Who Loved Big Challenges |author=Otterman, Sharon |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it happened, however, Holbrooke had developed poor relations with the White House during his time as Afghanistan envoy, and Clinton's vision of him forging an agreement in that country that modeled the success of his prior [[Dayton Accords]] (that resolved the [[Bosnian War]]) were unrealized.&lt;ref name="nyt-backstage" /&gt;

She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, and the rule of law in order to be effective – in the end "free people govern themselves best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12372983 |title=Hillary Clinton: Middle East facing 'perfect storm' |publisher=BBC News |date=February 5, 2011 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region.&lt;ref name="afp-bah"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5inJi1jMn1TGVvxak0qubKgy0CRzg?docId=CNG.5ff705d1bb699953d27412f47c096871.dd1 |title=Clinton urges restraint, reform in Bahrain |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=February 20, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the monarchy's response to the [[2011 Bahraini protests]] turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform."&lt;ref name="afp-bah" /&gt; At the same time, she said that the U.S. "cannot tell countries what they are going to do [and] cannot dictate the outcomes."&lt;ref name="afp-bah" /&gt; As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ...

When the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] began in mid-February and intensified into armed conflict with rebel successes in early March 2011, Clinton stated the administration's position that Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] "must go now, without further violence or delay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12611925 |title=Hillary Clinton: Libya may become democracy or face civil war |publisher=BBC News |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Gaddafi conducted counterattacks against the rebels, Clinton was initially reluctant, as was Obama, to back calls being made in various quarters for imposition of a [[Libyan no-fly zone]].&lt;ref name="nyt-libya-change"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/world/africa/19policy.html |title=Obama Takes Hard Line With Libya After Shift by Clinton |author=Cooper, Helene |author2=Myers, Steven Lee |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-libya-change"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obamas-shift-toward-military-action-in-libya/2011/03/18/ABiClIs_singlePage.html |title=Obama's shift toward military action in Libya |author=Wilson, Scott |author2=Warwick, Joby |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 19, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the prospects of a Gaddafi victory and possible subsequent bloodbath that would kill many thousands emerged, and as Clinton travelled Europe and North Africa and found support for military intervention increasing among European and Arab leaders, she had a change of view.&lt;ref name="nyt-libya-change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-libya-change" /&gt; Together with Ambassador to the U.N.

While Clinton recognized some of the contradictions of U.S. policy towards turmoil in the Mideast countries, which involving backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others,&lt;ref name="nyt-libya-change" /&gt; she was nevertheless passionate on the subject, enough so that Obama joked at the annual [[Gridiron Dinner]] that "I've dispatched Hillary to the Middle East to talk about how these countries can transition to new leaders—though, I've got to be honest, she's gotten a little passionate about the subject. These past few weeks it's been tough falling asleep with Hillary out there on Pennsylvania Avenue shouting, throwing rocks at the window."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/03/17/031711-news-hillary-2-2/ |title=Oh, Hill No |author=Hersh, Joshua |newspaper=[[The Daily (News Corporation)|The Daily]] |date=March 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Obama's reference to Clinton travelling a lot was true enough; by now she had logged {{convert|465,000|mi|km}} in her [[Boeing 757]], more than any other Secretary of State for a comparable period of time, and had visited 79 countries while in the office.&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2011/03/06/the-hillary-doctrine.html |title=The Hillary Doctrine |author=Lemmon, Gayle Tzemach |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |date=March 6, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine wrote that "Clinton's endurance is legendary" and that she would still be going at the end of long work days even as her staff members were glazing out.&lt;ref name="time-smart" /&gt; The key was her ability to fall asleep on demand, at any time and place, for [[power nap]]s.&lt;ref name="elle-2012" /&gt;

Clinton also saw the potential political changes in the Mideast as an opportunity for an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine saw as Clinton's [[categorical imperative]]).&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt – "If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible" – as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present [[Nujood Ali]] and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age.&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings."&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, but it is also a big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us."&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but because I see it as [a way] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me."&lt;ref name="elle-2012" /&gt;

In the midst of this turmoil, which also included Clinton pledging government-level support to Japan in the wake of the devastating [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rafu.com/news/2011/03/u-s-officials-pledge-to-help-quake-tsunami-victims/ |title=U.S. Officials Pledge to Help Quake, Tsunami Victims |newspaper=[[Rafu Shimpo]] |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with [[Wolf Blitzer]] during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's [[Tahrir Square]] that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again.&lt;ref name="wolf-2nd-no"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-18/politics/wolf.blitzer.clinton.cairo_1_armored-vehicles-armored-car-state-hillary-clinton/2?_s=PM:POLITICS |title=Blitzer's Notebook: Behind the scenes on Clinton's Mideast trip |author=Blitzer, Wolf |authorlink=Wolf Blitzer |publisher=CNN |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006103147/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-18/politics/wolf.blitzer.clinton.cairo_1_armored-vehicles-armored-car-state-hillary-clinton/2?_s=PM%3APOLITICS |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is [[United States presidential election, 2012|re-elected in 2012]].&lt;ref name="pol-no-2nd"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0311/51515.html |title=Day after saying no second term, a big win for Hillary Clinton |author=Thrush, Glenn |work=[[Politico]] |date=March 17, 2011 |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="no to 2nd"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/16/clinton-running-for-president/ |title=Clinton says no to second term |work=Political Ticker |publisher=CNN |date=March 16, 2011 |accessdate=March 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stressed how much she regarded her current position: "Because I have the best job I could ever have.

There are both the tragedies and disasters that we have seen from Haiti to Japan and there are the extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region."&lt;ref name="no to 2nd" /&gt; But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights.&lt;ref name="pol-no-2nd" /&gt; She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind.&lt;ref name="wolf-2nd-no" /&gt; In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her [[Gallup Poll]] favorability rating rose to 66&amp;nbsp;percent (against 31&amp;nbsp;percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the [[Lewinsky scandal]] thirteen years earlier.&lt;ref name="gallup-mar2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/146891/Hillary-Clinton-Favorable-Near-Time-High.aspx |title=Hillary Clinton Favorable Near Her All-Time High |author=Saad, Lydia |publisher=[[Gallup Organization]] |date=March 30, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state sometimes get.&lt;ref name="gallup-mar2011" /&gt;

[[File:Obama and Biden await updates on bin Laden.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary Clinton was among those in the [[White House Situation Room]] getting real-time updates on the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden]].]]

Throughout early 2011, the CIA thought there was a good chance it had discovered the whereabouts of [[Osama bin Laden]], and the White House held a final high-level discussion on April 28 about whether to go ahead with a raid to get him, and if so, what kind of mission to undertake.

By July, Clinton was assuring China and other foreign governments that the ongoing [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|U.S. debt ceiling crisis]] would not end with the U.S. going into [[sovereign default]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/clinton-seeks-to-reassure-asia-amid-us-debt-stalemate/2011/07/25/gIQAujW6XI_story.html |title=Clinton seeks to reassure China amid U.S. debt stalemate |author=Wan, William |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a prediction that turned true when the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] was passed and signed the day before default loomed).

Following the October 2011 announcement by Obama that the [[withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq]] would complete by the close of that same year, Clinton forcefully defended the decision as emanating from an agreement originally signed with Iraq under the Bush administration and as evidence that Iraq's sovereignty was real, and said that despite the absence of military forces, the U.S. was still committed to strengthening Iraq's democracy with "robust" diplomatic measures.&lt;ref name="pol-oct11"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/66644.html#ixzz1bh6Qnn2R |title=Hillary Clinton stands firm behind Obama |author=Thrush, Glenn |author2=Hirschhorn, Dan |newspaper=Politico |date=October 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also praised the effectiveness of Obama's foreign policy in general, implicitly pushing back on criticism from [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012|those running for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination]].&lt;ref name="pol-oct11" /&gt;

Clinton specifically pointed to the [[death of Muammar Gaddafi]] and the conclusion of the Libyan intervention.&lt;ref name="pol-oct11" /&gt; She had been active during the final stages of the Libyan rebellion, and via Sheik [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]], had urged the rebels forces to unify and avoid factional conflicts with each other.&lt;ref name="time-smart" /&gt; She visited [[Tripoli]] in October 2011 and, in private, was somewhat guarded about Libya's future following the rebel success.&lt;ref name="time-smart"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2097973,00.html |title=Hillary Clinton and the Rise of Smart Power |author=Calabresi, Massimo |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 7, 2011 |pages=26–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A video of her exclaiming "Wow" upon first reading on her BlackBerry of Gaddafi's capture achieved wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/21/gaddafi-death-image?newsfeed=true |title=Gaddafi's death: rumoured, announced and confirmed in a single image |author=Addley, Esther |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 21, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Over the next few years, the [[aftermath of the Libyan Civil War]] became characterized by instability, two rival governments, and a slide into status as a [[failed state]]; it became a refuge for extremists and terrorist groups, such as [[ISIL]], and spurred a massive refugee crisis as immigrants crossed the Mediterranean to southern Europe.&lt;ref name="cnn-libya-problem"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/08/politics/hillary-clinton-libya-election-2016/index.html |title=Hillary Clinton's real Libya problem |author=Collinson, Stephen |publisher=CNN |date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wisdom of the intervention would continue to be debated, with President Obama maintaining that the intervention had been worthwhile but that the United States and Europe underestimated the ongoing effort needed to rebuild Libyan society afterward;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/opinion/president-obama-thomas-l-friedman-iraq-and-world-affairs.html |title=Obama on the World |first=Thomas L. |last=Friedman |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; former U.S. Representative to NATO [[Ivo Daalder]] stating that the limited goals of the intervention had all been met but that the Libyan people had not seized their opportunity to form a better future and that post-intervention military involvement by the West would have been counterproductive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/07/libya-intervention-daalder_n_6809756.html |title=Was The 2011 Libya Intervention A Mistake? |first=Nick |last=Robins-Early |work=Huffington Post |date=March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scholar Alan J.

Secretary Clinton cancelled a planned trip to the United Kingdom and Turkey to be with her mother, [[Dorothy Rodham]], who died in Washington on November 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/hillary-rodham-clinton-s-mother-dies-at-92-20111101?mrefid=mostViewed |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton's Mother Dies at 92 |author=Sorcher, Sara |newspaper=[[National Journal]] |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511155722/http://www.nationaljournal.com/nationalsecurity/hillary-rodham-clinton-s-mother-dies-at-92-20111101?mrefid=mostViewed |archivedate=May 11, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Clinton declared, in both a speech at the [[East–West Center]] and in an article published in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, that the 21st century would be "America's Pacific century".&lt;ref name="reut-apc"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/11/us-apec-usa-clinton-f-idUSTRE7AA2S120111111 |title=Clinton declares 'America's Pacific century' |agency=Reuters |date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hrc-apc"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clinton |first=Hillary |title=America's Pacific Century |url=&lt;!-- http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/11/americas_pacific_century --&gt; |journal=[[Foreign Policy]] |issue=189 |date=November 2011 |pages=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term played on the notion of the "[[Pacific Century]]". Clinton said, "It is becoming increasingly clear that, in the 21st century, the world's strategic and economic center of gravity will be the Asia-Pacific, from the Indian subcontinent to western shores of the Americas."&lt;ref name="reut-apc" /&gt; The declaration was part of the [[East Asian foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|Obama administration's "pivot to Asia"]] after the focus of the decade of the 2000s on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref name="reut-apc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hrc-apc" /&gt;

When the [[2011–2012 Russian protests]] had begun in late 2011, in response to the [[Russian legislative election, 2011]], Clinton had been outspoken about the need for legitimate democratic processes there, saying in December 2011: "The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted. And that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/06/world/europe/russia-elections-clinton/index.html |title=Clinton cites 'serious concerns' about Russian election |author=Labott, Elise |publisher=CNN |date=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added that "Russian voters deserve a full investigation of electoral fraud and manipulation." In return, Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] denounced Clinton, accusing her of backing Russian protesters financially and in fact precipitating their actions: "They heard this signal and with the support of the U.S. State Department began their active work."&lt;ref name="cnn-putin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-12-08/Clinton-Putin-Russia/51729210/1 |title=Putin accuses Clinton of encouraging protesters |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Putin won the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]] in March 2012, some in the State Department wanted to denounce Russian process again, but they were overruled by the White House, and Clinton stated simply that "The election had a clear winner, and we are ready to work with President-elect Putin."&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;

[[File:Clinton talking with Suu Kyi.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary Clinton met with Burmese democracy leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] on December 2, 2011, as part of her historic visit to that country.]]
In early December 2011, Clinton made the first visit to [[Burma]] by a U.S. secretary of state since [[John Foster Dulles]]'s in 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] and sought to support the [[Reforms in Burma|2011 Burmese democratic reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/30/hillary-clinton-burma-visit-reform-hopes |title=Hillary Clinton begins Burma visit |author=Burke, Jason |newspaper=The Guardian |date=November 30, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton said that due to the direct and indirect communications she had had with Suu Kyi over the years, "it was like seeing a friend you hadn't seen for a very long time even though it was our first meeting."&lt;ref name="bbc-int-burma"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2011/12/20111202125706su0.4918286.html?CP.rss=true#ixzz1iDNssGTL |title=Secretary Clinton's Interview in Rangoon, Burma, with BBC |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outreach to Burma attracted both praise and criticism, with Congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] saying it "sends the wrong signal to the Burmese military thugs" but others saying the visit combined idealism with respect to reform and realpolitik with respect to keeping Burma out of the direct Chinese sphere of influence.&lt;ref name="guard-dec2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/hillary-clinton-world-tour-success?newsfeed=true |title=Hillary Clinton's world tour brings brickbats, but more bouquets |author=McGreal, Chris |newspaper=The Guardian |date=December 8, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton had had to overcome internal administration opposition from the White House and Pentagon, as well as from Senate minority leader [[Mitch McConnell]], to make the move, eventually making a personal appeal to Obama and gaining his approval.&lt;ref name="nyt-backstage" /&gt; Regarding whether the Burmese regime would follow up on reform pledges, Clinton said, "I can't predict what's going to happen, but I think it certainly is important for the United States to be on the side of democratic reform ... This is a first date, not a marriage, and we'll see where it leads."&lt;ref name="bbc-int-burma" /&gt; She continued to address rights concerns in a December 2011 speech a few days later before the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], saying that the U.S. would advocate for [[gay rights]] abroad and that "Gay rights are human rights" and that "It should never be a crime to be gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16062937 |title=Hillary Clinton declares 'gay rights are human rights' |publisher=BBC News |date=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This itself drew criticism from some American social conservatives.&lt;ref name="guard-dec2011" /&gt;

In a State Department town hall meeting on January 26, 2012, Clinton indicated her desire to remove herself from "the high wire of American politics" after twenty tiring years of being on it and added, "I have made it clear that I will certainly stay on until the president nominates someone and that transition can occur."&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/hillary-clinton-dodging-political-1318559.html |title=Hillary Clinton dodging political 'high wire' |author=Lee, Matthew |newspaper=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |agency=Associated Press |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also indicated that she had not watched any of the [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2012|2012 Republican Party presidential debates]].&lt;ref name=lee /&gt;

As the [[Syrian Civil War]] continued and intensified with the [[February 2012 bombardment of Homs]], the U.S. sought a UN Security Council resolution that backed [[Syrian conflict peace proposals|an Arab League plan]] that would urge Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] to relinquish powers to the vice presidential level and permit a unity government to form.&lt;ref name="ap-syria" /&gt; However, Russia and China vetoed the resolution, an action that Clinton characterized as a "travesty".&lt;ref name="ap-syria"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/clinton-calls-friends-syria-unite-132749258.html |title=Clinton calls for friends of Syria to unite |first=Matthew |last=Lee |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Yahoo!

In February 2012, a spokesman for Clinton denied again that Clinton wanted the President of the World Bank job, saying, "She has said this is not happening. Her view has not changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-hillary-clinton-world-bank-20120215,0,1753490.story |title=Hillary Clinton to World Bank?

At a keynote speech before the [[International Crisis Group]], the secretary brought her view regarding the empowerment of women specifically into the area of [[peacemaking]], saying that women's multifaceted ties with a community make them more compelled to concern about social and quality of life issues that prosper under peacetime conditions. Furthermore, women identify more with minority groups, being discriminated against themselves. Thus, "Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world. It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their children's and grandchildren's fates, are decided."&lt;ref name="elle-2012" /&gt; She also continued to believe that empowerment of women would continue to grow as people saw that it would lead to economic growth.&lt;ref name="nyt-gc-next" /&gt;

In April 2012, an [[Internet meme]] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on [[Tumblr]] and based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her [[text message]]s.

She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier.

A late April/early May 2012 trip to China found Clinton in the middle of a drama involving blind Chinese dissident [[Chen Guangcheng]]. He had escaped house arrest and, after finding his way to the [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing]], requested an arrangement whereby he could stay in China with guarantees for his safety. After a deal towards that end fell through, he requested a seat on Clinton's plane when she flew back to the U.S. After further negotiations in parallel with the existing agenda of Clinton's trip, Chen left for the U.S. after Clinton's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/chen-guangcheng-chinese-dissident-leaves-us/story?id=16384545 |title=Chen Guangcheng: Chinese Dissident Arrives US |first=Akiko|last=Fujita|first2=Elicia |last2=Dover|first3=Dean|last3=Schabner|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton had negotiated personally with senior Chinese diplomat [[Dai Bingguo]] in order to get the deal back in place.&lt;ref name="nyt-backstage" /&gt; Despite an environment that had, as one aide said, "exploded into an absolute circus", Clinton managed to find a path for the U.S. that kept China from losing face and kept the overall agenda of the meetings intact.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;

Following the June 2012 killing of high-ranking al Qaeda figure [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]] in one of the U.S. [[drone attacks in Pakistan]], Clinton defended the action, saying "We will always maintain our right to use force against groups such as al Qaeda that have attacked us and still threaten us with imminent attack.

On September 11, 2012, an [[attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi]] took place, resulting in the death of U.S. Ambassador [[J. Christopher Stevens]] and three other Americans. The next day, Clinton also made a statement describing the perpetrators as "heavily armed militants" and "a small and savage group – not the people or government of Libya."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama vows to track down ambassador's killers |author=Matt Spetalnick |author2=Hadeel Al Shalchi |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/12/us-libya-usa-attack-idUSBRE88B0EI20120912?irpc=932 |newspaper=Reuters |date=September 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton also responded to the notion that the attack had been related to the [[Reactions to Innocence of Muslims|reactions in Egypt and elsewhere]] to the [[Criticism of Islam|anti-Islamic]] online video known as ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'', saying: "Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet.

The attack, and questions surrounding the U.S. Government's preparedness for it, and explanations for what had happened afterward, became a political firestorm in the U.S., especially in the context of the [[United States presidential election, 2012|ongoing presidential election]].&lt;ref name="cnn-attack-resp" /&gt; The State Department had previously identified embassy and personnel security as a major challenge in its budget and priorities report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Years of warning about embassy security preceded Libya attack |author=John Solomon |url=http://www.washingtonguardian.com/red-flags-embassy-security |work=Washington Guardian |date=September 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028061103/http://www.washingtonguardian.com/red-flags-embassy-security |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the September 20, Clinton gave a classified briefing to U.S. Senators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Rogin|title=Republican senators decry 'useless, worthless' Clinton briefing on Libya attack|url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/20/republican_senators_decry_useless_worthless_clinton_briefing_on_libya_attack|work=Foreign Policy|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which several Republican attendees criticized, angry at the Obama administration's rebuff of their attempts to learn details of the Benghazi attack, only to see that information published the next day in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alexander Bolton|title=Senate GOP furious newspaper got better briefing on Libya|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/251109-senate-republicans-upset-obama-administration-passed-them-over-for-the-new-york-times |work=The Hill|date=September 22, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did announce the formation of an Accountability Review Board panel, chaired by longtime diplomat [[Thomas R.

On October 15, regarding the question of preparedness, Clinton said she was accountable: "I take responsibility. I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. ... I take this very personally. So we're going to get to the bottom of it, and then we're going to do everything we can to work to prevent it from happening again."&lt;ref name="cnn-attack-resp"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/15/us/clinton-benghazi/index.html |title=Clinton: I'm responsible for diplomats' security |author=Labott, Elise |publisher=CNN |date=October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the different explanations afterward for what had happened, she said, "In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion. And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens."&lt;ref name="cnn-attack-resp" /&gt;

On November 6, 2012, Obama was re-elected for a second term as president. Clinton said shortly before the election that she would stay on until her successor was confirmed, but that "this is not an open-ended kind of time frame."&lt;ref name="wapo-102612"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/clinton-wont-leave-til-successor-in-place/2012/10/26/4f794786-1f7f-11e2-afca-58c2f5789c5d_story.html |title=Clinton won't leave til successor in place |author=McCrummen, Stephanie |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her continuing to express a lack of interest, speculation continued about Clinton as a possible candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="nyt-gc-next"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/opinion/sunday/collins-hillarys-next-move.html |title=Hillary's Next Move |author=[[Gail Collins|Collins, Gail]] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 11, 2012 |page=SR1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-102612" /&gt; A poll taken in Iowa, the first state in the nomination process, showed that in a hypothetical 2016 caucuses contest, Clinton would have 58&amp;nbsp;percent support, with Vice President Biden coming in next at 17&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/11/exclusive-clinton-would-dominate-iowa-caucuses-ppp-149064.html |title=Exclusive: Clinton would dominate 2016 Iowa caucuses, PPP shows |author=Burns, Alexander |newspaper=Politico |date=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in November, Clinton traveled to Jersusalem, the West Bank, and Cairo, meeting with leaders [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], [[Mahmoud Abbas]] and [[Mohamed Morsi]] respectively, in an effort to stop the [[Operation Pillar of Defense|2012 Gaza conflict]]. On November 21, she participated in a joint appearance with Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Mohamed Kamel Amr]] to announce that a cease-fire agreement had been reached between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/21/world/meast/gaza-israel-strike/index.html |title=Cease-fire declared in Gaza conflict |publisher=CNN |date=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[2012 Egyptian protests]] against Morsi broke out shortly thereafter, Clinton said that it showed how a dialogue between both sides was immediately needed on how to reshape that nation's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/12/05/egypt-morsi.html |title=Egypt clashes between Morsi backers, protesters hurt 200 |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-December, Clinton fell victim to a stomach virus contracted on a trip to Europe. She subsequently became very dehydrated and then fainted, suffering a mild concussion. As a result, she cancelled another trip and scratched an appearance at scheduled Congressional hearings on the Benghazi matter.&lt;ref name="ap-conc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/us/politics/hillary-clinton-concussion.html |title=Clinton Is Recovering From a Concussion |author=Mazzetti, Mark |author2=Gordon, Michael R. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few conservative figures, including Congressman [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] and Ambassador to the UN [[John R.

On January 23, Clinton finally gave more than five hours of testimony on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]].&lt;ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" /&gt; She said with a choking voice, "For me, this is not just a matter of policy, it's personal. I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters."&lt;ref name="abc-glasses" /&gt; She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them.&lt;ref name="nyt-0123-hearings"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/us/testifying-on-benghazi-clinton-cites-new-security-steps.html |title=Facing Congress, Clinton Defends Her Actions Before and After Libya Attack |author=Gordon, Michael R. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 2013 |page=A11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said, "I feel responsible for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them."&lt;ref name="nyt-0123-hearings" /&gt; She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.&lt;ref name="nyt-0123-hearings" /&gt;

Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], a Republican associated with the [[Tea Party movement]], questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."&lt;ref name="cnn-0123-hearings"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/23/politics/clinton-benghazi/index.html |title=Clinton takes on Benghazi critics, warns of more security threats |author=Dougherty, Jill |author2=Cohen, Tom |publisher=CNN |date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative [[Jeff Duncan (politician)|Jeff Duncan]] accusing her of "national security malpractice" and Senator [[Rand Paul]] saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department&lt;ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" /&gt; (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator [[John McCain]] said that while "It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.&lt;ref name="nyt-0123-hearings" /&gt;

Clinton also took the opportunity to address the ongoing [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|conflict in Mali]] and the rest of Northern Africa, saying "this Pandora's Box if you will" of side effects from the Arab Spring had opened a new security challenge for the U.S.&lt;ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" /&gt; Specifically, she said "we cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven."&lt;ref name="cnn-0123-hearings" /&gt;

The next day, January 24, Clinton introduced John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as hearings were held on his nomination to succeed her. She called him "the right choice to carry forward the Obama Administration's foreign policy", and called out his [[Fulbright Hearings#Kerry's testimony|testimony before the same committee in 1971 in opposition to the Vietnam War]] as "speaking hard truths about a war that had gone badly off track."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/01/24/transcript-hillary-clinton-introduces-john-kerry-at-secretary-of-state-confirmation-hearing/ |title=Transcript: Hillary Clinton Introduces John Kerry at Secretary of State Confirmation Hearing |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=January 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216023227/http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/01/24/transcript-hillary-clinton-introduces-john-kerry-at-secretary-of-state-confirmation-hearing/ |archivedate=February 16, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both public appearances, as well as at the [[second inauguration of Barack Obama]], Clinton wore glasses (instead of her usual contact lens), which upon closer examination were seen to have [[Fresnel prism]]s attached to them, likely to counteract lingering blurred or double vision from her concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/hillary-double-mrs-clinton-specs-hint-impairment-article-1.1247375 |title=Seeing double: Clinton spokesperson confirms Daily News analysis that Secretary of State is wearing glasses to correct vision problems after concussion and blood clot |author=Moore, Tina |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of special glasses was confirmed by the State Department, which said, "She'll be wearing these glasses instead of her contacts for a period of time because of lingering issues stemming from her concussion."&lt;ref name="abc-glasses"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clintons-glasses-concussion-fashion/story?id=18313426 |title=Hillary Clinton's Glasses Are For Concussion, Not Fashion |author=Hughes, Dana |author2=Childs, Dan |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, ''[[60 Minutes]]'' aired a joint interview with Obama and Clinton. The interview was Obama's idea and was the first he had done with a member of his administration.&lt;ref name="pol-60m"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/60-minutes-obama-clinton-pressed-on-2016-86790.html |title=Obama, Clinton pressed on 2016 in joint interview |author=Epstein, Jennifer |newspaper=Politico |date=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Obama consistently praised Clinton's performance in the position, saying "I think Hillary will go down as one of the finest secretary of states we've had."&lt;ref name="lat-60m"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-hillary-clinton-60-minutes-interview-20130127,0,5348368.story |title=Obama praises Hillary Clinton in joint interview on '60 Minutes' |author=Savage, David G. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both said the relationship between them had been very comfortable, and that getting past their 2008 primary campaign battles had not been difficult for them personally.&lt;ref name="pol-60m" /&gt; Regarding her health, Clinton said, "I still have some lingering effects from falling on my head and having the blood clot. But the doctors tell me that will all recede. And so, thankfully, I'm looking forward to being at full speed."&lt;ref name="lat-60m" /&gt;

On January 29, Clinton held a global and final town hall meeting, the 59th of her tenure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/01/203337.htm |title=Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton To Hold Global Town Hall |publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]] |date=January 28, 2013 |access-date=July 11, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822173459/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/01/203337.htm |archive-date=August 22, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }} The YouTube link within shows the town hall being held.&lt;/ref&gt; Also on January 29, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved Kerry's nomination unanimously and the full Senate confirmed the nomination by a 94–3 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/29/john-kerry-confirmed-secretary-of-state |title=John Kerry confirmed as secretary of state in landslide senate vote |agency=Reuters |newspaper=The Guardian |date=January 30, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her final public speech, on January 31 before the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Clinton returned to the themes of "smart power".&lt;ref name="cbs-cfr-farewell"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57566994/in-farewell-speech-clinton-calls-for-smart-power-on-global-stage/ |title=In farewell speech, Clinton calls for 'smart power' on global stage |author=Madison, Lucy |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that a new architecture was needed for relations within the world, giving an analogy of [[Frank Gehry]] compared to [[ancient Greek architecture]]: "Some of his work at first might appear haphazard, but in fact, it's highly intentional and sophisticated. Where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world, today we need a dynamic mix of materials and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/hillary-clinton-sets-vision-for-continued-us-dominance-87029.html |title=Hillary Clinton sets vision for continued U.S. dominance |author=Epstein, Jennifer |newspaper=Politico |date=January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She added, echoing Madeleine Albright,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/news/iraq/1998/02/19/98021907_tpo.html |title=Transcript: Albright Interview on NBC-TV February 19 |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=February 19, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; "... we are truly the indispensable nation, it's not meant as a boast or an empty slogan.

Clinton's final day as secretary was February 1, 2013, when she met with Obama to hand in her letter of resignation and later gave farewell remarks in a meeting with employees at State Department headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/01/politics/hillary-final-day/index.html |title=Clinton's farewell marred by embassy bombing |author=Cohen, Tom |publisher=CNN |date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall themes and legacy==
Although Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State was popular at the time among the public and praised by President Obama, observers have noted that there was no signature diplomatic breakthrough during it nor any transformative domination of major issues in the nature of [[Dean Acheson]], [[George Marshall]], or [[Henry Kissinger]].&lt;ref name="lat-legacy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/28/nation/la-na-clinton-legacy-20130128 |title=Hillary Clinton's legacy at State: Splendid but not spectacular |author=Richter, Paul |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nykr-legacy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2013/02/11/130211taco_talk_packer |title=Long Engagements |author=[[George Packer|Packer, George]] |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intractable issues when she entered office, such as Iran, Pakistan, Arab-Israeli relations, and North Korea, were still that way when she left.&lt;ref name="lat-legacy" /&gt; Many of Clinton's initiatives in the "smart power" realm will take much more time to evaluate as to their effect.&lt;ref name="lat-legacy" /&gt; [[Aaron David Miller]], a vice president at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], said that "She's coming away with a stellar reputation that seems to have put her almost above criticism. But you can't say that she's really led on any of the big issues for this administration or made a major mark on high strategy."&lt;ref name="lat-legacy" /&gt; [[Michael E. O'Hanlon]], a [[Brookings Institution]] analyst, said that, "Even an admirer, such as myself, must acknowledge that few big problems were solved on her watch, few victories achieved. [She has been] more solid than spectacular."&lt;ref name="lat-legacy" /&gt; Others have been more highly critical of her tenure as Secretary; in a 2015 book entitled ''[[Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America]]'', former [[Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] and his daughter, [[Liz Cheney]] argue that Clinton's tenure, and the [[Obama administration]]'s foreign policy generally, weakened U.S. standing in its international relations and deviated sharply from 70 years of well-established, bipartisan U.S. foreign and defense policy that the United States had generally adhered to since [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="simonandschuster"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/Exceptional/Dick-Cheney/9781501115417 |title=Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America, By Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney |date= |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |access-date=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, such as [[Eric Schmidt]] disagree, and have argued that Clinton was "perhaps the most significant secretary of state since" Acheson.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; All agreed on her celebrity; as one unnamed official said, "She's the first secretary who's also been a global rock star. It's allowed her to raise issues on the global agenda in a way that no one before her has been able to do."&lt;ref name="lat-legacy" /&gt;

[[File:Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton speakings together.jpg|thumb|Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama discuss matters in 2009, at a picnic table on the grounds of the White House]]

The divisions between Obama and Clinton that many observers had originally predicted, never happened.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; Indeed, a writer for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' declared that "Obama and Clinton have instead led the least discordant national-security team in decades, despite enormous challenges on almost every front."&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; In part, this was because Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; Nevertheless, there were limitations to her influence: Much of the handling of the Middle East, Iraq, and Iran was done by the White House or Pentagon during her tenure,&lt;ref name="nyt-backstage" /&gt; and on some other issues as well, policy-making was kept inside the White House among Obama's inner circle of advisors.&lt;ref name="nykr-legacy" /&gt; There were also differences of opinion. Clinton failed to persuade Obama to arm and train Syrian rebels in 2012, but overcame initial opposition to gain approval of her visit to Burma in 2011.&lt;ref name="nyt-backstage" /&gt; Clinton's initial idea of having special envoys under her handling key trouble spots fell apart due to various circumstances.&lt;ref name="lat-legacy" /&gt; Clinton did find bureaucratic success in edging out the [[U.S. Commerce Department]], by having the State Department take a lead role in sales pitches in favor of U.S. companies.&lt;ref name="bbw-legacy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-10/hillary-clintons-business-legacy-at-the-state-department#p1 |title=Hillary Clinton's Business Legacy at the State Department |author=Dwoskin, Elizabeth |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, she helped negotiate international deals for the likes of [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], and [[Westinghouse Electric Company]].&lt;ref name="bbw-legacy" /&gt; Clinton believed, more than most prior secretaries, that the commercial aspects of diplomacy and the promotion of international trade were vital to American foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name="bbw-legacy" /&gt;

Obama later referred to the Libya intervention when questioned about his worst mistake.&lt;ref name="libya-legacy-obama"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525 |title=The Obama Doctrine |author=Goldberg, Jeffrey |work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama asserted that he had been reluctant to intervene but that intervention had been championed by Clinton and Susan Rice.&lt;ref name="libya-legacy-obama" /&gt; Obama cited the lack of preparation the Administration had made for a post-Gaddafi Libya, lack of followup by European countries and greater-than-expected intertribal divisions in Libya.&lt;ref name="libya-legacy-clinton"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/14/hillary-clinton-has-no-regrets-about-libya/ |title=Hillary Clinton Has No Regrets About Libya |author=Ghattas, Kim |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Clinton's stance is that the intervention was beneficial because it avoided another Syria-like scenario.&lt;ref name="libya-legacy-clinton" /&gt;

Clinton's background as an elected politician showed in her touch for dealing with people, in remembering personal connections, in visiting State Department staff when overseas, and in sympathizing with the dilemmas of elected foreign leaders.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt; It sometimes served to her detriment though, such as in Egypt when her personal relationship with the Mubaraks may have caused her to initially back them too long during the Egyptian Revolution.&lt;ref name="nytm-rock"/&gt; At least until the Benghazi matter, she retained personal support among a number of Republicans; in mid-2012, Republican Senator [[Lindsey Graham]] said, "I think she's represented our nation well. She is extremely well respected throughout the world, handles herself in a very classy way and has a work ethic second to none."&lt;ref name="nytm-rock" /&gt;

Especially in the Mideast turmoil but elsewhere as well, Clinton saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure, the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide.&lt;ref name="nw-doctrine" /&gt; Moreover, she viewed women's rights and human rights as critical for U.S. security interests,&lt;ref name="elle-2012" /&gt; as part of what has become known as the "[[Hillary Doctrine]]".&lt;ref name="cfr-zenko"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2015/06/24/book-review-the-hillary-doctrine-sex-american-foreign-policy/ |title=Book Review – 'The Hillary Doctrine: Sex &amp; American Foreign Policy' |first=Micah |last=Zenko|authorlink=Micah Zenko |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=June 24, 2015}} Also published in ''[[Newsweek]]'' as [http://www.newsweek.com/did-hillary-implement-womens-issues-foreign-policy-347219 "Did Hillary Implement a Women's-Issues Foreign Policy?"], June 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Former State Department director and coordinator Theresa Loar said in 2011 that, "I honestly think Hillary Clinton wakes up every day thinking about how to improve the lives of women and girls. And I don't know another world leader who is doing that."&lt;ref&gt;Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities, and in some cases feeling safer, as the result of her actions and visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson and Leidl, ''The Hillary Doctrine'', pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-2012 [[Pew Research]] study of public opinions found that Clinton was viewed positively in Japan and most European countries in terms of people having confidence that she would do the right thing in world affairs.&lt;ref name="pew-global" /&gt; She received mixed marks in China, Russia, and some Central and South American countries, and low marks in Muslim countries, on this question.&lt;ref name="pew-global" /&gt; Overall, Clinton's attempts to improve the image of America in Muslim countries did not find any immediate success due to many factors, including the unpopularity of [[drone strikes in Pakistan]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="pew-global" /&gt; Perceptions of the U.S. in those countries declined during her tenure according to a Pew Research, which found that only 15 percent of Muslims had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 25 percent in 2009.&lt;ref name="pew-global"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/13/global-opinion-of-obama-slips-international-policies-faulted/ |title=Global Opinion of Obama Slips, International Policies Faulted |publisher=Pew Research |date=June 13, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in Pakistan, only 12 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 16 percent in 2009,&lt;ref name="pew-paki"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/27/pakistani-public-opinion-ever-more-critical-of-u-s/ |title=Pakistani Opinion Ever More Critical of the U.S. |publisher=Pew Research |date=June 27, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only 3 percent had confidence in Clinton compared to 37 percent not.&lt;ref name="pew-global" /&gt;

The first secretary of state to visit countries such as [[Togo]] and [[Timor-Leste]], Clinton believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the digital age. As she said in remarks shortly before leaving office, "I have found it highly ironic that, in today's world, when we can be anywhere virtually, more than ever people want us to show up, actually. Somebody said to me the other day, 'I look at your travel schedule. Why Togo? Why the Cook Islands?' No secretary of state had ever been to Togo before. Togo happens to be on the U.N. Security Council. Going there, making the personal investment, has a real strategic purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/departing-secretary-state-hillary-clinton-leaves-legacy-firsts/story?id=18039755&amp;singlePage=true |title=Departing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Leaves Behind a Legacy of Firsts |author=Parnass, Sarah |author2=Hughes, Dana |publisher=ABC News |date=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-tenure issues==

===Financial accounting, document requests, Clinton Foundation===
{{Main|Clinton Foundation–State Department controversy}}
According to the [[Office of the Inspector General]] report made in 2014, the State Department's records failed to properly account for some $6 billion in contracts over the prior six years, including around $2 billion for the department's mission in Iraq. The report said, "The failure to maintain contract files adequately creates significant financial risk and demonstrates a lack of internal control over the Department's contract actions," and added that investigators and auditors had found "repeated examples of poor contract file administration" which it had characterized as having been one of the department's "major management challenges" for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/04/04/watchdog-state-department-cant-fully-account-for-6b-worth-contracts/ |title=Watchdog: State Department can’t fully account for $6B worth of contracts |publisher=Fox News |date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2014, the State Department failed to turn over documents to the [[Associated Press]] that it had asked for through a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request based on the possibility of [[Hillary Clinton#Subsequent activities|Clinton running for president in 2016]].

The ethics agreement between the State Department and Bill Clinton and the Clinton Foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary's tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during early 2015. A ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' report found that the Clinton Foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once Secretary Clinton's tenure had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/foreign-government-gifts-to-clinton-foundation-on-the-rise-1424223031 |title=Foreign Government Gifts to Clinton Foundation on the Rise |first=James V. |last=Grimaldi |first2=Rebecca |last2=Ballhaus |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Washington Post]]'' inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the secretary's tenure found a six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before Clinton became secretary, which was permissible under the agreement, and also one instance of a new donation, $500,000 from Algeria in January 2010 for earthquake relief in Haiti, that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review but did not. The ''Post'' noted that the donation "coincided with a spike" in lobbying efforts by Algeria of the State Department regarding their human rights record but that during 2010 and 2011 the Department still issued human rights reports critical of Algeria's restrictions on freedom of assembly, women's rights and labor rights that also pointed to instances of extrajudicial killings, corruption, and lack of transparency in the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html |title=Foreign governments gave millions to foundation while Clinton was at State Dept. |first=Rosalind S. |last=Helderman |first2=Tom |last2=Hamburger |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Politico]]'' analysis of State Department documents found that the department approved virtually all of Bill Clinton's proposed speaking engagements, even when they lacked sufficient information about the valuation of those talks or links between them and possible subsequent donations to the Clinton Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/ethics-approval-came-easily-at-hillary-clintons-state-department-115468.html |title=Hillary's State Department OK'd Bill's big-money speeches |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |newspaper=Politico |date=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2013, the Russian atomic energy agency [[Rosatom]] acquired [[Uranium One]], a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20&amp;nbsp;percent of the uranium production capacity in the United States. The strategically sensitive acquisition required the approval of the Canadian government as well as a number of U.S. governmental bodies including the State Department. In April 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. Also during this time, Bill Clinton received a $500,000 payment from [[Renaissance Capital (Russian company)|Renaissance Capital]], a Russian investment bank whose analysts were praising Uranium One stock, for making speech in Moscow.&lt;ref name="nyt-u-one"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html |title=Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal |first=Jo |last=Becker |first2=Mike |last2=McIntire |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation donations were not publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation or the State Department, despite a prior agreement to do so, in part due to taking advantage of the donations going through a Canadian affiliate of the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/five-questions-about-the-clintons-and-a-uranium-company |title=Five Questions About the Clintons and a Uranium Company |first=Amy |last=Davidson |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[FactCheck.org]] analysis stated that while the reports raised "legitimate questions about the Clinton Foundation and its donations," the reports "presented no evidence that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.factcheck.org/2015/04/no-veto-power-for-clinton-on-uranium-deal/ |title=No 'Veto Power' for Clinton on Uranium Deal |first=Eugene |last=Kiely |publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] |date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about the issue in June 2015, the former secretary said of the State Department's role in the approval, "There were nine government agencies that that had to sign off on that deal.

===Use of private email server===
{{Main|Hillary Clinton email controversy}}
In early March 2015, a ''[[New York Times]]'' report revealed that throughout her time as Secretary of State, Clinton used her own private [[Message transfer agent|email server]], rather than government-issued departmental ones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/hillary-clintons-use-of-private-email-at-state-department-raises-flags.html |title=Hillary Clinton Used Personal Email Account at State Dept., Possibly Breaking Rules |first=Michael S. |last=Schmidt |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 2, 2015 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigation revealed that the day of her first Senate hearing to become Secretary of State, Clinton, or an associate, purchased a private email server under the pseudonym "Eric Hoteham".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-email-mystery-man-eric-hoteham/story?id=29413827|title=Hillary Clinton Email Mystery Man: What We Know About Eric Hoteham |first1=Meghan |last1=Keneally |first2=Liz |last2=Kreutz |first3=Shushannah |last3=Walshe |date=March 5, 2015 |publisher=ABC News|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/who-is-eric-hoteham-1425588492|title=Who Is Eric Hoteham?|first=James |last=Taranto|date=March 5, 2015|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The server was set up in her home in [[Chappaqua, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-private-server/386818/|title=Hillary Clinton Ran Private Server Out of Westchester Home |first=Adam |last=Chandler|date=March 4, 2015 |work=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter gained widespread public attention due to concerns about the security of the mails she sent and received and whether they were exposed to hacking and surveillance; the availability and preservation of the mails for [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests and [[National Archives and Records Administration|the archival historical record]]; and whether her action had violated any federal laws, regulations, or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/politics/using-private-email-hillary-clinton-thwarted-record-requests.html |title=Using Private Email, Hillary Clinton Thwarted Record Requests |author=Schmidt, Michael S. |author2=Chozick, Amy |work=The New York Times |date=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-email"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-department-reviewing-whether-clinton-e-mail-violated-security-rules/2015/03/05/16d1547e-c378-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html |title=Clinton e-mail review could find security issues |author=Leonnig, Carol D. |author2=Helderman, Rosalind S. |author3=Gearan, Anne |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in question was whether the use of the private email server violated State Department transparency protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/state-department-email-rule-hillary-clinton-115804.html|title=Clinton private email violated 'clear-cut' State Dept. rules|first=Josh |last=Gerstein |date=March 5, 2015 |work=[[Politico]] |accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 turned over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and that she now wanted them made public.&lt;ref name="wapo-email" /&gt; These 55,000 printed pages accounted for 30,490, or slightly less than half, of the 62,320 emails that Clinton had sent or received on her private email account during her time as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3740357/hillary-clinton-emails-search/ The Problem With Hillary Clinton’s Email Record Search], ''Time'', March 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; At a press conference Clinton said she had set up the separate server as a matter of convenience so that she could carry one device and not two, but that in retrospect "it would have been better if I'd simply used a second email account and carried a second phone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/hillary-clinton-email-scandal-press-conference/ |title=Hillary Clinton: I used one email 'for convenience' |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she had sent mails to State Department employees on their government accounts, ensuring such mails would be preserved, but it then turned out that the department did not automatically or routinely save such mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-state-department-archiving-emails-116062.html |title=Hillary Clinton email flap exposes gaps in State Department records |publisher=Politico |date=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelations, questions were raised about whether Clinton, when she resigned in February 2013, had signed Form OF-109, a standard document declaring that she had turned over all work-related records. After searching, the State Department said it had "no record" that Clinton had signed the form, were "fairly certain" that she had not, and that it appeared neither of her two immediate predecessors as secretary had either.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/03/17/state-dept-clinton-didnt-sign-form-certifying-return-of-documents-when-she-left/ State Department: Clinton didn’t sign form certifying return of documents], ''Washington Post'', March 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to the text of the form, it warns individuals signing it that falsification is subject to criminal penalties under Section 1001 of Title 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action;jsessionid=A6B11B7C8F0A92109BD15CBA12BD1B78.eleven?mediaId=29929 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716104033/http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getFormFormatPortalData.action;jsessionid=A6B11B7C8F0A92109BD15CBA12BD1B78.eleven?mediaId=29929 |archive-date=July 16, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of the emails on Clinton's private server were emails sent in 2011 and 2012 by [[Sidney Blumenthal]], a political supporter and campaign staffer who worked for the Clinton Foundation. Blumenthal prepared, from public and other sources, about 25 memos which he sent to Clinton during 2011 and 2012 which she shared through her aide, [[Jake Sullivan]], with senior State Department personnel. In the form of intelligence briefings, the memos sometimes touted his business associates and, at times contained inaccurate information.&lt;ref name=NYT51815&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael S.

In August 2015, it was reported that Clinton had personally paid a State Department staffer, Bryan Pagliano, who had previously served as IT director for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, to maintain her private server while she was Secretary of State.&lt;ref name=WP0901&gt;Rosalind S.

===Mis-handling of classified information===
On July 23, 2015, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the existence of a June 2015, memorandum to the [[Justice Department (United States)|Justice Department]] from the [[Inspectors General]] of the [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] and the [[State Department]] regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State.&lt;ref name=NYT72415&gt;{{cite news|author1=Michael S.

Kennedy]], said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Clinton's private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information.&lt;ref name=NYT72415 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN3&gt;{{cite news | first=Elise | last=Labott | title=Clinton emails Included Classified Information | publisher= CNN | date=July 24, 2015 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/24/politics/hillary-clinton-email-justice-department/ | accessdate= 2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their joint statement, the inspectors general said that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.&lt;ref name=NYT72415 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ3&gt;{{cite news | first=Byron | last= Tau | title=Hillary Clinton Sent Classified Information Over Email While at State Department, Review Finds; Information was classified as 'secret' at the time it was sent, intelligence community inspector general says | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= July 24, 2015 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/investigation-sought-into-hillary-clintons-emails-1437714369 | accessdate= 2014-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton and her campaign reiterated that the information transmitted was not classified "at the time", but the inspectors general, as well as reporting by the New York Times and others, said that it, in fact, was classified at the time.&lt;ref name=NYT72415 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ3 /&gt; Information is considered classified if its disclosure would likely harm national security, and government procedures and protocols require that such information be sent or stored only on government computer networks with government safeguards.&lt;ref name=NYT72415 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ3 /&gt;

An [[FBI]] probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/02/04/how-did-top-secret-emails-end-up-on-hillary-clintons-server/ |title=How did 'top secret' emails end up on Hillary Clinton's server? |date=February 4, 2016 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the summer and fall of 2016 the probe was twice concluded with a recommendation of no charges, a recommendation that was followed by the Justice Department, but according to Clinton herself, the emails matter and the way in which it would not go away contributed to her electoral defeat.&lt;ref name="Politico111216"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gabriel |last=Debenedetti|title=Clinton blames Comey letters for defeat|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-comey-letters-defeat-231280|work=Politico|date=November 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indo Europeesch Verbond''' (IEV) or '''Indo European Alliance''' was a social movement and political organisation founded in 1919 by the [[Indo people|Indo-European (Eurasian)]] community of the [[Dutch East Indies]] that fought for race equality and political say in late colonial [[Indonesia]] during the early 20th century.

It was one of the first and largest European organisations in the Dutch East Indies that formulated a desire for an independent nation albeit in relation with a Dutch dominion and supported the [[Soetardjo Petition]] of 1936 that aimed for an independent status within a Dutch commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Willems"&gt;Willems, Wim ''Sporen van een Indisch verleden (1600-1942), Part II by van Hoogevest, W.M.'' (COMT, Leiden, 1994) P.81,84 {{ISBN|90-71042-44-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its vision was to retain an important position for the Indo European (Eurasian) segment of Indonesian society after obtaining independence from the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|81,140–143}} Founding father of this organisation was [[Karel Zaalberg]] chief editor of one of the country's largest newspapers ([[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]) and close friend to famous contemporaries like [[Paulus Adrianus Daum|P.A. Daum]], [[Edgar du Perron|E.du Perron]] and [[Ernest Douwes Dekker]].

Its main chairman and president (1929–1939) was [[Dick de Hoog]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Steur, P. ''"Eurasian dilemma in Indonesia"'' Vol. 20, No. 1 in ''"The journal of Asian studies"'' (Publisher: Association of Asian Studies, 1960) P.45-60 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2050071]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Indos in colonial history}}
The Dutch East East Indies (1800–1949), nowadays known as Indonesia, was the largest colony in the [[Dutch Empire]]. The colonial hierarchy consisted of 2 legal classes: 1) the European class; 2) the Indigenous class. In 1920 a third class: Foreign Easterners (Dutch: [[:id:Vreemde Oosterlingen]] was added.&lt;ref&gt;See online educational paper: [http://www.tongtong.nl/indische-school/contentdownloads/tjiook_09web.pdf] and Cordes, Jan, Willem, Cornelis. ''‘De Privaatrechterlijke Toestand: Der Vreemde Oosterlingen Op Java En Madoera (1887).’'' (Publisher” Bibiliobazaar, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-559-23498-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eurasians known as Indos made up almost 75% of the European headcount.

The Dutch East Indies had a non egalitarian and patriarchal social and legal system. Indo children were for instance only registered as European if the European father decided to acknowledge his children with his indigenous partner.&lt;ref&gt;Vandenbosch, Amry ''‘The Dutch East Indies: its government, problems and politics.’'' (University of California Press, 1941)&lt;/ref&gt; When this did not happen these Indo children would be assimilated into their mothers’ indigenous community. The colonial saying to describe this phenomenon was ''“The (Indo) child would disappear into the kampung (English: native village)”''.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Guno ''‘Tussen onderdanen, rijksgenoten en Nederlanders: Nederlandse politici over burgers uit Oost en West en Nederland, 1945-2005.’'' (Publisher: Rozenberg, Amsterdam, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the official European legal class Indos could be found in all 3 social layers of European society. This European segment of society can be broadly divided into the following 3 social layers: 1) a small top layer of colonial and commercial leadership, including governors, directors, managers (ceo's), etc. Mostly consisting of expatriate Dutchmen; 2) a large middle class of mostly Indo civil servants; 3) lower income (to poor) layer solely consisting of Indo people that were legally European, but had a living standard close or similar to the indigenous masses.

Since 1870, none of these layers were allowed to own and work land and with the continued arrival of white Dutch expatriates, their social status in colonial times increasingly depended on their efforts to blend into the white upper class. Within the legal class of Europeans, therefore, there was clear social, cultural and mental distinction between the so-called expatriate ‘Totok’ (full blooded) European and native ‘Indo’ (mixed) European.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|11–22}}

==Prelude==
The watershed moment initiating the political emancipation process of the Eurasian segment of colonial society occurred in the middle of the 19th century, when [[Indo people|Indos]] massively protested the discriminatory provisions implemented with the introduction of the '[[Cultivation System]]' (1830–1870). The start of the 20th century also saw continued and increasing pauperism among poor Indos increasingly dependent on charity, which created the mental specter of indivertible impoverishment.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|73}}

Moreover, the reality of plural colonial society composed of two main social orders (the European and Indigenous communities), living side by side, yet without mingling into one political, economic or cultural unit, pushed the [[Indos in colonial history|Indo-European]] in a fundamental position of insecurity. From the [[Indos in pre-colonial history|pre-colonial position]] of ''"middle men"'' the [[Indos in colonial history]] progressively became ''"marginal men"''. With the introduction of the ‘[[Dutch Ethical Policy|Ethical Policy]]' (1900–1930) Indos not only experienced the near impossible task of resisting pressure from the powerful Dutch authorities, but also from the rising numbers of the educated indigenous elite representing the massive majority of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|71–72}}

Inspired by [[Ernest Douwes Dekker]]‘s short-lived '[[Indische Party]]' (1912–1913) and the establishment of an infant form of a Dutch East Indies parliament, called the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)|People's Council]] (Dutch: [[:nl:Volksraad (Nederlands-Indië)|Volksraad]]) in 1917, the IEV was founded by [[Karel Zaalberg]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|74}}

==History 1920s==
From its conception in 1919, the IEV’s first aim was to establish unity among all 3 social layers of the Indo-European community, and was founded under the appropriate motto: ‘One for All, All for One’. To secure the interests of the majority of its middle class it clearly set out to also protect and uplift the most vulnerable bottom layer of Indo society.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van Dick de Hoog voorzitter van het Indo-Europees Verbond met docenten die werkzaam zijn op door het IEV opgerichte scholen TMnr 60042937.jpg|thumb|upright|IEV president [[Dick de Hoog]] with teachers working in the IEV funded schools.]]

The organisation started out as a social movement and only gradually entered the political arena.  In 1924 it elaborated on its founding principles, by firstly stating an unfaltering trust in Dutch authority as a representation of both the achievements and the potential of Western civilisation and modernisation. Simultaneously it also stated the aspiration to make that same authority redundant and endeavored to move control of the colony back to the Dutch East Indies, envisioning a self-sufficient and independent dominion.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|75–76}}

With 10,000 members in 1922 and almost 15,000 members in 1929 it became the largest European political movement of the early 20th century and put independence for the colonial Dutch East Indies on the agenda.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|75}} Meanwhile, it also experimented with projects aimed to bring Indo Europeans from desk jobs to agriculture as well as to establish more opportunities for education by building schools.

==History 1930s==
During the economic crisis of the 1930s the organisation remained large however was not met with great enthousiasm by the colonial government. Democratic institutions in the colony were still infantile and the movement was kept on a string by the colonial government, unable to sufficiently reach out to the rising indigenous Indonesian independence movement.

After the economic crisis of 1929 Indos were the first to truly comprehend the profound change initiated by the so-called ‘[[Dutch Ethical Policy]]’ (1900–1930). The relatively limited but high quality educational opportunities that had been opened to indigenous peoples had produced a large and growing number of Western style educated indigenous people competing on the job market. Jobs that were traditionally occupied by Indos were more and more taken over by indigenous people. As Indos numbered only 0.3 percent of the 60 million native people inhabiting the Dutch East Indies they came under increasing threat of marginalisation. At the same time the educated indigenous elite was also developing an Indonesian nationalist political agenda.

During the early '30s the IEV still mainly orientated itself on the colonial top layer of Dutch expatriates and settlers, striving for true equality between the Dutch ruling class and the Indo-Europeans and profiling themselves as exponents of Western modernity in the Dutch East Indies. For a while they even allied with the far political right i.e. ‘Vaderlandsche Club’ and lobbied for incentives to persuade Dutch expatriates to settle in the colony.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van leden van het Indo-Europees Verbond voor hun clubgebouw in Buitenzorg tijdens de IEV campagne voor de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen TMnr 60042110.jpg|thumb|left|IEV meeting in [[Buitenzorg]].]]

In the second half the '30s the IEV already shifted its orientation towards the nationalist indigenous movements and now openly advocated restrictions to the arrival of Dutch expatriates. The IEV was blatantly critical of the Governor-General and supported the [[Soetardjo Petition]] calling for Indonesian independence in 1936. It also advocated an Indies citizenship for all natives and the removal of the ban on Indos to own land. Simultaneously the IEV also continued attempts to build a class of Indo farmers as the economic crisis of the 30’s left Indos bereft of a network for agricultural subsistence able to produce the basic supplies of sustenance.&lt;ref name="Willems" /&gt;{{rp|79}} After more than 10 years of leading the IEV its popular president [[Dick de Hoog]] died in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Meijer, Hans ''Hoog, Frederik Hermanus de (1881-1939)'', in ''‘Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland.’'' ING - Institute for Dutch History [http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn6/hoog]&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1942 [[World War II]] hit the Dutch East Indies the Indo emancipation process was cut short and all political activity ended with the incarceration of the IEV leadership by the Japanese occupiers, while the indigenous independence movement accelerated into the Indonesian revolution.

==History 1940s==

Due to earlier hesitation and the Japanese occupation during World War II, the IEV had missed the attachment to the indigenous Independence movements and came into political disorientation. This ultimately contributed to the isolation of its Indo European followers during the Indonesian National Revolution. Right after Japan's capitulation in 1945 IEV leaders started to reorganise and rebuild their organisation. Attempts were made to find common ground with Indonesian revolutionaries, but were overtaken by the chaotic violence of the [[Bersiap]] period when IEV forerunner Ploegman was one of the first of almost 20,000 Indos to be killed by [[People's Youth (Indonesia)|Pemuda]].&lt;ref name="Meijer"&gt;Meijer, Hans ''In Indië geworteld. De 20ste eeuw.'' (Publisher Bert Bakker, Amsterdam, 2004) P.270 {{ISBN|90-351-2617-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disappointment in the inability of the Dutch government to provide security and civil order as well as its indifference towards the political and social position of Indos left the IEV bewildered. In 1946 sentiments of desperation were reflected in a cartoon by Indo artist [[Eppo Doeve]] in the Dutch main monthly magazine '[[Elsevier]]' headed by the text: ''"Those about to die salute you."'' &lt;ref name="Meijer" /&gt;{{rp|282}} Frustrated with what was perceived as Dutch apathy, negative sentiments towards the Dutch government started to prevail and by 1947 the IEV was advocating Indonesian citizenship for Indos.&lt;ref name="Meijer" /&gt;{{rp|292}} In 1949 the Netherlands officially ceded control to an independent Indonesian Republic.

==Final years==
In 1951 the IEV only accepted members that had chosen Indonesian citizenship and changed its name to the Indonesian name: 'Gabungan Indo Untuk Kesatuan Indonesia' (GIKI). All signs of goodwill towards the Indonesian Republic however did not mitigate anti-Dutch regulations by the Republican government and anti-Indo sentiments in general. Throughout the decade all Dutch language institutions for Indos continued to be eliminated. All schools, orphanages and retirement homes for Indos were closed by 1951. Widespread discrimination in the job market made it impossible for most Indos to pursue meaningful careers, while simultaneously the existing social security benefits were terminated by the Republican government.&lt;ref name="Meijer" /&gt;{{rp|325–26}}

To distract attention from faltering economic progress and strengthen the fragile unity of the young Republic, President [[Sukarno]] continued his strategy of anti-western politics indirectly stimulating anti-Indo polarization. With the traumatic memory of the [[Bersiap]] violence in mind, most Indos that had originally chosen Indonesian citizenship revised their decision. Even IEV leaders that had previously advocated Indonesian citizenship now fled the country. By 1962 both the IEV and its constituency had practically disappeared from Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Meijer" /&gt;{{rp|336}}

Daughter of King [[Erejuwa]] and his wife Emaye, Iye Idolorusan had a sister, Uwala. Their father died, and their mother remarried his son from a prior marriage, [[Akengbuwa]], with whom she had three more children, including sons Omateye and Ejo. The former was recognized as heir, but was in a rivalry with his elder half-brother {{Proper name|Agbagba}}. Iye and Uwala founded the town of [[Batere]] in the event that their brother should need a refuge. Akengbuwa died in 1848, followed closely by the deaths of his two sons in what some felt were suspicious circumstances; as a result, for three years Warri appears to have had no leader. The capital of Warris  population was very limited because people decided to moved to villages in the southern part of the Benin river, during which trade declined and the royal family dispersed. Iye then took control of the kingdom's affairs; not only was she a member of the royal house, she was married to Omoku, a former governor of the tributary state of Bobi. The couple had a son, [[Chanomi]]. Iye was a wealthy trader, and was joined as ruler by Ebrimoni, a senior slave formerly owned by her and her half-brother. The [[British Empire|British]], fearing further destabilization in local trading circles, appeared not to welcome Iye as queen; for her part, she, too, tried to find a suitable ruler, with no luck. Erbimoni was suggested, but the idea met with resistance among the Itsekiri. As a result, Warri lacked another king until 1937, although Iye served as a regent. She continued to live in Bobi, while her son founded his own village.&lt;ref name="Jr.Akyeampong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|author2=Professor Emmanuel Akyeampong|author3=Mr. Steven J.

'''Jack Cleveland Montgomery''' (July 23, 1917 – June 11, 2002) was a [[United States Army]] officer, a [[Cherokee]] Native American, and a recipient of the [[United States]] military's highest decoration—the [[Medal of Honor]]—for his actions in [[World War II]].

Montgomery joined the Army in 1937 from [[Sallisaw, Oklahoma]], and by February 22, 1944 was serving as a [[US First Lieutenant|first lieutenant]] in the [[180th Infantry Regiment (United States)|180th Infantry Regiment]], [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]]. On that day, near [[Padiglione]], [[Italy]], Montgomery single-handedly attacked [[Germany|German]] positions, killing eleven enemy soldiers and taking dozens of prisoners. For his actions in the battle, during which he was seriously wounded, he was awarded the Medal of Honor a year later, on January 15, 1945.

Montgomery graduated from the [[Chilocco Indian Agricultural School]] in north-central Oklahoma. Coincidentally, [[Ernest Childers]], who also earned the Medal of Honor in World War II for service in Italy, graduated from the same school.&lt;ref name="owens"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Owens|first=Ron|title=Medal of Honor: Historical Facts and Figures|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|location=Paducah, Kentucky|year=2004|page=120|isbn=1-56311-995-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s65pmBAUmD4C&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery left the Army while still a first lieutenant. He died at age 84 and was buried in [[Fort Gibson National Cemetery]], [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma]]. The [[Veterans Health Administration]] medical center located in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], is named in his honor.

==Medal of Honor citation==
First Lieutenant Montgomery's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty on February 22, 1944, near Padiglione, Italy. Two hours before daybreak a strong force of enemy infantry established themselves in 3 echelons at 50 yards, 100 yards, and 300 yards, respectively, in front of the rifle platoons commanded by 1st Lt. Montgomery. The closest position, consisting of 4 machineguns and 1 [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], threatened the immediate security of the platoon position. Seizing an [[M1 Garand rifle|M1 rifle]] and several hand grenades, 1st Lt. Montgomery crawled up a ditch to within [[hand grenade]] range of the enemy. Then climbing boldly onto a little mound, he fired his rifle and threw his grenades so accurately that he killed 8 of the enemy and captured the remaining 4. Returning to his platoon, he called for artillery fire on a house, in and around which he suspected that the majority of the enemy had entrenched themselves. Arming himself with a [[carbine]], he proceeded along the shallow ditch, as withering fire from the riflemen and machinegunners in the second position was concentrated on him. He attacked this position with such fury that 7 of the enemy surrendered to him, and both machineguns were silenced. Three German dead were found in the vicinity later that morning. 1st Lt. Montgomery continued boldly toward the house, 300 yards from his platoon position. It was now daylight, and the enemy observation was excellent across the flat open terrain which led to 1st Lt. Montgomery's objective. When the artillery barrage had lifted, 1st Lt. Montgomery ran fearlessly toward the strongly defended position. As the enemy started streaming out of the house, 1st Lt. Montgomery, unafraid of treacherous snipers, exposed himself daringly to assemble the surrendering enemy and send them to the rear. His fearless, aggressive, and intrepid actions that morning, accounted for a total of 11 enemy dead, 32 prisoners, and an unknown number of wounded. That night, while aiding an adjacent unit to repulse a counterattack, he was struck by mortar fragments and seriously wounded. The selflessness and courage exhibited by 1st Lt. Montgomery in alone attacking 3 strong enemy positions inspired his men to a degree beyond estimation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jean-Antoine Chaptal, comte de Chanteloup''' (5 June 1756 – 30 July 1832) was a distinguished French chemist, physician, agronomist, industrialist, statesman, educator and philanthropist. His multifaceted career unfolded during one of the most brilliant periods in French science. In chemistry it was the time of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], Claude-Louis Berthollet, Louis Guyton de Morveau, Antoine-François Fourcroy and Joseph Gay-Lussac. Chaptal made his way into this elite company in Paris beginning in the 1780s, and established his credentials as a serious scientist most definitely with the publication of his first major scientific treatise, the ''Ėléments de chimie'' (3 vols, Montpellier, 1790). His treatise brought the term "nitrogen" into the revolutionary new chemical nomenclature developed by Lavoisier. By 1795, at the newly established ''École Polytechnique'' in Paris, Chaptal shared the teaching of courses in pure and applied chemistry with [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], the doyen of the science. In 1798, Chaptal was elected a member of the prestigious Chemistry Section of the ''[[Institut de France]]''. He became president of the section in 1802 soon after Napoleon appointed him Minister of Interior (6 November 1800). Chaptal was a key figure in the early industrialization in France under Napoleon and during the Bourbon Restoration. He was a founder and first president in 1801 of the important Society for the Encouragement of National Industry and a key organizer of industrial expositions held in Paris in 1801 and subsequent years. He compiled a valuable study, ''De l'industrie française'' (1819), surveying the condition and needs of French industry in the early 1800s. Chaptal was especially strong in applied science. Beginning in the early 1780s, he published a continuous stream of practical essays on such things as acids and salts, alum, sulfur, pottery and cheese making, sugar beets, fertilizers, bleaching, degreasing, painting and dyeing. As a chemicals industrialist, he was a major producer of hydrochloric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and was much sought after as a technical consultant for the manufacture of gunpowder. His reputation as a master of applied science, dedicated to using the discoveries of chemistry for the benefit of industry and agriculture, was furthered with the publication of his ''L'Art de faire, de gouverner et de perfectionner les vins'' (1801) and ''La Chimie appliquée aux arts'' (1806), works that drew on the theoretical chemistry of Lavoisier to revolutionize the art of wine-making in France. His new procedure of adding sugar to increase the final alcohol content of wines came to be called "chaptalization." In 1802, Chaptal purchased the [[Château de Chanteloup]] and its extensive grounds in Touraine, near Amboise. He raised merino sheep and experimented there in his later years on a model farm for the cultivation of sugar beets. He wrote his classic study of the application of scientific principles to the cultivation of land, the ''Chimie appliquée à l'agriculture'' (1823), and composed his important political memoir, ''Mes souvenirs sur Napoléon''(1893). Napoleon named Chaptal Count of the Empire (1808) and Count of Chanteloup (1810). In 1819 he was named by Louis XVIII to the Restoration's Chamber of Peers.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean Pigeire, La vie et l'oeuvre de Chaptal (1756-1832) (Paris, 1932); Maurice Crosland, The Society of Arcueil: A View of French Science at the Time of Napoleon (London, 1967); Maurice Crosland, "Jean Antoine Chaptal," in Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, vol 3 (2008); Jeff Horn &amp; Margaret Jacob, "Jean-Antoine Chaptal and the Cultural Roots of French Industrialization," ''Technology and Culture'',Vol 39, No.4 (1998); Jeff Horn, The Path Not Taken: French Industrialization in the Age of Revolution, 1750-1830 (2006); Harold T.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Chaptal was born in Nojaret (Lozère) in southwestern France, the youngest son of well-to-do small landowners, Antoine Chaptal and Françoise Brunel. He was fortunate to have a rich uncle, Claude Chaptal, who was a prominent physician at Montpellier. The young Chaptal's brilliant record at the area ''collèges'' of Mende and Rodez encouraged his uncle to finance his way through medical school at the University of Montpellier, 1774-76. After receiving his degree of doctor of medicine, he persuaded his uncle to continue his support for three and one-half years of postgraduate study in medicine and chemistry at Paris. There he attended courses on chemistry at the ''École de Médicine'' given by J.B.Bucquet, who was a friend of Lavoisier and instructor earlier of Berthollet. He returned to Montpellier in 1780 to a salaried chair in chemistry at the university, where his lectures were quickly acclaimed. He composed a first book, ''Mémoires de chimie''(1781), reporting on his early studies in chemistry. Also in 1781, he married  Anne-Marie Lajard, the daughter of a rich cottons merchant at Montpellier. With his new wife's substantial dowry, plus capital supplied by his generous uncle, he then established at Montpellier one of the first modern chemical factories in France. The enterprise, manufacturing sulfuric, nitric, hydrochloric and other acids, alum, white lead and soda, among other substances, was a great success. By 1787 Montpellier became a center of innovation for the production of industrial chemicals in France. Chaptal reported regularly on his studies in chemistry applied to industry and agriculture for the ''Société Royale des Sciences de Montpellier''. He communicated with the Controller General's department in Paris in 1782 regarding his projects for bottle-making, dyeing and the manufacture of artificial soda.&lt;ref&gt;Harold T. Parker, An Administrative Bureau during the Old Regime: The Bureau of Commerce and Its Relations to French Industry from May 1781 to November 1783 (1993), pp.68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; His articles were published by the ''Académie Royale des Sciences'' and in the ''Annales de chimie'', the new journal founded in 1789 by Berthollet, Guyton, Fourcroy and others for reporting on the new chemistry and its application. Chaptal was a master popularizer of the new chemistry, applying his knowledge and writing skills to everything that intrigued him from pottery and paper to wines and Roquefort cheese. The ten years or so prior to the Revolution in 1789 in France were perhaps "the best of times" for the young Chaptal. On the eve of the Revolution, he was thirty-three years old—wealthy, famous, happily married, enthusiastic, well connected, full of ideas and hopeful of human progress through science.

===Revolution===
Reflecting later in his life on the Revolution in France, Chaptal wrote: "In the widespread confusion and flood of all passions, the wise man will consider carefully the role he must play; it will appear to him equally dangerous in the midst of such agitation to remain either inactive or to participate."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Antoine Chaptal, Mes souvenirs sur Napoléon (1893), p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaptal was a man of liberal ideas, but apolitical. He never jostled for political power. He believed in orderly change, human progress, competence and hierarchy. Initially, he welcomed the Revolution. But in 1793 he determined to lead opposition in Montpellier against the extremism of the Committee of Public Safety of the National Convention in Paris. As a consequence, he was arrested, imprisoned, and in danger of being guillotined (the sad fate of Lavoisier at the time). Fortunately for Chaptal, his value to the nation as an industrial chemist was deemed sufficient to excuse his politics. France at the time was desperately in need of gunpowder to supply the armies of the Revolution. In the Spring of 1794, by order of Lazare Carnot, the Minister of War, Chaptal was charged with the management of the major gunpowder factory at Grenelle in Paris. Chaptal recounts in his memoirs how, with the help of his fellow scientists—Berthollet, Fourcroy, Guyton and others—he was able to introduce new and more rapid methods for refining saltpeter (at Saint-Germain-des-Prés) and produce increasing amounts of gunpowder at Grenelle.&lt;ref&gt;Chaptal, Mes Souvenirs sur Napoléon, pp.23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; In the language of the Committee of Public Safety, it was the type of service expected of ''"un bon citoyen."'' After Thermidor (July 1794), Chaptal spent about four years mainly in Montpellier teaching at the medical school and rebuilding his chemicals industry. He estimated his losses because of the Revolution at 500,000 francs, almost all of his fortune. In 1798 he decided to take up permanent residence in Paris, leaving his business enterprises in Montpellier to his long-time partner, Étienne Bérard. He was elected to the ''Institut'' (24 May 1798) and became a member of the editorial board of the ''Annales de chimie''. He began to build up a second large chemicals industry near Paris at Ternes, an enterprise managed after 1808 by his son, Jean-Baptiste Chaptal (1782-1833).

===Consulate, Empire, and Restoration===
Napoleon's ''coup d'état'' of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799) leading to the establishment of the Consulate (1799-1804) opened up a new career for Chaptal. He had friends in high places at the time, not the least being the Second Consul, Jean-Jacques Cambacérès, a good friend from Montpellier who was well acquainted with his organizational skills and wide knowledge of the French economy. There was also Claude-Louis Berthollet, by then a close friend of Napoleon, who called Berthollet "my chemist": they were on the Egyptian Expedition together in 1798-99, which mattered. Berthollet could vouch for Chaptal's remarkable abilities and dedication to using science for the advancement of agriculture, commerce and industry. Napoleon as it proved was "prejudiced in favour of men of science" for positions in his government.&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, The Society of Arcueil, p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; His first Minister of Interior (1799) was Berthollet's great friend, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], a brilliant scientist and mathematician of genius, but an extremely poor administrator. He was replaced after six weeks by Napoleon's younger brother, Lucien Bonaparte. But Lucien was always too willful for Napoleon. So it was that Chaptal moved rapidly into position, first with appointment to Napoleon's Council of State, then acting Minister of Interior (6 November 1800), and finally confirmed in the position (21 January 1801). He would remain in this high office until his resignation on 6 August 1804.

Chaptal was one of the best, if not the best, of Napoleon's ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Savant, Les ministres de Napoléon (Paris, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; When he took over at the Ministry of Interior, practically everything in France was in disarray. Ten years of Revolution and war had destroyed or disrupted many of the continuities of life in France and much of the nation's infrastructure.  His ministry, with Napoleon's encouragement, would be a major work of reconstruction and reorganization. The jurisdiction of the ministry was enormous. Chaptal found himself dealing with the accumulated problems of hospitals, midwives, prisons, poor houses, public buildings (the Louvre), city streets, highways and canals, a new ''École des mines'', a reorganization of the ''Institut de France'', displays of machines and tools at the ''Conservatoire des arts et métiers'', and even zoo problems at Versailles.  He improved everything he touched. From early on, he worked to design and implement not only a fundamentally new administrative structure of prefects, subprefects, mayors and municipal councils for France, but also a new primary and secondary educational system introducing the lycée. For the needs of the French economy, he saw to the creation of a Bureau of Statistics for his ministry to gather basic data from each of the departments on population and the condition of agriculture, commerce and industry. Count Montalivet, the Minister of Interior during 1809-1814, would tap into this data later for his ''Exposé de la situation de l'Empire'' (25 February 1813).&lt;ref&gt;H.T.Parker, "Statistics," in Historical Dictionary of Napoleonic France.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep his ministry informed and to encourage the introduction of new technology, Chaptal also sponsored the formation of Councils of Agriculture, Arts and Commerce in each of France's departments (1801); Chambers of Commerce were reestablished in 23 of the largest cities (1802) and Chambres Consultatives des Arts et Manufactures were organized in 150 of the smaller urban areas (1803).

The advancement of French industry was Chaptal's major interest. He believed that government should "protect and encourage industry, open new markets for its products and defend it against undue foreign competition."&lt;ref&gt;Chaptal, Mes Souvenirs sur Napoléon, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Government should take steps to acquire new technologies employed in foreign countries, provide prizes and honors for innovative business leaders and create trade and technical schools in Paris and the departments. Educational reform was a must with emphasis on science and technical training. France was behind England in economic development and needed to catch up. Chaptal was an admirer of Adam Smith's laissez-faire doctrines, but he also believed in state sponsorship of industrialization for France. He believed that his ministry should play an active role in forging a new industrial order in France capable of competing with England. For this purpose, scientists, entrepreneurs, artisans, workers, farmers and government officials would need to work closely together. Government would mediate private interests for the public good.&lt;ref&gt;See Horn, The Path Not Taken, Chap 6, pp.194ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Chaptal was most proud of the establishment in France in 1801 of the [[Société d'Encouragement pour l'industrie nationale]], patterned after the successful English society founded in London in 1754, the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Crosland, The Society of Arcueil, pp.26,36,179-80; Horn, The Path Not Taken, pp.202-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaptal was the key animator and president of the new French association. Among other principal organizers were: Claude Berthollet (chemist), François de Neufchâteau (Minister of Interior, 1797), Benjamin Delessert (banker), William Ternaux (woolens), Jacques Perier (steam engines), Scipion Perier (banker, coal mining), Louis Costaz (Conservatory of Arts &amp; Sciences), Claude-Anthelme Costaz (Chief of Bureau of Manufactures, Ministry of Interior), Claude Molard (Director, Conservatory of Arts &amp; Sciences), Alphonse Perregaux (banker), Gaspard Monge (founder, École Polytechnique) and Joseph Degérando (Institut de France).&lt;ref&gt;For the philosophy of economic administration that motivated these men, see Harold T. Parker,"Two Administrative Bureaus under the Directory and Napoleon," French Historical Studies, IV (Fall 1965).&lt;/ref&gt; The society was financed by member subscriptions. It offered prizes and published a ''Bulletin'' to encourage discoveries useful to industry and new products. Closely related to this initiative, Chaptal resumed François de Neufchâteau's plan for periodic expositions in Paris of the products of French industry. The first [[Exposition des produits de l'industrie française]] had been held on the Champs-de-Mars in 1798 (110 exhibits); under Chaptal's guidance, the number of exhibitors steadily increased for the next three expositions held at the Louvre in 1801, 1802 and 1806. Napoleon was in attendance with Chaptal for the distribution of awards at the 1801 exposition (229 exhibits). Chaptal's son would win a gold medal for the chemicals industry category at the exposition of 1819 (Louvre).

Emmanuel-Anatole Chaptal (1861-1943) wrote that his great-grandfather was "the voice of commerce, agriculture and industry" for Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Chaptal, Mes souvenirs sur Napoléon, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; There's much truth to this claim. Napoleon greatly valued Chaptal's counsel and eventual friendship, and was reluctant to accept his resignation as Minister of Interior on August 6, 1804. He was quick to award Chaptal the dignities of the Legion of Honor and an important place in the Senate. Chaptal wrote to Napoleon that he wanted to return to his scientific endeavors ("''mes premières occupations''"), and it's worth noting that some of his major works were written in the years immediately following the resignation. On the other hand, the memoirs talk openly about certain personal complications at the time involving a Mlle Bourgoin of the Comédie-Française, Napoleon and Chaptal.&lt;ref&gt;Chaptal, Mes souvenirs sur Napoléon, pp.56-59; Pigeire, Vie de Chaptal, pp285-87.&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Chaptal now had the leisure to attend to his estate at Chanteloup in the Loire valley where he raised merino sheep, experimented growing sugar beets, wrote his applied science reports, entertained notables and made himself available for consultations. He was close enough to Paris for frequent trips. He had chemical factories there at Ternes and Nanterre, and his son was about to establish a third chemicals plant at Martigues in southern France. Chaptal was doing well producing a variety of industrial acids, alum and soda. In 1804 he bought a new home in Paris, the Hôtel de Mailly, at No.70 rue de Grenelle-Saint-Germain. As time allowed, he began to frequent meetings of the small and private, but very influential, [[Society of Arcueil]], a select association of leading scientists who gathered informally on weekends at the homes of Berthollet and Laplace in Arcueil, a few miles from Paris. Berthollet, who attracted scientific talent from all over Europe, was Chaptal's close friend for forty years. The meetings at his home at Arcueil were a way for Chaptal to keep up-to-date with new discoveries in pure science in a variety of fields. We are reminded that Chaptal was a contemporary of Thomas Jefferson (1748-1826) of Monticello fame. 

[[File:Château de Chanteloup - 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Château de Chanteloup]]]] 

Chaptal was called to Paris when the French economy soured in 1810-1811. Napoleon's [[Continental System]] for ruining England by closing the continent to British goods had resulted in an economic crisis of the first order in France. There were business failures, unemployment and worker protests. Manufacturers were distressed especially by high tariffs on imports of essential raw materials. The constant warfare disrupted shipping and markets in Europe. A poor harvest in 1811 added the problem of food shortages. To help cope with the crisis, Napoleon brought in Chaptal as his key consultant for a special ''Conseil d'Administration du commerce et des manufactures'' (6 June 1810). Napoleon presided. The other members were the Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs, plus the Director General of Customs, Jean-Baptiste Collin de Sussy, Napoleon's "''douanier par excellence''." In addition, two sixty-member advisory councils of leading manufacturers and merchants were organized (7 June 1810) and attached to the Ministry of Interior, then under Count Montalivet: a ''Conseil général des Manufactures'' and a ''Conseil général de Commerce.'' It was a difficult time for Chaptal. He believed that the wars of the Revolution and Napoleon had stimulated innovation and the application of science to industry and agriculture, and encouraged the development of the nation's resources. On the other hand, peace and a treaty of commerce with England might have been a better way. It's unlikely that Chaptal could have supported wholeheartedly Napoleon's proposed economic war to the death ("''guerre à outrance''") against England. The advisory councils of manufacturers and merchants had no influence on Napoleon. He stood by his imperial plan. Collin de Sussy became the head of a new Ministry of Manufactures and Commerce (22 June 1812) dedicated to an intensification of the Continental System. Chaptal's vision of a new industrial order in France that would bring scientists, business leaders and government officials together in a "sublime alliance" had to give way in 1812-14 before Napoleon's mercantilism and dream of Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See Odette Viennet, Napoléon et l'industrie française: la crise de 1810-1811 (Paris, 1947); R.J. Barker, "The Conseil général des Manufactures under Napoleon (1810-1814)," French Historical Studies, 6 (Fall 1969); Bertrand de Jouvenal, Napoléon et l'économie dirigée. Le blocus continental (1943); Horn, The Path Not Taken, p.211. The term "sublime alliance" is from Joseph Degérando's address at the founding ceremony of the Société d'Encouragement, November 1, 1801.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaptal was called back during the [[Hundred Days]] (March–June, 1815) to serve as Napoleon's Minister of Agriculture, Commerce and Industry. But that was a brief affair, ended by the Emperor's defeat at Waterloo and final exile to St.Helena. As the Bourbon king Louis XVIII assumed the throne in France beginning the Restoration (1815-1830), Chaptal wisely retreated temporarily to his estate at Chanteloup. He resisted an invitation by the American consul in Paris to take up residence in the United States. Instead, he stayed above politics, and gradually, with the intelligence and good grace he had always exercised in high circles, emerged in the role of elder statesman, philanthropist, esteemed scientist and authority on French agriculture, commerce and industry. His chemicals industries he had turned over to the management of his only son, who was doing well at the time. He had leisure time to spend at Chanteloup for his writings, farming and herd of merino sheep. But Paris always beckoned. He resumed his favorite position as president of the Society for the Encouragement of National Industry and organizer of industrial expositions (1819,1823,1827). In 1817 he published a lengthy memoir on the high price of coal in France that provoked a serious government inquiry into the coal tariff of 1816 and its benefits for the Anzin Coal Company in the Department of Nord.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Antoine Chaptal, Observations sur les commerce des houilles ou charbons de terre Belge en France, sur la cherté de ce combustible et sur les moyens d'en faire diminuer le prix (Paris, 1817), 79 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, with the Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, and Paris bankers Benjamin Delessert, Casimir Perier and others, Chaptal helped to found the first French savings bank, the Caisse d'Épargne et de Prévoyance de Paris. In 1819 he was appointed to the Restoration's Chamber of Peers, where he became noted for his informed committee reports on tariffs, canal construction, government budgets and schools of medicine, for example. In the field of education, with Joseph Degérando, Benjamin Delessert and Scipion Perier, he organized a society to improve primary school instruction (1815). He also helped found two important business schools in Paris, the École Speciale de Commerce (1816) and the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (1828). As a member of the Chamber of Peers, he watched over the budget of the Conservatory of Arts and Sciences. As in 1800-1804, his touch seemed to be everywhere. He was a member of an amazing number of scientific societies both in France and worldwide. In 1819, Chaptal had this to say about his career: "If I might be permitted to speak for myself, I would say that I have lived in workshops (''ateliers'') and in the midst of artists for forty years; that I have created important businesses; that the general administration of commerce, agriculture and industry was conferred on me during my ministry; that the sessions of the ''Académie des Sciences'', and those of the ''Société d'Encouragement'' which I presided over since its founding, allowed me to see and judge every day the progress and state . . . of production in France and often worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Chaptal, De L'Industrie française (1819), as quoted by Pigeire, Vie de Chaptal, p.345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadly, the 1820s for Chaptal were clouded by the financial ruin of his son, Jean-Baptiste Chaptal.&lt;ref&gt;See Pigeire, Vie de Chaptal, pp.369-81.&lt;/ref&gt; To cover his son's enormous debts due to large-scale business speculations, Chaptal was forced to sell Chanteloup and his home in Paris. He was left with only a small pension. During his last years he resided in a small apartment in Paris at No.8 rue Grenelle. It was there that he lived long enough to witness the Revolution of 1830 that brought [[Louis Philippe I]](the Citizen King) to the throne. He was 76 years old when he died in 1832. His remarkable career had unfolded through five different regimes and he had contributed importantly to every one. His name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names of famous French scientists engraved on the Eiffel Tower in Paris]].

'''Karl Christian Friedrich Krause''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʁaʊzə|lang}}; 6 May 1781 – 27 September 1832) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], born at [[Eisenberg, Thuringia|Eisenberg]], in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]]. His philosophy, known as "[[Krausism]]", was very influential in [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration Spain]].

==Education and life==

Educated at first at Eisenberg, he proceeded to the nearby [[University of Jena]], where he studied philosophy under professors [[Friedrich W. Schelling]], [[G. W. F. Hegel]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' in 1802. In the same year, with characteristic imprudence, he married Sophie Amalie Concordia Fuchs (born 1780), without [[dowry]]. Two years later, lack of pupils compelled him to move to [[Rudolstadt]] and later to [[Dresden]], where he gave lessons in music.

In 1805 his ideal of a universal world-society led him to join the [[Freemasons]], whose principles seemed to tend in the direction he desired. In Dresden he published two books on Freemasonry, ''Höhere Vergeistigung der echt überlieferten Grundsymbole der Freimaurerei: in zwölf Logenvorträgen'' (1811) and ''Die drei ältesten Kunsterkunden der Freimaurerbrüderschaft'' (1819), but his opinions attracted opposition from the Masons.

He lived for a time in [[Berlin]] and became a ''privatdozent'', but was unable to obtain a professorship. He therefore proceeded to [[TU Dresden|Dresden]] (where he taught [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]) and afterwards to [[Munich]], where he died of [[apoplexy]] at the very moment when the influence of [[Franz Xaver von Baader|Franz von Baader]] had at last obtained a position for him.

==Philosophical work==

One of the so-called {{Interlanguage link multi|Identitätsphilosophie|de|3=Philosophy of identity|lt=philosophers of identity}}, Krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a [[God]] known by [[faith]] or conscience and the world as known to sense. God, intuitively known by conscience, is not a personality (which implies limitations), but an all-inclusive essence (''Wesen''), which contains the [[universe]] within itself. This system he called [[panentheism]], a combination of [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]]. His theory of the world and of humanity is universal and idealistic.

In many ways following the general outline of Schelling's ''Philosophy of Nature'', he argued that the world itself and mankind, its highest component, constitute an organism (''Gliedbau''), and the universe is therefore a divine organism (''Wesengliedbau''). The process of development is the formation of higher unities, and the last stage is the identification of the world with God. The form which this development takes, according to Krause, is Right or the Perfect Law.

Right is not the sum of the conditions of external liberty but of absolute liberty, and embraces all the existence of nature, reason and humanity. It is the mode, or rationale, of all progress from the lower to the highest unity or identification. By its operation the reality of nature and reason rises into the reality of humanity. God is the reality which transcends and includes both nature and humanity. Right is, therefore, at once the dynamic and the safeguard of progress.

Ideal society results from the widening of the organic operation of this principle from the individual man to small groups of men, and finally to mankind as a whole. The differences disappear as the inherent identity of structure predominates in an ever-increasing degree, and in the final unity Man is merged in God.

==Influence and works==

The comparatively small area of Krause's influence was due partly to him being overshadowed by Schelling and Hegel, and partly to two intrinsic defects. The spirit of his thought is [[Mysticism|mystical]] and by no means easy to follow, and this difficulty is accentuated, even to German readers, by the use of artificial terminology. He makes use of Germanized foreign terms which are unintelligible to the ordinary man.

His principal works are (beside those quoted above): ''Entwurf des Systems der Philosophie'' (1804); ''System der Sittenlehre'' (1810); ''Das Urbild der Menschheit'' (1811); and ''Vorlesungen über das System der Philosophie'' (1828). He left behind him at his death a mass of unpublished notes, part of which has been collected and published by his disciples Karl David August Röder&lt;ref&gt;Karl David August Röder (June 23, 1806 - December 20, 1879)&lt;/ref&gt; (1806-1879), Heinrich Ahrens&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Ahrens (July 14, 1808 - August 2, 1874)&lt;/ref&gt; (1808–1874), Friedrich Wilhelm Theodor Schliephake&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Theodor Schliephake (April 28, 1808 - September 8, 1871)&lt;/ref&gt; (1808-1871), Hermann Karl von Leonhardi&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Karl von Leonhardi (March 12, 1809 - August 21, 1875). His original full name was Peter Karl Pius Gustav Hermann von Leonhardi. On October 19, 1841 he married  Marie Sidonie Krause (aka Maria Sidonia Krause) (August 14, 1810 - 1875), who was a daughter of K. C. F. Krause (1781-1832).&lt;/ref&gt; (1809-1875) (Krause's son-in-law), Guillaume Tiberghien&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Tiberghien (August 9, 1819 - November 28, 1901)&lt;/ref&gt; (1819-1901), and others.

[[Krausism]] became particularly influential in Spain in the 19th century, where Krause's ideas were introduced by Julián Sanz del Río&lt;ref&gt;Julián Sanz del Río (March 10, 1814 - October 12, 1869)&lt;/ref&gt; (1814-1869), an academic based in Madrid. Spanish Krausists combined an emphasis on scientific rationalism and a liberal commitment to individual freedom and opposition to privilege and arbitrary power with Christian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heywood |first1=Paul |author-link1=Paul Heywood|year=2003|title=Marxism and the Failure of Organised Socialism in Spain, 1879-1936|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsfQfYk8iVgC&amp;q=krause#v=snippet&amp;q=krausism&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=21–23|isbn=9780521530569|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish intellectuals influenced by Krause included [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]] (1839-1915) and [[Gumersindo de Azcárate]] (1840-1917). In addition Krause's influence extended to Latin America, where his work made an impact on [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] (1852-1933), [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]] (1856-1929) and [[Juan José Arévalo]] (1904-1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delaney |first=Jeane Hunter |date=February 2001 |title=Karl Christian Friedrich Krause and His Inﬂuence in the Hispanic World (review) |url=http://hahr.dukejournals.org.abc.cardiff.ac.uk/content/81/1/176.short |journal=Hispanic American Historical Review |publisher=[[Duke University Press]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=176–178 |doi=10.1215/00182168-81-1-176 |accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Gott]] has argued that Krause influenced [[José Martí]] (1853-1895), [[Fidel Castro]] (1926-2016) (through Martí and other Cuban thinkers), and [[Che Guevara]] (1928-1967) (through the influence of Yrigoyen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gott |first1=Richard |author-link1=Richard Gott|year=2002|title=Karl Krause and the Ideological Origins of the Cuban Revolution|url=http://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/249/1/Gott.1.pdf|series=University of London Institute of Latin American Studies Occasional Papers|location=London |publisher=[[Institute of Latin American Studies]]|issn=0953-6825|accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard Swidler was born in [[Sioux City]], [[Iowa]] to Josephine Marie Reed Swidler (1901–62) and Samuel Swidler (1897–1984). His father was a  [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Jew who had come to the U.S. at age 15, and his mother was an [[Irish-American]] [[Catholic]]. Eventually the family moved to Cumberland, [[Wisconsin]], and then to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], where his parents owned and operated the Bay Beauty Shop until after [[World War II]], when they bought a home in Allouez and set up a beauty parlor there.  Samuel worked in a paper mill in De Pere and Josephine continued to run the hair salon. In 1935 Leonard's brother Jack was born, followed in 1940 by his sister Sandra.

In 1957, while they were graduate students at the University of Wisconsin,  Leonard Swidler and Arlene Anderson were married. They have two daughters, Carmel (born 1958) and Eva (born 1962, and one granddaughter, Willow (born 2000). Leonard and Arlene Swidler lived in [[Philadelphia]] since 1966.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13361">A '''[[Treasure hunting|treasure hunter]]''' is a person who, as either a [[vocation]] or [[avocation]], searches for sunken, buried, lost, or hidden [[treasure]] and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].

==Historical==
*[[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]] (1778–1823, [[Italy|Italian]]). sometimes known as The Great Belzoni, was a prolific Italian explorer and pioneer archaeologist of Egyptian antiquities. He removed with great skill the colossal bust of Ramesses II, commonly called "the Young Memnon" later shipped to England. He expanded his investigations to the great temple of [[Edfu]], visited  [[Elephantine]] and [[Philae]], cleared the great temple at [[Abu Simbel]] of sand (1817), made excavations at [[Karnak]], and opened up the sepulchre of [[Seti I]] (still sometimes known as "[[KV17|Belzoni's Tomb]]"). He was the first to penetrate into the second pyramid of [[Giza]], and the first European in modern times to visit the oasis of Bahariya. He also identified the ruins of [[Berenice (port)|Berenice]] on the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
*[[Heinrich Schliemann]] (1822-1890, [[Germany|German]]). He argued for the historical reality of places mentioned in the works of [[Homer]] and was an important [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavator]] of [[Troy]] and of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] sites [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]]. He is considered by many to have been the "father of historical archaeology."
* [[Mel Fisher]] (1922-1998, American). Best known for finding the wreck of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[galleon]] ''[[Nuestra Señora de Atocha]]'' in 1985. The estimated $450 million [[treasure trove|cache]] recovered, known as the "''Atocha'' Motherlode," included 40 tons of gold and silver and some 100,000 Spanish silver coins ([[Spanish dollar|pieces of eight]]), gold coins, Colombian [[emerald]]s, golden and silver artifacts, and 1000 silver [[Ingot|bars]].
*[[Robert F. Marx]] (b. 1923, American). A pioneering [[Scuba diving|scuba diver]] best known for his work with shipwrecks and sunken treasure. Considered controversial for his frequent and successful forays into treasure hunting. E. Lee Spence described him as "the true father of underwater archaeology."&lt;ref&gt;Spence, E. Lee. ''Spence's Guide to South Carolina''. Nelson Southern Printing: [[Sullivan's Island, South Carolina]], 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[John Chatterton]]. The 1991 discovery and subsequent identification of the German submarine U-869, off the coast of New Jersey, has been the subject of several television documentaries including ''Hitler's Lost Sub'', a two-hour special for the popular NOVA series on PBS. The same story was the subject of a book by Robert Kurson, called ''Shadow Divers''. The movie rights have been purchased by 20th Century Fox. Chatterton has made over 160 dives to the wreck of the SS ''Andrea Doria'' and worked two seasons on the fabled treasure galleon ''Nuestra Señora de la Pura y Limpia Concepcion''. &lt;ref&gt; Kurson, Robert (2015). ''Pirate Hunters''. Random House. {{ISBN|9781400063369}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Chatterton and his partner discovered and identified the wreck of the ''Golden Fleece'' off of the North coast of the Dominican Republic. The ship was that of Joseph Bannister, a pirate captain of the late 18th century. The discovery of the ''Golden Fleece'' was chronicled by writer Robert Kurson in his 2015 book ''Pirate Hunters''.
*[[John Mattera]] (born 1962) is a writer and American shipwreck explorer and the subject of the book ''Pirate Hunters'' by Robert Kurson. ''Pirate Hunters'' is the story of two US divers, John Chatterton and John Mattera, finding the lost pirate ship ''Golden Fleece'' of Captain Joseph Bannister in the waters off the Dominican Republic in 2008. Mattera first became a certified diver in 1976, exploring the North Atlantic, he was an early pioneer of the shipwrecks in the waters around New York and New Jersey, performing penetration and decompression dives long before technical diving had a name. From the late 1970s on exploring some of the most famous shipwrecks of the northeast, with over sixty dives on the SS ''Andrea Doria'' and working two seasons on the fabled treasure galleon ''Nuestra Señora de la Pura y Limpia Concepcion'', Guadalupe, Tolosa, San Josef. &lt;ref&gt; Kurson, Robert (2015).

'''Matti Kurki''', in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''Matts Kurck'', was a legendary [[Finland|Finnish]] [[tribal chief|chieftain]]. If he was a real person, he is thought to have lived in the late 13th century.

[[Finnish folklore|Folklore]] tales tell about Matti Kurki, particularly in the [[Satakunta (historical province)|Satakunta]] province ([[Vesilahti]], [[Pirkkala]]) but also in [[Sápmi (area)|Lapland]]. The first written reference to Matti Kurki dates from the 17th century.

The best known tale concerns his duel with ''Pohto'', a [[Russians|Russian]]-[[Karelians|Karelian]] warrior. The battle would have taken place near the [[Manor of Laukko]].

Matti Kurki was supposedly the ancestor of the [[Finnish noble]] family of [[Kurki of Laukko|Kurki]]. The lands of the Laukko manor were, according to legends, either compensation for ceding his right to tax the [[Sami people|Sami]], or for his valor and deeds in the wars against the [[Denmark|Danish]] enemies of the King of Sweden.

==Legacy==
The name has been used as a traditional name in the [[Finnish Navy]], two ships have so far carried the name in the 20th century:
*The gunboat [[Finnish gunboat Matti Kurki|''Matti Kurki'']] (1918–1940)
*The ''Bay''-class frigate [[HMS Porlock Bay (K 650)|''Matti Kurki'']] (1962–1975)

[[File:Club Privé Birger Jarlsgatan.JPG|thumb|"Club Privé" in Stockholm was once owned by Marković]]

After his sporting career ended, in the mid-1990s Marković ran a Stockholm sex club called "Club Privé", before ownership was transferred to former policeman [http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/201001/13/20100113160353_Realtid619/20100113160353_Realtid619.dbp.asp Ljubomir Pilipović], and eventually to ex-ice hockey player Michael Badelt. Marković was convicted of criminal charges on several occasions.&lt;ref name=metro/&gt; In June 1995, he was convicted and sentenced to a one-year jail term for using or attempting to use extortion and inflicting serious damage.&lt;ref name=zaranis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.zaramis.se/2013/05/10/mille-markovic-och-michael-badelt|publisher=Zaranis.se|first=Anders|last=Svensson|title=Mille Marković och Michael Badelt|trans-title=Mille Marković and Michael Badelt|date=10 May 2013|access-date=25 September 2015|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marković had fitted a room in his club with hidden cameras and planned to lure celebrities there, film the victims having sex and consuming drugs, and use the footage for [[blackmail]].&lt;ref name=aftonbladet2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article16949209.ab|first1=Martin|last1=Ekelund|first2=Anders|last2=Johansson|title=Mille Marković gripen för anstiftan till mordförsök - Misstänks ligga bakom skottlossning mot porrklubb|trans-title=Mille Marković arrested for incitement to murder attempt - suspected of gunshots on sex club|newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=25 January 2014|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohamed Sherif Pasha''' [[Order of the Star of India|GCSI]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalark.net/Egypt/egypt13.htm Royal Ark]&lt;/ref&gt; (1826–1887) ({{lang-ar|محمد شريف باشا}}) was an [[Egypt]]ian statesman of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldschmidt|first=Arthur|year=2000|title=Biographical dictionary of modern Egypt|place=|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|page=191|isbn=1-55587-229-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Prime Minister of Egypt]] three times during his career. His first term was between April 7, 1879 and August 18, 1879. His second term was served from September 14, 1881 to February 4, 1882. His final term was served between August 21, 1882 and January 7, 1884.

Sherif, who was from [[Kavala]] in northern Greece,  filled numerous administrative posts under [[Sa'id of Egypt|Sa'id Pasha]] and [[Isma'il Pasha]]. He was better educated than most of his contemporaries, and had married a daughter of Colonel Sèves, the French non-commissioned officer who became [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Suleiman Pasha]] under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mehmet Ali]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Sherif Pasha |volume=24 |page=850 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As minister of foreign affairs he was useful to Ismail, who used Sherif's bluff bonhomie to veil many of his most insidious proposals. Of singularly lazy disposition, he yet possessed considerable tact; he was in fact an Egyptian [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], whose policy was to leave everything alone.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Sherif's favorite argument against any reform was to appeal to the [[Pyramids]] as an immutable proof of the solidity of Egypt financially and politically. His fatal optimism rendered him largely responsible for the collapse of Egyptian credit which brought about the fall of Ismail.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Upon the military insurrection of September 1881 under [[Ahmed Orabi|Urabi Pasha]], Sherif was summoned by the khedive [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfiq]] to form a new ministry. The impossibility of reconciling the financial requirements of the national party with the demands of the British and French controllers of the public debt, compelled him to resign in the following February.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

After the suppression of the [[Urabi Revolt]] he was again installed in office (August 1882) by Tawfiq, but in January 1884 he resigned rather than sanction the evacuation of the [[Sudan]]. As to the strength of the [[Mahdi]]st movement he had then no conception. When urged by Sir [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]] (Lord Cromer) early in 1883 to abandon some of the more distant parts of the Sudan, he replied with characteristic light-heartedness: "''Nous en causerons plus tard ; d'abord nous allons donner une bonne raclée à ce monsieur''" (We'll talk about that later, first we're going to give this gentleman (i.e. the [[Mahdi]]) a good thrashing). [[William Hicks (British soldier)|Hicks Pasha]]'s expedition was at the time preparing to march on [[Al-Ubayyid|El Obeid]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Sherif died in [[Graz]], [[Austria-Hungary]], on April 20, 1887.

'''Oliver Prescott''' (27 April 1731, in [[Groton, Massachusetts]] - 17 November 1804, in Groton) was a colonial-era physician, soldier and judge.

==Biography==
He graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1750, after which he was apprenticed to Ebenezer Robie of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]],&lt;ref name=anb&gt;{{Cite ANB|title=Prescott, Oliver|author=Eric Howard Christianson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then practiced medicine in Groton. He returned to Harvard to get an M.A. in 1753.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;  He and Lydia Baldwin were wed in 1756. Three of their seven children died in an epidemic of 1765/6.

From 1779 until his death, he was judge of probate for Middlesex County. In 1780 he became one of the original&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; fellows of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and he was a trustee, patron, and benefactor of [[Groton Academy]].

==Son==
His son, also named Oliver (4 April 1762, Groton - 26 September 1827, [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]), was also a physician. He graduated at Harvard in 1783, studied medicine with his father, and was surgeon of the forces that suppressed the Shays insurrection in 1787. Leaving a large practice in Groton, he removed to Newburyport in 1811, practising successfully there till his death. He was often a representative in the legislature, and was a founder, trustee, and treasurer of Groton Academy.

He contributed articles to the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]] and Surgery'', but is best known for a discourse before the [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] in 1813, entitled a "Dissertation on the Natural History and Medicinal Effects of Secale Cornutum, or [[Ergot]]," which was republished in [[London]], and translated into French and German.

The term "'''Palestine refugees'''" originally referred to both Arabs and Jews whose normal place of residence had been in [[Mandatory Palestine]] but were displaced and lost their livelihoods as a result of the [[1948 Palestine war]].&lt;ref name="UNCCPdefinition"&gt;{{cite book |title=International law and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author=Susan Akram |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeJ50a76z5cC&amp;pg=PA19 |pages=19, 20, 38 |isbn=9780415573221 |quote="The term 'refugees' applies to all persons, Arabs, Jews and others who have been displaced from their homes in Palestine.

It would not include Arabs who lost their lands but not their houses, such as the inhabitants of Tulkarm"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[UNRWA]] definition of the term includes the [[patrilineal]] descendants of the original "Palestine refugees", but is limited to persons residing in UNRWA's areas of operation in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.&lt;ref name="UNCCPdefinition"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNRWAdef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Consolidated Eligibility and Registration Instructions|url=http://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/2010011995652.pdf|publisher=UNRWA|quote=Persons who meet UNRWA's Palestine Refugee criteria These are persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict.

On 11 December 1948, the UN General Assembly in non-binding [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194#Article 11—Refugees|Resolution 194,  Article 11]] resolved that the refugees who wish to "live at peace with their neighbors ... should be permitted" to return to their homes at the "earliest practicable date"&lt;ref name="Resolution 194 III"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/C758572B78D1CD0085256BCF0077E51A|title=A/RES/194 (III) of 11 December 1948|author=|date=|website=unispal.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dumper, 'Introduction' to M.Dumper (ed.)

An independent poll conducted in 2003 with the Palestinian populations of Gaza, West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon showed that the majority (54%) would accept a financial compensation and a place to live in West Bank or Gaza in place of returning to the exact place in modern-day Israel where they or their ancestors lived (this possibility of settlement is contemplated in the Resolution 194). Only 10% said they would live in Israel if given the option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.time.com/2012/11/06/the-palestinian-right-of-return-abbas-wades-into-the-morass/ The Palestinian 'Right of Return': Abbas Wades into the Morass], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 6 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA) is an organ of the [[United Nations]] created exclusively for the purpose of aiding those displaced by the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], with an annual budget of approximately $600 million.&lt;ref name="unrwa4.4billion"&gt;"Today, UNRWA's annual budget stands at approximately $600 million, of which $250 million is contributed by the United States. Overall, America has contributed $4.4 billion to the UN agency since its establishment in 1949."[http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-senate-dramatically-redefines-definition-of-palestinian-refugees/ US Senate dramatically scales down definition of Palestinian 'refugees']&lt;/ref&gt; It defines a "Palestine refugee" as a person "whose normal place of residence was [[Mandatory Palestine]] between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict".&lt;ref name="unwra12" /&gt; UNRWA aids all "those living in its area of operations who meet this definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance"&lt;ref name="unwra12" /&gt; and those who first became refugees as a result of the [[Six-Day War]], regardless whether they reside in areas designated as [[Palestine refugee camps]] or in other permanent communities.

===Palestinian definitions===
Palestinians make several distinctions relating to Palestinian refugees. The 1948 refugees and their descendants are broadly defined as "refugees" (''laji'un''). The [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO), especially those who have returned and form part of the [[Palestinian National Authority|PNA]], but also Palestinian refugee camp residents in Lebanon, repudiate this term, since it implies being a passive victim, and prefer the [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] of 'returnees' (''a'idun'').&lt;ref&gt;Helena Lindholm Schulz, with Juliane Hammer, ''The Palestinian Diaspora: Formation of Identities and Politics of Homeland'', Psychology Press reprint 2003 p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who left since 1967, and their descendants, are called ''nazihun'' or 'displaced persons', though many may also descend from the 1948 group.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Chiller-Glaus, ''Tackling the Intractable: Palestinian Refugees and the Search for Middle East Peace'', Peter Lang, 2007 p. 82, as opposed to ''muwatinun'' (citizens).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the Palestine refugees==
{{Nakba}}
[[File:Palestinian refugees.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[1948 Palestinian exodus]] – Palestine refugees making their way from Galilee in October–November 1948]]
Most Palestinian refugees have retained their refugee status and continue to reside in refugee camps, including within the [[State of Palestine]] in the West Bank and in the [[Gaza Strip]]. Their descendants form a sizable portion of the [[Palestinian diaspora]].

===Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Palestine War===
{{Main article|1948 Palestinian exodus|Causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus|Palestinian Exodus 1949 to 1956}}
During the [[1948 Palestine War]], 711,000 out of around 900,000 Palestine Arabs fled or were expelled from the territories that became the State of Israel.&lt;ref name="d" /&gt; The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim|Shlaim, Avi]], [http://ccas.georgetown.edu/research-articles.cfm?id=96 "The War of the Israeli Historians."] ''[[Center for Arab Studies]]'', 1 December 2003 (retrieved 17 February 2009) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903084029/http://ccas.georgetown.edu/research-articles.cfm?id=96 |date=3 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas historians now agree on most of the events of that period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a plan designed before or during the war by Zionist leaders or was an unintended consequence of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], 1989, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949'', Cambridge University Press; [[Benny Morris]], 1991, ''1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians'', Clarendon Press, Oxford; [[Walid Khalidi]], 1992, ''All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948'', Institute for Palestine Studies; [[Nur Masalha]], 1992, ''Expulsion of the Palestinians: The Concept of "Transfer" in Zionist Political Thought'', Institute for Palestine Studies; [[Efraim Karsh]], 1997, ''Fabricating Israeli History: The "New Historians"'', Cass; [[Benny Morris]], 2004, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Cambridge University Press; [[Yoav Gelber]], 2006, ''Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Palestinian Refugee Problem'', Oxford University Press; [[Ilan Pappé]], 2006, ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', OneWorld&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of bias in Palestinian and Zionist sources dealing with the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]], Steven Glazer lists a number of early [[Zionist]] historians and writers, notably [[Joseph Schechtman]], [[Leo Kohn]], [[Jon Kimche]] and [[Maria Syrkin]], who considered that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...the Arabs in Palestine were asked to stay and live as citizens in the Jewish state. Instead, they chose to leave, either because they were unwilling to live with the Jews, or because they expected an Arab military victory which would annihilate the Zionists. They thought they could leave temporarily and return at their leisure. Later, an additional claim was put forth, namely that the Palestinians were ordered to leave, with radio broadcasts instructing them to quit their homes".&lt;ref name = "Glazer-1980-p97"&gt;Steven Glazer, 1980, 'The Palestinian Exodus in 1948', ''J. Palestine Studies'' 9(4), p. 96–118.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implication of this position is that the Palestinians chose to leave, and thus forfeited their rights to their land, and must accept their own responsibilities for the plight they find themselves in.&lt;ref name="Glazer-1980-p97" /&gt; According to [[Benny Morris]], between December 1947 and March 1948, around 100,000 Palestine Arabs fled. Among them were many from the higher and middle classes from the cities, who left voluntarily, expecting to return when the Arab states won the war and took control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp.138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Haganah]] and then the emerging [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] (Israel Defense Forces or IDF) went on the defensive, between April and July, a further 250,000 to 300,000 Palestinian Arabs left or were expelled, mainly from the towns of [[Operation Bi'ur Hametz|Haifa]], [[Tiberias]], [[Beit-Shean]], [[Safed]], [[Jaffa]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which lost more than 90 percent of their Arab inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], p.262&lt;/ref&gt; Expulsions took place in many towns and villages, particularly along the [[Tel Aviv]]–[[Jerusalem]] road&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp.233–240.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Eastern [[Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp.248–252.&lt;/ref&gt;  About 50,000–70,000 inhabitants of [[1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle|Lydda and Ramle]] were expelled towards [[Ramallah]] by the IDF during [[Operation Danny]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp.423–436.&lt;/ref&gt; and most others during operations of the IDF in its rear areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], p.438.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Dekel]], the Arabs of [[Nazareth]] and South Galilee were allowed to remain in their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], pp.415–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Today they form the core of the [[Arab Israeli]] population. From October to November 1948, the IDF launched [[Operation Yoav]] to remove [[Egyptian forces]] from the [[Negev]] and [[Operation Hiram]] to remove the [[Arab Liberation Army]] from North Galilee during which at least nine [[List of events named massacres|events named massacres]] of Arabs were carried out by IDF soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''Righteous Victims'', p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; These events generated an exodus of 200,000 to 220,000 Palestinian Arabs. Here, Arabs fled fearing atrocities or were expelled if they had not fled.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], p.492.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, from 1948 to 1950, the IDF resettled around 30,000 to 40,000 Arabs from the borderlands of the new Israeli state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#morris birth revisited|Benny Morris (2003)]], p.538&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)===
{{main article|Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)}}
The [[Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)|Palestinian exodus from Kuwait]] took place during and after the [[Gulf War]]. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians voluntarily fled Kuwait during the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi occupation of Kuwait]] due to harassment and intimidation by [[Iraq]]i security forces,&lt;ref name="ir"/&gt; in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=ir&gt;{{cite web|author=Shafeeq Ghabra|title=The PLO in Kuwait|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/1457|date=8 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Gulf War, [[Kuwait]]i authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991.&lt;ref name="ir"/&gt; Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]] and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) with the dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], who had earlier invaded Kuwait.

Prior to the Gulf War, Palestinians numbered 400,0000 (30%) of [[Demographics of Kuwait|Kuwait's population]] of 2.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/persian-gulf-states/19.htm |title=Kuwait - Population |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were [[Jordanian people|Jordanian citizens]].&lt;ref name=jor&gt;{{cite web|author=Yann Le Troquer and Rozenn Hommery al-Oudat|title=From Kuwait to Jordan: The Palestinians' Third Exodus|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2538306?uid=3738400&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102826710897|work=Journal of Palestine Studies|date=Spring 1999|pages=37–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, there were 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=mon&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordanians of Kuwait|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=KU|work=[[Joshua Project]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians (without Jordanian [[citizenship]]) lived in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=monitor&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/04/palestinians-open-kuwait-embassy.html|work=Al Monitor|title=Palestinians Open Kuwaiti Embassy|date=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, there are 360,000 Palestinians in Kuwait as of 2012–2013.

===Palestinian refugees as part of the Syrian refugee crisis===
{{main article|Refugees of the Syrian Civil War}}
As a result of the [[Syrian Civil War]] starting in 2011, 235,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Syria itself and 60,000, alongside 2.2 million Syrians, have fled the country as of October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unrwa.org/activity/rss-syria |title=RSS in Syria |publisher=[[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]] |year=2013 |accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports that [[Jordan]] and [[Lebanon]] have turned away Palestinian refugees attempting to flee the humanitarian crises in Syria.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Jordan has absorbed 126,000 Syrian refugees, but Palestinians fleeing Syria are placed in a separate refugee camp, under stricter conditions and are banned from entering Jordanian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jordan-turns-away-palestinian-refugees-fleeing-violence-in-syria/|title=Jordan turns away Palestinian refugees fleeing violence in Syria|work=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian refugees from Syria are also immigrating to [[Europe]] seeking asylum, especially to [[Sweden]], which has offered asylum to any Syrian refugees that manage to reach its territory, albeit with some conditions. Many do so by finding their way to [[Egypt]] and making the journey by sea. In October 2013, the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command|PFLP-GC]] claimed that some 23,000 Palestinian refugees from the [[Yarmouk Camp]] had immigrated to Sweden alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=638344 PFLP-GC: Thousands from Yarmouk camp have fled to Sweden] - Maan News Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], [[Jewish refugees]] were initially resettled in [[refugee camps]] known variously as [[Immigrant camps (Israel)|Immigrant camps]], ''[[Ma'abarot]]'', and "[[development town]]s" prior to absorption into mainstream [[Israeli society]]. Conversely, many Palestinian refugees remain settled in [[Palestinian refugee camps]], while others have been [[Palestinians in Jordan|absorbed into Jordanian society]] or [[Demographics of Palestine|the Palestinian territories]]. Since 1948, the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[State of Israel]] has guaranteed asylum and citizenship to Jewish refugees, while the self-declared [[State of Palestine]] remains unable to absorb the Palestinian refugees, due to lack of ''[[de facto]]'' sovereignty over [[Palestinian territories|its claimed territories]].

===Gaza Strip===
As of January 2015, the [[Gaza Strip]] has 8 UNRWA refugee camps with 560,964 Palestinian refugees, and 1,276,929 registered refugees in total,&lt;ref name="UNRWA2015"/&gt; out of a population of 1,816,379.

===West Bank===
As of January 2015, the [[West Bank]] has 19 UNRWA refugee camps with 228,560 Palestinian refugees, and 774,167 registered refugees in total,&lt;ref name="UNRWA2015"/&gt; out of a population of 2,345,107.

===Jordan===
"More than 2 million registered Palestine refugees live in Jordan. Most Palestine refugees in Jordan, but not all, have full citizenship",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan |title=Where We Work |publisher=UNRWA |date= |accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordan's annexation and occupation of the West Bank]]. The percentage of Palestinian refugees living in refugee camps to those who settled outside the camps is the lowest of all UNRWA fields of operations. Palestine refugees are allowed access to public services and healthcare, as a result, refugee camps are becoming more like poor city suburbs than refugee camps. Most Palestine refugees moved out of the camps to other parts of the country and the number of people registered in refugee camps as of January 2015 is 385,418, who live in ten refugee camps.&lt;ref name="UNRWA2015"/&gt; This caused UNRWA to reduce the budget allocated to Palestine refugee camps in Jordan. Former UNRWA chief-attorney James G. Lindsay says: "In Jordan, where 2 million Palestinian refugees live, all but 167,000 have citizenship, and are fully eligible for government services including education and health care." Lindsay suggests that eliminating services to refugees whose needs are subsidized by [[Jordan]] "would reduce the refugee list by 40%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/EditionFrancaise/Home.aspxservlet/Satellite?cid=1233304645372&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120708164719/http://www.jpost.com/EditionFrancaise/Home.aspxservlet/Satellite?cid=1233304645372&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter|deadurl=yes|title=Israel News - Online Israeli News Covering Israel &amp; The Jewish World …|author=|date=8 July 2012|archivedate=8 July 2012|website=jpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mepeace.org/forum/topics/fixing-unrwa-by-james-g|title=Fixing UNRWA -- by James G.

Palestinians who moved from the [[West Bank]] (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the "official 10 refugee camps" in Jordan. From 1988 to 2012, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked. Jordan's Interior Minister Nayef al-Kadi said: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Our goal is to prevent Israel from emptying the Palestinian territories of their original inhabitants," the minister explained, confirming that the kingdom had begun revoking the citizenship of Palestinians.

"We should be thanked for taking this measure," he said. "We are fulfilling our national duty because Israel wants to expel the Palestinians from their homeland."&lt;ref name=Jordan&gt;{{cite news|first=KHALED |last=Abu toameh |title=Amman revoking Palestinians' citizenship |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443863400&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194852/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1246443863400&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-israel-bias" &gt;[http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=183252 Demonizing Israel is bad for the Palestinians], by Mudar Zarhan, 01/08/2010, Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that about 2,700 Palestinians were stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/01/jordan-stop-withdrawing-nationality-palestinian-origin-citizens Jordan: Stop Withdrawing Nationality from Palestinian-Origin Citizens] - [[Human Rights Watch]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that over 40,000 Palestinians were affected by this policy.&lt;ref name=Jordan2&gt;{{cite news|author=KHALED ABU TOAMEH and YAAKOV KATZ |title=Israel: We 'won't make Jordan Palestine' |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418582807&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |date=12 August 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929033231/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1249418582807&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |archivedate=29 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Jordanian government promised to stop revoking the citizenship of Palestinians, and restored citizenship to 4,500 Palestinians who had previously lost it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/jordan-promises-to-stop-revoking-nationality-from-palestinians/ Jordan promises to stop revoking citizenship from Palestinians] - ''[[Times of Israel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon===
100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon because of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and were not allowed to return.&lt;ref name="amn"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE18/010/2007 |title=Lebanon Exiled and suffering: Palestinian refugees in Lebanon |year=2007 |work=Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=8 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211203636/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE18/010/2007 |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2015, there were 452,669 registered refugees in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="UNRWA2015"/&gt;

In a 2007 study, [[Amnesty International]] denounced the "appalling social and economic condition" of Palestinians in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="amn"/&gt; Until 2005, Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they do not have Lebanese citizenship, but this was later reduced to around 20 as of 2007 after liberalization laws.&lt;ref name="amn"/&gt; In 2010, Palestinians were granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/world/middleeast/18lebanon.html|title=Lebanon Gives Palestinians New Work Rights|date=18 August 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanon gave citizenship to about 50,000 Christian Palestinian refugees during the 1950s and 1960s. In the mid-1990s, about 60,000 Shiite Muslim refugees were granted citizenship. This caused a protest from Maronite authorities, leading to citizenship being given to all Christian refugees who were not already citizens.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;Simon Haddad, The Origins of Popular Opposition to Palestinian Resettlement in Lebanon, ''International Migration Review'', Volume 38 Number 2 (Summer 2004):470-492. Also Peteet [http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/MEPP/PRRN/papers/peteet.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, many Palestinian refugees in Lebanon began immigrating to Europe, both legally and illegally, as part of the [[European migrant crisis]], due to a deterioration in living conditions there as part of the [[Syrian civil war]]. In December 2015, sources told ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' that thousands of Palestinians were fleeing to Europe by way of [[Turkey]], with about 4,000 having fled the [[Ain al-Hilweh]] camp alone in recent months. Many were reaching [[Germany]], with others going to [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Belgium]], and [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/12/lebanon-palestinians-leaving-europe-151203103618789.html|title=Why are Lebanon's Palestinians leaving for Europe?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A census completed in January 2018 found that only around 175,000 Palestinian refugees were living in Lebanon,  as opposed to previous UNRWA figures which put the number at between 400,000 and 500,000, as well as other estimates that placed the number between 260,000 and 280,000.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessnews.com.lb/cms/Story/StoryDetails.aspx?ItemID=6343|title=Palestinian refugees number 175,000|first=Business|last=News|date=|website=businessnews.com.lb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/lebanon-census-finds-number-of-palestinian-refugees-only-a-third-of-official-un-data-1.5629560|title=Lebanon Census Finds Number of Palestinian Refugees Only a Third of Official UN Data|author=|date=25 December 2017|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer and researcher Mudar Zahran, a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, the media chose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in Lebanese refugee camps, and that the "tendency to blame Israel for everything" has provided Arab leaders an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries.&lt;ref name="anti-israel-bias" /&gt;

===Syria===
[[Syria]] had 528,616 registered Palestinian refugees in January 2015. There were 9 UNRWA refugee camps with 178,666 official Palestinian refugees.&lt;ref name="UNRWA2015"/&gt;

As a result of the [[Syrian civil war]], large numbers of Palestinian refugees fled Syria to Europe as part of the [[European migrant crisis]], and to other Arab countries. In September 2015, a Palestinian official said that only 200,000 Palestinian refugees were left in Syria, with 100,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria in Europe and the remainder in other Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/100000-Palestinians-have-fled-Syria-to-Europe-official-says-415395|title=100,000 Palestinians have fled Syria to Europe, official says|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
An estimated 240,000 [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] are living in Saudi Arabia. They are not allowed to hold or even apply for Saudi citizenship, because of [[Arab League]] instructions barring the Arab states from granting them citizenship; the only other alternative for them is to marry a Saudi national. Palestinians are the sole foreign group that cannot benefit from a 2004 law passed by Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers, which entitles [[expatriate]]s of all nationalities who have resided in the kingdom for ten years to apply for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=58980&amp;d=14&amp;m=2&amp;y=2005 |title=Expatriates Can Apply for Saudi Citizenship in Two-to-Three Months |publisher=Arabnews.com |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate =1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
{{Main article|Palestinians in Iraq}}
There were 34,000 Palestinian refugees living in Iraq prior to the [[Iraq War]]. In the aftermath of the war, the majority fled to neighboring Jordan and Syria, or were killed.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Thousands lived as [[internally displaced person]]s within Iraq or were stranded in camps along Iraq's borders with Jordan and Syria, as no country in the region would accept them, and lived in temporary camps along the [[no man's land]] in the border zones.

[[India]] agreed to take in 165 refugees, with the first group arriving in March 2006. Generally, they were unable to find work in India as they spoke only Arabic though some found employment with [[UNHCR]]'s non-governmental partners. All of them were provided with free access to public hospitals. Of the 165 refugees, 137 of them later found clearance for resettlement in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/4919b20b4.html|title=UNHCR - Palestinians bid goodbye to India, hello Sweden|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, 54 were granted asylum in [[Canada]], and in 2007, some 200 were accepted for resettlement in Sweden and [[Iceland]], and [[Brazil]] agreed to take 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/08/05/iraq.palestinians/|title=Sweden, Iceland absorbing Palestinian refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23126#.VoCqr3b2DIU|title=United Nations News Centre|date=3 July 2007|work=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, significant numbers of these refugees were allowed to [[third country resettlement|resettle]] abroad. More than 1,000 were accepted by various countries in Europe and South America, and an additional 1,350 were cleared for resettlement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4b67064c6.html|title=UNHCR - End of long ordeal for Palestinian refugees as desert camp closes|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124778007172153909|title=U.S. Agrees to Resettle Palestinians Displaced by Iraq War|author=Miriam Jordan|date=17 July 2009|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 68 were allowed to resettle in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/45343|title=Palestinian-Iraqi refugees – the forgotten victims of Iraq war|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of Palestine refugees strongly oppose resettlement and much rather want to [[voluntary return|return]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/resettlement.pdf%7C|title=page 68ff|author=|date=|website=fmreview.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions on the 'right of return'-claim==
{{Main article|Palestinian right of return}}
{{Israel-Palestinian peace process}}
On 11 December 1948 the  [[United Nations General Assembly]] discussed Bernadotte's report and passed a resolution: ''"that refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbour should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/IMG/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement |accessdate=20 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108201915/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/IMG/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=8 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "'' This General Assembly article 11 of [[UN General Assembly Resolution 194|Resolution 194]] has been annually re-affirmed.&lt;ref name="Resolution 194 III"/&gt;&lt;ref name="k" /&gt;

===Israeli views===
The Jewish Agency promised to the UN before 1948 that Palestinian Arabs would become full citizens of the State of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Pappe, "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine", page 110&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli declaration of independence]] invited the Arab inhabitants of Israel to "full and equal citizenship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel|title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|work=GxMSDev}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Israel does not grant citizenship to the refugees, as it does to those Arabs who continue to reside in its borders. The 1947 [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|Partition Plan]] determined citizenship based on residency, such that Arabs and Jews residing in Palestine but not in Jerusalem would obtain citizenship in the state in which they are resident. Professor of Law at Boston University Susan Akram, [[Omar Barghouti]] and [[Ilan Pappé]] have argued that Palestinian refugees from the envisioned Jewish State were entitled to normal Israeli citizenship based on laws of [[state succession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/2591|title=I Want This Poem to End: A Nakba Commemoration - The Jerusalem Fund|author=|date=17 May 2018|website=thejerusalemfund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=14921 "Palestinian refugees were excluded from entitlement to citizenship in the State of Israel under the 1952 Citizenship Law. They were "denationalized" and turned into stateless refugees in violation of the law of state succession].". "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine", Ilan Pappé, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab states===
The [[Arab League]] has instructed its members to deny citizenship to original Palestine Arab refugees (or their descendants) "to avoid dissolution of their identity and protect their right to return to their homeland".&lt;ref name="p"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=53213&amp;d=21&amp;m=10&amp;y=2004 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404085820/http://www.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=53213&amp;d=21&amp;m=10&amp;y=2004 |archivedate=4 April 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tashbih Sayyed]], a fellow of the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]], criticized Arab nations of violating human rights and making the children and grandchildren of Palestinian refugees second class citizens in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], or the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf States]], and said that the UNRWA Palestine refugees "cling to the illusion that defeating the Jews will restore their dignity".&lt;ref name="NRO"&gt;{{cite news|last=SAYYED |first=TASHBIH |title=Defeat Terrorism First |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/269137/defeat-terrorism-first/tashbih-sayyed |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129172748/http://article.nationalreview.com/269137/defeat-terrorism-first/tashbih-sayyed |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 January 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2010 |newspaper=National Review |date=18 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palestinian views===
Most Palestine refugees claim a [[Palestinian right of return]]. In lack of an own country, their claim is based on Article 13 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which declares that "Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country", although it has been argued that the term only applies to citizens or nationals of that country. Although all [[Arab League]] members at the time (1948) - [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syrian Republic (1946–1963)|Syria]], and [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|Yemen]] - voted against the resolution,&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/2dac0ed54bcd6af68525629f00718b98?OpenDocument |title=Yearbook of the United Nations 1948-49 (excerpts) |date=31 December 1949 |work=[[UNISPAL]] |accessdate=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721233654/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/2dac0ed54bcd6af68525629f00718b98?OpenDocument |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they also cite the non-binding article 11 of [[United Nations General Assembly]] [[UN General Assembly Resolution 194|Resolution 194]], which "Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return [...]."&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite news|author= |year=1948 |url=http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/IMG/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194 |format=PDF |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=20 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108201915/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/043/65/IMG/NR004365.pdf?OpenElement |archivedate=8 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is currently a matter of dispute whether Resolution 194 referred only to the estimated 50,000 remaining Palestine refugees from the 1948 Palestine War, or additionally to their UNRWA-registered 4,950,000 descendants. The [[Palestinian National Authority]] supports this claim, and has been prepared to negotiate its implementation at the various peace talks. Both [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] hold a strong position for a claimed ''right of return'', with Fatah being prepared to give ground on the issue while Hamas is not.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brynen, 'Addressing the Palestinian Refugee Issue: A Brief Overview' (McGill University, background paper for the Refugee Coordination Forum, Berlin, April 2007), p.15, available at http://prrn.mcgill.ca/research/papers/brynen-070514.pdf (08/08/09)&lt;/ref&gt;
However, a report in Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper in which Abdullah Muhammad Ibrahim Abdullah, the Palestinian ambassador to Lebanon and the chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council's Political and Parliamentary Affairs committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2011/Sep-15/148791-interview-refugees-will-not-be-citizens-of-new-state.ashx#ixzz1aWRkXv9r|title=Interview: Refugees will not be citizens of new state|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the proposed future Palestinian state would not be issuing Palestinian passports to UNRWA Palestine refugees – even refugees living in the West Bank and Gaza.

In a 2 January 2005 opinion poll conducted by the Palestinian Association for Human Rights involving Palestinian refugees in Lebanon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saidacity.net/_NewsPaper.php?NewsPaperID=131&amp;Action=Details|title=استطلاع للاجئين في مخيمات لبنان: الغالبية تعارض انتخابات تحت الاحتلال ولا تثق بقدرة "ابو مازن"|publisher=Saida City Net|date=2 January 2005|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 96% refused to give up their right of return
* 3% answered contrary
* 1% did not answer

==The Oslo Accords==
Upon signing the [[Oslo Accords]] in 1993, Israel, the EU and the US recognized PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.  In return, [[Yasser Arafat]] recognized the State of Israel and renounced terrorism.  At the time, the accords were celebrated as a historic breakthrough.  In accordance with these agreements, the Palestinian refugees began to be governed by an autonomous [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]], and the parties agreed to negotiate the permanent status of the refugees, as early as 1996. However, events have halted the phasing process and made the likelihood of a future sovereign Palestinian state uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/israel_and_the_palestinians/key_documents/1682727.stm|title=Text: 1993 Declaration of Principles|author=|date=29 November 2001|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another development, a rift developed between Fatah in the West-Bank and Hamas in Gaza after [[Hamas]] won the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]].  Among other differences, Fatah officially recognizes the Oslo Accords with Israel, whereas Hamas does not.

===United States===
The United States considers the original refugees and their descendants to be refugees.&lt;ref name="alg"/&gt;
In May 2012, the [[United States Senate]] Appropriations Committee approved a definition of a Palestine refugee to include only those original Palestine refugees who were actually displaced between June 1946 and May 1948, resulting in an estimated number of 30,000.&lt;ref name="unrwa30"&gt;"According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency – the main body tasked with providing assistance to Palestinian refugees – there are more than 5 million refugees at present. However, the number of Palestinians alive who were personally displaced during Israel's War of Independence is estimated to be around 30,000."[http://www.timesofisrael.com/us-senate-dramatically-redefines-definition-of-palestinian-refugees/ US Senate dramatically scales down definition of Palestinian 'refugees']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paulo Cesar Siqueira Cavalcante Farias''' (September 20, 1945 &amp;ndash; June 23, 1996) commonly known as '''Paulo Cesar Farias''' or '''PC Farias''', was the political campaign treasurer of [[Brazil]]ian President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] and a central figure in the corruption scandal that resulted in Collor's 1992 removal from Brazil's presidential office.

== Corruption scandal ==
PC (as he was colloquially known) was a successful and famous campaign treasurer in [[Alagoas]] and a relatively unsuccessful businessman before associating himself with Collor in 1981. As campaign treasurer, PC typically collected much more than he spent on the campaign. The remainder (which was estimated to be over 50 million US [[dollar]]s) was invested in his own businesses (such as an [[air taxi]] service) or hidden in anonymous overseas accounts.

Once Collor was elected, PC Farias masterminded the vast corruption scheme that rendered Collor's presidency a high-priced toll booth for government favors. He set up dummy companies to collect bribes, with 30 percent of the money going to him and 70 percent to Collor.&lt;ref name=nyt280696&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904E7D81239F93BA15755C0A960958260  Politics, Passion and Graft at Issue in Rio Slayings], The New York Times, June 28, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; As much as US $9 million went to PC's accounts between 1990 and 1992. As the corruption scandal emerged in 1992, it was revealed that a fraction of money from PC's businesses was sent directly to Collor to finance the president's personal expenditures, including household staff and extensive landscaping at his home in [[Brasília]].

After Collor's impeachment, PC fled to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Thailand]], where he was arrested by the [[Interpol]] and extradited back to Brazil. In 1994 he was condemned to 7 years in [[prison]]. He was released in December 1995 by an indult from the Brazilian president [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]].

== Murder ==
In 1996, PC and his young girlfriend [[Suzana Marcolino]] were found both dead, shot by a .38 Special caliber Rossi revolver in PC's beach house in [[Maceió]]. Local police ascribed the deaths to a crime of passion, where Suzana, fearing the imminent dissolution of the relationship, shot PC and then herself. Others would claim it was a form of "destruction of evidence" over what PC may know and subsequently reveal. In 1999, both their bodies were exhumed and subjected to another round of forensic examinations by three separate experts from three different institutions. Their conclusions were that while there was not enough evidence to rule out suicide, there was evidence to suggest it was ''not'' a suicide.&lt;ref name=caso&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.terra.com.br/noticias/especial/pc/morte02.htm Caso PC Farias]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently PC Farias' brother, [[Augusto Farias]], and eight others were charged with the murder.&lt;ref name=bbc181199&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/526856.stm New twist in Brazil murder case], BBC News, November 18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5502">'''Pedro Antonio Olañeta''' (1770 in Elgueta, [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Spain]] &amp;ndash; April 2, 1825 in [[Tumusla]] ([[Potosí Department]]), [[Bolivia]]) was a Royalist commander in the army of the [[Spanish Empire]] who fought the against the South American insurgency led by [[Simón Bolívar]]. His support for Spanish absolutism and rebellion against the moderate Royalists created conflicts within the Royalist army that aided the rebels. After the defeat of the main Royalist armies, he continued the resistance, becoming last Royalist commander to hold out.

==Early life==
Olañeta was born of a humble family in [[Biscay|Biscay province]], Spain and emigrated with his parents to [[South America]] in 1797. He settled in the area of [[Potosí]] and [[Salta]], becoming a prosperous trader.

==Royalist commander==
When the [[May Revolution]] occurred in 1810 he sided with the Royalists, commanded by General [[José Manuel de Goyeneche, 1st Count of Guaqui|José Manuel de Goyeneche]], and fought as an officer in campaigns against the rebels. He was promoted to colonel under the command of [[Joaquín de la Pezuela, 1st Marquis of Viluma|Joaquín Pezuela]], then to brigadier general under Viceroy [[José de la Serna e Hinojosa]] in 1821. After the liberal revolution in Spain under [[Fernando VII]], Olañeta rejected the authority of La Serna and proclaimed himself "the only defender of throne and altar". Olañeta then ordered an attack of the Upper Peruvian royalists on the constitutionalists in the Peruvian viceroyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime E. Rodríguez O. [https://books.google.com/books?id=QQWJ4nzGNKMC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=%22las+guerras+de+los+absolutistas+y+liberales+en+am%C3%A9rica%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=CT8C2e3q7z&amp;sig=fA6S3RXyqSWYdm2D-qmWuNiOCEg The Independence of Spanish America] (1998), 231. {{ISBN|0521626730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Viceroy de La Serna was forced to change his plans of going down to the coast to fight Bolívar and sent [[Jerónimo Valdés]] with a force of 5,000 veterans to cross the [[River Desaguadero]], which took place on January 22, 1824, in order to drive them to [[Potosí]] against his former subordinate "because there are indications of a meditated treason, joining the dissidents of Buenos Aires". ''Memorias para la historia de las armas españolas en el Perú'' ("Memories for the history of the Spanish armies in Peru") by peninsular official Andrés García Camba (1846) detailed the radical change that the events in Upper Peru produced in the viceory's defensive plans. After a long campaign in the battles of Tarabuquillo, Sala, Cotagaita, and finally La Lava on August 17, 1824, both royalists forces of Viceroyalty Peru (liberals) and of the provinces of Upper Peru (absolutists) were decimated.

==Continuing resistance==
Bolivar, having news of Olañeta's actions, took advantage of the dismantling of the royalist defensive system so that he "moved the whole month of May to Jauja", and faced [[José de Canterac]], who was isolated in Junín on August 6 of 1824. Unrelenting prosecution of the war started, with the consequent desertion of 2700 royalists, who immediately went over to the independentists. Finally, October 7 of 1824, having his troops right in front of the doors of [[Cusco]], Bolívar gave general Sucre the command of the new battle front, which followed the course of the [[Apurímac River]], and he withdraw to Lima in order to negotiate more loans to keep the war going in Peru, and to receive a Colombian division of 4000 men given up by Páez which would arrive after Ayacucho.&lt;ref name="Bolívar"&gt;Bolívar&lt;/ref&gt;

After the decisive defeat of the main royalist armies in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], Olañeta continued a hopeless resistance against [[Simón Bolívar]]'s forces in the [[Campaign of Sucre in Upper Peru]] (today's [[Bolivia]]). On April 2, 1825, after a desperate fight, Olañeta was mortally wounded in the [[Battle of Tumusla]], fighting with a few hundred men against many of his own ex-troops led by Colonel Carlos Medinaceli, who had defected to the patriots. He died the following day. This battle of the war of independence was the last engagement in an open field by regular armies in [[South America]]. Unaware of his death, Fernando VII appointed him [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Viceroy of the Rio de la Plata]]. After the battle [[Antonio José de Sucre]] called a congress of Upper Peru and saw the creation of a new nation, [[Bolivia]].

[[Image:Flores 1.JPG|thumb|Flores Yo-yo (Circ. 1928-1929)]] 
'''Pedro Flores''' (26 April 1896- December 1963) was a Filipino businessman and yo-yo maker who has been credited with popularizing [[Yo-yo]]s in the [[United States]]. He patented an innovation to yo-yos that used a loop instead of a knot around the axle, allowing for new tricks such as the ability to "sleep."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2796.htm|title=No. 2796: The yo-yo|website=www.uh.edu|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/04/the-yo-yo-effect/389868/|title=The High-Stakes World of High-End Yo Yos|last=Goto-Jones|first=Chris|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Pedro Flores was born in [[Vintar, Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]] and came to the United States in 1915. He attended the High School of Commerce in San Francisco 1919-1920 and subsequently studied law at [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Hastings College of Law]] in San Francisco. Flores dropped out of school and moved to [[Santa Barbara, California]] where he worked at odd-jobs to make a living.

While working as a bellboy, Flores read an article about a self-made millionaire who made his money by selling a ball attached to a rubber band. At this point he remembered the yo-yo (previously known as the bandalore), a game which has been played for hundreds of years in the Philippines. Bringing it all together, Flores saw a good market opportunity in the US, and the ability to go into business for
himself.

==Flores Yo-yos==
Between 1928 and 1932, Flores started and ran the ''Yo-yo Manufacturing Company'' in Santa Barbara before selling the company and trademark to Duncan who continued to market and sell Flores yo-yos alongside the Duncan line.

Flores initially made yo-yos for neighborhood children by hand, but soon started buying machinery to produce them more quickly. Approximately a year after Flores opened his yo-yo business, his company was selling 300,000 yo-yos a day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecharacternetwork.org/pedro-flores/|title=The Pedro Flores Story {{!}} The Character Network|website=thecharacternetwork.org|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flores has been credited with popularizing the yo-yo in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but he never claimed to have invented the yo-yo. Yo-yos were introduced to the Philippines in the 1800s. The word "yóyo" was a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word that means "come and go"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or "come back."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Flores is sometimes referred to as the original [[Patents|patent]] holder of the yo-yo. Although he didn't patent the first yo-yo in the U.S., his patent included the [[Philippines|Filipino]] innovation&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of using a loop instead of a knot around the axle. This is known as an "unresponsive yo-yo" and allows for additional tricks such as the ability to "sleep."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ability to do tricks was one of the main selling points for Flores' yo-yos, and he created some of the first yo-yo trick competitions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other types of yo-yos (Bandalores) had already been patented prior to the company's existence.

Flores stayed involved with yo-yos most of his life. He founded a yo-yo manufacturing company in Santa Barbara, California in 1928, founded the Flores Corporation in Hollywood (6301 Sunset Blvd.) and cofounded Flores and Stone in Los Angeles (1938 Hyperion Ave. in Silver Lake) c. 1929. In the 1930s, he promoted yo-yo contests along with Duncan. He cofounded the Chico yo-yo company in 1950 and founded the Flores Corporation of America in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirahara|first=Naomi|title=Distinguished Asian American Business Leaders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fN7_zps2kQUC|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-57356-344-4|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fN7_zps2kQUC&amp;pg=PA56 56]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duncan==
Between 1930 and 1932, Flores sold his interest in his yo-yo manufacturing companies for greater than $750,000, to [[Donald F. Duncan Sr.]], which during the depression of the 1930s was a fortune. On this transaction Flores was quoted saying ''"I am more interested in teaching children to use the yo-yos than I am in manufacturing of yo-yos."''{{Citation needed|date=December 2011|reason=per [[WP:V]]}}

Taking his own words to heart, he became one of the key promoters in Duncan's early yo-yo campaigns. During 1931-1932, Flores was instrumental in setting up a large number of the promotions in the cities where the early Duncan contests were being held. In relation to his contests run just 2 years earlier with his Yo-yo Manufacturing Company, the new Duncan contests were vastly different. These contests now required a series of tricks similar to modern day contests with ties being broken by the number of loop the loops completed.

==Rugby career==
Seddon started his career at [[Broughton Rangers]], and was one original members of the club when it was founded in 1877. He left the club in October 1887 and joined [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Graham|title=Rugby league in Manchester|year=2003|publisher=Tempus|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7524-3087-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seddon first came to note as a rugby player when he was chosen to represent England during the [[1887 Home Nations Championship]]. Seddon was representing Broughton at the time of his first international,&lt;ref name="Godwin15"&gt;Godwin (1984), pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of five new caps brought into the pack for the opening game of the Championship, played away against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, but despite this being the worst result against the Welsh to date, the selectors kept faith in Seddon who was chosen for the next game against [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Another poor game for England saw Ireland beat the English team for the first time in their history. Seddon played one final international game for England, a draw against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]], which capped off England's worst ever season in the Home Nations Championship, ending bottom of the table.

Seddon may have gained reselection in the next season, but after the Rugby Football Union refused to join the International Rugby Board, the other Home Nations refused to play England. In 1888, a private venture by cricketers [[Alfred Shaw]] and [[Arthur Shrewsbury]], saw a group of rugby players chosen to tour Australia and New Zealand. The tour was not sanctioned by any of the Home Nations, and no test games were played, but it was the [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|first rugby tour from Britain]], and is retrospectively classed as the first British Lions tour. Seddon was given the captaincy of the team, but after 20 games of a 35 match series, Seddon drowned in an accident while [[sculling]] on the [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionsrugby.com/5710.php?PHPSESSID=1f0db26c9ca845611524170106c51d0f Seddon's last hurrah] Lionsrugby.com&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Maitland, New South Wales|West Maitland]], [[New South Wales]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">'''Robert Wolter Mongisidi''' (Malalayang, February 14, 1925 &amp;ndash; Pacinang, September 5, 1949) was part of [[Indonesia| Indonesia's]] [[Indonesian National Revolution|struggle for independence]] from the Dutch in South Sulawesi.

==Biography==
Robert was born in Malalayang (now part of [[Manado]]) and was the son of Petrus Mongisidi and Lina Suawa. He started his education in 1931 in elementary school ({{lang-nl|Hollands Inlandsche School (HIS)}}), which was followed by middle school ({{lang-nl|Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (MULO)}}) at Frater Don Bosco in Manado. Mongisidi was then educated as a Japanese language teacher at a school in [[Tomohon]]. After his studies, he taught Japanese in Liwutung, in the [[Minahasa]] region, and in [[Luwuk]], [[Central Sulawesi]], before making his way to [[Makassar]], [[South Sulawesi]].&lt;ref name="KOMANDOKO1"&gt;{{cite book | first = Gamal | last = Komandoko | year = 2006 | title = Kisah 124 Pahlawan and Pejuang Nusantara (124 Stories of National Heroes) | pages = 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grave of Robert Wolter Monginsidi 27 November 1950 p1.jpg|thumb|Mongisidi's family surrounding his grave, 1950]]
Indonesia's independence was [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] while Mongisidi was in Makassar. However, the Dutch sought to regain control of Indonesia after the end of [[World War II]]. They returned  through the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA). Mongisidi became involved in the struggle against NICA in Makassar.&lt;ref name="SUDARMANTO"&gt;{{cite book | first = J.B. | last = Sudarmanto | year = 2007 | title = Jejak-jejak Pahlawan (Footsteps of Heroes) | pages = 220 | publisher = Grasindo}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, 1946, Mongisidi with Ranggong Daeng Romo and others formed the Indonesian people's resistance army in Sulawesi ({{lang-id|Laskar Pemberontak Rakyat Indonesia Sulawesi (LAPRIS)}}), which continually harassed and attacked Dutch positions. He was caught by the Dutch on February 28, 1947, but managed to escape on October 27, 1947. The Dutch caught him again and this time sentenced him to death. Mongisidi was executed by firing squad on September 5, 1949.&lt;ref name="KOMANDOKO2"&gt;{{cite book | first = Gamal | last = Komandoko | year = 2006 | title = Kisah 124 Pahlawan and Pejuang Nusantara (124 Stories of National Heroes) | pages = 280}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was moved to the Makassar heroes cemetery on November 10, 1950.&lt;ref name="MEDIAPUSINDO"&gt;{{cite book | title = Pahlawan Indonesia (Indonesian Hero) | pages = 118 | publisher = Media Pusindo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
Robert Wolter Mongisidi was posthumously named a national hero ({{lang-id|Pahlawan Nasional}}) by the government of Indonesia on November 6, 1973. He also received the country's highest honor, the Bintang Mahaputra (Adipradana), on November 10, 1973. His then 80-year-old father, Petrus, accepted the honor.&lt;ref name="TEMPO_24NOV1973"&gt;{{cite news | title=Petrus Terima Bintang (Petrus Receives Honor) | publisher=Tempo | date=24 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wolter Monginsidi Airport|airport]] in [[Kendari]], [[South East Sulawesi]] is named in honor of Mongisidi, as is an Indonesian naval ship, the [[USS Claud Jones|KRI Wolter Mongisidi]].

}}
'''Samuel Alexander Adams''' (June 14, 1934 – October 10, 1988), known as '''Sam Adams''', was an analyst for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). He is best known for his role in discovering that during the mid-1960s American military intelligence had underestimated the number of [[Viet Cong]] and [[North Vietnamese Army]] soldiers. Although his opinion was challenged, he pushed the case for a higher troop count. The issue under debate was called the [[Order of Battle]] (O/B). His efforts in 1967 met strong and persistent opposition from the Army (here [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]]) which, in the short-term, prevailed against him.

Following his testimony for the defense during the 1973 prosecution of [[Daniel Ellsberg]], Adams resigned from the CIA. In 1975 his critical article on Vietnam intelligence appeared in ''[[Harper's]]''. He then testified before a [[United States House of Representatives|House]] committee about the Viet Cong O/B. In 1982 he was a consultant for a [[The Uncounted Enemy|CBS television documentary]] on Vietnam. Consequently, he was named as a co-defendant in a media-covered [[Westmoreland v. CBS|civil trial]] for [[libel]], which was successfully defended. When he died, he was finishing his book about the CIA in Vietnam.

==Family, education==
Although he was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], he was born into the prominent [[Adams family]] of Massachusetts. His father Pierpont 'Pete' Adams was a stock broker and member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Sam Adams attended [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]] in [[Southborough, Massachusetts]]. He graduated in European history from [[Harvard College]], class of 1955. After two years in the Navy, he attended [[Harvard Law School]], then worked for a while in banking.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (1988), ¶ 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randolph (1985), ¶¶ 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), pp. 24, 110-111 (his father).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in the CIA==
From 1963 to 1973 Sam Adams served in the CIA, mostly at its headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]]. About the intelligence agency, he said, "I found to my astonishment that I really loved the place."&lt;ref&gt;Randolph (1985), ¶ 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa division===
Starting as an intelligence analyst at the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] desk, in the CIA's new Africa Division, he read everything and talked to everybody, and "quickly became one of Washington's reigning authorities on the Congo". He wrote on its economy, but it was political turbulence in the newly independent state that drew world attention, including Cuban under [[Che Guevara|Che]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair (1995), §1: ¶¶ 5-9 ("reigning authorities" quote, Cubans, Simba invasion)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (1988), ¶ 7 (Congo economy).&lt;/ref&gt; Adams later commented that "the Congo's problem" was "being both rich and weak at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), at p. 4 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially, it was for his coverage of the [[Simba rebellion]] that Adams won commendations. Although at first greeted with 'snickers' from intelligence agents at [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research|State]], he successfully predicted the crisis appointment of [[Moise Tshombe]] by [[Joseph Kasavubu]], then President of Congo. He briefed a high-level CIA conclave about the Simba and their invasion of the Congo from the east. The Simba reached [[Kisangani]] (then called Stanleyville), which prompted an intervention to rescue hostages. Tshombe was cheered "wherever he went". Adams won the esteem of analysts at CIA. As he later recalled, "It was terrific... one of the high points of my life."&lt;ref&gt;Powers (1979), pp. 138-140 (Simba), 139 (Adams).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randolph (1985), ¶¶ 21-23 ("terrific" quote from Adams, 'snickers').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), pp. 1-24; pp. 11-12, 17, quote at 20 (Kasavubu, Tshombe); pp. 14-17 (briefs [[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]] [[John McCone|McCone]], DDI [[Ray Cline|Cline]], [[Deputy Director for Plans|DDP]] [[Richard Helms|Helms]], 30 others).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers (1979), p. 139, Adams at CIA conclave re Simba.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Far East division===
In 1965 Adams transferred to the Vietnam desk, Southeast Asia Branch of the Far East Division.&lt;ref&gt;Ranelagh (1978), p.455 (CIA organization).&lt;/ref&gt; He read as background then-recent books by [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] on the north's view of its earlier victory, ''People's War, People's Army'', [[Bernard Fall]] on the French defeat, ''[[Street without Joy (book)|Street without Joy]]'', and [[Joseph Buttinger]]'s history of Vietnam, ''Smaller Dragon''. His branch chief, Edward Hauck, when asked told Adams that the Vietnamese communists would probably outlast the Americans and, after 10 or 20 years, win the war.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), p.28 (books). pp. 26-27 (Ed Hauck, cf. p.32).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiam (2006), pp. 41-43 (Ed Huack).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Viet Cong motivation====
In the role of a "generalist" and "roving analyst", Adams was assigned to study the [[Viet Cong]]. Its motivation and morale were his first objectives. Following his procedure per the Congo, he began assembling biographies of Viet Cong operatives, but stopped when told the names were all fake. He also netted little by reading captured documents in translation. He drew welcome information, however, out of statistics compiled in Saigon from the files of [[Chieu Hoi]] ([[South Vietnam]]'s defector program).&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), pp. 23, 26, 28 (roving analyst, VC morale), pp. 28-29 (VC names are aliases), pp. 33-34 (captured documents), pp. 33-34 (statistics, Chieu Hoi).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiam (2006), pp. 52-55, 100, 125 (Chieu Hoi).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker (2000), pp. 69-70, "Chiêu Hôi (Open Arms) Program".&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams found VC [[defection]]s per year were 10,000, and thus a 5% defection rate which was high, and rising. The statistics also showed an increase in VC killed, paralleling the higher defections. This information would counter the general CIA pessimism about the war. Yet feedback within his CIA office was ambiguous, noncommittal, cautious; they knew well enough the widespread evidence of the Viet Cong's growing success in the field, of its confidence and morale. His report "Viet Cong Morale: Possible Indicator of Downward Drift" was published, but with caveats in footnotes and distributed only within the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), pp. 34-35, 46 (10,000 defectors, 5% rate, statistics), p.36 (his report), pp. 36, 37, 38 (VC success, CIA pessimism), pp. 26-27, 62 (CIA pessimism).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiam (2006), pp. 47-48, 51-52, 73 (defections). "South Vietnam was awash in escaped Viet Cong recruits" (p.73).&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Vietnam, Adams got advice from a senior analyst.&lt;ref&gt;George W. Allen, author of ''None so Blind'' (2001), later Adams' boss at CIA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), p. 44 (Allen).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Hiam (2006), p. 54 (Allen).&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he inquired about VC [[desertion]]s. A [[Rand Corporation]] office in Saigon was doing similar VC investigations; it was headed by [[Leon Gouré]]. He told Adams that VC deserters were seven times the number of VC defectors. This surprised and puzzled Adams, considering the math. Such a combined loss rate per year (10,000 defectors + 70,000 deserters), in addition to VC annual casualties (reported at 150,000), would severely reduce the Viet Cong's overall strength (which MACV's O/B put at 280,000). Yet the VC did not seem to be losing the war.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), pp. 44, 46, 59 (VC deserters), pp. 46, 59, 63 (ratio of Gouré), pp. 36, 39, 44 (George Allen).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiam (2006), pp. 52, 54-55 (desertion numbers and ratios to defection, O/B numbers).&lt;/ref&gt;

While doing this perplexing research, Adams discovered that in the provinces the [[Army of the Republic of Viet Nam|ARVN]]'s count of the VC guerrillas and militia was often much higher than [[MACV]]'s, e.g., in [[Long An]] province it was 2000 to 160.  He got permission to "look into enemy manpower".&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), pp. 56-57, 58 (VC numbers for Long An), p.63 (MACV's O/B numbers for VC), p.64 (permission).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers (1979), p. 214-215 (trail of Adams from VC desertion to VC O/B).&lt;/ref&gt;

MACV's ''Combined Document Exploitation Center'' (CDEC) in Saigon had been publishing annotated versions of captured documents in its bulletins. "Bulletin 689" contained a single 3-page document, "Recapitulated Report on the People's Warfare Movement from [[Bình Định Province]]". It listed VC troop counts for several types of guerrillas and militias, which all together totaled 50,244. In MACV's country-wide O/B for VC, of the 280,000 grand total, only 100,000 were guerrillas or militia. Adams asked, "Why should Bình Định--one of forty-four provinces--have half of them?"&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1994), p.64 (MACV bulletins), pp. 65-66, 67 (Buelliten 689), p.66 (quote). Adams writes, "For the rest of the day I galloped around CIA headquarters like [[The Ride of Paul Revere|Paul Revere]], ballooing about Viet Cong guerrillas" (p.67).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hiam (2006), pp. 75-76, 259, 262 (Bulletin 689).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Order of Battle====
{{See also|Order of Battle for the Viet Cong}}
Adams assignment in motivation led to his work in estimating the number of [[Viet Cong]] guerrillas. From his research into captured enemy documents and other sources, he "concluded that previous estimates had undercounted the communists by hundreds of thousands. The implications were astounding."&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis (2005), p. 233 (quote).&lt;/ref&gt; If the Viet Cong enemy combatant count was higher, it implied that the prospects for a South Vietnamese military victory were dimmed. It questioned American claims of progress on the battlefield. It'd be "politically disastrous" for the U.S. government. This numbers dispute became known in military terms as the Order of Battle (O/B) controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Powers (1978), pp. 213-219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1998), pp. 89-90 (Sam Adams), 87 ("disastrous" quote).&lt;/ref&gt;

His findings, at first ignored, then challenged, after a heated struggle were not adopted. The Army's [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]] forcefully insisted on its lower numbers, and the CIA in 1967, due to the domestic political environment, reluctantly agreed. Following the [[Tet offensive]] in early 1968, however, the controversy was revisited. The numbers of enemy combatants were raised to a higher count, more in accord with Adams' original conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Ranelagh (1986), pp. 455-471, at pp. 462-463, 465 (Adams and numbers after Tet).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis (2005), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See below, "Order of Battle controversy".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Challenging the CIA====
By then, Adams had resigned his Vietnam post and was doing CIA analysis of neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Yet he persisted in advancing the higher count of Viet Cong in the 'Order of Battle' controversy, despite the institutional fallout between CIA and MACV. He claimed that the CIA had compromised its integrity. He filed formal charges against [[Director of Central Intelligence|DCI]] [[Richard Helms]]. He became notorious to many in the agency, and acquired a general reputation as a "gadfly, pariah and nemesis."&lt;ref&gt;Andersen (1994), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Helms (2003), pp. 326-328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powers (1978), p. 221-222 (files charges).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ranelagh (1986), pp. 469-470 (Adams bitter as wrong numbers lost lives).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Adams, fearing that his opponents would destroy them, secretly removed CIA files and documents which would support his case. He buried them in the woods near his {{convert|250|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in rural Virginia. His 1973 testimony in federal court,&lt;ref&gt;At the Ellsberg espionage trial, see section below.&lt;/ref&gt; where he restated his position on the 'Order of Battle' numbers, caused consternation at CIA. Following this trial, he retired from the agency.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media, and testimony==
Outside the CIA Adams continued to advance the issues stemming from the 'Order of Battle' controversy. In particular, the tailoring of 'pure' intelligence in order to fit the political agenda of its primary consumers: the American government, and its chief executive.

===Trial of Ellsberg and Russo===
Adams appeared as a defense witness at the 1973 trial of [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Anthony J. Russo]]. The case involved their role in the unauthorized publication of the top secret [[Pentagon Papers]], a 47-volume, government-produced, secret history of the Vietnam War. The prosecution alleged [[felony]] violations of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and of signed secrecy agreements. The charges involved disclosure of government secrets, yet not to foreign powers, but to American newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg (2002), pp. 303 (secrecy agreements), 304 ("thousands of pages of top secret documents"), 429-430 (criminal prosecution, Espionage Act).&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams testified concerning the military's false numbers for Viet Cong combatants. The undercounting had been deliberately adopted by the American intelligence community as official. His testimony was offered to show that supposed 'secret information' in the text of the ''Pentagon Papers'' contained in reality many fictions.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph (1985) ¶36. Adams volunteered to testify that "the numbers Ellsberg was being tried for leaking were false anyway."&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial was held at the [[U.S. District Court for the Central District of California|U.S. District Court in Los Angeles]]. Eventually, citing the "totality" of government misconduct, Federal judge [[William Matthew Byrne, Jr.]] dismissed all charges against Ellsberg and Russo.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg (2002), pp. 454-456 (case dismissed).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Article on CIA in ''Harper's''===
Adams did additional research. Fearful that his opponents would destroy evidence, he had already removed files and documents from the CIA, hiding them on a farm in rural Virginia. He also scouted out former contacts and CIA employees in order to bolster his cause. After his resignation from the agency in 1973, he sought the support of other intelligence officials to prove that there was a Saigon cover-up. He detailed his allegations in an article sent to ''Harper's Magazine''.
In 1975, in its May issue, ''[[Harper's]]'' published his article, "Vietnam Cover-Up: Playing war with numbers". Adams brought his cause to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the 'cover-up' article, Adams was sought out for further comments.

===House Intelligence Committee===
Adams gave sworn testimony before the [[Otis G. Pike|Pike Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;Now (2017) called the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Select Committee on Intelligence]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the House of Representatives. This committee was holding hearings during the latter half of 1975. Although it shed needed light on the secret operations of CIA, it also acquired controversy.&lt;ref&gt;The Pike Committee was tagged for its "politically partisan manner" and as the source of [[leaks]] that "damaged national security". Publication of its official report was suppressed by House vote, but was leaked to the press. Ranelagh (1986), p.595 (quotes), cf. 593 (leaks).&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks were welcomed; Adams and the House Pike committee on intelligence reached similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys-Jones (1989), pp. 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis (2005), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBS Vietnam documentary===
In 1982 Adams provided critical evidence to CBS News reporters who made the documentary ''[[The Uncounted Enemy]]: A Vietnam Deception.'' He claimed [[U.S. Army]] General [[William C. Westmoreland]] had conspired to minimize reported [[Vietnam]]ese enemy troop strength in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1998), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis (2005), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Westmoreland v. CBS''===
General Westmoreland in 1982 sued for libel against CBS News, and named as co-defendants the producer [[George Crile III|George Crile]], correspondent [[Mike Wallace]], and consultant Sam Adams. The case, ''[[Westmoreland v. CBS]]'', went to trial but ended in a private, out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys-Jones (1989), p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westmoreland's law suit was financed by politically conservative foundations. Mascaro, ¶ 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams testified "concerning the intelligence gathering and reporting of enemy strength." He told the court, "I believe there was a conspiracy. There was an attempt to do wrong with the numbers... . I have always felt that what went on in the 1967–1968 period was a conspiracy." Adams also stated, "I do not believe Gen. Westmoreland communicated fully to Washington."&lt;ref&gt;Times Wire Services (1988), quotes of Sam Adams.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also testifying at the 1984–1985 trial were several Army officers of [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]] in the mid-1960s. Then Col. (later Gen.) [[Daniel O. Graham]] (chief of MACV intelligence estimates), Gen. [[Joseph A. McChristian]] (MACV intelligence), and Col. Gaines Hawkins (chief of MACV's O/B section). The MACV O/B ('Order of Battle') estimate was "undercut" by "latter admissions" at trial that

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The officers] had known at the time that General Westmoreland's insistence on an O/B total of no more than 300,000 was an artificial position dictated by political considerations, and that the true number of enemy forces had almost certainly been much higher.&lt;ref&gt;Ford (1998), pp. 100-101 (officers' testimony), 91 (re Hawkins, re McChristian), 93 and 94 (re Graham), 100-101 ("known at that time" quote, cf. pp. 92, 94).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After an 18-week trial, while the jury was beginning their deliberation, the parties negotiated and reached agreement. Evidently it was testimony "by his former chief of military intelligence" in Vietnam, which agreed more with Adams, that convinced Westmoreland to settle.&lt;ref&gt;Times Wire Services (1988), quote re Westmoreland.&lt;/ref&gt; The General received no money, but in a public statement each side expressed respect for the other.&lt;ref&gt;Theoharis (2005), pp. 234 (18-week trial, statement), 248-249 (Carver was a witness).&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit ended in February 1985. In May 1993, Westmoreland appeared on NBC's ''[[The Today Show]]''. He discussed the Vietnam War in 1967–68, and opined that the true calamity of the [[Tet offensive]] was its surprise, because the public did not know the Viet Cong's real strength. "And if I had to do it over again, I would have called a press conference and made known to the media the intelligence we had."&lt;ref&gt;Mascaro, ¶ 13 (last ¶).&lt;/ref&gt;

===His book ''War of Numbers''===
Adams worked on his revising his memoirs at his home in Vermont. The book was published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Sam Adams Award]] for integrity in intelligence, given since 2002, is named after him.

'''Samuel Price Carson''' (January 22, 1798 – November 2, 1838) was an American political leader and farmer in both [[North Carolina]] and [[Texas]]. He served as [[United States House of Representatives|Congressional Representative]] from North Carolina.  He was born in [[McDowell County, North Carolina|Pleasant Gardens, North Carolina]], and studied under private tutors in Pleasant Gardens; engaged in agricultural pursuits; member of the [[North Carolina Senate|State senate]] 1822-1824; elected as a Jacksonian to the Nineteenth and to the three succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1825-March 3, 1833); unsuccessful candidate in 1833 for reelection to the Twenty-third Congress; again elected to the State senate in 1834; delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1835.

By 1836 he had moved to Texas, and was elected by his neighbors to the [[Convention of 1836]] where he signed both the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas]]. The convention also established an interim or acting government for the Republic, which was still at war in rebellion against Mexico. They considered him for president, but elected [[David G. Burnet]] instead, by six votes more than Carson received.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Kemp; ''The Signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence''; Salado, Texas; Anson Jones, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}} In a later vote they elected Carson the Secretary of State. President Burnet sent him to [[Washington, D.C.]] to lead a team to negotiate for recognition of and aid for Texas, then later named [[James Collinsworth]] to replace him as Secretary of State. When Carson learned of this from a newspaper he simply went home.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Handbook of Texas]] entry for Carson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when borders were formalized, Carson's home was identified as part of [[Miller County, Arkansas]]. He died in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], and is buried in the Government Cemetery there.

[[Robert Brank Vance]] was mortally wounded by Samuel Price Carson, who challenged him to a duel, fought at [[Saluda Gap, North Carolina]], because of a derogatory remark made during the [[20th United States Congress|campaign]] of 1826.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2305">'''Thomas Culbreth''' (April 13, 1786 &amp;ndash; April 16, 1843) was an [[United States|American]] politician.

Born in [[Kent County, Delaware]], eight miles northeast of [[Greensboro, Maryland]], Cubreth attended the public schools and studied under private tutors.  He moved to [[Denton, Maryland]], in 1806 and was a clerk in a store there.  He became a member of the congressional committee at Hillsboro in 1810, and was a member of the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] in 1812 and 1813.  He was also cashier of the State Bank at Denton in 1813.

Culbreth was elected from the [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|sixth district of Maryland]] as a [[Democratic-Republican]] to the Fifteenth Congress and reelected to the Sixteenth Congress, serving from March 4, 1817 to March 3, 1821.  He declined to be a candidate for reelection in 1820 to the Seventeenth Congress and for election in 1822 to the Eighteenth Congress.  He was appointed chief judge of the Caroline County orphans’ court in 1822, was clerk of the executive council of Maryland from 1825 to 1838, and resided in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].  He returned to Denton in 1838 and engaged in mercantile pursuits, and soon afterward moved to ''Orrell Farm'', near Greensboro, where he died.  He is interred in the family cemetery on the farm.

From 1984 to 1989 she was Assistant Professor in French Studies in charge of the Philosophy Translation Program at the Department of Foreign Languages of [[Sofia University]]. In 1989 she earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the Institute of Philosophy at the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], where she became Junior research fellow. The same year she founded the Bulgarian Society for French Philosophy and Culture - Société Bulgare de Philosophie et de Culture de Langue Française.

==Work==
'''Translations and articles'''

The early writings and research of Raynova had a special impact on Bulgarian philosophy and culture, as she was the first to introduce contemporary French and German philosophers, unknown at the time in the Bulgarian academia, like [[Simone Weil]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Edith Stein]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Paul Ricoeur]], and to translate original texts of these and other authors into Bulgarian. She was also the first to open the field of [[Feminist philosophy]] in Bulgaria by publishing an extensive essay on Beauvoir in 1988 and organizing ten years later the first conference on Feminist philosophy in Sofia in which took part well known feminists like [[Alison Jaggar]], Herta Nagl-Docekal, Cornelia Klinger, Hedwig Meyer-Wilmes a.o.

After the fall of Communism she became chief editor of the book series "Philosophers of the 20th Century" at the publisher "Nauka I Izkustvo", and "Contemporary Philosophers" at EA, where she compiled the translation programs and edited herself some key figures of Western philosophy, including [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jean-Francois Lyotard]], [[Richard Rorty]] a. o. In addition to her Phenomenology courses at Sofia University, she set up in 1995 a seminar and invited lecturer program on "Phenomenology and Post-Phenomenology" of the Institute of Philosophy, and organized in 2004 the first International Conference on Phenomenology and Hermeneutics at Goethe Institut – Sofia.

'''Post-personalism, phenomenology, and comparative hermeneutics'''

Since the beginning of her career, Raynova used the methods of comparative hermeneutics in combination with a new methodological and critical approach that she launched under the neologism of "post-personalism." This perspective was elaborated in her first monograph ''From existential philosophy to post-personalism'' (1992) in the context of a detailed hermeneutic comparison of French personalism and existential philosophy. She explores in this book the question if [[Personalism]] is a form of [[Existentialism]], as claimed [[Emmanuel Mounier]], or, on the contrary, if existential philosophy is a variant of personalism, as asserted Jean Lacroix and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]. By the means of an analysis of their common topics Raynova shows their specific methodological differences and issues, hence she offers more exact definitions of both currents as well as a new methodology enabling clearer distinctions between the different contemporary philosophical schools.

Trying to overcome some dilemmas of contemporary philosophy, she propounds in conclusion "post-personalism" as a complex methodological alternative based on the following principles: the deconstruction of the conceptions of the personal existence and impersonal being reinterpreted in direction of the ''Urgrund'' as a supra-personal ground of being; the existence of a plurality of monadic centers; the personal evolution as a transformation through the free choice of a continuous conversion, i.e. a profound transformation of values and moral attitudes. This methodology is applied in her next book ''From Husserl to Ricoeur'' (1993). By retracing the different stages of Husserl's work, which passes from the project of the elaboration of "philosophy as science" (egology) to philosophy as a "general science of mind" (science of the life world), Raynova recovers the critical receptions of this projects in the post-husserlian thought and analyses the major transformations of the phenomenological approach to human being - the philosophical anthropology, the phenomenology of life, the fundamental ontology, the existential philosophy, neo-thomism and neo-Protestant phenomenology, French personalism, and hermeneutic phenomenology. Thus she shows how the transfigurations of the phenomenological approach passes from the conception of ''human being'' as a philosophical object to the conception of ''being'' (where ''Dasein'' is the "privileged" being) as a fundamental question of philosophy, ending in multiple rivalizing interpretations of subjectivity and unveiling the limits of phenomenology.

As a possible overcome of this situation Raynova suggests a post-personalist deconstruction of the life world which deconstructs it not as subjectivity but as a center and as a starting point of philosophy. Some of these subjects has been subsequently discussed in interviews with eminent philosophers, published in her book ''Philosophy at the End of the 20th century'' (1995), and were later scrutinized in the context of the social and political implications of the phenomenological movement in her book ''Être et être libre: deux passions des philosophes phénoménologiques'' (2010). The post-personalist critical methodology was implemented also in her monograph ''Jean-Paul Sartre, the philosopher without God'' (1995) where she proposes a reinterpretation of Sartre's philosophical evolution by revisiting the axiological effects of his radical rejection of the hypothesis about God. The question about God and hence the questions if phenomenology can be elaborated as religious philosophy or only as a hermeneutic philosophy of religion are at the core of Raynova's discussions with Paul Ricoeur in ''Between the Said and the Unsaid'' (2009). Since 2000 Ricoeur's philosophy became the main subject-matter of her writings where she argues, in contrast to the mainstream interpretations, that there are some important differences in the perspectives of Ricoeur's early phenomenology and his later philosophical works.

==Honors and awards==
In 1983 Raynova became the First Prize in the National Philosophy Competition from the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and the Council of Higher Education. She was granted in 1996 the Paul Celan Fellowship at the [[Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen]] in Vienna. In 1997 she has been [[Visiting Scholar]] at [[Vienna University]] and from 1998 to 1999 Visiting Fellow at the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]]. For her translations of Jean-Paul Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and Paul Ricoeur's ''The Conflict of Interpretations'' she was awarded the Bulgarian Union of Translators and the National Publishing Center's Translation Award in the field of Humanities.
