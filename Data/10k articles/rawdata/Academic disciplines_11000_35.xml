In [[ecology]], the theory of '''alternative stable states''' (sometimes termed '''alternate stable states''' or '''alternative stable equilibria''') predicts that [[ecosystems]] can exist under multiple "states" (sets of unique biotic and abiotic conditions). These alternative states are non-transitory and therefore considered stable over ecologically-relevant timescales. Ecosystems may transition from one stable state to another, in what is known as a state shift (sometimes termed a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] or [[regime shift]]), when [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbed]]. Due to ecological feedbacks, ecosystems display resistance to state shifts and therefore tend to remain in one state unless perturbations are large enough. Multiple states may persist under equal environmental conditions, a phenomenon known as [[hysteresis]]. '''Alternative stable state''' theory suggests that discrete states are separated by [[ecological threshold]]s, in contrast to ecosystems which change smoothly and continuously along an [[environmental gradient]].

== Theory ==

Alternative stable state theory was first proposed by [[Richard Lewontin]] (1969), but other early key authors include [[C. S. Holling|Holling]] (1973), Sutherland (1974), [[R. M. May|May]] (1977), and [[Marten Scheffer|Scheffer]] et al. (2001). In the broadest sense, alternative stable state theory proposes that a change in ecosystem conditions can result in an abrupt shift in the state of the ecosystem, such as a change in population (Barange, M. et al. 2008) or community composition. Ecosystems can persist in states that are considered stable (i.e., can exist for relatively long periods of time). Intermediate states are considered unstable and are, therefore, transitory. Because ecosystems are resistant to state shifts, significant perturbations are usually required to overcome ecological thresholds and cause shifts from one stable state to another. The resistance to state shifts is known as "[[ecological resilience|resilience]]" (Holling 1973).

State shifts are often illustrated heuristically by the ball-in-cup model (Holling, C.S. et al., 1995) Biodiversity in the functioning of ecosystems: an ecological synthesis. In Biodiversity Loss, Ecological and Economical Issues (Perrings, C.A. et al., eds), pp.&amp;nbsp;44–83, Cambridge University Press). A ball, representing the ecosystem, exists on a surface where any point along the surface represents a possible state. In the simplest model, the landscape consists of two valleys separated by a hill. When the ball is in a valley, or a "domain of attraction", it exists in a stable state and must be perturbed to move from this state. In the absence of perturbations, the ball will always roll downhill and therefore will tend to stay in the valley (or stable state). State shifts can be viewed from two different viewpoints, the "community perspective" and the "ecosystem perspective". The ball can only move between stable states in two ways: (1) moving the ball or (2) altering the landscape. The community perspective is analogous to moving the ball, while the ecosystem perspective is analogous to altering the landscape.

These two viewpoints consider the same phenomenon with different mechanisms. The community perspective considers ecosystem variables (which change relatively quickly and are subject to feedbacks from the system), whereas the ecosystem perspective considers ecosystem parameters (which change relatively slowly and operate independently of the system). The community context considers a relatively constant environment in which multiple stable states are accessible to populations or communities. This definition is an extension of stability analysis of populations (e.g., Lewontin 1969; Sutherland 1973) and communities (e.g., Drake 1991; Law and Morton 1993). The ecosystem context focuses on the effect of exogenic "drivers" on communities or ecosystems (e.g., May 1977; Scheffer et al. 2001; Dent et al. 2002). Both definitions are explored within this article.

== Ecological community ==

Ecosystems can shift from one state to another via a significant perturbation directly to [[state variable]]s. State variables are quantities that change quickly (in ecologically-relevant time scales) in response to feedbacks from the system (i.e., they are dependent on system feedbacks), such as [[Population density|population densities]]. This perspective requires that different states can exist simultaneously under equal environmental conditions, since the ball moves only in response to a state variable change.

For example, consider a very simple system with three microbial species. It may be possible for the system to exist under different community structure regimes depending on [[Initial value problem|initial conditions]] (e.g., population densities or spatial arrangement of individuals) (Kerr et al. 2002). Perhaps under certain initial densities or spatial configurations, one species dominates over all others, while under different initial conditions all species can mutually coexist. Because the different species interact, changes in populations affect one another synergistically to determine community structure. Under both states the environmental conditions are identical. Because the states have resilience, following small perturbations (e.g., changes to [[population size]]) the community returns to the same configuration while large perturbations may induce a shift to another configuration.

The community perspective requires the existence of alternative stable states (i.e., more than one valley) before the perturbation, since the landscape is not changing. Because communities have some level of [[Change management|resistance to change]], they will stay in their domain of attraction (or stable state) until the perturbation is large enough to force the system into another state. In the ball-and-cup model, this would be the energy required to push the ball up and over a hill, where it would fall downhill into a different valley.

== Ecosystem ==

It is also possible to cause state shifts in another context, by indirectly affecting [[state variable]]s. This is known as the ecosystem perspective. This perspective requires a change in environmental parameters that affect the behavior of state variables. For example, [[birth rate]], [[Mortality rate|death rate]], migration, and density-dependent predation indirectly alter the ecosystem state by changing population density (a state variable). Ecosystem parameters are quantities that are unresponsive (or respond very slowly) to feedbacks from the system (i.e., they are independent of system feedbacks). The stable state landscape is changed by environmental drivers, which may result in a change in the quantity of stable states and the relationship between states.

By the ecosystem perspective, the landscape of the ecological states is changed, which forces a change in the ecosystem state. Changing the landscape can modify the number, location, and resilience of stable states, as well as the unstable intermediate states. By this view, the topography in the ball-and-cup model is not static, as it is in the community perspective. This is a fundamental difference between the two perspectives.

Although the mechanisms of community and ecosystem perspectives are different, the [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] required for documentation of alternative stable states is the same. In addition, state shifts are often a combination of internal processes and external forces (Scheffer et al. 2001). For example, consider a stream-fed lake in which the pristine state is dominated by benthic vegetation. When upstream construction releases soils into the stream, the system becomes turbid. As a result, benthic vegetation cannot receive light and decline, increasing nutrient availability and allowing [[phytoplankton]] to dominate. In this state shift scenario the state variables changing are the populations of benthic vegetation and phytoplankton, and the ecosystem parameters are turbidity and nutrient levels. So, whether identifying mechanisms of variables or parameters is a matter of formulation (Beisner et al. 2003).

== Hysteresis effects ==

[[Hysteresis]] is an important concept in alternative stable state theory. In this ecological context, hysteresis refers to the existence of different stable states under the same variables or parameters. Hysteresis can be explained by "path-dependency", in which the [[equilibrium point]] for the trajectory of "A → B" is different from for "B → A". In other words, it matters which way the ball is moving across the landscape. Some ecologists (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001) argue that hysteresis is a prerequisite for the existence of alternative stable states. Others (e.g., Beisner et al. 2003) claim that this is not so; although shifts often involve hysteresis, a system can show alternative stable states yet have equal paths for "A → B" and "B → A".

Hysteresis can occur via changes to variables or parameters. When variables are changed the ball is pushed from one domain of attraction to another, yet the same push from the other direction cannot return the ball to the original domain of attraction. When parameters are changed a modification to the landscape results in a state shift, but reversing the modification does not result in a reciprocal shift.

A real-world example of hysteresis is helpful to illustrate the concept. [[Coral reef]] systems can dramatically shift from pristine coral-dominated systems to degraded [[algae]]-dominated systems when populations grazing on algae decline. The 1983 crash of [[sea urchin]] populations in [[Caribbean]] reef systems released algae from top-down ([[herbivory]]) control, allowing them to overgrow corals and resulting in a shift to a [[environmental degradation|degraded]] state. When urchins rebounded, the high (pre-crash) coral cover levels did not return, indicating hysteresis (Mumby et al. 2007).

In some cases, state shifts under hysteresis may be irreversible. For example, tropical [[cloud forest]]s require high moisture levels, provided by clouds that are intercepted by the canopy (via condensation). When [[deforested]], moisture delivery ceases. Therefore, reforestation is often unsuccessful because conditions are too dry to allow the trees to grow (Wilson and Agnew 1992). Even in cases where there is no obvious barrier to recovery, alternative states can be remarkably persistent: an experimental grassland heavily fertilized for 10 years lost much of its biodiversity, and was still in this state 20 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Isbell|first1=Forest|last2=Tilman|first2=David|last3=Polasky|first3=Stephen|last4=Binder|first4=Seth|last5=Hawthorne|first5=Peter|last6=Rejmanek|first6=Marcel|title=Low biodiversity state persists two decades after cessation of nutrient enrichment|journal=Ecology Letters|date=April 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=454–460|doi=10.1111/ele.12066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resilience ==

By their very nature, basins of attraction display [[ecological resilience|resilience]]. Ecosystems are resistant to state shifts – they will only undergo shifts under substantial perturbations – but some states are more resilient than others. In the ball-and-cup model, a valley with steep sides has greater resilience than a shallow valley, since it would take more force to push the ball up the hill and out of the valley.

Resilience can change in stable states when environmental parameters are shifted. Often, humans influence stable states by reducing the resilience of basins of attraction. There are at least three ways in which anthropogenic forces reduce resilience (Folke et al. 2004): (1) Decreasing diversity and [[functional group]]s, often by top-down effects (e.g., overfishing); (2) altering the physico-chemical environment (e.g., [[climate change]], [[pollution]], [[fertilizer|fertilization]]); or (3) modifying disturbance regimes to which organisms are adapted (e.g., [[bottom trawling]], [[coral mining]], etc.). When the resilience is decreased, ecosystems can be pushed into alternative, and often less-desirable, stable states with only minor perturbations. When hysteresis effects are present, the return to a more-desirable state is sometimes impossible or impractical (given management constraints). Shifts to less-desirable states often entail a loss of ecosystem service and function, and have been documented in an array of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments (reviewed in Folke et al. 2004).

== Evidence ==

Most work on alternative stable states has been theoretical, using [[mathematical model]]s and simulations to test ecological hypotheses. Other work has been conducted using empirical evidence from surveying, [[History|historical records]], or comparisons across [[spatial scale]]s. There has been a lack of direct, manipulative experimental tests for alternative stable states. This is especially true for studies outside of controlled laboratory conditions, where state shifts have been documented for cultures of [[microorganism]]s.

Verifying the existence of alternative stable states carries profound implications for [[ecosystem management]]. If stable states exist, gradual changes in [[environmental factor]]s may have little effect on a system until a threshold is reached, at which point a catastrophic state shift may occur. Understanding the nature of these thresholds will help inform the design of monitoring programs, ecosystem restoration, and other management decisions. Managers are particularly interested in the potential of hysteresis, since it may be difficult to recover from a state shift (Beisner et al. 2003). The mechanisms of [[Feedback|feedback loops]] that maintain stable states are important to understand if we hope to effectively manage an ecosystem with alternative stable states.

=== Empirical evidence ===

Empirical evidence for the existence of alternative stable states is vital to advancing the idea beyond theory. Schröder et al. (2005) reviewed the current ecological literature for alternative stable states and found 35 direct experiments, of which only 21 were deemed valid. Of these, 62% (14) showed evidence for and 38% (8) showed no evidence for alternative stable states. However, the Schröder et al. (2005) analysis required evidence of hysteresis, which is not necessarily a prerequisite for alternative stable states. Other authors (e.g., Scheffer et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2004) have had less-stringent requirements for the documentation of alternative stable states.

State shifts via the community perspective have been induced experimentally by the addition or removal of predators, such as in Paine's (1966) work on [[keystone predator]]s (i.e., predators with disproportionate influence on community structure) in the [[intertidal zone]] (although this claim is refuted by Schröder et al. 2005). Also, Beisner et al. (2003) suggest that commercially exploited fish populations can be forced between alternative stable states by [[fishing pressure]] due to [[Allee effect]] that work at very low population sizes. Once a fish population falls below a certain threshold, it will inevitably go extinct when low population densities make replacement of adults impossible due to, for example, the inability to find mates or density-dependent [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. Since populations cannot return from extinction, this is an example of an irreversible state shift.

Although alternative stable state theory is still in its infancy, empirical evidence has been collected from a variety of [[biome]]s:

* [[Sahara|The Sahara]] region, once vegetated, suddenly collapsed into a desert about 5,000 to [[4th millennium BC|6,000 years ago]] due to climate change (Scheffer and Carpenter 2003). Recent alteration of disturbance states via [[Fire fighting|fire suppression]] has caused state shifts in fire-adapted ecosystems of the [[southeastern United States]] (Peterson 2002).
* In the [[northeastern United States]] alternative stable states have been experimentally documented in [[Temperate hardwood forest|hardwood forest]] [[Food chain|food webs]] (Schmitz 2004). Spiders exhibit top-down control on generalist herbivore grasshoppers, causing them to hide in and forage on a competitively dominant plant species. Herbivory on the superior plant competitor reduces dominance, thereby increasing plant diversity. Under experimental removal of spiders, grasshoppers were released from predation and consumed plants without preference for the competitively-superior species. This top competitor outcompeted other species, resulting in lower overall plant diversity. Furthermore, reintroductions of spiders failed to return the system to high plant diversity, indicating ecological thresholds.
* Ponds, lakes, and other small [[Body of water|bodies of water]] are ideal for studying alternative stable states because they are relatively self-contained (Holling 1973). There has been great interest in state shifts in shallow temperate lakes between clear-water and turbid-water states. Nutrient loading can shift clear lakes to turbid systems by causing phytoplankton blooms (Scheffer 1997). Feedbacks maintaining the turbid state include shading out benthic macrophytes, which otherwise stabilize sediments and reduce rapid nutrient cycling. Hysteresis may occur if reductions in nutrient input do not return the clear-water state.
* Alternative stable states have also been shown for freshwater faunal communities. Initial conditions, such as densities of snails, can influence the movement of an ecosystem into one of several alternative stable equilibria (Chase 2003).
* Additionally, alternative stable states have been documented experimentally in coastal [[marine ecosystem]]s. Arctic [[salt marshes]] of [[Hudson Bay]], Manitoba have been shown to shift from a vegetated state to an unvegetated state due to overgrazing by [[snow goose|snow geese]] (Handa et al. 2002). When geese were experimentally removed, recovery of the system only occurred under ideal soil conditions, indicating hysteresis.

'''Aminoacylase 1 deficiency''' is a rare [[inborn error of metabolism]]. To date only 21 cases have been described.&lt;ref name=Ferri2013&gt;Ferri L, Funghini S, Fioravanti A, Biondi E, La Marca G, Guerrini R, Donati M, Morrone A (2013) Aminoacylase I deficiency due to ACY1 mRNA exon skipping.

Am J Hum Genet 78(3):401-409&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

The clinical picture is heterogeneous and includes motor delay, [[seizure]]s, moderate to severe mental retardation, absent speech, growth delay, muscular [[hypotonia]] and [[autism|autistic features]].

==Genetics==

This disorder in inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] fashion.
==Molecular biology==

[[ACY1|Aminoacylase 1]] (ACY1: EC 3.5.14) is a [[zinc]] binding [[enzyme]] which hydrolyzes [[N-acetyl amino acid]]s into the free [[amino acid]] and [[acetic acid]]. Of the N-actyl amino hydrolyzing enzymes, aminoacylase 1 is the most common.

The ACY1 gene is located on the short arm of [[chromosome 3]] (3p21.2).

==Diagnosis==
There is a specific pattern of N-acetyl [[amino acid]] excretion in the urine. The diagnosis can be confirmed by sequencing of the [[ACY1|aminoacylase 1]] gene.
==Treatment==
{{Empty section|date=November 2017}}

==History==

This disorder was first reported in 2005.&lt;ref name=VanCoster2005&gt;Van Coster RN, Gerlo EA, Giardina TG, Engelke UF, Smet JE, De Praeter CM, Meersschaut VA, De Meirleir LJ, Seneca SH, Devreese B, Leroy JG, Herga S, Perrier JP, Wevers RA, Lissens W (2005) Aminoacylase I deficiency: a novel inborn error of metabolism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17974">The '''antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis''' was first proposed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957 as an [[evolution]]ary explanation for [[senescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Williams G.C. | year = 1957 | title = Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 398–411 | doi=10.2307/2406060}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pleiotropy]] is the phenomenon where one [[gene]] controls for more than one phenotypic trait in an organism.&lt;ref name="Cheverud, J 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheverud J | year = 1996 | title = Developmental integration and the evolution of pleiotropy | url = | journal = American Zoology | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 44–50 | doi=10.1093/icb/36.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antagonistic pleiotropy is when one gene controls for more than one trait, where at least one of these traits is beneficial to the organism's fitness and at least one is detrimental to the organism's fitness.&lt;ref name="Elena, S.F 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elena S.F. |author2=Sanjuán R. | year = 2003 | title = Climb every mountain? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5653| pages = 2074–2075 | doi=10.1126/science.1093165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of G.C. William's idea about antagonistic pleiotropy was that if a gene caused both increased reproduction in early life and aging in later life, then senescence would be adaptive in evolution. For example, one study suggests that since [[Folliculogenesis#Depletion of the ovarian reserve|follicular depletion]] in human females causes both more regular cycles in early life and loss of fertility later in life through menopause, it can be selected for by having its early benefits outweigh its late costs.&lt;ref name="Wood et al 2001"&gt;Wood, J.W., K.A. O'Conner, D.J. Holman, E. Bringle, S.H. Barsom, M.A. Grimes. 2001. The evolution of menopause by antagonistic pleiotropy. Center for Demography and Ecology, Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a constraint on perfection ==
Antagonistic pleiotropy is one of the several reasons evolutionary biologists give for organisms never being able to reach perfection through [[natural selection]]. Antagonistically pleiotropic genes are the explanation for [[Life_history_theory#Trade-offs|fitness trade-offs]].&lt;ref name="Elena, S.F 2003" /&gt; This means that genes that are pleiotropic control for some beneficial traits and some detrimental traits; thus, if they happen to persist through natural selection, this will prevent organisms from reaching perfection because if they possess the benefits of the gene, they must also possess the imperfections or faults. An example of this would be female rodents that live in a nest with other females and may end up feeding young that are not theirs due to their intense parental drive.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, J. 2005. Animal Behavior: eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt; This strong parental drive will be selected for, but the organisms will still make the mistake of feeding young that are not theirs and misallocating their resources.

== Benefits and costs ==
Antagonistic pleiotropy has several negative consequences.  It results in delayed [[adaptation]], an altered path of [[evolution]], and reduced adaptation of other traits.&lt;ref name="Otto 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Otto S.P. | year = 2004 | title = Two steps forward, one step back: the pleiotropic effects of favoured alleles | journal = Proc. Biol. Sci. | volume = 271 | issue = 1540| pages = 705–714 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2635 | pmid=15209104 | pmc=1691650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the overall benefit of alleles is cut down significantly (by about half) by pleiotropy. Still, antagonistic pleiotropy has some evolutionary benefits.  In fact, the conservation of genes is directly related to the pleiotropic character of an organism.&lt;ref name="J. Zhang 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=He X. |author2=Zhang J. | year = 2006 | title = Toward a Molecular Understanding of Pleiotropy | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 173 | issue = | pages = 1885–1891 | doi=10.1534/genetics.106.060269| pmc=1569710}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that genes that control for multiple traits, even if the traits have different implications for the organism's fitness, have more staying power in an evolutionary context.

== Role in sexual selection ==

It is generally accepted that the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics persists until the relative costs of survival outweigh the benefits of reproductive success.&lt;ref name=Bolstad&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolstad|first=Geir|first2=Cristophe |last2=Pelabon |first3=Line-K |last3=Larsen |first4=Ian A. |last4=Fleming |first5=Aslaug |last5=Viken |first6=Gunilla |last6=Rosenqvist|title=The Effect of Purging on Sexually Selected Traits through Antagonistic Pleiotropy with Survival|journal=Ecology and Evolution|year=2012|pages=1184–191|doi=10.1002/ece3.246|pmc=3402193|pmid=22833793|volume=2|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the level of [[genes]], this means a trade-off between variation and expression of selected traits. Strong, persistent sexual selection should result in decreased genetic variation for these traits. However, higher levels of variation have been reported in sexually-selected traits compared to non-sexually selected traits.&lt;ref name="Lek Paradox"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pomiankowski|first=A|author2=AP Moller|title=A Resolution of the Lek Paradox|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|year=1995|pages=21–29|doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0054|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/260/1357/21.abstract|volume=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon is especially clear in [[Lek mating|lek]] species, where males confer no immediate advantage to the female. Female choice presumably depends on correlating male displays (secondary sexual characteristics) with overall genetic quality. If such directional sexual selection depletes variation in males, why would female choice continue to exist? Rowe and Houle answer this question (the [[lek paradox]]) using the notion of [[genetic capture]], which couples the sexually-selected traits with the overall condition of the organism. They posit that the genes for secondary sexual characteristics must be pleiotropically linked to condition, a measure of the organism's fitness. In other words, the genetic variation in secondary sexual characteristics is maintained due to variation in the organism's condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=L|author2=D. Houle|title=The Lek Paradox and the Capture of Genetic Variance by Condition Dependent Traits|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|year=1996|pages=1415–1421|doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0207|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/263/1375/1415.abstract|volume=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in disease ==

The survival of many serious genetic disorders in our long evolutionary history has led researchers to reassess the role of antagonistic [[pleiotropy]] in disease. If genetic disorders are defined by the existence of deleterious alleles, then [[natural selection]] acting over evolutionary time would result in a lower frequency of mutations than are currently observed.&lt;ref name=Diseases&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=Ashley|author2=Andrew Q. Nguyen|title=Antagonistic Pleiotropy as a Widespread Mechanism for the Maintenance of Polymorphic Disease Alleles|journal=BMC Medical Genetics|year=2011|doi=10.1186/1471-2350-12-160|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2350/12/160|volume=12|pages=160|pmid=22151998|pmc=3254080}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent article, Carter and Nguyen identify several genetic disorders, arguing that far from being a rare phenomenon, antagonistic pleiotropy might be a fundamental mechanism for the survival of these non-optimal alleles.

In one of these studies, 99 individuals with [[Laron syndrome]] (a rare form of dwarfism) were monitored alongside their non-dwarf kin for a period of ten years. Patients with Laron syndrome possess one of three genotypes for the [[growth hormone receptor]] gene (GHR). Most patients have an A-&gt;G splice site mutation in position 180 in exon 6. Some others possess a nonsense mutation (R43X), while the rest are heterozygous for the two mutations. Laron syndrome patients experienced a lower incidence of cancer mortality and diabetes compared to their non-dwarf kin.&lt;ref name="Laron Syndrome"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guevara-Aguirre|first=J.|first2=P. |last2=Balasubramanian |first3=M. |last3=Guevara-Aguirre |first4=M. |last4=Wei |first5=F. |last5=Madia |first6=C.W. |last6=Chang |first7=D. |last7=Hwang|title=Growth Hormone Receptor Deficiency is Associated with a Major Reduction in Pro-aging Signaling, Cancer, and Diabetes in Humans|journal=Science Translational Medicine|year=2011|pmid=21325617|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001845|pmc=3357623|volume=3|issue=70|pages=70ra13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a role for antagonistic pleiotropy, whereby a deleterious mutation is preserved in a population because it still confers some survival benefit.

Another instance of antagonistic pleiotropy is manifested in [[Huntington's disease]], a rare [[neurodegenerative]] disorder characterized by a high number of CAG repeats within the [[Huntingtin]] gene. The onset of Huntington's is usually observed post-reproductive age and generally involves involuntary muscle spasms, cognitive difficulties and psychiatric problems. Incidentally, the high number of CAG repeats is associated with increased activity of [[p53]], a tumor suppressing protein that participates in [[apoptosis]]. It has been hypothesized that this explains the lower rates of cancer among Huntington's patients. Huntington's disease is also correlated with high [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name=Diseases /&gt;

Additionally, it was found that individuals with a higher pro-inflammatory ratio TNFα/IL-10 had a significantly higher incidence of death due to cardiovascular disease in old age. Yet, it was hypothesized that this genotype was prevalent because higher ratios of TNFα/IL-10 allow individuals to more effectively combat infection during reproductive years.&lt;ref name=Inflammation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Den Biggelaar|first=AH|title=Inflammation underlying cardiovascular mortality is a late consequence of evolutionary programming|journal=
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology|year=2004|doi=10.1096/fj.03-1162fje|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/18/9/1022.short2350/12/160|volume=12|pages=160|pmid=15084512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sickle cell anemia]], [[Beta-thalassemia]], and [[cystic fibrosis]] are some other examples of the role antagonistic pleiotropy may play in genetic disorders.&lt;ref name=Diseases /&gt;

== Ubiquity ==
Although there are so many negative effects related to genes that are antagonistically pleiotropic, it is still present among most forms of life. Indeed, pleiotropy is one of the most common traits possessed by genes overall.&lt;ref name="J. Zhang 2006" /&gt; In addition to that, pleiotropy is under strong [[stabilizing selection]].&lt;ref name="Otto 2004" /&gt; In one experiment with mice and the morphology of the [[mandible]], 1/5 of the loci had effects of pleiotropy for the entire [[mandible]].&lt;ref name="Cheverud, J 1996" /&gt; One other example was in the Russian biologist Dmitry K. Belyaev's study on the domestication of the fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trut L.N. | year = 1996 | title = Early canid domestication: the farm-fox experiment | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 87 | issue = 2| pages = 160 | doi = 10.1511/1999.2.160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Dmitry K. Belyaev's farm-fox experiment, wild foxes were bred for docile behavior alone. After 40 generations, other physiological changes had surfaced including shortened tails, floppy ears, a white star in the forehead, rolled tails, shorter legs. Since the only thing being selected for was behavior, this leads scientists to believe that these secondary characteristics were controlled by the same gene or genes as docile behavior.

== Adaptivity and senescence ==
An antagonistically pleiotropic gene can be selected for if it has beneficial effects in early life while having its negative effects in later life because genes tend to have larger impacts on fitness in an organism's prime than in their old age.&lt;ref name="Wood et al 2001" /&gt; An example of this is [[testosterone]] levels in male humans.  Higher levels of this hormone lead to increased fitness in early life, while causing decreased fitness in later life due to a higher risk for prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gann P.H. |author2=Hennekens C.H. |author3=Ma J. |author4=Longcope C. |author5=Stampfer M.J. | year = 1996 | title = Prospective Study of Sex Hormone Levels and Risk of Prostate Cancer | url = | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 88 | issue = 16| pages = 1118–1126 | doi=10.1093/jnci/88.16.1118 | pmid=8757191}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of antagonistic pleiotropy being an explanation for senescence. Senescence is the act of ageing in individuals; it's the failure over time of the individual's life processes by natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Promislow D.E.L. | year = 2004 | title = Protein networks, pleiotropy and the evolution of senescence | url = | journal = Proc. Biol. Sci. | volume = 271 | issue = 1545| pages = 1225–1234 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2732| pmc = 1691725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams's theory has been the motivation for many of the experimental studies on the reasons for aging in the last 25 years.&lt;ref name="Fox, C.W 2006"&gt;Fox, C.W. and J.B. Wolf. 2006. Evolutionary Genetics: Concepts and Case Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is more than one theory out there for aging. The competing model to explain senescence is Medawar's "[[mutation accumulation]]" hypothesis, saying that "over evolutionary time, late-acting mutations will accumulate at a much faster rate than early-acting mutation. These late-acting mutations will thus lead to declining [[:wikt:viable|viability]] and/or fertility as an organism ages."&lt;ref name="Fox, C.W 2006" /&gt; Medawar's theory is based around the older concept of [[selection shadow]] that had been discussed throughout the early 1900s and led to Medawar's theory after discussions with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-evolution-of-aging-23651151 |title=The Evolution of Aging |last1=Fabian |first1=Daniel |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas |date=2011 |website=[[Scitable]] |publisher=[[Nature Publishing Group]] |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DNA repair and aging ===

A prominent explanation for aging at the molecular level is the [[DNA damage theory of aging]].  It has been proposed that genetic elements that regulate [[DNA repair]] in [[somatic cell]]s may constitute an important example of age-dependent pleiotropic "genes".&lt;ref name=Bernsteinbook&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair. Academic Press, San Diego. {{ISBN|0120928604}}  {{ISBN|978-0120928606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24464418"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vijg J |title=Aging genomes: a necessary evil in the logic of life |journal=BioEssays |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=282–92 |year=2014 |pmid=24464418 |doi=10.1002/bies.201300127 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As pointed out by Vijg,&lt;ref name="pmid24464418" /&gt; [[genome]] repair and maintenance is beneficial early in life by swiftly eliminating [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]] or damaged cells. However, studies of DNA repair in the brain&lt;ref name="pmid7286098"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gensler HL |title=Low level of U.V.-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in postmitotic brain cells of hamsters: possible relevance to aging |journal=Exp.

The reduced expression of DNA repair is presumably part of an evolutionary adaptation for diverting the resources of the cell that were previously used for DNA repair, as well as for replication and cell division, to more essential neuronal and muscular functions.&lt;ref name=Bernsteinbook /&gt;

The harmful effect of this genetically controlled reduction in expression is to allow increased accumulation of DNA damage.  Reduced DNA repair causes increased impairment of transcription and progressive loss of cell and tissue function.  However, these harmful effects of DNA damage are cumulative and most severe in chronologically older individuals whose numbers diminish with time (by causes of death that can be independent of senescence).  As a consequence, the beneficial effects of the genetic elements that control the reduction of DNA repair early in life would predominate.  Thus regulatory genetic elements that reduce expression of DNA repair genes in post-mitotic cells appear to be important examples of the postulated pleiotropic "genes" that are beneficial in youth but deleterious at an older age.&lt;ref name=Bernsteinbook /&gt;

The device, housed in the remains of a {{cvt|34|×|18|×|9|cm|in|adj=on}} wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation works. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others.&lt;ref name=bibliotec/&gt;&lt;ref name=vetenskapens/&gt; The largest gear is approximately {{convert|14|cm|in}} in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt;

It is a complex [[clockwork]] mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears. A team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at [[Cardiff University]] used modern computer [[x-ray]] [[tomography]] and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine.

Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests that it had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the moon and the sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and even to model the [[Lunar month#Anomalistic month|irregular orbit of the moon]], where the moon’s velocity is higher in its [[Apsis|perigee than in its apogee]]. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of [[Rhodes]], and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.&lt;ref name=sample-06/&gt;

The knowledge of this technology was lost at some point in [[Late Antiquity|antiquity]], and technological works approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the development of mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s in Europe in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=marchant-06 /&gt; All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are kept at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions/replicas of how the mechanism may have looked and worked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/museum "The Antikythera Mechanism at the National Archaeological Museum"].

{{see also|Antikythera wreck}}

===Discovery===
[[File:DerekdeSollaPrice.jpg|thumb|[[Derek J. de Solla Price]] (1922–1983) with a model of the Antikythera mechanism]]
The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved from {{convert|45|m}} of water in the [[Antikythera wreck|Antikythera shipwreck]] off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of [[Antikythera]] in 1901, most probably in July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/history|title=History - Antikythera Mechanism Research Project|website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck had been found in April 1900 by a group of Greek [[Sponge diving|sponge divers]] who retrieved numerous large arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;facts, including bronze and marble statues,  pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism.  All were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. The mechanism was merely a lump of corroded bronze and wood at the time and went unnoticed for two years, while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious statues.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt;

On 17 May 1902, [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Valerios Stais]] found that one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be [[wikt:prochronistic|prochronistic]], too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered. Investigations into the object were dropped until British science historian and Yale University professor [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] became interested in it in 1951.&lt;ref name=haughton2006/&gt; In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and [[Gamma camera|gamma-ray images]] of the 82 fragments. Price published an extensive 70-page paper on their findings in 1974.&lt;ref name=marchant-06 /&gt;

It is not known how the mechanism came to be on the cargo ship, but it has been suggested that it was being taken from [[Rhodes]] to [[Rome]], together with other looted treasure, to support a [[Roman triumph|triumphal parade]] being staged by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name=iol/&gt;

Two other searches for items at the Antikythera wreck site in 2012 and 2015 have yielded a number of fascinating art objects and a second ship which may or may not be connected with the treasure ship on which the Mechanism was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Missing Piece of Antikythera Mechanism Found on Aegean Seabed| url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-missing-piece-of-antikythera-mechanism-found-on-aegean-seabed-1.6640779| publisher=Haaretz| date=16 November 2018| accessdate=15 November 2018&lt;!--yes, dates are correct--&gt;| first=Philippe| last=Bohstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also found was a bronze disk, with the image of a bull embellished on it.  The disk has four "ears" which have holes in them, and it was thought by some that it may have been part of the Antikythera Mechanism itself, as a "[[gear|cog wheel]]".  However, there appears to be little evidence that it was part of the Mechanism; it is more likely that the disk was a bronze decoration on a piece of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| publisher=Smithsonian Magazine| title=No, Archaeologists Probably Did Not Find a New Piece of the Antikythera Mechanism| url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/no-archaeologists-probably-did-not-find-new-piece-antikythera-mechanism-180970821/| first=Jason| last=Daley| date=15 November 2018|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known [[analogue computer]].&lt;ref name=angelakis2006/&gt; The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=allen-07/&gt; Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt; or the early first century BC&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017) 129–203.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1974, Derek de Solla Price concluded from gear settings and inscriptions on the mechanism's faces that it was made about 87 BC and lost only a few years later.&lt;ref name=price-74/&gt; [[Jacques Cousteau]] and associates visited the wreck in 1976 and recovered coins dated between 76 and 67 BC.&lt;ref name=lazos-94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/history/people/jacques-yves-cousteau|title=Jacques-Yves Cousteau – Antikythera Mechanism Research Project|website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism's advanced state of corrosion has made it impossible to perform an accurate [[Metallurgical assay|compositional analysis]], but it is believed that the device was made of a low-tin [[bronze]] alloy (of approximately 95% copper, 5% tin).&lt;ref name=amrp-07/&gt; Its instructions were composed in [[Koine Greek]].&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

In 2008, continued research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested that the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], since they identified the calendar on the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] Spiral as coming from Corinth or one of its colonies in Northwest Greece or Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Freeth, Tony; Jones, Alexander; Steele, John M.; Bitsakis, Yanis (31 July 2008). "Calendars with Olympiad display and eclipse prediction on the Antikythera Mechanism"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was a colony of Corinth and the home of [[Archimedes]], and the Antikythera Mechanism Research project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; However, it has recently been demonstrated that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is indeed of the Corinthian type but cannot be that of Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017): 134–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device's construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of [[Pergamon]],&lt;ref name="Freeth_SA" /&gt; home of the [[Library of Pergamum]]. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the [[Library of Alexandria]] during the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Article "Pergamum", ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th Edition, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship carrying the device also contained vases in the [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] style, leading to a hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]] on that Greek island.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Derek de Solla (1974). "Gears from the Greeks. The Antikythera Mechanism: A Calendar Computer from ca. 80 B.C.". Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series. 64 (7): 13; 57–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes was a busy trading port in antiquity and a centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer [[Hipparchus]] who was active from about 140 BC to 120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus's theory for the motion of the moon, which suggests the possibility that he may have designed it or at least worked on it.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt; In addition, it has recently been argued that the astronomical events on the [[Parapegma]] of the Antikythera Mechanism work best for latitudes in the range of 33.3–37.0 degrees north;&lt;ref&gt;Yannis Bitsakis and Alexander Jones, "The Inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism 3: The Front Dial and Parapegma Inscriptions", ''Almagest'' 7 (2016), pp. 117–119. See also Magdalini Anastasiou et al., "The Astronomical Events of the Parapegma of the Antikythera Mechanism", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' 44 (2013): 173–186.&lt;/ref&gt; the island of Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.85 and 36.50 degrees north.

In 2014, a study by Carman and Evans argued for a new dating of approximately 200 BC based on identifying the start-up date on the [[Saros Dial]] as the astronomical lunar month that began shortly after the new moon of 28 April 205 BC.&lt;ref name="Carman Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141124-JM"/&gt; Moreover, according to Carman and Evans, the Babylonian arithmetic style of prediction fits much better with the device's predictive models than the traditional Greek trigonometric style.&lt;ref name="Carman Evans" /&gt; A study by Paul Iversen published in 2017 reasons that the prototype for the device was indeed from Rhodes, but that this particular model was modified for a client from Epirus in northwestern Greece, and was probably constructed within a generation of the shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017) 129–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dives were undertaken in 2014, with plans to continue in 2015, in the hope of discovering more of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=NYT-20141124-JM /&gt;

==Description==
The original mechanism apparently came out of the Mediterranean as a single encrusted piece. Soon afterward it fractured into three major pieces. Other small pieces have broken off in the interim from cleaning and handling,&lt;ref name=marchant-06-01&gt;{{cite book| first=Jo| last=Marchant| title=Decoding the Heavens| publisher=Da Capo Press| date=2006| page=180}} mechanical engineer and former curator of London's [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] [[Michael Wright (engineer)|Michael Wright]] tells of a piece breaking off in his inspection, which was glued back into place by the museum staff.&lt;/ref&gt; and still others were found on the sea floor by the Cousteau expedition. Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F came to light in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=wright-07/&gt;

!Notes
|- align=center
| A ||180&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;150 ||369.1 ||27 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" | The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&amp;nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.

Fragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions.
|- align=center
| B ||125&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;60 ||99.4 ||1 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train.
|- align=center
| C ||120&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;110 ||63.8 ||1 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions. This fragment also contains the moon indicator dial assembly including the moon phase sphere in its housing and a single bevel gear (ma1) used in the moon phase indication system.
|- align=center
| D ||45&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;35 ||15.0 ||1 ||
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains at least one unknown gear and according to [[Michael T. Wright]] possibly two. Their purpose and position has not been ascertained to any accuracy or consensus, but lends to the debate for the possible planet displays on the face of the mechanism.

===Minor fragments===
Many of the smaller fragments that have been found contain nothing of apparent value; however, a few have some inscriptions on them. Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading "...&amp;nbsp;76 years&amp;nbsp;..." which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;fact's known mechanism]]

Information on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.&lt;ref name="freeth-06" /&gt;

===Operation===
On the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].&lt;ref name=freeth-09/&gt;

The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a "follower" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Faces===
[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]

====Front face====
The front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.

The position of the sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.

The following three [[Egyptian calendar#Months|Egyptian months]] are inscribed in [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jones |first=Alexander |title=A Portable Cosmos |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT97 97] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ΠΑΧΩΝ ([[Pachon]])
* ΠΑΥΝΙ ([[Payni]])
* ΕΠΙΦΙ ([[Epiphi]])

The other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the 5 days of the Egyptian intercalary month. The [[Zodiac]] dial contains Greek inscriptions of the members of the zodiac, which is believed to be adapted to the [[tropical month]] version rather than the [[Sidereal month|sidereal]]:&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|8}}{{Failed verification|reason=This page mentions neither tropical nor sidereal|date=September 2016}}

They are keyed to a ''[[parapegma]]'', a precursor of the modern day [[almanac]] inscribed on the front face above and beneath the dials. They mark the locations of longitudes on the ecliptic for specific stars. The ''parapegma'' above the dials reads (square brackets indicate inferred text):

At least two pointers indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the moon, and a mean sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The moon position was not a simple mean moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].

It also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88 year cycle. The mean sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the moon correct,&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a "true sun" pointer in addition to the mean sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the sun (the orbit of Earth around the sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt; Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.

Finally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.&lt;ref name=wright-05 /&gt; The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the sun and moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.

====Rear face====
[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]
In July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.&lt;ref name=wilford-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=connor-08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),&lt;ref name="Paul Iversen 2017"/&gt; the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|11}}

The Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the [[Hellenic calendars#Corinthian|Corinthian month names]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freeth | first1 = T | year = 2009 | title = Decoding an Ancient Computer | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 301 | issue = 6| pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1209-76 | pmid=20058643|bibcode = 2009SciAm.301f..76F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.

Based on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 165-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. The [[Callippic cycle]] is four Metonic cycles, and so this dial indicates the current Metonic cycle in the overall Callippic cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Games dial is the right secondary upper dial; it is the only pointer on the instrument that travels in a counter-clockwise direction as time advances. The dial is divided into four sectors, each of which is inscribed with a year indicator and the name of two [[Panhellenic Games]]: the "crown" games of [[Isthmian Games|Isthmia]], [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympia]], [[Nemean Games|Nemea]], and [[Pythian Games|Pythia]]; and two lesser games: Naa (held at [[Dodona]]),&lt;ref name=bbc-08/&gt; and the sixth and final set of Games recently deciphered as the Halieia of Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 141-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions on each one of the four divisions are:&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;

The Saros dial is the main lower spiral dial on the rear of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|4–5, 10}} The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] cycle is 18 years and {{frac|11|1|3}} days long (6585.333… days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&amp;nbsp;— not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:
* Σ = ΣΕΛΗΝΗ (Moon)
* Η = ΗΛΙΟΣ (Sun)
* H\M = ΗΜΕΡΑΣ (of the day)
* ω\ρ = ωρα (hour)
* N\Y = ΝΥΚΤΟΣ (of the night)

The glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour; obviously, solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]]. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carman, Christián C.; Evans, James (15 November 2014). "On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor". Archive for History of Exact Sciences. 68 (6): 693–774.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exeligmos Dial is the secondary lower dial on the rear of the mechanism. The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|10}}
* Blank or o ? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed)
* H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display
* Iϛ (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display

Thus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.

===Doors===
The mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt; The back door appears to be the "instruction manual". On one of its fragments is written "76 years, 19 years" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is "223" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written "on the spiral subdivisions 235" referring to the Metonic dial.

===Gearing===
The mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.&lt;ref name=freeth-09/&gt;

There is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for—with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the solar system; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.

Ptolemy's epicyclic solar system (still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism), carried forward with more epicycles, was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus, until Kepler introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.&lt;ref name=amrp-07-2/&gt;

Evans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.&lt;ref name="freeth-12"/&gt; Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|8}}

A table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios. The gears marked with an asterisk (*) are missing, or have predecessors missing, from the known mechanism; these gears have been calculated with reasonable gear teeth counts.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt;

There are several gear ratios for each planet that result in close matches to the correct values for synodic periods of the planets and the sun. The ones chosen above seem to provide good accuracy with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears that may have been used are, and probably will remain, unknown.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

It is very probable that there were planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).
'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, "true sun" pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

The system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]]. The moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean sun pointer or a hypothetical true sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the moon, but is also geared to the sun&amp;nbsp;— the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the sun and moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.  It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly 4 years, as expected.

'''The [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer.

'''The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Exeligmos]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

Apparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

====Proposed gear schemes====
Because of the large space between the mean sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.

'''Michael Wright''' was the first person to design and build a model with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the "first anomaly"). He included pointers for this "true sun", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known "mean sun" (current time) and lunar pointers.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt; Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

Their proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

In a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.&lt;ref name=cte-12/&gt;

'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]

The system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean sun wheel turns.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The inferior planet mechanism includes the sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The superior planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.

In total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, 7 gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

On the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon. And let the Sun be golden, the Moon silver, Kronos [Saturn] of obsidian, Ares [Mars] of reddish onyx, Aphrodite [Venus] lapis lazuli veined with gold, Hermes [Mercury] turquoise; let Zeus [Jupiter] be of (whitish?) stone, crystalline (?)...&lt;ref name=papyrus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Accuracy===
Investigations by Freeth and Jones reveal that their simulated mechanism is not particularly accurate, the Mars pointer being up to 38° off at times. This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD and then the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world—but it didn’t really work very well!&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy. Freeth and Jones note that the inevitable "looseness" in the mechanism due to the hand-built gears, with their triangular teeth and the frictions between gears, and in bearing surfaces, probably would have swamped the finer solar and lunar correction mechanisms built into it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the engineering was remarkable for its era, recent research indicates that its design conception exceeded the engineering precision of its manufacture by a wide margin—with considerable cumulative inaccuracies in the gear trains, which would have cancelled out many of the subtle anomalies built into its design.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/46026/|title=An Initial Assessment of the Accuracy of the Gear Trains in the Antikythera Mechanism|last=Geoffrey|first=Edmunds, Michael|date=1 August 2011|website=orca.cf.ac.uk|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the device itself may have struggled with inaccuracies due to the triangular teeth being hand made, the calculations used and the technology implemented to create the elliptical paths of the planets and retrograde motion of the moon and Mars by using a clockwork-type gear train with the addition of a pin-and-slot mechanism predated that of the first known clocks found in [[Late antiquity|antiquity]] in Medieval Europe by more than 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchant|first1=Jo|title=Decoding the Heavens|date=2009|publisher=First Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81742-7|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes' development of the approximate value of pi and his theory of centres of gravity along with the steps he made towards developing the calculus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Netz &amp; Noel|first1=Reviel &amp; William|title=The Archimedes Codex|date=2007|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81580-5|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; all suggest that the Greeks had access to more than enough mathematical knowledge beyond that of just Babylonian algebra in order to be able to model the elliptical nature of planetary motion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of special delight to physicists, the Moon mechanism uses a special train of bronze gears, two of them linked with a slightly offset axis, to indicate the position and phase of the moon. As is known today from [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion]], the moon travels at different speeds as it orbits the Earth, and this speed differential is modeled by the Antikythera Mechanism, even though the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] were not aware of the actual elliptical shape of the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickover|first1=Clifford|title=The Physics Book|date=2011|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-7861-2|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Similar devices in ancient literature==

[[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'', a 1st-century BC philosophical dialogue, mentions two machines that some modern authors consider as some kind of [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]], predicting the movements of the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the five planets known at that time. They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was offered to the temple of Virtus). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a "learned explanation" and a working demonstration of the device.

{{quote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.

When Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&amp;nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]&lt;ref name=cicero/&gt;}}

[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.&lt;ref name=rorres-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=fildes-10/&gt; The surviving texts from the [[Library of Alexandria]] describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).&lt;ref name=needham/&gt; The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.&lt;ref name=sleeswyk-81/&gt; Whether this is an example of a device created by Archimedes and described by texts lost in the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]], or if it is a device based on his discoveries, or if it has anything to do with him at all, is debatable.

If Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.

Cicero also said that another such device was built "recently" by his friend [[Posidonius]], "... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=cicero-1/&gt;

It is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.

This evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]]s, where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=charette-06/&gt; Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.&lt;ref name=madison-85/&gt; In the Islamic world, [[Banū Mūsā]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]]. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist [[al-Biruni]] around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century [[astrolabe]] also contains a similar clockwork device.&lt;ref name=madison-85/&gt; It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt;

== Popular culture ==
As of 2012, the Antikythera mechanism was now displayed as part of a temporary exhibition about the Antikythera Shipwreck,&lt;ref name=amrp-12/&gt; accompanied by reconstructions made by [[Ioannis Theofanidis]], [[Derek J. de Solla Price|Derek de Solla Price]], Michael Wright, the Thessaloniki University and Dionysios Kriaris.

The National Geographic documentary series ''[[Naked Science]]'' had an episode dedicated to the Antikythera Mechanism entitled "Star Clock BC" that aired on 20 January 2011.&lt;ref name=imdb/&gt; A documentary, ''The World's First Computer'', was produced in 2012 by the Antikythera mechanism researcher and film-maker Tony Freeth.&lt;ref name=amrp-movie/&gt; In 2012 [[BBC Four]] aired ''The Two-Thousand-Year-Old Computer'';&lt;ref name=amrp-movie-bbc/&gt; it was also aired on 3 April 2013 in the United States on [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]], the [[PBS]] science series, under the name ''Ancient Computer''.&lt;ref name=amrp-movie-nova/&gt; It documents the discovery and 2005 investigation of the mechanism by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project.

A fictionalised version of the device was a central plot point in the film ''[[Stonehenge Apocalypse]]'' (2010), where it was used as the artefact that saved the world from impending doom.&lt;!--IMDB is not considered a reliable source and should only appear in the External Links section of an article.

      <comment>The statement that reaction rate doubles for every 10 degree rise in Celsius is a myth. This is easily observed if one actually works through the math. Also, activation energy plays a large role in this as well.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13262">The '''Arrhenius equation''' is a formula for the temperature dependence of [[reaction rate]]s. The equation was proposed by [[Svante Arrhenius]] in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] who had noted in 1884 that [[Van 't Hoff equation|Van 't Hoff's equation]] for the temperature dependence of [[equilibrium constant]]s suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation  of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula.&lt;ref name="Arrhenius96"&gt;{{cite journal|first = S.A.|last = Arrhenius|title = Über die Dissociationswärme und den Einfluß der Temperatur auf den Dissociationsgrad der Elektrolyte|journal = [[Z. Phys. Chem.]]|volume = 4|pages = 96–116|year = 1889|doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arrhenius226"&gt;{{cite journal|first = S.A.|last = Arrhenius|title = Über die Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit bei der Inversion von Rohrzucker durch Säuren|journal = [[ibid.]]|volume = 4|pages = 226–248|year = 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Laidler42"&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler, K. J.]] (1987) ''Chemical Kinetics'', Third Edition, Harper &amp; Row, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is best seen as an [[empirical]] relationship.&lt;ref name="Connors"&gt;Kenneth Connors, Chemical Kinetics, 1990, VCH Publishers {{Google books|nHux3YED1HsC|Chemical Kinetics: The Study of Reaction Rates in Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|188}} It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processes/reactions.  The [[Eyring equation]], developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy.

==Equation==
[[File:NO2 Arrhenius k against T.svg|thumb|In almost all practical cases, &lt;math&gt;E_a &gt;&gt; RT&lt;/math&gt; and k increases rapidly with T.]]
[[File:KineticConstant.png|thumb|Mathematically, at very high temperatures so that &lt;math&gt;E_a &lt;&lt; RT&lt;/math&gt;, k levels off and approaches A as a limit, but this case does not occur under practical conditions.]]
Arrhenius' equation gives the dependence of the [[rate constant]] of a chemical reaction on the [[absolute temperature]], a [[pre-exponential factor]] and other constants of the reaction.
:&lt;math&gt;k = Ae^\frac{-E_a}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;
Where
*{{mvar|k}} is the [[rate constant]]
*{{mvar|T}} is the [[absolute temperature]] (in [[kelvin]])
*{{mvar|A}} is the [[pre-exponential factor]], a constant for each chemical reaction. According to [[collision theory]], A is the frequency of collisions in the correct orientation
*{{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[activation energy]] for the reaction (in the same units as R*T)
*{{mvar|R}} is the [[universal gas constant]]:&lt;ref name="Arrhenius96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arrhenius226"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Laidler42"/&gt;

Alternatively, the equation may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;k = Ae^\frac{-E_a}{k_BT}&lt;/math&gt;
Where
*{{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[activation energy]] for the reaction (in the same units as k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;*T)
*{{mvar|k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]]

The only difference is the energy units of {{mvar|E&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}: the former form uses energy per [[mole (unit)|mole]], which is common in chemistry, while the latter form uses energy  per [[molecule]] directly, which is common in physics.
The different units are accounted for in using either the  [[gas constant]], {{mvar|R}}, or the [[Boltzmann constant]], {{mvar|k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as the multiplier of temperature {{mvar|T}}.

The units of the pre-exponential factor {{mvar|A}} are identical to those of the rate constant and will vary depending on the order of the reaction. If the reaction is first order it has the units: [[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and for that reason it is often called the ''[[frequency]] factor'' or ''attempt frequency'' of the reaction. Most simply, {{mvar|k}} is the number of collisions that result in a reaction per second, {{mvar|A}} is the number of collisions (leading to a reaction or not) per second occurring with the proper orientation to react&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberberg|first1=Martin S.|title=Chemistry|date=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=NY|isbn=0--07-111658-3|page=696|edition=fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{{-E_a}/{(RT)}}\ \ \ &lt;/math&gt; is the probability that any given collision will result in a reaction. It can be seen that either increasing the temperature or decreasing the activation energy (for example through the use of [[catalyst]]s) will result in an increase in rate of reaction.

Given the small temperature range of kinetic studies, it is reasonable to approximate the activation energy as being independent of the temperature.  Similarly, under a wide range of practical conditions, the weak temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor is negligible compared to the temperature dependence of the &lt;math&gt;\exp(-E_a/(RT))\ \ &lt;/math&gt; factor; except in the case of "barrierless" [[diffusion]]-limited reactions, in which case the pre-exponential factor is dominant and is directly observable.

==Arrhenius plot==
{{main|Arrhenius plot}}

[[Image:Arrhenius_plot_with_break_in_y-axis_to_show_intercept.svg|thumb|Arrhenius linear plot: ln(k) against 1/T.]]
Taking the [[natural logarithm]] of Arrhenius' equation yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(k)= \ln(A)  - \frac{E_a}{R}\frac{1}{T} &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\ln(k) =  \frac{-E_a}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right) + \ln(A)&lt;/math&gt;

This has the same form as an equation for a straight line:
:&lt;math&gt;y = m x + c&lt;/math&gt;,

where x is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of T.

So, when a reaction has a rate constant that obeys Arrhenius' equation, a plot of ln(''k'') versus ''T''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; gives a straight line, whose gradient and intercept can be used to determine ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A'' . This procedure has become so common in experimental chemical kinetics that practitioners have taken to using it to ''define'' the activation energy for a reaction. That is the activation energy is defined to be (&amp;minus;''R'') times the slope of a plot of ln(''k'') vs. (1/''T''&amp;thinsp;)

:&lt;math&gt;\ E_a \equiv -R \left[ \frac{\partial \ln k}{\partial ~(1/T)} \right]_P &lt;/math&gt;

==Modified Arrhenius' equation==
The modified Arrhenius' equation&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/M03963.html IUPAC Goldbook definition of modified Arrhenius equation]&lt;/ref&gt; makes explicit the temperature dependence of the pre-exponential factor.  The modified equation is usually of the form :

:&lt;math&gt;k = A T^n e^{{-E_a}/{(RT)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The original Arrhenius expression above corresponds to ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 0.  Fitted rate constants typically lie in the range &amp;minus;1&lt;''n''&lt;1.  Theoretical analyses yield various predictions for ''n''.  It has been pointed out that "it is not feasible to establish, on the basis of temperature studies of the rate constant, whether the predicted ''T''&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt; dependence of the pre-exponential factor is observed experimentally."&lt;ref name="Connors"/&gt;{{rp|190}} However, if additional evidence is available, from theory and/or from experiment (such as density dependence), there is no obstacle to incisive tests of the Arrhenius law.

Another common modification is the [[stretched exponential]] form: {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

:&lt;math&gt;k = A \exp \left[-\left(\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)^{\beta}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β'' is a purely dimensionless number of order 1.  This is typically regarded as a purely empirical correction or ''[[fudge factor]]'' to make the model fit the data, but can have theoretical meaning, for example showing the presence of a range of activation energies or in special cases like the Mott [[variable range hopping]].

==Theoretical interpretation of the equation==

===Arrhenius' concept of activation energy===
Arrhenius argued that for reactants to transform into products, they must first acquire a minimum amount of energy, called the activation energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. At an absolute temperature ''T'', the fraction of molecules that have a kinetic energy greater than ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated from [[statistical mechanics]]. The concept of ''activation energy'' explains the exponential nature of the relationship, and in one way or another, it is present in all kinetic theories.

The calculations for reaction rate constants involve an energy averaging over a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] with &lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt;as lower bound and so are often of the type of [[Incomplete gamma function#Special values|incomplete gamma function]]s, which turn out to be proportional to &lt;math&gt;\ e^{\frac{-E_a}{RT}}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Collision theory===
{{main|Collision theory}}
One example comes from the [[collision theory]] of chemical reactions, developed by [[Max Trautz]] and William Lewis in the years 1916-18. In this theory, molecules are supposed to react if they collide with a relative kinetic energy along their lines-of-center that exceeds ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to an expression very similar to the Arrhenius equation.

===Transition state theory===
The [[Eyring equation]], another Arrhenius-like expression, appears in the "[[transition state theory]]" of chemical reactions, formulated by [[Eugene Wigner|Wigner]], [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], [[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]] and [[Meredith Gwynne Evans|Evans]] in the 1930s. This takes various forms, but one of the most common&lt;!-- Citation needed. --&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\ k = \frac{k_BT}{h}e^{-\frac{\Delta G^\ddagger}{RT}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\ddagger&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gibbs free energy|Gibbs energy]] of activation, &lt;math&gt;k_B&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]].

At first sight this looks like an exponential multiplied by a factor that is ''linear'' in temperature. However, free energy is itself a temperature dependent quantity. The free energy of activation is the difference of an enthalpy term and an entropy term multiplied by the absolute temperature. When all of the details are worked out one ends up with an expression that again takes the form of an Arrhenius exponential multiplied by a slowly varying function of ''T''. The precise form of the temperature dependence depends upon the reaction, and can be calculated using formulas from [[statistical mechanics]] involving the partition functions of the reactants and of the activated complex.

===Limitations of the idea of Arrhenius activation energy===
Both the Arrhenius activation energy and the rate constant ''k'' are experimentally determined, and represent macroscopic reaction-specific parameters that are not simply related to threshold energies and the success of individual collisions at the molecular level. Consider a particular collision (an elementary reaction) between molecules A and B. The collision angle, the relative translational energy, the internal (particularly vibrational) energy will all determine the chance that the collision will produce a product molecule AB. Macroscopic measurements of E and ''k'' are the result of many individual collisions with differing collision parameters. To probe reaction rates at molecular level, experiments are conducted under near-collisional conditions and this subject is often called molecular reaction dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raphael David Levine|Levine, R.D.]] (2005) ''Molecular Reaction Dynamics'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There are deviations from the Arrhenius law during the [[glass transition]] in all classes of glass-forming matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Th.|last2=Lunkenheimer|first2=P.|last3=Loidl|first3=A.|title=Cooperativity and the Freezing of Molecular Motion at the Glass Transition|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=2013|volume=111|issue=22|page=225702|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.225702|pmid=24329455|arxiv=1306.4630|bibcode=2013PhRvL.111v5702B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arrhenius law predicts that the motion of the structural units (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) should slow down at a slower rate through the glass transition than is experimentally observed. In other words, the structural units slow down at a faster rate than is predicted by the Arrhenius law. This observation is made reasonable assuming that the units must overcome an energy barrier by means of a thermal activation energy. The thermal energy must be high enough to allow for translational motion of the units which leads to [[viscous flow]] of the material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">The '''Beutelsbach Consensus''' constitutes a kind of minimum standard of [[Civics|civic]]  (''Politische Bildung'') and [[religious education]] (''Religionsunterricht'') in [[Germany]]. It was developed in the frame of a conference at a small town called [[Beutelsbach (Weinstadt)|Beutelsbach]]  to reanimate the exchange of different didactic schools after a period of deep conflicts. Until today Beutelsbach Consensus is of high importance.

==Main clauses==
=== Prohibition against Overwhelming the Pupil===
It is not permissible to catch pupils unprepared or unaware - by whatever means - for the sake of imparting desirable opinions and to hinder them from `forming an independent judgment’. It is precisely at this point that the dividing line runs between political education and indoctrination. Indoctrination is incompatible with the role of a teacher in a democratic society and the universally accepted objective of making pupils capable of [[Freedom of religion in Germany|independent judgment]] (Mündigkeit).

===Treating Controversial Subjects as Controversial===
Matters which are controversial in intellectual and political affairs must also be taught as controversial in educational instruction. This demand is very closely linked with the first point above, for if differing points of view are lost sight of, options suppressed, and alternatives remain undiscussed, then the path to indoctrination is being trodden. We have to ask whether teachers have in fact a corrective role to play. That is, whether they should or should not specially set out such points of view and alternatives which are foreign to the social and political origins of pupils (and other participants in programs of political education).
In affirming this second basic principle, it becomes clear why the personal standpoint of teachers, the intellectual and theoretical views they represent and their political opinions are relatively uninteresting. To repeat an example that has already been given: their understanding of democracy presents no problems, for opinions contrary to theirs are also being taken into account.

===Giving Weight to the Personal Interests of Pupils===
Pupils must be put in a position to analyse a political situation and to assess how their own personal interests are affected as well as to seek means and ways to influence the political situation they have identified according to their personal interests. Such an objective brings a strong emphasis on the acquisition of the necessary operational skills, which is in turn a logical consequence of the first two principles set out above. In this connection the reproach is sometimes made that this is a `return to formalism’, so that teachers do not have to correct the content of their own beliefs. This is not the case since what is involved here is not a search for a maximum consensus, but the search for a minimal consensus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2322">The '''Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia''' is a state-chartered, federally recognized, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, devoted to collecting information about and promoting cultural work related to [[broadcasting]] and communications in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, US, and its metropolitan area, the [[Delaware Valley]]. The group was founded in 1962 as a local chapter of the national Broadcast Pioneers organization, but became an independent organization in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/who.html |title= Who Are We? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization is made up of over 500 members of the broadcast community.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}&lt;!-- what is the "community"? (on-air, editing/production, engineering/hardware, research, third-party ad/media groups, etc) --&gt;   Full Members must have 10 years or more experience in the business while Associate Members need less.

Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia is more often simply referred to as just Broadcast Pioneers.  They run college student career nights on local college campuses and annual symposiums, also for college students.  The symposiums rotate between three [[television]] stations in the Philadelphia market that originate local newscasts.  In a three-year time period, local college students can visit all three.  They also award college scholarships.  In April 2014, they awarded 20 scholarships to local area students.

Broadcast Pioneers also maintains several local broadcasting archives ranging from video to audio to photographs and other historical documents. Their website was awarded "Honorable Mention for Best Info Site" by ''[[Time Magazine]].''

In addition to collecting information and archives, they professionally record interviews with local broadcast legends. These productions are available on YouTube for public access.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/youtube&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philippines]]' '''Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources''' ({{lang-fil|Kawanihan ng mga Pangisdaan at mga Yamang-Tubig}}, abbreviated as '''BFAR'''), is an agency of the [[Politics of the Philippines|Philippine government]] under the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] responsible for the development, improvement, management and conservation of the [[Philippines]]' fisheries and aquatic resources.

==History==
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) started as a small agency in 1901 under the name Bureau of Government Laboratories, Department of Interior of the Philippine Commission. When the Civil Government was established on July 4, 1901, the [[Philippines|Philippine]] Commission proposed the creation of an Office under the Department of Interior to take charge of the conservation, promotion and development of the country's fishery resources. This was not carried out, due to limited funds. The Secretary of the Interior, [[Dean Conant Worcester]], continued to stir interest in the development of fisheries and, finally, in 1907, studies in fisheries began following the arrangement made by the Secretary of Interior for the services of the [[United States Fish Commission]] fisheries research vessel ''[[USS Albatross (1882)|USS Albatross]]'' to work in Philippine waters for 18 months, and the employment of an American fisheries specialist in the Bureau of [[Science]], to take charge of all work pertaining to fisheries.  Considerable advances in the taxonomy of fish in the Philippines and documentation of fishing methods were made by [[Albert William Herre]] who served as the chief fishery officer in the Bureau of Science from 1919 to 1928.

On January 1, 1933, by virtue of General Memorandum Order No. 4 dated December 5, 1932 of the Secretary of [[Agriculture]] and [[Commerce]], the Division of Fisheries and Division of [[Zoology]] of the Bureau of [[Science]] together with the Division of Forest [[Fauna]] and Grazing of the Bureau of [[Forestry]] were fused into one special division known as the Fish and Game Administration, which was placed under the direct administrative jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Under this arrangement, the Fish and Game Administration operated under the provisions of the Fisheries Act (Act No. 4003) and Act No. 2590, entitled "An Act for the Protection of Game and Fish." By subsequent reorganization effected on September 27, 1934, the Fish and Game Administration was returned to the Bureau of Science. The reason for its return was to strengthen the office through the use of equipment, personnel and appropriation of the Bureau.

On July 1, 1941, under the provisions of General Administrative Order No. 15, the Fish and Game Administration was reorganized as an independent unit under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and renamed the Division of Fisheries. The functions pertaining to forest fauna and grazing was returned to the Bureau of Forestry and those of the Division of Zoology to the Bureau of Science.

The Divisions of Fisheries as a special division under the Department of Agriculture and Commerce functioned up to the outbreak of the war in 1941. During the early days of [[World War II]], the Division of Fisheries was fused with the Bureau of Forestry and then known as the Bureau of Forestry and Fishery. In the latter part of Japanese occupation, however, the Division of Fisheries was converted into an independent office known as the Bureau of Fisheries.

Taking cognizance of the increasing importance of effectively administering and conserving fisheries and other aquatic resources and in efforts to rehabilitate the devastated economy brought upon bu World War II, the [[Congress of the Philippines]] enacted [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 177 creating the present Bureau of Fisheries which took effect on July 1, 1947. The Division of Fisheries and all sections, field districts, experimental stations and all activities and agencies of the National Government connected with fishery work have been incorporated in the Bureau of Fisheries.

As organized on July 1, 1947, the Bureau of Fisheries had seven functional divisions, namely, (1) Administrative Division, (2) Division of Fish Culture and Fisheries Biology,(3) Division of Commercial Fisheries, (4) Division of Fisheries Technology, (5) Division of Licenses and Regulations, (6) Division of Investigation and Inspection, and (7) Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology offering a 2½ year course in fisheries on collegiate level. Subsequently, branches of this Institute offering a 4 years secondary course in fisheries were established in the following seven [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]]: [[Samar]], [[Cebu]], [[Albay]], [[Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City]], [[Antique]] and [[Batangas]].

The entire [[Philippines]] was divided into 10 fishery districts with a District Fishery Officer as head of each District. The headquarters of the fishery districts were located in strategic places in the different fishing regions as follows; Fishery District No. 1-Aparri, [[Cagayan]]; 2-[[Dagupan City]], 3-[[Manila]]; 4-[[Naga City, Camarines Sur|Naga City]]; 5-[[Catbalogan, Samar|Catbalogan City, Samar]]; 6-[[Iloilo City]]; 7-[[Coron, Palawan]]; 8-[[Cebu City]]; 9-[[Davao City]] and 10-[[Zamboanga City]].

Under the reorganization Plan No. 30-A reorganizing the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources as implemented by Executive Order No. 216, dated November 17, 1956, the Bureau of Fisheries was reorganized again effective January 16, 1957 such that functional divisions of the Bureau had been reduced from seven to five, namely, (1) Licenses and Regulations Divisions; (2) Marine Fisheries Division; (3) Fisheries Research Division; (4) Inland Fisheries Division; and (5) Administrative Services Division.

[[File:Alaminosjf377.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Alaminos Regional Mariculture Technodemo Center (RMaTDeC) - April 20, 2011]]
The Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology had been transferred to the [[University of the Philippines]]. The seven secondary schools of fisheries in the provinces previously mentioned had been transferred to the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] under the administration of the Bureau of Public Schools. On March 20, 1963, R. A. 3512 reorganized the Bureau into the Philippine Fisheries Commission.  And on September 30, 1972, under the Integrated Reorganization Plan, the Philippine Fisheries Commission was reverted to the Bureau of Fisheries. By virtue of Presidential Decree No. 461 signed on May 17, 1974, which reorganized the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Natural Resources, the Philippine Fisheries Commission was renamed Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources and placed under the Ministry of Natural Resources.

On June 30, 1984, BFAR was transferred from the Ministry of Natural Resources to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, in compliance with Executive Order 967 mandating the conversion of BFAR as a staff Bureau and integrating its Regional Offices with the Regional Offices of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]]. The staff functions of the Central Office and the integration of BFAR's Regional Offices into Regional Offices of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]] was fully implemented with the issuance of Executive Order 116 signed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] on January 30, 1987.

On February 25, 1998 [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed into law [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] No. 8550, entitled, "An Act Providing For the Development, Management and Conservation of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Integrating all laws pertinent thereto and for other purposes", otherwise known as the Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. This law took effect on March 23, 1998.

On January 5, 2008, the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Philippines) (BFAR) announced that a [[fish kill]] at [[Taal Lake]] (January 2 to 4) caused the 50 metric tons or P 3.25-million ($80,000) loss of cultured [[tilapia]] in the [[villages]] of Leviste and Balakilong in [[Laurel, Batangas|Laurel]] and in Barangay Aya and Barangay Quiling in [[Talisay, Batangas|Talisay]]. 6,000 maliputo fishes (P 230,000) also died at Quiling. [[Toxic]] [[sulfur]] and high level of [[hydrogen sulfide]] in Ambulong while low dissolved [[oxygen]] caused the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=110554 Inquirer.net, Taal Lake fish kill causes P3-M losses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117031940/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=110554 |date=2008-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current organization==
After undergoing series of reorganizations, the BFAR today has nine (9) functional divisions: the Fisheries Policy Research and Economics Division, Fishery Resources Administration Division, Fisheries Development and Support Services Division, Aquaculture Division, Fisheries Resources Research Division, EEZ Fisheries and Allied Services Division, Fishing Technology Division, Fisheries Regulation and Quarantine Division, and Post Harvest Technology Division. It also has eight (8) fisheries technology center under its wing: The National Marine Fisheries Development Center, National Brackishwater Aquaculture Technology Research Center, National Freshwater Fisheries Technology Research Center, Tanay Freshwater Experimental Station, Fisheries Biological Station Complex, National Fisheries Research and Development Center, National Seaweeds Technology and Development Center and the Mindanao Freshwater Fisheries Technology Center.

CAF-1 is required for the spatial organization and [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] marking of [[heterochromatin]] domains in pluripotent [[embryon]]ic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | year = 2006 | title = CAF-1 Is Essential for Heterochromatin Organization in Pluripotent Embryonic Cells | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020181 | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e181 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020181 | last1 = Houlard | first1 = Martin | last2 = Berlivet | first2 = Soizik | last3 = Probst | first3 = Aline V. | last4 = Quivy | first4 = Jean-Pierre | last5 = Héry | first5 = Patrick | last6 = Almouzni | first6 = Geneviève | last7 = Gérard | first7 = Matthieu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells resembling 2-cell-stage mouse embryos ([[Cell potency|totipotent]] cells) can be induced in vitro through downregulation of the chromatin-assembly activity of CAF-1 in [[embryonic stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ishiuchi | first1 = T. | last2 = Enriquez-Gasca | first2 = R. | last3 = Mizutani | first3 = E. | last4 = Bošković | first4 = A. | last5 = Ziegler-Birling | first5 = C. | last6 = Rodriguez-Terrones | first6 = D. | last7 = Torres-Padilla | first7 = M.

Optimal modulation of both CAF-1 and [[transcription factor]] levels increases reprogramming efficiency by several orders of magnitude and facilitated [[iPS cell]] formation in as little as 4 days. Mechanistically, CAF-1 suppression led to a more accessible chromatin structure at enhancer elements early during reprogramming. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in somatic heterochromatin domains, increased binding of [[Sox2]] to [[pluripotency]]-specific targets and activation of associated genes. Suppression of CAF-1 also enhance the [[Induced stem cells#Direct transdifferentiation|direct conversion]] of [[B cells]] into [[macrophages]] and [[fibroblast]]s into [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheloufi S, Elling U, Hopfgartner B ''et al'' | year = 2015| title = The histone chaperone CAF-1 safeguards somatic cell identity | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7581/full/nature15749.html| journal = Nature | volume = 528 | issue = 7581| pages = 218–224 | doi = 10.1038/nature15749 | pmid = 26659182| pmc = 4866648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''CSS framework''' is a pre-prepared [[software framework]] that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant [[web design]] using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a [[grid (graphic design)|grid]]. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional [[JavaScript]] based functions, but are mostly design oriented and [[unobtrusive JavaScript|unobtrusive]]. This differentiates these from functional and full [[Comparison of JavaScript frameworks|JavaScript frameworks]].

Two notable and widely used examples are [[Bootstrap (front-end framework)|Bootstrap]] and [[Foundation (framework)|Foundation]].

CSS frameworks offer different modules and tools:

* [[reset style sheet]]
* [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] especially for [[responsive web design]]
* [[web typography]]
* set of [[Icon (computing)|icons]] in [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] or [[icon fonts]]
* styling for [[tooltip]]s, [[Button (computing)#HTML|buttons]], elements of [[Form (HTML)|forms]]
* parts of [[graphical user interface]]s like [[Accordion (GUI)|accordion]], [[Tab (GUI)|tabs]], [[Slide show|slideshow]] or [[modal window]]s ([[Lightbox (JavaScript)|Lightbox]])
* equalizer to create equal height content 
* often used CSS helper classes (''left'', ''hide'')

Bigger frameworks use a CSS interpreter like [[Less (stylesheet language)|Less]] or [[Sass (stylesheet language)|Sass]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5688">'''Certified Sex Therapists''' ('''CST''') have graduate degrees and can demonstrate their competence in [[sex therapy]] by becoming credentialed by the [[American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists]] (AASECT).&lt;ref name=Mayo&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sex-therapy/MY01349 Mayo Clinic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The AASECT certification process was started in the 1970s as a form of quality control—to ensure that clients and patients could receive competent treatment from practitioners who were calling themselves [[sex therapists]].  The first national supervision session was held in 1979 at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expandingsextherapy.com/2011/aasect-certification/   Expanding Sex Therapy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification criteria==
AASECT certified sex therapists are mental health professionals, trained to provide in-depth [[psychotherapy]], who have specialized in treating clients with sexual issues and concerns. They are either licensed, or in the absence of available licensure, certified, registered, or clinical members of a national psychotherapy organization.&lt;ref name=AASECT&gt;AASECT website [http://www.aasect.org AASECT website]&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, AASECT requires that applicants for sex therapist certification be current members of AASECT, have a graduate degree, post-degree clinical experience, liability insurance, and a valid state license to practice [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[social work]], [[counseling]], [[nursing]], or [[marriage and family therapy]].&lt;ref name=AASECT/&gt;

Academic requirements include 90 hours of courses in 15 core areas of [[human sexuality]], and also 60 hours of training in seven specific disciplines related to sex therapy.  Every certified sex therapist must agree to abide by the AASECT [[code of ethics]], which stresses competence and integrity along with moral, ethical, and legal responsibility to safeguard the well-being of clients.  Further, sex therapist certification requires up to 50 hours of direct supervision by a certified sex therapy supervisor — half of these hours can take place in small, pre-approved groups.  For the vast majority of professionals in health care and human services, certification is a prerequisite to practice. AASECT credentials sexual health professionals on the basis of rigorous standards for academic preparation, supervised training and consultation, field-related experience and applied skills.  Field experience and practical application of skills and competencies carried out under trained and approved supervision or consultation are crucial aspects of certification.  Applicants must substantiate completion of certification requirements with academic transcripts and other formal documentation, and must also undergo peer review of their credentials.&lt;ref name=AASECT/&gt;

Using the '''[[PLISSIT model]]''' for Sexual Counseling, sex therapists are trained to perform all four steps ('''P-LI-SS-IT''').&lt;ref&gt;Annon, J. S. (1976). ''Behavioral Treatment of Sexual Problems: Brief Therapy''. Harper &amp; Row. {{ISBN|0-06-140265-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''P-LI-SS-IT model''' for Sexuality Counseling:

* '''Permission (P)''': The practitioner creates a climate of comfort and permission for clients to discuss sexual concerns, often introducing the topic of sexuality, thereby validating sexuality as a legitimate health issue.
* '''Limited Information (LI)''': The practitioner addresses specific sexual concerns and attempts to correct myths and misinformation.
* '''Specific suggestions (SS)''': The practitioner compiles a sexual history or profile of the client:
:# Defining the issues and concerns of the client.
:# Determining the course of how the issues have evolved over time.
:# Facilitating the client's understanding of the main issues and providing options for resolution.
:# Assisting the client in formulating perceptions and ideas about sources of these concerns and developing realistic and appropriate goals and solution plans.
* '''Intensive Therapy (IT)''': The practitioner provides specialized treatment in cases that are complicated by the coexistence of other complex life issues which may also include psychiatric diagnoses such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]), [[personality disorders]], or [[substance abuse]], or by interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict.

==Certified sex therapy treatment==
Certified sex therapists work with simple sexual concerns, but in addition, where appropriate, are prepared to provide comprehensive and intensive psychotherapy over an extended period of time in more complex cases.&lt;ref name=AASECT/&gt; Sex therapy can help resolve various sexual issues, from concerns about sexual function or feelings that affect one’s sex life to the way one relates to a partner. Sex therapy may address:  concerns about sexual desire or arousal, concerns about sexual interests or [[sexual orientation]], [[sex addiction]] or compulsive sexual behavior, [[erectile dysfunction]], [[premature ejaculation]], trouble reaching orgasm ([[anorgasmia]]), painful intercourse ([[dyspareunia]]), intimacy issues related to a disability or chronic condition.&lt;ref name=Mayo/&gt;  Sex therapists tend to have much greater than average knowledge about the physiological processes that are a part of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/guide/sex-therapists WebMD website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circles of Sustainability''' is a method for understanding and assessing [[sustainability]], and for managing projects directed towards socially sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as outlined in [[sustainable development]] debates. The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements.

Circles of Sustainability, and its treatment of the social domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture, provides the empirical dimension of an approach called '[[engaged theory]]'. Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life', using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience, adaptation, security, reconciliation. It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' (with World Vision).

The rationale for this new method is clear. As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli (2012) and Medellin (2014), sustainability assessment is on the global agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672|accessdate=September 9, 2012|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911065400/http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672#|archive-date=11 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more complex the problems, the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Paul James, Andy Scerri, ‘Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach’, Applied Research in the Quality of Life, vol. 7, no. 3., 2012, pp. 239–61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Triple Bottom Line]] approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality. Secondly, the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues. Thirdly, the size, scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation. Fourthly, the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings—corporations and other institutions, cities, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Andy Scerri, Paul James, Lin Padgham, James Thom, Hepu Deng, Sarah Hickmott, and Felicity Cahill, ‘Reframing Sustainability Reporting: Towards an Engaged Approach’, Environment, Development and Sustainability, vol. 15, no. 1, 2013, pp. 225–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Most indicator approaches, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031, have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries. Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations.

==History==
The method began with a fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality. Two concurrent developments provided impetus: a major project in Porto Alegre, and a United Nations’ paper called ''Accounting for Sustainability'', Briefing Paper, No. 1, 2008. The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCarthy, Paul James and Carolines Bayliss, eds, ''Sustainable Cities, Vol. 1'', United Nations Global Compact, Cities Programme, New York and Melbourne, 2010, 134pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee, and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project&lt;ref&gt;‘Semantic Technologies to Help Machines Understand Us: Fuji Xerox leads RMIT to $1.4m Grant for Real-Time Green Reports’, ''IT Business'', 30 October 2009.

Andy Scerri, ‘Ends in View: The capabilities approach in ecological/sustainability economics’, Ecological Economics 77, 2012, pp. 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the ''Green Score City Index''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://greenscore.ca/greenscore-city-index.html |title=GreenScore City Index |work=greenscore.ca |year=2014 |accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by studying the UN circle of sustainability. However, unlike this system, the Canadian index data-sets are focused on measuring the physical footprints of human activity and greenspace footprints which are less subjectivity than cultural and economic&lt;ref&gt;‘Subjectivity in Economics’, ''SSRN'', June 1, 2012. Matthew T. Clements, ‘Abstract: Economics cannot claim to be absolutely objective...’,''St. Edward's University'', &lt;/ref&gt; indicators.

The method is used by a series of global organizations including the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme, The World Association of Major Metropolises,&lt;ref&gt;The methodology was used by Metropolis for Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the ‘Circles of Sustainability’ methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice. (See http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |date=19 August 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Vision]] to support their engagement in cities. It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles (e.g., Hyderabad, Johannesburg, Melbourne, New Delhi, São Paulo and Tehran). It is a method for understanding [[urban politics]] and [[urban planning]], as well as for conducting [[sustainability]] analysis and profiling [[sustainable development]].

===Global Compact Cities Programme===
The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than 80 Signatory Cities. In particular, some of the 14 Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects, some with intensity and others as a background feature. They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porto Alegre, Vila Chocolatão project====

The Vila Chocolatão project refers to the 2011 resettlement of approximately 1,000 residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolatão slum in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil. The resettlement project of Vila Chocolatão commenced in 2000 in response to an imminent eviction of the community, with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown [[participatory budgeting]] system. The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group, the Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network. The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court, TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolatão Residents Association, local government departments, federal agencies, non-government organisations and the corporate sector. The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality’s Local Solidarity Governance Scheme. In 2006, the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement.

This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers, it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums. The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site, Residencial Nova Chocolatão, linked to the garbage-collection process of the city (an example of linking the sub-domains of ‘emission and waste’ and ‘organization and governance’); and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community. The Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement.  This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements.

====Milwaukee, water sustainability project====

In 2009, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America, wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Milwaukee Business Journal'', 29 April 2009; John Schmid, ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project. In the period of the application of the method (2009–present) there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities/americas/usa/milwaukee |title=Milwaukee - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance, as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500,000. The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/ |title=UN Global Compact &amp;#124; Milwaukee Water Council |work=thewatercouncil.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815005612/http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/# |archive-date=15 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolis (World  Association of the Major Metropolises)===
The methodology was first used by Metropolis for ''Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth''. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions |title=Publications / Commissions &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |archive-date=19 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives. The methodology is central to the approach used by the ‘Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative’ organized by Metropolis, 2012–2013 for Indian, Brazilian and Iranian cities. A workshop was held in New Delhi, 26–27 July 2012, and senior planners from New Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans. Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran (in relation to their mega-projects plan) and São Paulo (in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metropolis.org/news/metropolis-initiative-integrated--1 |title=Metropolis Initiative "Integrated Strategic Planning and Public Private Partnerships" meets in New Delhi &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities. A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method.

===''The Economist''===
In 2011, ''The Economist'' invited [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] (Director of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme) and Chetan Vedya (Director, National Institute of Urban Affairs, India) into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth. It led to over 200 letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/192 |title=Economist Debates: Cities |work=economist.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Vision===
In 2011, recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty, [[World Vision]] decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings. Previously 80 per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities. The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India, South Africa, Lebanon, Indonesia and elsewhere, to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings.

==Domains and subdomains==
The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the [[triple bottom line]] that treat economics as if it is outside the social, or that treat the environment as an externality. It uses a four-domain model - economics, ecology, politics and culture. In each of these domains there are 7 subdomains.

===Economics===
The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production, use, and management of resources, where the concept of ‘resources’ is used in the broadest sense of that word.
# Production and resourcing
# Exchange and transfer
# Accounting and regulation
# Consumption and use
# Labour and welfare
# Technology and infrastructure
# Wealth and distribution

===Ecology===
The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms, focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature, but also including the built-environment.
# Materials and energy
# Water and air
# Flora and fauna
# Habitat and settlements
# Built-form and transport
# Embodiment and sustenance
# Emission and waste

===Politics===
The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power, such as organization, authorization, legitimation and regulation. The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general.
# Organization and governance
# Law and justice
# Communication and critique
# Representation and negotiation
# Security and accord
# Dialogue and reconciliation
# Ethics and accountability

===Culture===
The cultural domain is defined as the practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.
# Identity and engagement
# Creativity and recreation
# Memory and projection
# Belief and ideas
# Gender and generations
# Enquiry and learning
# Wellbeing and health

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5294">'''Collostructional analysis''' is a family of [[Corpus-based methods used in construction grammar|methods]] developed by (in alphabetical order) [[Stefan Th. Gries]] (University of California, Santa Barbara) and Anatol Stefanowitsch (Free University of Berlin). Collostructional analysis aims at measuring the degree of attraction or repulsion that words exhibit to [[grammatical construction|constructions]], where the notion of construction has so far been that of [[Adele Goldberg (linguist)|Goldberg]]'s [[construction grammar]].

==Collostructional methods==
Collostructional analysis so far comprises three different methods:

* collexeme analysis, to measure the degree of attraction/repulsion of a lemma to a slot in one particular construction;
* distinctive collexeme analysis, to measure the preference of a lemma to one particular construction over another, functionally similar construction; multiple distinctive collexeme analysis extends this approach to more than two alternative constructions;
* covarying collexeme analysis, to measure the degree of attraction of lemmas in one slot of a construction to lemmas in another slot of the same construction.

==Input frequencies==
Collostructional analysis requires frequencies of words and constructions and is similar to a wide variety of collocation statistics. It differs from raw frequency counts by providing not only observed co-occurrence frequencies of words and constructions, but also

(i) a comparison of the observed frequency to the one expected by chance; thus, collostructional analysis can distinguish attraction and repulsion of words and constructions;

(ii) a measure of the strength of the attraction or repulsion; this is usually the log-transformed [[p-value]] of a [[Fisher's exact test|Fisher-Yates exact test]].

==Versus other collocation statistics==
Collostructional analysis differs from most [[collocation]] statistics such that

(i) it measures not the association of words to words, but of words to syntactic patterns or constructions; thus, it takes syntactic structure more seriously than most collocation-based analyses;

(ii) it has so far only used the most precise statistics, namely the Fisher-Yates exact test based on the [[hypergeometric distribution]]; thus, unlike ''t''-scores, ''z''-scores, [[chi-square test]]s etc., the analysis is not based on, and does not violate, any distributional assumptions.

The '''Congressional Budget Office''' ('''CBO''') is a [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] within the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]] of the [[United States government]] that provides budget and economic information to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Inspired by California's [[California Legislative Analyst's Office|Legislative Analyst's Office]] that manages the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion, the CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. It has earned the reputation of a trusted, in-house quasi-[[think tank]] for the Congress. 

There is a consensus among economists that "the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
The Congressional Budget Office was created by Title II of the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]] (Pub. L. 93-344), which was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on July 12, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Adam Kelsey|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/spicers-rebuke-puts-spotlight-congressional-budget-office-amid/story?id=46017070|title=What the CBO does and how it gets its numbers|date=March 13, 2017|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official operations began on February 24, 1975, with [[Alice Rivlin]] as director.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;Philip Joyce, [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PJ_WorkingPaper9_Feb11_Final.pdf The Congressional Budget Office at Middle Age], Working Paper #9, Hutchins Center on Fiscal &amp; Monetary Policy, [[Brookings Institution]] (February 17, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO's creation stems from a fight between President Richard Nixon and a Democratic-controlled Congress. Congress wanted to protect its [[power of the purse]] from the executive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sarah Binder|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/15/this-is-why-the-congressional-budget-office-will-likely-survive-republican-attacks/|title=This is why the Congressional Budget Office will likely survive Republican attacks|website=Washington Post|date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/13/14860856/congressional-budget-office-cbo-explained|title=The Congressional Budget Office, explained|work=Vox|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO was created "within the legislative branch to bolster Congress’s budgetary understanding and ability to act. Lawmakers' aim was both technical and political: Generate a source of budgetary expertise to aid in writing annual budgets and lessen the legislature’s reliance on the president's [[Office of Management and Budget]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since its creation, the CBO has since supplanted the OMB "as the authoritative source of information on the economy and the budget in the eyes of Congress, the press, and the public."&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt;

==Mission==
The Congressional Budget Office is [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]], and produces "independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/2016-IntroToCBO.pdf|title=Introduction to CBO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation, without issuing any policy recommendations.

With respect to estimating spending for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]] for estimating revenue for Congress, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] for estimating revenues for the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]]. This includes projections on the effect on [[national debt]] and cost estimates for legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/about/overview|title=Introduction to CBO|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Section 202(e) of the Budget Act requires the CBO to submit periodic reports about fiscal policy to the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Senate]] budget committees to provide baseline projections of the federal budget. This is currently done by preparation of an annual ''Economic and Budget Outlook'' plus a mid-year update. The agency also each year issues ''An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals'' for the upcoming fiscal year per a standing request of the [[Senate Committee on Appropriations]]. These three series are designated essential titles distributed to [[Federal depository library|Federal Depository Libraries]] and are available for purchase from the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. The CBO often provides testimony in response to requests from various Congressional committees and issues letters responding to queries made by members of Congress.

==Divisions==
The Congressional Budget Office is divided into eight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staffing and Organization|url=http://www.cbo.gov/about/our-organization-and-people/|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] jointly appoint the CBO Director after considering recommendations from the two budget committees. The term of office is four years, with no limit on the number of terms a director may serve. Either house of Congress, however, may remove the director by resolution. At the expiration of a term of office, the person serving as Director may continue in the position until his or her successor is appointed.

== Reception ==
Whereas politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the CBO when its estimates have been politically inconvenient,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-pol-cbo-report-qa-20170314-story.html|title=What is the CBO, and can you trust its numbers on the Republican healthcare plan?|last=Lee|first=Don|date=2017-03-14|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; economists and other academics overwhelmingly reject that the CBO is partisan or that it fails to produce credible forecasts.

A March 2017 survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the notion that "adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/the-cbo|title=The CBO|publisher=[[Initiative on Global Markets]] (IGM), [[University of Chicago]] [[Booth School of Business]]|language=en-US|date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MIT economist [[David Autor]], the "CBO has a good track record with a very difficult assignment. It errs, but not systematically or with partisan intent."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Yale economist [[Christopher Udry]], "There is no credible evidence of partisan bias."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Economist [[Walter E. Williams]] wrote in 1998 that the CBO was well-regarded for its "honest numbers" on fiscal and economic matters.&lt;ref name="Joyce" /&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "the CBO’s analyses and forecasting are regarded as good or better than others doing similar work... economists say that the CBO’s economic projections generally compare favorably against other outfits, and its long-term budget estimates have been fairly accurate."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder, the CBO "has emerged over its history as a neutral analyst of congressional budgets and cost estimates for proposed legislation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agency has "a nonpartisan staff culture".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, the [[House Budget Committee]] and [[Senate Budget Committee]] have insulated the CBO from external pressures and attempts to politicize or weaken the office.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt; Professor Philip Joyce of the [[University of Maryland School of Public Policy]] writes:

{{quote|This is quite surprising, in a sense, given the partisan nature of the Congress. It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as a positive end in itself, however. Rather, the Budget Committees (and especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one that does not have a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens the Budget Committees, and indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with the executive over budget and economic policy.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt;}}

'''Daylight harvesting''' systems use [[daylight]] to offset the amount of electric [[lighting]] needed to properly light a space, in order to reduce [[energy consumption]].  This is accomplished using [[lighting control system]]s that are able to dim or switch electric lighting in response to changing daylight availability.  The term Daylight Harvesting has become the standard in the fields of [[lighting]], [[sustainable architecture]], and [[active daylighting]] industries.

==System design and components==
Daylight harvesting systems are typically designed to maintain a minimum recommended [[illuminance|light level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoo|first1=Seunghwan|last2=Kim|first2=Jonghun|last3=Jang|first3=Cheol-Yong|last4=Jeong|first4=Hakgeun|title=A sensor-less LED dimming system based on  daylight harvesting with BIPV systems|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/view_article.cfm?gotourl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eopticsinfobase%2Eorg%2FDirectPDFAccess%2FDAB2FFC3-DA91-5E1D-69C013A04919E893_276152%2Foe-22-S1-A132%2Epdf%3Fda%3D1%26id%3D276152%26seq%3D0%26mobile%3Dno&amp;org=|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This light level will vary according to the needs and use of the space; for example, the commonly recommended light level for [[offices]] is 500 [[Lux]] (or around 50 [[footcandles]]) on the desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 | author2 = Newsham, G. R.
 | publisher = ANSI-IESNA
 | year = 2004
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photosensors==
All daylight harvesting systems use a light level sensor, a [[photosensor]], to detect the prevailing light level, [[luminance]] or [[brightness]], in open-loop or closed-loop systems. Photosensors are used to adjust electric lighting based on the available daylight in the space.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/researchAreas/reducingbarriers/photosensorSolutions.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lrc.rpi.edu"&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/PDF/VIEW/SR_Photosensors.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[open-loop controller|open-loop system]], the photosensor detects the amount of available daylight only, and can be positioned on the building's exterior wall or roof, or inside the building facing the window or skylight. In a closed-loop system, the photosensor detects the total [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] amount of light, from both daylight and electric sources in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Lightning Product Information Program |url=http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/tutorials/photosensors/feed.asp |publisher=Lighting Research Center |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903090628/http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/NLPIP/tutorials/photosensors/feed.asp |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dilouie|first1=Craig|title=Photosensors: Technology and Major Trends|url=http://lightingcontrolsassociation.org/photosensors-technology-and-major-trends/|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in an office a closed-loop photosensor can be positioned on the [[ceiling]] facing the desktops in order to detect the amount of light on the work surface, as placing the sensor on the desktop itself would be impractical. In both the open- and closed-loop configurations, the signal from the photosensor must be carefully calibrated to accurately indicate the effect of exterior daylight variations on the light level on 'important function' areas in the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control modules and dimming==
The signal from the photosensor is interpreted by a [[lighting control system]] module, an automated [[light switch]]ing device, in the electric lighting system which can reduce the electric lighting, by shutting off or dimming fixtures as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/daylighting/pdf/14005DayswitchReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/daylighting/pdf/DaySwitchDemoRpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; If the electric lighting is dimmable, then the artificial lighting may be continuously adjusted in proportion to the amount of daylight available. If the electric lighting is on-off only, then an electric lighting fixture or lamp must remain on at full output until daylight can meet the entire recommended light level for the space. Non-dimming variants include having multiple non-adjacent light fixtures such as alternate units in the ceiling 'grid layout,' or daylight source adjacent fixtures near windows or skylights, linked for [[X10 (industry standard)|module]] on-off switching. Another variant of on-off switching is step switching (sometimes referred to as "bi-level switching"), in which multiple lamps in a single light fixture can be switched on and off independent of each other. This allows for typically one or two steps between full output and zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimming systems are generally more expensive than on-off systems. They have the potential to save more energy, because they can reduce electric light output when daylight can only partially meet the needs of the space. However, dimming systems may also require a little more energy for their basic operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understand compatibility, performance, and dimming issues in LED lighting (MAGAZINE)|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/iif/print/volume-2/issue-6/features/understand-compatibility-performance-and-dimming-issues-in-led-lighting-magazine.html|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a dimming system is well-calibrated, the occupants of the space will not notice changes in electric lighting due to daylight harvesting, whereas they are very likely to notice the changes due to on-off or step switching.

==Energy savings==
Several studies have recorded the energy savings due to daylight harvesting.  Energy savings for electric lighting in the range of 20-60% are common.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Savings are very dependent on the type of space the light harvesting [[lighting control system|control system]] is deployed in, and its usage.&lt;ref name="lrc.rpi.edu"/&gt; Clearly, savings can only accrue in spaces with substantial daylight where electric lighting would have been otherwise used.  Therefore, daylight harvesting works best in spaces with access to conventional or [[clerestory]] [[window]]s, [[skylight]]s, [[light tube]] groups, [[glass block]] walls, and other [[passive daylighting]] sources from [[sunlight]]; and where electric lighting would otherwise be left on for long periods.  Such spaces have included [[office]]s, [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]], interior public multistory [[plaza]]s and [[shopping mall]] courts, and [[school]]s.

It is too simplistic to try to increase [[energy saving]]s by increasing the size of windows. Daylight [[over-illumination]] may cause [[Glare (vision)|glare]] for occupants, causing them to deploy [[blinds]] or other window shading devices, and compromising the daylight harvesting system. Even partially deployed [[venetian blind]]s can cut energy savings in half.

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Impressive energy savings estimates may not be realized in practice due to poor system design, calibration, or [[Building commissioning|commissioning]].  Systems that dim or switch electric lighting in a distracting manner, or that produce overall light levels that are perceived as too low, can be sabotaged by occupants.

(For example, simply taping over a sensor will create constant electric lighting at maximum output.)

The adoption of daylight harvesting technologies has been hampered by high costs and imperfect performance of the technologies. However, studies have shown that by using daylight harvesting technologies, owners can see an average annual energy savings of 24%.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, R.P., R. Raghavan, O. Howlett, and C. Eaton. 2005 The Potential of Simplified Concepts for Daylight Harvesting. Lighting Research and Technology 37 (1): 21-40. Online at: http://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/daylighting/rp_simplifiedconcepts.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

One method of predicting energy savings it to use commercially available software programs, such as TRACE 700 or (freeware) DOE-2, which considers thermal loads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doe2.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payback, and drivers for adoption==
There is an incremental cost to daylight harvesting systems.  Dividing this cost by the annual energy savings provides a "simple payback", the number of years for the system to pay for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTEGRATED DAYLIGHTING  SYSTEMS|url=http://gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/193599/fileName/Integrated_Daylighting_Findings-508.action|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shorter the calculated [[payback period]], the more likely it is that a building owner will invest in the system.  Costs vary for a whole host of local factors, but generally if energy costs rise, or the cost of the control hardware and installation falls, the payback period will be reduced.

==Sustainability==
The [[green building]]-sustainable building movement encourages [[sustainable architecture]] design and building practices.  Various green building [[ecolabel]] [[certification marks]] exist around the world, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], [[Building Owners and Managers Association|BOMA]] Best, [[BREEAM]], HKBeam, and [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]].  All of these programs offer points for various building design features that promote [[sustainability]], and certification at various levels is awarded for reaching a given number of points.  One of the principal ways to gain points is through [[energy saving]] measures.

Therefore, daylight harvesting is a common feature of green buildings.

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus green building practices are increasing the production of daylight harvesting components, leading to lower prices.
&lt;br /&gt;
Many electric utilities provide financial incentives for their customers to save energy. One such incentive is rebates on daylight harvesting systems

&lt;/ref&gt;
, which also reduces payback periods.

In addition, energy codes and standards are beginning to address daylight harvesting. For example, the [[California Energy Code]] Title 24-2008 recognizes primary and secondary daylight zones. At least 50% of the general lighting in primary zones must be controlled separately from other lighting, with automatic control required for larger zones. The code encourages automatic daylight harvesting in secondary zones by awarding power adjustment factor credits that can be applied to the lighting design.&lt;ref name=title24&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/2008standards/|title=California's Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) recognizes daylight zones around vertical fenestration and skylights, and requires that the lighting in these zones be controlled separately from the general lighting in the space.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The 2010 [[ASHRAE 90.1]] energy standard, expected to be published in the fall 2010, is also expected to address daylight harvesting. Meanwhile, ASHRAE 189.1, the first of a generation of sustainable construction codes, defines daylight zones and requires daylight harvesting control.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''Device Description Language (DDL)''' is the formal language describing the service and configuration of field devices for process and factory automation.

== Background ==

Current field devices for process and factory automation have a number of configuration options, to customize them to their individual use case. For these means they are equipped with a digital communication interface ([[Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol|HART]], [[PROFIBUS]], [[Fieldbus Foundation]]). Different software tools provide the means to control and configure the devices. In the 1990s, the DDL was developed to remove the requirement to write a new software tool for each new device type. Software can, through the interpretation of a device description (DD), configure and control many different devices. The creation of a description with the DDL is less effort than writing an entire software tool.

The HART Communication Foundation, PROFIBUS and Fieldbus Foundation have merged their individual dialects of the DDL. The result became the ''Electronic Device Description Language (EDDL)'', an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard (IEC 61804).

The harmonization and enhancement of the EDDL is being undertaken in the EDDL Cooperation Team (ECT). The ECT consists of the leadership of the Fieldbus Foundation, Profibus Nutzerorganisation (PNO), Hart Communication Foundation, OPC Foundation and the FDT Group.

== Structure of the DDL ==

The DDL describes:
* Data (e.g. Parameters)
* Communication (e.g. Addressing Information)
* User Interfaces
* Operations (e.g. Calibration)

== Software ==

A device description (DD) can be created with a plain text editor. But like any other programing or description language, the authoring is error prone and as such special development tools may be used, to create valid and norm conforming EDDs.

The following tools assists the creation of EDDs:
* isEDD Workbench and EDD Checker ([http://eddl.ifak.eu/ ifak e.V. Magdeburg]) - Norm conformity to the IEC 61804 parts 3, 4 and 5

The following control and configuration tools interpret the DDL:
* [[SIMATIC]] PDM - "The Process Device Manager" ([[Siemens]])
* AMS Intelligent Device Manager([[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson Process Management]])
* SDC 625 (HART)  
* FDM ([[Honeywell]])
* isEDDview DTM (ifak system GmbH)
* iDTM für FieldCare ([[Endress+Hauser]])
* DevCom2000 ([https://www.procomsol.com/online_store/devcom2000 ProComSol, Ltd])
* DevComDroid ([https://www.procomsol.com/online_store/devcomdroid ProComSol, Ltd])

'''Direct trade''' is a form of [[procurement|sourcing]] practiced by certain [[coffee roaster]]s and [[chocolate maker]]s who build direct relationships with the farmers and processors who sell them coffee or cocoa beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/dining/12coff.html|title=To Burundi and Beyond for Coffee’s Holy Grail|last=Meehan|first=Peter|date=2007-09-12|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single set of direct trade standards, and specific trade practices vary as a reflection of business and ethical priorities of the roaster or maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/labeling-and-certification/direct-trade|title=Direct Trade|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, however, direct trade practitioners view their model as one of mutually-beneficial and transparent trade relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates explicitly define direct trade as an alternative to [[fairtrade certification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/image/direct-vs-fair-trade-coffee|title=Contrasting Direct Trade and Fair Trade Coffee|date=2014-10-02|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they seek to address perceived limitations of [[fair trade]] by:

'''Fair Trade''' practices -- such as those certified by Fairtrade International -- are designed to promote ethical trading standards to the benefit of the poorest of coffee producers in developing countries, providing opportunities for assistance with infrastructural growth, access to credit and financing to the farmers, and ensure ethical labor regulations for certified farms. Many studies have found that Fair Trade has brought stabilization to the world coffee market, as well as improved many coffee producing farms world wide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingenbleek, P., &amp; Reinders, T.|first=|date=2013|title=The development of a market for sustainable coffee in The Netherlands: Rethinking the contribution of Fair Trade|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=113 (3).|pages=461-474|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

While such practices are common among self-identified direct trade coffee roasters and chocolate makers, there is no single definition of direct trade nor set of common standards. A lack of third-party accountability is a frequent criticism leveled by direct trade critics, which include former proponents frustrated by what they perceive as a trend of large, marketing-savvy roasters "who bombard consumers with the term despite not offering any clear definition of its meaning, any evidence of an actual direct trade scheme or the slightest shred of transparency regarding sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycoffeenews.com/2017/05/10/direct-trade-is-dead-long-live-its-founding-principles/|title=Direct Trade is Dead, Long Live its Founding Principles|date=2017-05-10|website=Daily Coffee News by Roast Magazine|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6660">'''Dispositif''' is a term used by the French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]], generally to refer to the various institutional, physical, and administrative mechanisms and knowledge structures which enhance and maintain the exercise of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] within the social body.

==Translation==
Dispositif is translated variously, even in the same book, as 'device', 'machinery', 'apparatus', 'construction', and 'deployment'.

== Definition ==

Foucault uses the term in his 1977 "The Confession of the Flesh" interview, where he answers the question, "What is the meaning or methodological function for you of this term, [[Apparatus theory|apparatus]] (dispositif)?" as follows:

:''"What I'm trying to pick out with this term is, firstly, a thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic propositions–in short, the said as much as the unsaid. Such are the elements of the apparatus. The apparatus itself is the system of relations that can be established between these elements."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Confession of the Flesh" (1977) interview. In Power/Knowledge Selected Interviews and Other Writings (ed Colin Gordon), 1980: pp. 194–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foucaultblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/01/what-is-the-dispositif "What is the ''dispositive''?"] Foucault Blog, April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German linguist [[Siegfried Jäger]] defines Foucault's ''dispositif'' as

:''"the interaction of discursive behavior (i. e. speech and thoughts based upon a shared knowledge pool), non-discursive behavior (i. e. acts based upon knowledge), and manifestations of knowledge by means of acts or behaviors ''...''. ''Dispositifs'' can thus be imagined as a kind of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', the complexly interwoven and integrated ''dispositifs'' add up in their entirety to a ''dispositif'' of all society."''&lt;ref&gt;''"das Zusammenspiel diskursiver Praxen (= Sprechen und Denken auf der Grundlage von Wissen), nichtdiskursiver Praxen (= Handeln auf der Grundlage von Wissen) und „Sichtbarkeiten“ bzw. „Vergegenständlichungen“ (von Wissen durch Handeln/Tätigkeit) ''...''. Dispositive kann man sich insofern auch als eine Art „Gesamtkunstwerke“ vorstellen, die – vielfältig  miteinander verzahnt und verwoben – ein gesamtgesellschaftliches Dispositiv ausmachen."'', [http://www.diss-duisburg.de/Internetbibliothek/Artikel/Aspekte_einer_Kritischen_Diskursanalyse.htm Siegfried Jäger: Theoretische und methodische Aspekte einer Kritischen Diskurs- und Dispositivanalyse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish philosopher Raffnsøe "advances the 'dispositive' (le dispositif) as a key conception in Foucault's work" and "a resourceful approach to the study of contemporary societal problems."&lt;ref&gt;What is a dispositive? Foucault's historical mappings of the networks of social reality" https://www.academia.edu/9838825/What_is_a_dispositive_Foucault_s_historical_mappings_of_the_networks_of_social_reality&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raffnsøe, "the dispositionally prescriptive level is a crucial aspect of social reality in organizational life, since it has a determining effect on what is taken for granted and considered real. Furthermore, it determines not only what is and can be considered possible but also what can even be imagined and anticipated as potentially realizable, as something one can hope for, or act to bring about".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault's dispositive: The perspicacity of dispositive analytics in organizational Research": 21

=== Agamben's delineation ===
The Italian political philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] traces the trajectory of the term to [[Aristotle]]'s ''oikonomia—the effective management of the household''  and the early Church Fathers' attempt to save the concept of the Trinity from the allegation of polytheism, as the triplicity of the God is his oikonomia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jDGrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=dispositif+agamben+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98j4y5vhL5&amp;sig=QBqpf3kZtb92q246YMByRdoidmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieqfWgz_7PAhUIL48KHYe9DoIQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dispositif%20agamben%20dictionary&amp;f=false|title=Agamben Dictionary|last=Murray|first=Alex|date=2011-06-06|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748646982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agamben defines the ''apparatus''/''dispositif'' as

:''"Further expanding the already large class of Foucauldian apparatuses, I shall call an apparatus literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings. Not only, therefore, prisons, madhouses, the panopticon, schools, confession, factories, disciplines, judicial measures, and so forth (whose connection with power is in a certain sense evident), but also the pen, writing, literature, philosophy, agriculture, cigarettes, navigation, computers, cellular telephones and—why not—language itself, which is perhaps the most ancient of apparatuses—one in which thousands and thousands of years ago a primate inadvertently let himself be captured, probably without realizing the consequences that he was about to face."''&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, "What is an Apparatus?" in ''What is an Apparatus? And Other Essays''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009: p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar Matteo Pasquinelli criticises Agamben's genealogy with these words

:''"The dispositif is traced back, theoretically and philologically, to the definition of social normativity that Foucault takes from Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological (1966) and to the use of the term dispositif by Canguilhem himself in the essay "Machine and Organism" (1952). Both these lineages proceed from the notion of organic normativity that Canguilhem adopts from the German-Jewish neurologist Kurt Goldstein, that is from a tradition of Lebensphilosophie that appears to be incompatible with Agamben's theological thesis."''&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Pasquinelli, "What an Apparatus is Not: On the Archeology of the Norm in Foucault, Canguilhem, and Goldstein". Parrhesia 22,  2015, 79-89. [http://matteopasquinelli.com/what-an-apparatus-is-not/ PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="837">'''Eidonomy''' is the study of the external appearance of an [[organism]]. It is thus the opposite of [[anatomy]], which refers to internal [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].l
While predominant early in the [[history of biology]] it is little studied in particular anymore as it is rife with the effects of [[convergent evolution]]. It thus yields less new information about organisms than anatomy, and therefore the external appearance of lifeforms is usually studied as part of general investigations in morphology, e.g. in the context of [[phylogenetic]] research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7609">'''Fiction Theory''' is a discipline that applies [[possible world]] theory to literature. Fiction theory scholars and critics have articulated various theses rooted in [[Saul Kripke]]’s application of [[modal logic]] to [[semantics]]. Drawing on concepts found in possible world theory, theorists of fiction study the relationships between textual worlds and the world outside the text.  The overarching idea in fiction theory is that the relationships between the imaginary worlds of fiction and the actual world in which we live are complicated, and that one ought not dismiss fiction as simply stories that are not “true.” Theorists of fiction pose challenging questions about, and offer constructive ways of exploring, the often complex relations between the worlds of fiction and the “real” world in which we live. 

== Fundamentals of fiction theory ==
In order to understand fiction theory, one must pose questions about fundamental terms such as text, narrative, literature, fiction, etc.  Literature may be understood as a text that is self-consciously artistic, rather than as a text that is used as a medium through which to convey information, for example a newspaper article. [[Roman Jakobson]], a Russian formalist and linguist, was one of the first individuals to discuss art as a way of communication that is intentionally aesthetic, and applied linguistics to analyses of literary texts. In his well-known communication model, Jakobson breaks apart a communicative act between an addressor and addressee into a message, code, context, and contact, with each part having its own function.  According to Jakobson’s model, art is created when the message itself (which carries the poetic function) is stressed. 

The French scholar [[Roland Barthes]] designed a system of [[five major codes]] that function as tools to analyze narrative texts in ways that move beyond examinations of plot and structure, thereby bringing to the surface the subtle ways a text becomes a literary narrative. 

Jakobson’s model and Barthes’s codes offer critics a way to begin to explore the nature of a literary text through application of [[semiotics]] to [[narrative]].

== The Actual versus the Fictive ==
While Jakobson and Barthes emphasize the intention of the speaker/writer, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] examines the broader question of how we create imaginary worlds and categorizes our “Ways of Worldmaking” (the title of his book on this topic) into composition/decomposition, weighting, ordering, deletion/supplementation, and reformations. The scholar [[Marie-Laure Ryan]] is also concerned less with intention and more with the various ways that fictional worlds are related to the actual world outside the text. Ryan conceptualizes these relations in a framework of accessibility and has developed a typology of accessibility relations that establishes the extent to which fictional worlds are similar to or different from the actual world in which we live. The fictional world that most resembles the actual world is based on the “principle of minimal departure.” This idea was first articulated by [[John Searle]] and refers to the fundamental property of an imaginary world that is minimally different from the familiar world in which we live. Lubomir Dolezel has developed a similar typology based on [[modal operator]]s that determine the narrative world.

[[Frank Kermode]], in his seminal text ''[[The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction]]'', argues that ultimate meaning is derived from the end; successive events are predicated on previously established meaning.  He articulates a concept of fiction based on this view of humans’ constant yearning for an ultimate end that will imbue with meaning everything that preceded it. In this discussion, Kermode distinguishes between fiction and myth.  Fiction consists of stories all individuals create about their lives in order to keep on living in a world that makes few guarantees and is full of inexplicable phenomena. Kermode defines myth as a dangerous fiction used for exploitative purposes.  The philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] has articulated similar ideas, putting forth the biological argument that human beings use fictions to help survive in a hostile environment, and that these fictions are so useful that it becomes most difficult, if not impossible, for us to stop ourselves from creating fictions.  In Vaihinger’s language, fiction is something we treat “as if” it is true even when we know that it is not true, whereas myth is something we treat as true because we do not know it is false. 

Literary critic [[Thomas Pavel]] argues that the fictional world deserves to be examined on its own terms rather than merely through the lens of [[mimesis]].  His thesis serves as a critique of [[Structuralism]] by its insistence on the idea that narrativity, as a fundamental aspect of fiction, removes the possibility of pure imitation of the actual world.  Pavel’s theory thus departs from the main ideas of other fiction theorists because he separates literature from its referential relationship to the actual world. Following in the footsteps of the Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]], Pavel asserts that fictional worlds demand tremendous respect for their ability to serve as powerful tools of knowledge rather than for their likeness to the actual world.

In a small part of the general human population, gluten can trigger adverse autoimmune reactions responsible for a broad spectrum of [[gluten-related disorders]], including [[coeliac disease]], [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity|non-coeliac gluten sensitivity]], [[gluten ataxia]] and [[dermatitis herpetiformis]].&lt;ref name=LudvigssonLeffler2013 /&gt; People with these conditions often practice [[gluten-free diet]]s.

==Preparation==

Gluten is a [[protein complex]] that accounts for 75–85% of the total protein in bread wheat.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt;&lt;ref name="cgc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/fact-fait/gluten-eng.htm |title=Gluten's role in bread baking performance |publisher=Canadian Grain Commission |publication-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In home or restaurant cooking, gluten is prepared from [[flour]] by kneading the flour under water, agglomerating the gluten into an elastic network known as a [[dough]], and then washing out the [[starch]].&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt; Starch granules [[suspension (chemistry)|disperse]] in low-temperature water, and the dispersed starch is [[sedimentation|sedimented]] and dried. If a [[salt|saline]] solution is used instead of water, a purer protein is obtained, with certain harmless [[impurity|impurities]] departing the solution with the starch. Where starch is the prime product, cold water is the favored solvent because the impurities depart from the gluten.

In industrial production, a [[slurry]] of wheat flour is kneaded vigorously by machinery until the gluten agglomerates into a mass.&lt;ref name="sakhare"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4252461|year=2013|author1=Sakhare|first1=S. D.|title=Effect of flour particle size on microstructural, rheological and physico-sensory characteristics of bread and south Indian parotta|journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology|volume=51|issue=12|pages=4108–4113|last2=Inamdar|first2=A.

About 65% of the water in the wet gluten is removed by means of a [[screw press]]; the remainder is sprayed through an [[atomizer nozzle]] into a [[drying]] chamber, where it remains at an elevated temperature for a short time to allow the water to evaporate without denaturing the gluten.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The process yields a flour-like powder with a 7% moisture content, which is [[Air cooling|air cooled]] and [[Pneumatics|pneumatically]] transported to a receiving vessel. In the final step, the processed gluten is [[Sieve|sifted]] and [[Mill (grinding)|milled]] to produce a uniform product.&lt;ref name=sakhare/&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Wheat field.jpg|thumb|[[Wheat]], a prime source of gluten]]

===Bread products===

Gluten forms when [[glutenin]] molecules cross-link via [[disulfide bond]]s to form a submicroscopic network attached to [[gliadin]], which contributes [[viscosity]] (thickness) and extensibility to the mix.&lt;ref name="shewry1"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692935|year=2002|author1=Shewry|first1=P.

[[Baking]] [[denaturation (biochemistry)|coagulates]] the gluten, which, along with starch, stabilizes the shape of the final product. Gluten content has been implicated as a factor in the [[staling]] of bread, possibly because it binds water through hydration.&lt;ref&gt;

The formation of gluten affects the texture of the baked goods.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt; Gluten's attainable elasticity is proportional to its content of glutenins with low molecular weights, as this portion contains the preponderance of the [[sulfur]] atoms responsible for the cross-linking in the gluten network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Further refining of the gluten leads to chewier doughs such as those found in [[pizza]] and [[bagel]]s, while less refining yields tender baked goods such as [[pastry]] products.&lt;ref name="Baking Technology, Bread"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, [[bread]] flours are high in gluten (hard wheat); pastry flours have a lower gluten content. [[Kneading]] promotes the formation of gluten strands and cross-links, creating baked products that are chewier (as opposed to more brittle or crumbly). The "chewiness" increases as the dough is kneaded for longer times. An increased moisture content in the dough enhances gluten development,&lt;ref name="Baking Technology, Bread"/&gt; and very wet doughs left to rise for a long time require no kneading (see [[no-knead bread]]). [[Shortening]] inhibits formation of cross-links and is used, along with diminished water and less kneading, when a tender and flaky product, such as a [[pie crust]], is desired.

The strength and elasticity of gluten in flour is measured in the baking industry using a [[farinograph]]. This gives the baker a measurement of quality for different varieties of flours when developing recipes for various baked goods.&lt;ref name=shewry1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/ndsu/simsek/wheat/farinograph.html |title=Farinograph |date=22 September 2014 |website=Wheat Quality and Carbohydrate Research |publisher=North Dakota State University |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oliver |first=JR |last2=Allen |first2=HM |date=January 1992 |title=The prediction of bread baking performance using the farinograph and extensograph |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521009800581 |journal=Journal of Cereal Science |publisher=Elsevier |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=79–89 |doi=10.1016/S0733-5210(09)80058-1 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Added gluten====

Gluten, when dried, milled and added to ordinary [[flour]] dough, may help improve the dough's ability to increase in volume. The resulting mixture also increases the bread's structural stability and chewiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Amendola, J.|author2= Rees, N.|author3= Lundberg, D. E.|year=2002|title=Understanding Baking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gluten-added dough must be worked vigorously to induce it to rise to its full capacity; an automatic [[bread machine]] or [[food processor]] may be required for high-gluten kneading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eckhardt, L.W.|author2=Butts, D.C.|year=1997|title=Rustic European Breads from your Bread Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, higher gluten levels are associated with higher overall protein content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain|title=Against the Grain|date=3 November 2014|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imitation meats===
[[File:Wheat gluten (vegetarian mock duck) 2007.jpg|thumb|Gluten is often used in imitation meats (such as this mock "duck") to provide supplemental protein and variety in vegetarian diets]]
{{details|topic=the use of gluten in cooking|Wheat gluten (food)}}

Gluten, especially [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], is often the basis for [[Meat analogue|imitation meats]] resembling [[beef]], [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[Duck (food)|duck]] (see [[mock duck]]), [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[pork]]. When cooked in [[broth]], gluten absorbs some of the surrounding liquid (including the flavor) and becomes firm to the bite.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Dorothy, R.; Wingate, Colby. 1993. "Cooking with Gluten and Seitan." Summertown, Tennessee: The Book Publishing Co. 128 p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vegannomnoms.net/2011/03/how-to-make-seitan-an-illustrated-guide.html |title=How to Make Seitan: An Illustrated Guide |last=Abramowski |first=Nicole |date=11 March 2011 |website=Vegan Nom Noms |accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of gluten is a popular means of adding supplemental protein and variety to many [[vegetarian]] diets.

===Other consumer products===

Gluten is often present in [[beer]] and [[soy sauce]], and can be used as a [[food additive|stabilizing agent]] in more unexpected food products, such as [[ice cream]] and [[ketchup]]. Foods of this kind may therefore present problems for a small number of consumers because the hidden gluten constitutes a hazard for people with [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]] and gluten sensitivities. The protein content of some [[pet food]]s may also be enhanced by adding gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Celiac disease===
{{Main article|Celiac disease}}

[[Celiac disease]] (CD) is a chronic, multiple-organ [[autoimmune disorder]] primarily affecting the [[small intestine]] caused by the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, oats, and derivatives, that appears in [[genetic predisposition|genetically predisposed]] people of all ages. CD is not only a gastrointestinal disease, because it may involve several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may be apparently asymptomatic.&lt;ref name=WGO2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/guidelines/global-guidelines/celiac-disease/celiac-disease-english|title=Celiac disease|date=July 2016|publisher=[[World Gastroenterology Organisation]] Global Guidelines|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Biesiekierski2017 /&gt; Many asymptomatic people actually are not, but have become accustomed to living with a chronic bad health status as if it were normal, and they are able to recognize that they actually had symptoms related to celiac disease  after starting the gluten-free diet and improvement is evident, in contrast to the situation prior to the diet.&lt;ref name=WGO2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=LudvigssonCard /&gt;&lt;ref name=LionettiGatti2015 /&gt; Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers ([[Anti-transglutaminase antibodies#Anti-tissue transglutaminase|anti-tissue transglutaminase]] [TG2]) are not always present&lt;ref name=NEJM2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fasano|first1=A|last2=Catassi|first2=C|title=Clinical practice.

===Wheat allergy===
{{Main article|Wheat allergy}}

People can also experience adverse effects of wheat as result of a [[wheat allergy]].&lt;ref name=ElliBranchi /&gt; As with most allergies, a wheat allergy causes the immune system to abnormally respond to a component of wheat that it treats as a threatening foreign body. This immune response is often time-limited and does not cause lasting harm to body tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cureceliacdisease.org/archives/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-gluten-intolerance-gluten-sensitivity-and-wheat-allergy|publisher=The University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center|title=What’s the difference between celiac disease, gluten intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy?|date=2015|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheat allergy and celiac disease are different disorders.&lt;ref name=ElliBranchi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/allergyfactsheettwo.pdf |title=Food intolerance and coeliac disease |publisher=Food Standards Agency |date=September 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gastrointestinal symptoms of wheat allergy are similar to those of celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. An allergic reaction to wheat has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and could include [[anaphylaxis]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2012 /&gt;

===Gluten ataxia===
[[File:Gluten ataxia eng.ogg|thumb|Gluten ataxia eng|A male with gluten ataxia: previous situation and evolution after three months of gluten-free diet]]

[[Ataxia#Gluten ataxia|Gluten ataxia]] is an autoimmune disease triggered by the ingestion of gluten.&lt;ref name="sapone-etal-2010-b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sapone A, Bai JC, Ciacci C, Dolinsek J, Green PH, Hadjivassiliou M, Kaukinen K, Rostami K, Sanders DS, Schumann M, Ullrich R, Villalta D, Volta U, Catassi C, Fasano A | title = Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 10 | issue =  | pages = 13 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22313950 | pmc = 3292448 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-10-13 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; With gluten ataxia, damage takes place in the cerebellum, the balance center of the brain that controls coordination and complex movements like walking, speaking and swallowing, with loss of [[Purkinje cell]]s. People with gluten ataxia usually present [[gait abnormality]] or incoordination and tremor of the upper limbs. Gaze-evoked [[nystagmus]] and other ocular signs of cerebellar dysfunction are common. [[Myoclonus]], palatal tremor, and [[opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome|opsoclonus-myoclonus]] may also appear.&lt;ref name="HadjivassiliouSanders2015" /&gt;

Early diagnosis and treatment with a [[gluten-free diet]] can improve ataxia and prevent its progression. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the elapsed time from the onset of the ataxia until diagnosis, because the death of [[Purkinje cells|neurons in the cerebellum]] as a result of gluten exposure is irreversible.&lt;ref name="HadjivassiliouSanders2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MitomaAdhikari2016"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Mitoma H, Adhikari K, Aeschlimann D, Chattopadhyay P, Hadjivassiliou M, Hampe CS et al.| title=Consensus Paper: Neuroimmune Mechanisms of Cerebellar Ataxias | journal=Cerebellum | year= 2016 | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 213–32 | pmid=25823827 | doi=10.1007/s12311-015-0664-x | pmc=4591117 | type=Review }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Labeling==

===International standards===

The ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' [[international standard]]s for [[food labeling]] has a standard relating to the labeling of products as "[[gluten-free]]". It only applies to foods that would normally contain gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexalimentarius.org/download/standards/291/cxs_118e.pdf|publisher=[[Codex Alimentarius]]|title=Codex Standard For "Gluten-Free Foods" CODEX STAN 118-1981|date=February 22, 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

By law in Brazil, all food products must display labels clearly indicating whether or not they contain gluten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://e-legis.anvisa.gov.br/leisref/public/showAct.php?id=32
  |date=July 2014
  |title=General labeling for Packaged Foods (free translation)
  |publisher=[[ANVISA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

The Canadian Celiac Association estimates that one in 133 Canadians experiences adverse symptoms from gluten in celiac disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celiac.ca/?page_id=882|title=About celiac disease|date=2014|publisher=Canadian Celiac Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labels for all food products sold in Canada must clearly identify the presence of gluten if it is present at a level greater than 20 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/allerg/cel-coe/gluten-position-eng.php|title=Health Canada's Position on Gluten-Free Claims|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===

In the European Union, all prepackaged foods and non-prepacked foods from a restaurant, take-out food wrapped just before sale, or unpackaged food served in institutions must be identified if gluten-free.&lt;ref name="fsa2016"&gt;{{cite web
  |url= https://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/allergy-guide/labelling-of-gluten-free-foods
  |date=31 October 2016
  | title=Labelling of 'gluten free' foods
  | publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Gluten-free" is defined as 20 parts per million of gluten or less and "very low gluten" is 100 parts per million of gluten or less; only foods with cereal ingredients processed to remove gluten can claim "very low gluten" on labels.&lt;ref name=fsa2016/&gt;

All foods containing gluten as an ingredient must be labelled accordingly as gluten is defined as one of the 14 recognised EU allergens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.food.gov.uk/science/allergy-intolerance/label/labelling-changes|title=EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation (EU FIC) |date=March 2016|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|format=link}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, gluten is not listed on labels unless added as a standalone ingredient. Wheat or other allergens are listed after the ingredient line. The [[US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has historically classified gluten as "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS). In August 2013, the FDA issued a final ruling, effective August 2014, that defined the term "gluten-free" for voluntary use in the labeling of foods as meaning that the amount of gluten contained in the food is below 20 parts per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/ucm362880.htm|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|title=Questions and Answers: Gluten-Free Food Labeling Final Rule|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are fairly rare, and only 53 were studied between 1986 and 2001. The paintings are typically brought out only rarely for special festivals or holidays such as [[Buddha's Birthday]] or [[Gwaebul Festival]]s when they are unrolled and hung from tall poles in the temple courtyard. When not in use, ''gwaebul'' are stored un a box behind the altar in a temple hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrich.go.kr/english/page.do?menuIdx=1038|title=RESEARCH ON TRADITIONAL PAINTINGS|last=|first=|date=|website=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Universe expansion2.png|thumb|241px|According to the Big Bang model, the [[universe]] expanded from an extremely dense and hot state and continues to expand today. A common analogy explains that [[space]] itself is expanding, carrying [[galaxy|galaxies]] with it, like spots on an inflating balloon. The graphic scheme above is an artist's concept illustrating the expansion of a portion of a flat universe.]]
{{Physical cosmology|history}}
The began with the [[Big Bang]]'s development from observations and theoretical considerations. Much of the theoretical work in cosmology now involves extensions and refinements to the basic Big Bang model.

==Ancient philosophy and medieval temporal finitism==
In [[medieval philosophy]], there was much debate over whether the universe had a finite or infinite past (see [[Temporal finitism]]). The philosophy of [[Aristotle]] held that the universe had an infinite past, which caused problems for medieval [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] who were unable to reconcile the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] conception of the eternal with the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] [[Creation according to Genesis|view of creation]].&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gersonides' Proofs for the Creation of the Universe|author=Seymour Feldman|journal=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research|volume=35|date=1967|pages=113–137|doi=10.2307/3622478|publisher=Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 35|jstor=3622478}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a variety of logical arguments for the universe having a finite past were developed by [[John Philoponus]], [[Al-Kindi]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], among others.&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165–170 [165–6]|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1225 treatise ''De Luce'' (''On Light''), English theologian [[Robert Grosseteste]] explored the nature of matter and the cosmos. He described the birth of the universe in an explosion and the crystallization of matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth. ''De Luce'' is the first attempt to describe the heavens and Earth using a single set of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20140313]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1610, [[Johannes Kepler]] used the dark night sky to argue for a finite universe. Seventy-seven years later, [[Isaac Newton]] described large-scale motion throughout the universe.

The description of a universe that expanded and contracted in a cyclic manner was first put forward in a poem published in 1791 by [[Erasmus Darwin]]. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] presented a similar cyclic system in his 1848  essay titled ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]''; it is obviously not a scientific work, but Poe, while starting from metaphysical principles, tried to explain the universe using contemporary physical and mental knowledge. Ignored by the scientific community and often misunderstood by literary critics, its scientific implications have been reevaluated in recent times.

According to Poe, the initial state of matter was a single "Primordial Particle". "Divine Volition", manifesting itself as a repulsive force, fragmented the Primordial Particle into atoms. Atoms spread evenly throughout space, until the repulsive force stops, and attraction appears as a reaction: then matter begins to clump together forming stars and star systems, while the material universe is drawn back together by gravity, finally collapsing and ending eventually returning to the Primordial Particle stage in order to begin the process of repulsion and attraction once again. This part of Eureka describes a Newtonian evolving universe which shares a number of properties with relativistic models, and for this reason [[Poe]] anticipates some themes of modern cosmology.&lt;ref name=Cappi&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Edgar Allan Poe's Physical Cosmology|first=Alberto|last=Cappi|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=35|date=1994|pages=177–192|bibcode=1994QJRAS..35..177C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early 20th century scientific developments==
Observationally, in the 1910s, [[Vesto Melvin Slipher|Vesto Slipher]] and later, [[Carl Wilhelm Wirtz]], determined that most spiral nebulae (now correctly called [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]) were receding from Earth. Slipher used [[spectroscopy]] to investigate the rotation periods of planets, the composition of planetary atmospheres, and was the first to observe the radial velocities of galaxies. Wirtz observed a systematic redshift of nebulae, which was difficult to interpret in terms of a cosmology in which the universe is filled more or less uniformly with stars and nebulae. They weren't aware of the cosmological implications, nor that the supposed nebulae were actually galaxies outside our own [[Milky Way]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Also in that decade, [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] was found to admit no [[static universe|static cosmological solutions]], given the basic assumptions of cosmology described in the [[Big Bang#Theoretical underpinnings|Big Bang's theoretical underpinnings]]. The universe (i.e., the space-time metric) was described by a [[metric tensor]] that was either expanding or shrinking (i.e., was not constant or invariant). This result, coming from an evaluation of the field equations of the general theory, at first led Einstein himself to consider that his formulation of the field equations of the general theory may be in error, and he tried to correct it by adding a [[cosmological constant]].  This constant would restore to the general theory's description of space-time an invariant metric tensor for the fabric of space/existence.  The first person to seriously apply general relativity to cosmology without the stabilizing cosmological constant was [[Alexander Friedmann]]. Friedmann derived the expanding-universe solution to general relativity field equations in 1922. Friedmann's 1924 papers included "''Über die Möglichkeit einer Welt mit konstanter negativer Krümmung des Raumes''" (''About the possibility of a world with constant negative curvature'') which was published by the Berlin Academy of Sciences on 7 January 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1922 |title=Über die Krümmung des Raumes |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=377–386 |doi=10.1007/BF01332580 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F }} (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 1991–2000.) and {{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=A. |authorlink= |date=1924 |title=Über die Möglichkeit einer Welt mit konstanter negativer Krümmung des Raumes |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=326–332 |doi=10.1007/BF01328280 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1924ZPhy...21..326F }} (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 2001–2008.)
&lt;/ref&gt; Friedmann's equations describe the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] universe.

In 1927, the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] priest [[Georges Lemaître]] proposed an expanding model for the universe to explain the observed redshifts of spiral nebulae, and calculated the [[Hubble law]]. He based his theory on the work of Einstein and [[De Sitter]], and independently derived Friedmann's equations for an expanding universe.  Also, the red shifts themselves were not constant, but varied in such manner as to lead to the conclusion that there was a definite relationship between amount of red-shift of nebulae, and their distance from observers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] provided a comprehensive observational foundation for Lemaître's theory. Hubble's experimental observations discovered that, relative to the Earth and all other observed bodies, galaxies are receding in every direction at velocities (calculated from their observed red-shifts) directly proportional to their distance from the Earth and each other. In 1929, Hubble and [[Milton Humason]] formulated the empirical Redshift Distance Law of galaxies, nowadays known as [[Hubble's law]], which, once the redshift is interpreted as a measure of recession speed, is consistent with the solutions of Einstein's General Relativity Equations for a homogeneous, isotropic expanding space.  The isotropic nature of the expansion was direct proof that it was the space (the fabric of existence) itself that was expanding, not the bodies in space that were simply moving further outward and apart into an infinitely larger preexisting empty void. It was this interpretation that led to the concept of the expanding universe. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. This discovery later resulted in the formulation of the Big Bang model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1931, Lemaître proposed in his "''hypothèse de l'atome primitif''" (hypothesis of the primeval atom) that the universe began with the "explosion" of the "primeval [[atom]]" — what was later called the Big Bang. Lemaître first took [[cosmic ray]]s to be the remnants of the event, although it is now known that they originate within the local [[galaxy]]. Lemaître had to wait until shortly before his death to learn of the discovery of [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], the remnant radiation of a dense and hot phase in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georges Lemaître, Father of the Big Bang |url=http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117044852/http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/cosmic/p_lemaitre.html |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Big Bang theory vs. Steady State theory===
Hubble's Law suggested that the universe was expanding, contradicting the [[cosmological principle]] whereby the universe, when viewed on sufficiently large distance scales, has no preferred directions or preferred places.  Hubble's idea allowed for two opposing hypotheses to be suggested. One was Lemaître's Big Bang, advocated and developed by [[George Gamow]]. The other model was [[Fred Hoyle]]'s [[Steady State theory]], in which new matter would be created as the galaxies moved away from each other. In this model, the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. It was actually Hoyle who coined the name of Lemaître's theory, referring to it  as "this 'big bang' idea" during a radio broadcast on 28 March 1949, on the [[BBC]] [[Third Programme]]. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.&lt;ref&gt;

 |ref=harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hoyle repeated the term in further broadcasts in early 1950, as part of a series of five lectures entitled ''The Nature of The Universe''. The text of each lecture was published in [[The Listener (British magazine)|''The Listener'']] a week after the broadcast, the first time that the term "big bang" appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;The book in question can [no longer] be downloaded here: [http://www.nap.edu/books/0309093139/html/136.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence in favour of the Big Bang model mounted, and the consensus became widespread, Hoyle himself, albeit somewhat reluctantly, admitted to it by formulating a new cosmological model that other scientists later referred to as the "Steady Bang".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M., Just Six Minutes, Orion Books, London (2003), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950 to 1990s==
[[File:WMAP power spectrum.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Comparison of the predictions of the standard Big Bang model with experimental measurements. The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropy is plotted in terms of the angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]) (top).]]

From around 1950 to 1965, the support for these theories was evenly divided, with a slight imbalance arising from the fact that the Big Bang theory could explain both the formation and the observed abundances of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], whereas the Steady State could explain how they were formed, but not why they should have the observed abundances. However, the observational evidence began to support the idea that the universe evolved from a hot dense state. Objects such as [[quasars]] and radio galaxies were observed to be much more common at large distances (therefore in the distant past) than in the nearby universe, whereas the Steady State predicted that the average properties of the universe should be unchanging with time. In addition, the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation in 1964 was considered the death knell of the Steady State, although this prediction was only qualitative, and failed to predict the exact temperature of the CMB. (The key big bang prediction is the black-body spectrum of the CMB, which was not measured with high accuracy until COBE in 1990). After some reformulation, the Big Bang has been regarded as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the cosmos. Before the late 1960s, many cosmologists thought the infinitely dense and [[physical paradox|physically paradoxical]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the starting time of Friedmann's cosmological model could be avoided by allowing for a universe which was contracting before entering the hot dense state, and starting to expand again. This was formalized as [[Richard Tolman]]'s [[oscillating universe]]. In the sixties, [[Stephen Hawking]] and others demonstrated that this idea was unworkable,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and the singularity is an essential feature of the physics described by Einstein's gravity. This led the majority of cosmologists to accept the notion that the universe as currently described by the physics of general relativity has a finite age. However, due to a lack of a theory of [[quantum gravity]], there is no way to say whether the singularity is an actual origin point for the universe, or whether the physical processes that govern the regime cause the universe to be effectively eternal in character.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, most cosmologists accepted the Big Bang, but several puzzles remained, including the non-discovery of anisotropies in the CMB, and occasional observations hinting at deviations from a black-body spectrum; thus the theory was not very strongly confirmed.

==1990 onwards==
Huge advances in Big Bang cosmology were made in the 1990s and the early 21st century, as a result of major advances in [[telescope]] technology in combination with large amounts of satellite data, such as [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[WMAP]]. 

In 1990, measurements from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite showed that the spectrum of the CMB matches a 2.725 K [[black-body]] to very high precision; deviations do not exceed 2 parts in {{val|100000}}. This showed that earlier claims of spectral deviations were incorrect, and essentially proved that the universe was hot and dense in the past, since no other known mechanism can produce a black-body to such high accuracy. Further observations from COBE in 1992 discovered the very small anisotropies of the CMB on large scales, approximately as predicted from Big Bang models with [[dark matter]]. From then on, models of [[non-standard cosmology]] without some form of Big Bang became very rare in the mainstream astronomy journals.

In 1998, measurements of distant supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, and this was supported by other observations including ground-based CMB observations and large galaxy redshift surveys. In 1999-2000, the [[BOOMERanG]] and Maxima balloon-borne
CMB observations showed that the geometry of the universe is close to flat, then in 2001 the
[[2dFGRS]] galaxy redshift survey estimated the mean matter density around 25-30 percent of critical density. 
 
From 2003 to 2010, [[NASA]]'s [[WMAP]] spacecraft took very detailed pictures of the universe by means of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error) and that the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and the [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflationary theory]] are correct. No other cosmological theory can yet explain such a wide range of observed parameters, from the ratio of the elemental abundances in the early universe to the structure of the cosmic microwave background, the observed higher abundance of [[active galaxies|active galactic nuclei]] in the early universe and the observed masses of [[clusters of galaxies]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2013 and 2015, ESA's [[Planck_(spacecraft)|Planck]] spacecraft released even more detailed images of the cosmic microwave background, showing consistency with the [[Lambda-CDM model]] to still higher precision. 

Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding what happened in the earliest times after the Big Bang, and reconciling observations with the basic theory. Cosmologists continue to calculate many of the parameters of the Big Bang to a new level of precision, and carry out more detailed observations which are hoped to provide clues to the nature of [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]], and to test the theory of [[General Relativity]] on cosmic scales.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5450">The '''International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English''' ('''ICAME''') is an international group of linguists and data scientists working in [[corpus linguistics]] to digitise [[English language|English]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Corpus Linguistics and Beyond: Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on English Language Research on Computerized Corpora|volume=59|page=vi|publisher=Rodopi|year=1987|isbn=978-9-062-03569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] in 1977 as the International Computer Archive of Modern English, before being renamed to its current title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Corpus Linguistics|first=Graeme|last=Kennedy|publisher=Routledge|p=85|isbn=978-1-317-89258-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portal to their materials is hosted at the [[University of Bergen]], where they have set out the aim of the organization to "collect and distribute information on English language material available for computer processing and on linguistic research to compile an archive of English text corpora in [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] form, and to make material available to research institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clu.uni.no/icame/|title = ICAME|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating computer corpora, i.e. collections of texts in machine-readable form, is the most accessible way to study both transcribed spoken language and various genres of written texts for modern scholars, including both "descriptive and more theoretically-minded linguists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = ICAME-Quo Vadis? Reflections on the use of computer corpora in linguistics|last = Johansson|first = Stig|authorlink=Stig Johansson (linguist)|date = 1994|journal = Computers and the Humanities |volume=28 |issue=4-5 |pages=243–252|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICAME group hosts academic conferences that focus on corpus linguistic studies of historical changes and contemporary grammatical descriptions of English, and makes corpora of different varieties of English available to scholars, starting with editions of the 1960s [[Brown Corpus]]. Their first academic conference was held in [[Bergen, Norway]] in 1979, and scholars who were interested in corpus linguistics continued to meet each spring in different European and English-speaking countries. At these meetings, the compilation and distribution of corpora they enabled played a key role in the creation of the field of corpus linguistics in the 20th century, a precursor to current big data analytics. In summarizing the field, Kennedy's ''Introduction to Corpus Linguistics'' notes that "for corpus linguists with an interest in the description of English, the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English has been the major resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Corpus Linguistics|last = Kennedy|first = Graeme|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014 |isbn = |location = |pages = ch. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ICAME on the field has also be laid out in Facchinetti's history, ''Corpus Linguistics Twenty-five Years On''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Corpus Linguistics Twenty-Five Years On|last = Facchinetti|first = Roberta|publisher = Brill / Rodopi|year = 2007|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One influential resource that ICAME made available was a CD of 20 different corpora, including those covering different regional Englishes (such as the [[Australian Corpus of English]], the [[Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English]], the [[Kolhapur Corpus of Indian English]], the [[Bergen Corpus of London Teenage Language]] (COLT), the [[Helsinki Corpus of Older Scots]], and the [[International Corpus of English]]—East-African component), as well as versions of the Brown Corpus and the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus|Lancaster-Bergen-Oslo]] (LOB) corpus tagged for [[part of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = ICAME collection of English language corpora [CD]|last = Hofland|first = K.|publisher = |year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICAME also published an annual journal, the ''ICAME Journal'', formerly ''ICAME News'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.degruyter.com/view/supplement/s15025462_International_Computer_Archive_of_Modern_and_Medieval_English.pdf|title = degruyter ICAME supplement|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; that contains articles, conference reports, reviews and notices related to corpus linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://linguistlist.org/pubs/journals/get-journals.cfm?JournalID=6657|title = The LinguistList--ICAME Journal|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current editors of the ''ICAME Journal'' are Merja Kytö and [[Anna-Brita Stenström]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://clu.uni.no/icame/journal.html|title = ICAME Journal|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;History
The marine laboratory was established by biologist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] in 1928 to replicate the facilities at the [[Stazione Zoologica]] in Naples, Italy. It is one of the oldest marine laboratories on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. From 1962 until his death in 2002, Dr. [[Wheeler J. North]] conducted numerous studies on the ecology of the California [[kelp forest]]s while based at this laboratory.  During the 1990s and 2000s investigators included members of the [[Eric H. Davidson|Eric Davidson]] lab working on various marine biology related projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/196/1/marine.pdf | title= Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory | publisher=California Institute of Technology | accessdate=19 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kiel Institute for the World Economy''' (Institut für Weltwirtschaft, IfW) is an economics research center and a [[think tank]] that is located in [[Kiel]], Germany.
In 2013, it was ranked as one of the top 20 research centers in the world for [[International Trade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.int.html |title=Field Ranking at IDEAS |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the top four think tanks in the world for [[economic policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012_Global_Go_To_Think_Tank_Report_-_FINAL-1.28.13.pdf |title=University of Pennsylvania, International Relations Program |date=January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627063611/http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012_Global_Go_To_Think_Tank_Report_-_FINAL-1.28.13.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With more than four million publications in printed or electronic format and subscriptions to 31,970 periodicals and journals, the Institute has the world's largest specialist library for economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zbw.eu/e_about_us/e_library_profile.htm |title=ZBW – German National Library |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is affiliated with the [[University of Kiel]] where it cooperates closely with the Department of Business, Economics, and Social Sciences. It is nevertheless legally and academically independent of the University of Kiel. Since 1 January 2007, it has been an independent, nonprofit organization (foundation under public law). It is a member of an association of research institutions, museums, and service centers called the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community or Leibniz Association and is ranked as one of the top six leading economics research institutions in the Leibniz Association. Like all the institutions that are members of the Leibniz Association, it is funded 50% by the German federal government and 50% by the German states. It employs approximately 160 people, of whom more than 80 are economists. It is headed by a president, currently [[Dennis J. Snower]].

==History==
The Kiel Institute was founded under the name of Königliches Institut für Seeverkehr and Weltwirtschaft an der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel (Royal Institute for Maritime Transport and World Economics at the University of Kiel) on 18 February 1914, and opened two days later at the address Schlossgarten 14. With the help of its Sponsors' Association, it was to acquire new premises in 1919, a hotel called the Seebadeanstalt, which was owned by the [[Krupp]] family. It moved into these new premises in the spring of 1920, and changed its name to its current German name in 1934. Its mission as part of the University of Kiel was to study the world economy, which was a unique mission, as other economics institutes at the time studied only national economies. The founding director and first head of the Kiel Institute, {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Harms|de}}, directed the establishment of a research library, which was systematically expanded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Gülich|de}}, the head of the library for a number of years as of 1924, into the world's largest economics library. Harms also established several journals and an economics-related press archive. Further, he attached great importance to linking research to practical economics and to teaching research findings to economics students. The Institute, at the time, conducted international research for the benefit of Germany, which led to the establishment of a war archive and to the expansion of the Institute during [[World War I]]. During the [[Weimar Republic]], the Institute established a reputation for competence in international economics. In 1926, the Institute established a department for statistical economics and business cycle research, which gave the Institute a new profile in business cycle theory and business cycle policies. The new department was headed by [[Adolph Lowe]] and staffed by such researchers as {{Interlanguage link multi|Gerhard Colm|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Neisser|de}}, [[Jacob Marschak]], and [[Wassily Leontief]], all of whom published highly acclaimed research findings.

When the Nazis took over power in Germany, Jewish members of staff and members of staff who were active in the Social Democratic Party were quickly forced to leave the Institute. This affected the new department for statistical economics and business cycle research the most, and many of the staff in the department emigrated to the United States, where they became professors of economics. Bernhard Harms initially supported the Nazis and remained the head of the Institute, but later resisted the Nazi SA when it forced the Jewish members of staff to leave the Institute, and was himself then forced to leave. Formally, he retained his professorship at the University of Kiel, but was actually only active academically as an honorary professor in Berlin until his death in 1939. Harms was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jens Jessen (economist)|de|3=Jens Jessen|lt=Jens Jessen}}, who, because of differences with the Nazis, had himself transferred to the University of Marburg in October 1934. He was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Predöhl|de}}, who had worked for a long time under Bernhard Harms. Predöhl served as director of the Institute from July 1934 to November 1945. He strengthened the ties between the Institute and the University of Kiel and prevented the Institute's library from being cleansed of books written by Jews. During his term in office, the library was also able to buy foreign literature until far into World War II. The Institute conducted international economic research that was important for Germany's war planning and its economic aspects, for example, access to natural resources and the geopolitical significance of areas that Germany considered to be part of its "Grossraum" (economic areas under German supremacy), up until 1945. A comprehensive analysis of the research conducted by the Institute between 1933 and 1945 has never been undertaken. The complete holdings of the library were moved to Ratzeburg (Herzogtum Lauenburg) and thus were not destroyed during the war. However, parts of the Institute and its press archive were destroyed. After the war, British occupation authorities dismissed Predöhl as the director of the Institute (in November 1945) but allowed him remain a professor at the University of Kiel, which he left for a professorship at the University of Münster in 1953. He died at the age of 80 in Münster in 1974.

Friedrich Hoffmann was temporarily appointed to replace Predöhl as the acting director of the Institute and was succeeded, in 1948, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Baade|de}} (1893–1974), who devoted himself primarily to research in agricultural economics and food security. Under his leadership and thanks to his good connections in the United States and other countries, he was able to reintegrate the Institute into the international research community and to expand its role as an important economic research center with its own large library and its own archive of press clippings.

{{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Schneider (economist)|de|3=Erich Schneider (Ökonom)|lt=Erich Schneider}} (1900–1970) succeeded Fritz Baade as the director of the Institute in 1961. As the leading proponent of Keynesianism in Germany at the time and the author of a multivolume bestseller entitled "Einführung in die Volkwirtschaftslehre" (Introduction to Economics), he affiliated the Institute more closely with the University of Kiel, which later resulted in many researchers at the Institute becoming professors at German and non-German universities. He also established the Bernhard Harms Prize in 1964, on the occasion of the Institute's 50th anniversary. The first person to be awarded the prize, Gerhard Colm, was a former researcher at the Institute, a professor, an advisor to President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], and the engineer of the German currency reform in 1948.

[[Herbert Giersch]] (1921–2010) was appointed director of the Institute in 1989, and subsequently became president of the Institute. Numerous economic sea changes that determined the Institute's research and policy-advising activities took place during his period in office: the Bretton Woods system collapsed, oil prices began to climb, and developing countries and emerging markets  started producing manufactured goods for world markets. He strengthened the Institute's policy-advising role in Germany by playing a leading intellectual role in the German Council of Economic Experts. In this role, the Institute became involved in numerous controversies with the German government because it differed with the government on such important issues as  exchange rate policies and monetary, labor, and industrial policies. Under Giersch's leadership, the Institute became significantly more active in research of an international, applied nature. As a result, it played a leading role in  the Sonderforschungsbereich 86 "Weltwirtschaft und internationale Wirtschaftsbeziehungen" (Special Research Area 86 for Global Economics and Global Economic Affairs).

Giersch was succeeded by [[Horst Siebert]] (1938–2009) in 1989. Numerous economic sea changes also took place during his period in office: communist economies collapsed, the two Germanys were reunited, China became a world economic power, information technology emerged, and reforms of the labor market and social security systems became topical, as did the sustainable use of environmental resources as well. During his period in office, he was, like Herbert Giersch before, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts. Further, he defined the Institute's public image by often appearing on television and by publishing numerous articles and monographs on topical economic issues. Under his leadership, the Institute became more involved in environmental and resource economics, and international financial market economics. Siebert served as the president of the Institute until 2003, when he was given emeritus status.

After a period of 18 months in which the Institute had difficulties appointing a new president, [[Dennis Snower|Dennis J. Snower]] (born 1950) succeeded Siebert. Snower was appointed president of the Institute in October 2004 and is the first non-German to be appointed head of a leading economic research institute in Germany. He reorganized the Institute from the ground up, redefined its mission, and established such events as the Global Economic Symposium and the Global Economy Prize Awards, both of which are symbolic of the Institute's mission: to be a highly competent center for global economic affairs in research, education and policy-advising pertaining to topics and issues that are of immediate social importance  from a global perspective, and to strike a balance between being a research center on its own and a part of various research networks. The Institute participates in the German Joint Economic Forecast. {{As of|2007|1}}, the Institute's library became an independent nonprofit organization (under public law) called the [[German National Library of Economics]] (ZBW).

'''''Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts''''' is a 1979 book by [[Sociology of science|sociologists of science]] [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar]].

This influential book in the field of [[science studies]] presents an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] study of [[Roger Guillemin]]'s scientific laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]]. It advances a number of observations regarding how scientific work is conducted, including descriptions of the complex relationship between the routine lab practices performed by scientists, the publication of papers, scientific prestige, research finances and other elements of laboratory life.

The book is considered to be one of the most influential works in the laboratory studies tradition within [[Science and Technology Studies]]. It is inspired but not entirely dependent on the [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] approach.  In turn, it served as the inspiration for [[Actor-Network Theory]] (or ANT); many of ANT's core concepts (like transcription, inscription, translation, and the deployment of networks) are present in ''Laboratory Life''.

==Introduction and Methodology==
Latour and Woolgar state that their work "concerns the way in which the daily activities of working scientists lead to the construction of scientific facts" (40).  ''Laboratory Life'' therefore stands in opposition to the study of scandalous moments in which the so-called "normal" operation of science was disrupted by external forces.  In contrast, Latour and Woolgar give an account of a how scientific facts are produced in a laboratory ''[[in situ]]'', or as it happens.

==An Anthropologist Visits the Laboratory==
The initial [[methodology]] of ''Laboratory Life'' involves an "[[anthropology|anthropological]] strangeness" (40) in which the laboratory is a [[tribe]] foreign to the researcher.  The study of the lab begins with a semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer who knows nothing of laboratories or scientists.  In this account, Latour and Woolgar "bracket" (44) their previous knowledge of scientific practice and [[irony|ironic]]ally ask seemingly-nonsensical questions about observed practices in the laboratory, such as "Are the heated debates in front of the blackboard part of some [[gambling]] contest?"  In the asking and answering of these questions, the observer's understanding of laboratory practices is gradually refined, leading to a strong focus on the significance of paper [[document]]s.

The observer soon recognizes that all the scientists and technicians in the lab [[writing|write]] in some fashion, and that few activities in the lab are not connected to some sort of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] or [[inscription]]. The foreign observer describes the laboratory as "strange tribe" of "compulsive and [[mania|manic]] writers ... who spend the greatest part of their day coding, marking, altering, correcting, reading, and writing" (48-9).  Large and expensive laboratory equipment (such as [[bioassay]]s or [[mass spectrometer]]s) are interpreted as "inscription device[s]" that have the sole purpose of "transform[ing] a material substance into a figure or [[diagram]]" (51).  In this way, the observer works to organize and systematize the laboratory such that it "began to take on the appearance of a system of literary inscription" (52).

Having concluded that the "production of papers" for publication in a [[scientific journal]] is the primary focus of a laboratory, the observer next aims to "consider papers as objects in much the same way as [[manufactured goods]]" (71).  This involves asking how papers are produced, what their [[constituent element]]s (or [[raw material]]s) are, and why these papers are so important.  First, the authors recognize that in papers, "some statements appeared more [[fact]]-like than others" (76).  From this observation, a five-element [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of [[facticity]] is constructed, which spans from type 5 statements which are taken for granted to type 1 statements which are unqualified speculations, with various intermediate levels in between.  The conclusion reached is that statements in a laboratory routinely travel up and down this continuum, and the main purpose of a laboratory is to take statements of one level of facticity and transform them to another level.

However, Latour and Woolgar recognize that this semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer aiming to systematize the alien laboratory has several problems.  While the observer's rich descriptions of activity in the lab are taken as accurate, the observer has not established that the interpretation of this data in terms of literary inscription is exhaustive or the only way in which laboratory life can be analyzed.  In the authors' words, the observer's account is not "immune from all possibility of future qualification" (88).

==The Construction of a Fact: The Case of TRF(H)==
The next chapter aims at giving a precise account of the way in which this process operates with respect to a single scientific fact: the [[peptide]] [[thyrotropin-releasing factor|TRF]](H).  This historical account, which Latour and Woolgar admit is, like all histories, a "necessarily literary [[fiction]]" (107), has the ostensible purpose of qualifying the initial account given by the observer.  To this end, the chapter focuses on the specific way in which TRF(H) was constructed as a fact, describing how one scientist, Guillemin, "redefine[d] the TRF subspecialty solely in terms of determining the structure of the substance" (119).  As [[molecular sequencing|sequencing]] TRF(H) required far more sophisticated equipment and techniques than merely determining its physiological effects, Guillemin raised the [[cost of entry]] to this field and cut his potential competitors by three-fourths.

The authors next claim that the fact regarding TRF(H)'s structure progressed by decreases in the number of "'logically' possible alternatives" (146).  However, Latour and Woolgar critique the explanation that "[[logic]]" or "[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]" is a satisfactory and complete explanation for the specific way in which a scientific fact is constructed.  Instead, as their historical account of TRF(H) shows, the "list of possible alternatives by which we can evaluate the logic of a deduction is sociologically (rather than logically) determined" (136).  Specifically, the material, technical, and human resources of a laboratory affected what kinds of challenges and counter-facts could be constructed and formulated, leading Latour and Woolgar to later conclude that "the set of statements considered too costly to modify constitute what is referred to as reality" (243).

In the previous section, Latour and Woolgar used a semi-fictional observer to describe the laboratory as a literary system in which mere statements are turned into facts and vice versa.  The most sound and established facts were those statements which could be divorced from their contingent circumstances.  The authors next aim to interrogate how this process operates on a very small and specific scale by looking at how this process operated with respect to the molecule TRF(H), whose molecular structure went through various stages of facticity both in and out of the laboratory Latour studied.  In this section, Latour and Woolgar aim to "specify the precise time and place in the process of fact construction when a statement became transformed into a fact and hence freed from the circumstances of its production" (105).

Instead of trying to construct a "precise chronology" of what "really happened," in the field, they aim to demonstrate how "a hard fact can be sociologically [[deconstruction|deconstructed]]" (107) by showing how it emerged in what they call a network.  A ''network'' is "a set of positions within which an object such as TRF has meaning" (107), and they recognize that TRF only has meaning within certain networks.  For example, outside of the network of post-1960s endocrinology, TRF is "an unremarkable white powder" (108), which leads to the claim that a "well-established fact loses its meaning when divorced from its context" (110).  Latour and Woolgar stress that "to say that TRF is constructed is not to deny its solidity as a fact.  Rather, it is to emphasize how, where, and why it was created" (127).

==The Microprocessing of Facts==

This chapter turns back from grander historical accounts to the micro details of laboratory life. Through analysis of the conversations and discussions between scientists at the lab, it shows that the grander notion of science as a debate of contrasting ideas influences actual scientists only through social mechanisms. Instead of attempting to do their studies more carefully to be sure they get the right answer, scientists appear to only use as much care as they think will be necessary to defeat the counterarguments of their detractors and get the acclamation they desire for their work.

It also notes that the stories scientists tell about the history of their field often omit social and institutional factors in favor of "moment of discovery" narratives. For example, one scientist tells this story:

:Slovik proposed an assay but his assay did not work everywhere; people could not repeat it; some could, some could not. Then one day Slovik ''got the idea'' that it could be related to the selenium content in the water: they checked to see where the assay worked; and indeed, Slovik's idea was right, it worked wherever the selenium content of water was high. (169)

This story is contrasted with another story based on interviews with the participants: The University of California required that graduate students get credits in a field totally unrelated to their own. Sara, one of Slovik's students, fulfilled this requirement by taking selenium studies, since it had a vague relation to her major. Graduate students had a tradition of informal seminars where they discussed these unrelated classes. At one meeting, Sara presented a paper on the effects of Selenium on cancer and noted that someone on campus proposed that the geographical distribution of selenium content in water might correlate with the geographical distribution of cancer rates. Slovik was at the meeting and thought that this might explain the geographical difference in his assay working. He phoned a colleague to tell him the idea and ask him to test the selenium in the water.

One story says merely that Slovik "got the idea"—the other notes that institutions (the University, grad student meetings) and other people (Sara, the colleague) provided key pieces of the inspiration.

The chapter closes by arguing that scientists do not simply use their inscription devices to discover already-existing entities. Instead, they project new entities out of the analysis of their inscriptions. Statements to the effect that "it's amazing they were able to discover it" only make sense when one ignores the arduous process to construct the discovery out of the inscriptions available. Similarly, justifications that the discovery is valid because it works well outside the laboratory are fallacious. Any claims as to whether a new substance like TRF works are only valid in a laboratory context (or its extension) -- the only way one can know that the substance is actually TRF (and thus that TRF is working) is through laboratory analysis. However, the authors stress that they are not relativists—they simply believe that the social causes of statements should be investigated.

==Cycles of Credit==

Scientists frequently explain their choice of field by referring to curves of interest and development, as in "[[peptide]] chemistry [is] tapering off ... but now ... this is the future, molecular biology, and I knew that this lab would move faster to this new area" (191). Desire for credit appears to only be a secondary phenomenon; instead a kind of "credibility capital" seems to be the driving motive. In a case study, they show one scientist sequentially choosing a school, a field, a professor to study under, a specialty to get expertise in, and a research institution to work at, by maximizing and reinvesting this credibility (i.e. ability to do science), despite not having received much in the way of credit (e.g. awards, recognition).

Four examples: (a) X threatens to fire Ray if his assay fails, (b) a number of scientists flood into a field with theories after a successful experiment then leave when new evidence disproves their theories, (c) Y supports the results of "a big shot in his field" when others question them in order to receive invitations to meetings from the big shot where Y can meet new people, (d) K dismisses some of L's results on the grounds that "good people" won't believe them unless the level of noise is reduced (as opposed to K thinking them unreliable himself).

The credibility of a scientist and their results is largely seen as identical. "For a working scientist, the most vital question is not 'Did I repay my debt in the form of recognition because of the good paper he wrote?' but 'Is he reliable enough to be believed? Can I trust him/his claim? Is he going to provide me with hard facts?'" (202) CVs are the major way this credibility is proven and career trajectories are the story of its use. Technicians and minor leaguers, by contrast, do not accumulate capital but instead are paid a "salary" by major leaguers.

The preface to the second edition (1986) reads:

So ''social construction'' becomes just ''construction of scientific facts''. This change indicates a shift from [[social constructivism]] to [[Actor-network theory]], which leaves more room for the non-social or 'natural' (albeit in a non-naturalistic / non-essentialist sense).

The idea of language as a 'system' appears in the linguistic theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[J.R. Firth]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Michael Halliday]].

The paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='System' in systemic functional linguistics==
“System” is used in two related ways in [[systemic functional linguistics]] (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from [[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]] &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, [[Jay Lemke]] describes language as an open, dynamic system.

There is also the notion of “system” as used by [[John Rupert Firth|J.R. Firth]], where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In "Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers" from the ''Ninth International Systemic Workshop'', James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a “Science of Language”. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp1-9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of [[complex systems]].

'''Plant collecting''' is the acquisition of plant specimens for the purposes of research, cultivation, or as a hobby. Plant specimens may be kept alive, but are more commonly dried and pressed to preserve the quality of the specimen. Plant collecting is an ancient practice with records of a Chinese botanist collecting roses over 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plant Hunters|last=Whittle|first=T|publisher=Heinemann|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbaria]] are collections of preserved plants samples and their associated data for scientific purposes. The largest herbarium in the world exist at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], in Paris, France. Plant samples in herbaria typically include a reference sheet with information about the plant and details of collection. This detailed and organized system of filing provides horticulturist and other researchers alike with a way to find information about a certain plant, and a way to add new information to an existing plant sample file.

The collection of live plant specimens from the wild, sometimes referred to as '''plant hunting''',  is an activity that has occurred for centuries. The earliest recorded evidence of plant hunting was in 1495 BC when botanists were sent to [[Somalia]] to collect incense trees for [[Queen Hatshepsut]]. The [[Victorian era]] saw a surge in plant hunting activity as botanical adventurers explored the world to find exotic plants to bring home, often at considerable personal risk. These plants usually ended up in [[botanical garden]]s or the private gardens of wealthy collectors. Prolific plant hunters in this period included [[William Lobb]] and his brother [[Thomas Lobb]], [[George Forrest (botanist)|George Forrest]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], [[Charles Maries]] and [[Robert Fortune]].

== Plant pressing ==
Proper pressing and mounting techniques are critical to the longevity of a collected plant sample. Properly preserved plant samples can last for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/collecting-plants|title=Collecting Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Botanical Garden]] itself holds plant samples that date back to the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804–1806.

=== Sample gathering ===
The first step of plant pressing begins with the collection of the sample. When collecting a sample it is important to first make sure that land you are collecting on allows for the removal of natural specimens. The next step after finding a suitable plant for collection is to assign it with a number for record keeping purposes. This number system is up to the individual collector, but usually involves the date of collection or the sequential number of that collection. Along with an assigned number, observations about the plant's location and live appearance should be noted in detail. These field notes will accompany the finished sample to provide supplementary information about the plant.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing And Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.msuextension.org/publications/AgandNaturalResources/MT198359AG.pdf|title=How to Collect, Press and Mount Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compression ====
After cleaning the sample of any mud or dirt, the next step is to press the sample. Some samples may press better if they have been left to wilt for a few days. However plants should never be allowed to spoil or decompose before pressing, as this will impact the quality of the dried product. Plant presses are most commonly constructed with two flat smooth pieces of wood, and some type of compression mechanism. Compression may be accomplished with tightened nuts and bolts on the corners of the press, with tightened straps around the press, or by placing weights on top of the press. When placing in the press, plant samples should be sandwiched between a few layers of absorbent [[Blotting paper|blotter]]. Newspaper and cardboard are two common choices for blotter material. When arranging the plant in the press it is important to remember that the dried plant product will be fragile and inflexible, so position the plant exactly as you wish the final product to appear. Tighten the press and wait approximately a day to check up on the plant. The blotter should be taken out and replaced with dry blotter roughly every 24 hours. Complete drying time will vary depending on the type of plant, but is generally 7–10 days. Fleshier plants such as succulents will take longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/how-to-press-and-preserve-plants/|title=How to Press and Preserve Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mounting ====
After the plant sample has been sufficiently dried and pressed, it must be mounted. The quality of mounting not only impacts the appearance of the plant sample, but also determines the rate of deterioration the sample will experience. Herbarium quality mounts use specialized paper for the best protection against deterioration.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/botany/resources/general-information/how-to-make-a-plant-collection/|title=Making a Plant Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper can either be 100% alpha cellulose paper or cotton “rag” paper. These types of paper are ideal for preserving plant samples because they are acid free and pH neutral. Samples can be strapped to the paper with linen tape, or glued onto the sheet. If glue is needed, it is recommended that Grade A [[methyl cellulose]] mixed with water be used for optimal deterioration resistance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Storage ====
In order for plant specimens to be kept in good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should be kept in a low light, low [[humidity]] environment. The temperature of the storage space should be kept cool, between 50 – 65 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brit.org/herbarium/plantcollecting/storage|title=BRIT Herbarium|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep the storage space free of harmful pest. It is recommended to protect the specimens by sheathing the sheets in sealed plastic bags. Various [[pesticide]]s may also be used to protect the storage space from pest infestation. If pest infestation has already occurred, the samples should be frozen for three to four days. Freezing new additions of plant samples is a suggested preventative measure against the introduction of pest to the storage space.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Collection of herbarium specimens ==
[[Herbarium]] specimens of plants are collected for a number of different uses. They can assist in  accurate identification and provide a species record for a time and place that can be used in distribution maps. They can also provide biological material for researchers, a reference point to document scientific names and vouchers for research and seed collections.&lt;ref name=qh&gt;{{cite paper|editor=Bean, A.R.|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, A Manual|url=http://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|publisher=
Queensland Herbarium, Environmental Protection Agency Biodiversity Sciences unit, Brisbane
|date=2006|isbn=1-920928-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA barcoding, a new method of identification of plant vouchers, is being used in herbaria across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/dnabarcode/index.htm|title=Plant DNA Barcode Project|website=botany.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] creates their barcodes from a short sequence of plant DNA, which can be easily identified from all healthy specimens of the species. This barcode is then printed and placed onto the plant mount. By creating these DNA barcodes, the process of organizing and loaning plant specimens becomes more streamlined and can be mechanized.

===Voucher specimens===
 
Voucher specimens are select herbarium specimens. What distinguishes these specimens from others is that a voucher specimen is a "representative sample of an expertly identified organism." These specimens are usually associated with a professional research article and are considered to be more official references than a typical herbarium specimen. Voucher specimens can be useful in many ways such as use for comparison when scientists think they have found a new species or when dichotomous keys have narrowed the possible species down to a few that have minute differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why vouchers matter in botanical research1|first=Theresa M.|last=Culley|date=29 October 2013|publisher=|journal=Applications in Plant Sciences|volume=1|issue=11|doi=10.3732/apps.1300076|pmid=25202501|pmc=4103463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant collecting as a hobby ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}

Plant collecting may also refer to a hobby, in which the hobbyist takes identifiable samples of [[plant]] species found in nature, dries them, and stores them in a paper sheet album, a simple [[herbarium]], along with the information of the finding location, finding date, etc. necessary scientific information. As in many [[collecting]] hobbies, rarer specimens have been valued. However, when collecting living organisms, the [[Conservation ethic|conservation aspects]] must precede the collector's ambitions. This has led in some cases to a collector voluntarily taking part, helping scientists, in some research areas, provided he can store the "[[collectible]]". In fact, historically, many [[species]] have initially been found within a collection of a collector.

Usually, a plant can be identified in nature, since they are stationary.
The advent of [[digital camera]]s has led many plant collectors to switch totally to [[photography]]. Some have switched to collecting live specimens of various plant species in their gardens, building a sort of "private [[botanical garden]]". Some have specialized in a specific group, the [[orchid]]s and the [[rose]]s and their [[cultivar]]s are among the most collected.
&lt;ref name="brit.org"&gt;http://www.brit.org/sites/default/files/public/Herbarium/Plant_Collection_and_Preservation_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poaching ==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
Illegal collection of plants is known as plant poaching. A report on the risk of rare plant [[poaching]] has provided data showing possible connections between geography and the rate of poaching in the [[Shenandoah National Park]], Virginia, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John A.|last2=Manen|first2=Frank T. van|last3=Thatcher|first3=Cindy A.|date=2011-09-01|title=Geographic Profiling to Assess the Risk of Rare Plant Poaching in Natural Areas|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=577–587|doi=10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|issn=0364-152X|bibcode=2011EnMan..48..577Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The openings for poaching were found to be increased in locations with easy accessibility, such as roads, trails, and developed areas. The condition of the environment can determine the levels of poaching, with regions of higher quality receiving more attention from poachers.

=== Ethics ===

The hobby and practice of plant collecting is known to have been the cause of declines in certain plant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=David A.|last2=Lord|first2=Janice M.|last3=Given|first3=David R.|last4=Lange|first4=Peter J. De|date=1994-01-01|title=Over-Collecting: An Overlooked Factor in the Decline of Plant Taxa|jstor=1222876|journal=Taxon|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–185|doi=10.2307/1222876}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the result of hobbyists being oblivious to the status of a particular species, collectors of valuable species for profit, or researchers over collecting to fill slots in herbaria. This issue can be solved with proper research on the status of species before a plant is collected and taking the smallest sample possible.

== Safety and precautions ==
While plant collecting may seem like a very safe and harmless practice, there is a few things collectors should keep in mind to protect themselves. First collectors should always be aware of the land where they are collecting. As in [[hiking]] there will be certain limitations to whether or not public access is granted on a plot of land and if collection from that land is allowed. For example, in a [[National park]] of the [[United States]], plant collection is not allowed unless given special permission. Collecting internationally will involve some logistics, such as official permits which will most likely be required to bring plants both from the country of collection and to the destination country. The major herbaria can be useful to the average hobbyist in aiding them in acquiring these permits.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;

If traveling to a remote location to access samples, it is safe practice to inform someone of your whereabouts and planned time of return. If traveling in hot weather, collectors should bring adequate water to avoid dehydration. Forms of sun protection such as sunscreen and wide brimmed hats may be essential depending on location. Travel to remote locations will most likely involve walking measurable distances in wild terrain, so precautions synonymous with those related to [[hiking]] should be taken.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, a manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Plant "discovery" means the first time that a new plant was recorded for science, often in the form of dried and pressed plants (a [[herbarium]] specimen) being sent to a botanical establishment such as [[Kew Gardens]] in London, where it would be examined, classified and named.&lt;ref name="Musgrave"&gt;{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | date=1999|pages= 10–11| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant "introduction" means the first time that living matter – seed, cuttings or a whole plant – was brought back to Europe. Thus, the [[Handkerchief tree]] (''[[Davidia involucrata]]'') was discovered by [[Père David]] in 1869 but introduced to Britain by [[Ernest Henry Wilson|Ernest Wilson]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

[[File:Flamingo Flower Orchid.JPG|thumb|Flamingo Flower]]

Often, the two happened simultaneously: thus Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] discovered and introduced his Himalayan [[rhododendron]]s between 1849 and 1851.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">The '''Political Economy of Research and Innovation''' (PERI) (or sometimes political economy of [[technoscience]]) is an emerging academic field at the interface of [[Science and Technology Studies|science and technology studies]] and political economy.

[[Image:1dfj RNAseInhibitor-RNAse complex.jpg|thumb|The horseshoe shaped ribonuclease inhibitor (shown as wireframe) forms a protein–protein interaction with the ribonuclease protein. The contacts between the two proteins are shown as coloured patches.|250px]]
'''Protein–protein interactions''' ('''PPIs''') are the physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more [[protein]] molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by [[electrostatic forces]] including the [[hydrophobic effect]]. Many are physical contacts with molecular associations between chains that occur in a cell or in a living organism in a specific biomolecular context.&lt;ref name="Rivas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Las Rivas J, Fontanillo C | title = Protein-protein interactions essentials: key concepts to building and analyzing interactome networks | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000807 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20589078 | pmc = 2891586 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000807 | bibcode = 2010PLSCB...6E0807D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proteins rarely act alone as their functions tend to be regulated. Many molecular processes within a cell are carried out by molecular machines that are built from a large number of protein components organized by their PPIs. These interactions make up the so-called [[Interactome|interactomics]] of the organism, while aberrant PPIs are the basis of multiple aggregation-related diseases, such as [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease|Creutzfeldt–Jakob]], [[Alzheimer's disease]]s, and may lead to cancer.

PPIs have been studied from different perspectives: [[biochemistry]], [[quantum chemistry]], [[molecular dynamics]], [[signal transduction]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herce HD, Deng W, Helma J, Leonhardt H, Cardoso MC | title = Visualization and targeted disruption of protein interactions in living cells | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 4 | issue =  | page = 2660 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24154492 | pmc = 3826628 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3660 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2660H }}&lt;/ref&gt; All this information enables the creation of large protein interaction networks – similar to [[Metabolic network|metabolic]] or [[Genetic networks|genetic/epigenetic networks]] – that empower the current knowledge on [[biochemical cascade]]s and molecular etiology of disease, as well as the discovery of putative protein targets of therapeutic interest.

== Examples ==

===Electron transfer proteins===
In many metabolic reactions, a protein that acts as an electron carrier binds to an enzyme that acts its reductase. After it receives an electron, it dissociates and then binds to the next enzyme that acts its oxidase (i.e. acceptor of the electron). These interactions between proteins are dependent on highly specific binding between proteins to ensure efficient electron transfer. Examples: mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation chain system components cytochrome c-reductase / cytochrome c / cytochrome c oxidase; microsomal and mitochondrial P450 systems.&lt;ref name="1996-Hanukoglu"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Hanukoglu I | title = Electron transfer proteins of cytochrome P450 systems | journal = Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. | year = 1996 | volume = 14 | pages= 29–55 | doi = 10.1016/S1569-2558(08)60339-2 | url=https://www.science.co.il/hi/pub/Electron-Transfer-Proteins-Cytochrome-P450-Systems.pdf| series = Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology | isbn = 9780762301133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the mitochondrial P450 systems, the specific residues involved in the binding of the electron transfer protein [[adrenodoxin]] to its reductase were identified as two basic Arg residues on the surface of the reductase and two acidic Asp residues on the adrenodoxin.&lt;ref name="pmid8349601"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brandt ME, Vickery LE| title=Charge pair interactions stabilizing ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase complexes. Identification by complementary site-specific mutations. | journal=J Biol Chem | year= 1993 | volume= 268 | issue= 23 | pages= 17126–30 | pmid=8349601 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=8349601  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent work on the phylogeny of the reductase has shown that these residues involved in protein-protein interactions have been conserved throughout the evolution of this enzyme.&lt;ref name="2017-Hanukoglu-JME"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Conservation of the Enzyme-Coenzyme Interfaces in FAD and NADP Binding Adrenodoxin Reductase-A Ubiquitous Enzyme | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 85 | issue= 5 | pages= 205–218 | year= 2017 | pmid= 29177972 | doi= 10.1007/s00239-017-9821-9 | url=| bibcode= 2017JMolE..85..205H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal transduction===
The activity of the cell is regulated by extracellular signals. Signal propagation inside and/or along the interior of cells depends on PPIs between the various signaling molecules. The recruitment of signaling pathways through PPIs is called [[signal transduction]] and plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and in many diseases including [[Parkinson's disease]] and cancer.

===Transport across membranes===
A protein may be carrying another protein (for example, from [[cytoplasm]] to [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] or vice versa in the case of the [[nuclear pore]] importins).

===Cell metabolism===
In many biosynthetic processes [[enzymes]] interact with each other to produce small compounds or other macromolecules.

===Muscle contraction===
Physiology of [[muscle contraction]] involves several interactions. [[Myosin]] filaments act as molecular motors and by binding to [[actin]] enables filament sliding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=G.M. | name-list-format =vanc |title=The cell : a molecular approach|year=2000|publisher=ASM Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=978-0-87893-106-4|edition=2nd}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, members of the [[skeletal muscle]] [[lipid droplet-associated protein]]s family associate with other proteins, as activator of [[adipose triglyceride lipase]] and its [[coactivator]] comparative gene identification-58, to regulate [[lipolysis]] in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacPherson RE, Ramos SV, Vandenboom R, Roy BD, Peters SJ | title = Skeletal muscle PLIN proteins, ATGL and CGI-58, interactions at rest and following stimulated contraction | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

== Types ==
{{Main|Multiprotein complex}}
To describe the types of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) it is important to consider that proteins can interact in a "transient" way (to produce some specific effect in a short time) or to interact with other proteins in a "stable" way to build  multiprotein complexes  that are molecular machines within the living systems. A protein complex assembly can result in the formation of [[Oligomer|homo-oligomeric or hetero-oligomeric complexes]]. In addition to the conventional complexes, as enzyme-inhibitor and antibody-antigen, interactions can also be established between domain-domain and domain-peptide. Another important distinction to identify protein-protein interactions is the way they have been determined, since there are techniques that measure direct physical interactions between protein pairs, named “binary” methods, while there are other techniques that measure physical interactions among groups of proteins, without pairwise determination of protein partners, named “co-complex” methods.&lt;ref name="Rivas"/&gt;

=== Homo-oligomers vs. hetero-oligomers ===
Homo-oligomers  are macromolecular complexes constituted by only one type of [[protein subunit]]. Protein subunits assembly is guided by the establishment of [[non-covalent interactions]] in the [[quaternary structure]] of the protein. Disruption of homo-oligomers in order to return to the initial individual [[monomers]] often requires denaturation of the complex.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; Several [[enzymes]], [[carrier proteins]], scaffolding proteins, and transcriptional regulatory factors carry out their functions as homo-oligomers. 
Distinct protein subunits interact in  hetero-oligomers, which are essential to control several cellular functions. The importance of the communication between heterologous proteins is even more evident during cell signaling events and such interactions are only possible due to structural domains within the proteins (as described below).

=== Stable interactions vs. transient interactions ===
Stable interactions  involve proteins that interact for a long time, taking part of permanent complexes as subunits, in order to carry out structural or functional roles. These are usually the case of homo-oligomers (e.g. [[cytochrome c]]), and some hetero-oligomeric proteins, as the subunits of [[ATPase]]. On the other hand, a protein may interact briefly and in a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] manner with other proteins in only certain cellular contexts – [[cell type]], [[Cell cycle|cell cycle stage]], external factors, presence of other binding proteins, etc. – as it happens with most of the proteins involved in [[biochemical cascade]]s. These are called  transient interactions. For example, some G protein-coupled receptors only transiently bind to G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; proteins when they are activated by extracellular ligands,&lt;ref name="pmid=18434433"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin K, Sethi PR, Lambert NA | title = Abundance and stability of complexes containing inactive G protein-coupled receptors and G proteins | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 2920–7 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18434433 | pmc = 2493464 | doi = 10.1096/fj.08-105775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while some G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled receptors, such as muscarinic receptor M3, pre-couple with G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; proteins prior to the receptor-ligand binding.&lt;ref name="pmid=21873996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin K, Dong C, Wu G, Lambert NA | title = Inactive-state preassembly of G(q)-coupled receptors and G(q) heterotrimers | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 740–7 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21873996 | pmc = 3177959 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between intrinsically disordered protein regions to globular protein domains (i.e. [[MoRFs]]) are transient interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malhis N, Gsponer J | title = Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 1738–44 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25637562 | pmc = 4443681 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv060 | access-date =  | lastauthoramp = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Covalent vs. non-covalent===
{{Main|Covalent bond|Non-covalent interactions}}
Covalent interactions  are those with the strongest association and are formed by [[disulphide bonds]] or [[Atomic orbital|electron sharing]]. Although being rare, these interactions are determinant in some [[posttranslational modifications]], as [[ubiquitination]] and [[SUMOylation]].  Non-covalent bonds  are usually established during transient interactions by the combination of weaker bonds, such as [[hydrogen bonds]], ionic interactions, [[Van der Waals force]]s, or hydrophobic bonds.&lt;ref name="Jukka" /&gt;

===Role of water===
Water molecules play a significant role in the interactions between proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Janin J | title = Wet and dry interfaces: the role of solvent in protein-protein and protein-DNA recognition | journal = Structure | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = R277–9 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10647173 | doi = 10.1016/s0969-2126(00)88333-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barillari C, Taylor J, Viner R, Essex JW | title = Classification of water molecules in protein binding sites | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 129 | issue = 9 | pages = 2577–87 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17288418 | doi = 10.1021/ja066980q }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal structures of complexes, obtained at high resolution from different but homologous proteins, have shown that some interface water molecules are conserved between homologous complexes. The majority of the interface water molecules make hydrogen bonds with both partners of each complex. Some interface amino acid residues or atomic groups of one protein partner engage in both direct and water mediated interactions with the other protein partner. Doubly indirect interactions, mediated by two water molecules, are more numerous in the homologous complexes of low affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lisova O, Belkadi L, Bedouelle H | title = Direct and indirect interactions in the recognition between a cross-neutralizing antibody and the four serotypes of dengue virus | journal = Journal of Molecular Recognition | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 205–14 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24591178 | doi = 10.1002/jmr.2352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carefully conducted mutagenesis experiments, e.g. changing a tyrosine residue into a phenylalanine, have shown that water mediated interactions can contribute to the energy of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = England P, Brégégère F, Bedouelle H | title = Energetic and kinetic contributions of contact residues of antibody D1.3 in the interaction with lysozyme | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–72 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8993330 | doi = 10.1021/bi961419y | citeseerx = 10.1.1.613.413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, water molecules may facilitate the interactions and cross-recognitions between proteins.

Later, [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] also started to be applied with the aim of unravelling the molecular structure of protein complexes. One of the first examples was the structure of calmodulin-binding domains bound to [[calmodulin]].&lt;ref name="Alberts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NMR&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wand AJ, Englander SW | title = Protein complexes studied by NMR spectroscopy | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 403–8 | date = August 1996 | pmid = 8768898 | pmc = 3442359 | doi = 10.1016/s0958-1669(96)80115-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is based on the study of magnetic properties of atomic nuclei, thus determining physical and chemical properties of the correspondent atoms or the molecules.

=== Domains  ===
Proteins hold structural domains that allow their interaction with and bind to specific sequences on other proteins:

*  ''Src homology 2 (SH2) domain '' {{Main|SH2 domain}} 
:SH2 domains are structurally composed by three-stranded twisted beta sheet sandwiched flanked by two alpha-helices. The existence of a deep binding pocket with high affinity for [[phosphotyrosine]], but not for [[phosphoserine]] or [[phosphothreonine]], is essential for the recognition of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, mainly autophosphorylated [[growth factor]] receptors. Growth factor receptor binding proteins and [[phospholipase C]]γ are examples of proteins that have SH2 domains.&lt;ref name=Berridge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berridge|first=M.J.|title=Cell Signalling Biology: Module 6 – Spatial and Temporal Aspects of Signalling|journal=Biochemical Journal|volume=6|pages=csb0001006|year=2012|doi=10.1042/csb0001006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*  ''Src homology 3 (SH3) domain '' {{Main|SH3 domain}}
:Structurally, SH3 domains are constituted by a beta barrel formed by two orthogonal beta sheets and three anti-parallel beta strands. These domains recognize [[proline]] enriched sequences, as polyproline type II helical structure (PXXP motifs){{Verify source|date=August 2014}} in cell signaling proteins like protein [[tyrosine kinases]] and the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 ([[Grb2]]).&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

*  ''Phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain '' {{Main|PTB domain}}
:PTB domains interact with sequences that contain a phosphotyrosine group. These domains can be found in the [[insulin receptor substrate]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

*  ''LIM domain '' {{Main|LIM domain}}
:LIM domains were initially identified in three [[homeodomain transcription factors]] (lin11, is11, and mec3). In addition to this [[homeodomain proteins]] and other proteins involved in development, LIM domains have also been identified in non-homeodomain proteins with relevant roles in [[cellular differentiation]], association with [[cytoskeleton]] and [[senescence]]. These domains contain a tandem cysteine-rich [[Zn-finger|Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-finger motif]] and embrace the [[consensus sequence]] CX2CX16-23HX2CX2CX2CX16-21CX2C/H/D. LIM domains bind to PDZ domains, bHLH transcription factors, and other LIM domains.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''Sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain '' {{Main|SAM domain}}
:SAM domains are composed by five helices forming a compact package with a conserved [[hydrophobic core]]. These domains, which can be found in the [[Eph receptor]] and the stromal interaction molecule ([[STIM]]) for example, bind to non-SAM domain-containing proteins and they also appear to have the ability to bind [[RNA]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''PDZ domain '' {{Main|PDZ domain}}
:PDZ domains were first identified in three guanylate kinases: PSD-95, DlgA and ZO-1. These domains recognize carboxy-terminal tri-peptide motifs (S/TXV), other [[PDZ domain]]s or [[LIM domain]]s and bind them through a short peptide sequence that has a [[C-terminal]] hydrophobic residue. Some of the proteins identified as having PDZ domains are scaffolding proteins or seem to be involved in ion receptor assembling and receptor-enzyme complexes formation.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''FERM domain '' {{Main|FERM domain}}
:FERM domains contain basic residues capable of binding [[Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate|PtdIns(4,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. [[Talin protein|Talin]] and [[focal adhesion kinase]] (FAK) are two of the proteins that present FERM domains.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''Calponin homology (CH) domain '' {{Main|Calponin homology domain}}
:CH domains are mainly present in cytoskeletal proteins as [[PARVA|parvin]].&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;
*  ''Pleckstrin homology domain '' {{Main|Pleckstrin homology domain}}
:Pleckstrin homology domains bind to phosphoinositides and acid domains in signaling proteins.
*  ''WW domain '' {{Main|WW domain}}
:WW domains bind to proline enriched sequences.
*  ''WSxWS motif '' 
:Found in cytokine receptors

==Properties of the interface==
The study of the molecular structure can give fine details about the interface that enables the interaction between proteins. When characterizing PPI interfaces it is important to take into account the type of complex.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones S, Thornton JM | title = Principles of protein-protein interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–20 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8552589 | pmc = 40170 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.1.13 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93...13J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parameters evaluated include size (measured in absolute dimensions [[Angstrom|Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] or in [[Solvent accessible surface area|solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)]]), shape, complementarity between surfaces, residue interface propensities, hydrophobicity, segmentation and secondary structure, and conformational changes on complex formation.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

The great majority of PPI interfaces reflects the composition of protein surfaces, rather than the protein cores, in spite of being frequently enriched in hydrophobic residues, particularly in aromatic residues.&lt;ref name=Yan&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan C, Wu F, Jernigan RL, Dobbs D, Honavar V | title = Characterization of protein-protein interfaces | journal = The Protein Journal | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–70 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17851740 | pmc = 2566606 | doi = 10.1007/s10930-007-9108-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; PPI interfaces are dynamic and frequently planar, although they can be globular and protruding as well.&lt;ref name=JonesJMB&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones S, Thornton JM | title = Analysis of protein-protein interaction sites using surface patches | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 272 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–32 | date = September 1997 | pmid = 9299342 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on three structures – [[insulin]] dimer, [[trypsin]]-pancreatic trypsin inhibitor complex, and [[oxyhaemoglobin]] – [[Cyrus Chothia]] and Joel Janin found that between 1,130 and 1,720 Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of surface area was removed from contact with water indicating that hydrophobicity is a major factor of stabilization of PPIs.&lt;ref name="pmid1153006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chothia C, Janin J | title = Principles of protein-protein recognition | journal = Nature | volume = 256 | issue = 5520 | pages = 705–8 | date = August 1975 | pmid = 1153006 | doi = 10.1038/256705a0 | bibcode = 1975Natur.256..705C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies refined the buried surface area of the majority of interactions to 1,600±350 Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, much larger interaction interfaces were also observed and were associated with [[Conformational change|significant changes in conformation]] of one of the interaction partners.&lt;ref name="pmid2204619" /&gt; PPIs interfaces exhibit both shape and electrostatic complementarity.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin K, Dong C, Wu G, Lambert NA | title = Inactive-state preassembly of G(q)-coupled receptors and G(q) heterotrimers | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 10 | pages = 740–7 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21873996 | pmc = 3177959 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio.642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Principles of yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems.svg|thumb|left|Principles of yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems]]

===Yeast two-hybrid screening===

{{Main|Two-hybrid screening}}

This system was firstly described in 1989 by Fields and Song using ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' as biological model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Terentiev AA, Moldogazieva NT, Shaitan KV | title = Dynamic proteomics in modeling of the living cell.

The Y2H is based on the functional reconstitution of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 and subsequent activation of a selective reporter such as His3.  To test two proteins for interaction, two protein expression constructs are made: one protein (X) is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB) and a second protein (Y) is fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD).  In the assay, yeast cells are transformed with these constructs.  Transcription of reporter genes does not occur unless bait (DB-X) and prey (AD-Y) interact with each other and form a functional Gal4 transcription factor. Thus, the interaction between proteins can be inferred by the presence of the products resultant of the reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=Jukka&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westermarck J, Ivaska J, Corthals GL | title = Identification of protein interactions involved in cellular signaling | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 1752–63 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23481661 | pmc = 3708163 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.R113.027771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wodak&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wodak SJ, Vlasblom J, Turinsky AL, Pu S | title = Protein-protein interaction networks: the puzzling riches | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 941–53 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24007795 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2013.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases in which the reporter gene expresses enzymes that allow the yeast to synthesize essential amino acids or nucleotides, yeast growth under selective media conditions indicates that the two proteins tested are interacting.

Despite its usefulness, the yeast two-hybrid system has limitations.  It uses yeast as main host system, which can be a problem when studying proteins that contain mammalian-specific post-translational modifications.

In initial studies that utilized Y2H, proper controls for false positives (e.g. when DB-X activates the reporter gene without the presence of AD-Y) were frequently not done, leading to a higher than normal false positive rate.

Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry mostly detects stable interactions and thus better indicates functional in vivo PPIs.&lt;ref name="pmid23017156|noedit"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brettner LM, Masel J | title = Protein stickiness, rather than number of functional protein-protein interactions, predicts expression noise and plasticity in yeast | journal = BMC Systems Biology | volume = 6 | page = 128 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 23017156 | pmc = 3527306 | doi = 10.1186/1752-0509-6-128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wodak" /&gt; This method starts by purification of the tagged protein, which is expressed in the cell usually at ''in vivo'' concentrations, and its interacting proteins (affinity purification). One of the most advantageous and widely used method to purify proteins with very low contaminating background is the [[tandem affinity purification]], developed by Bertrand Seraphin and Matthias Mann and respective colleagues. PPIs can then be quantitatively and qualitatively analysed by mass spectrometry using different methods: chemical incorporation, biological or metabolic incorporation (SILAC), and label-free methods.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

This system was first developed by LaBaer and colleagues in 2004 by using in vitro transcription and translation system. They use DNA template encoding the gene of interest fused with GST protein, and it was immobilized in the solid surface. Anti-GST antibody and biotinylated plasmid DNA were bounded in aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-coated slide. BSA can improve the binding efficiency of DNA. Biotinylated plasmid DNA was bound by avidin. New protein was synthesized by using cell-free expression system i.e. rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), and then the new protein was captured through anti-GST antibody bounded on the slide. To test protein-protein interaction, the targeted protein cDNA and query protein cDNA were immobilized in a same coated slide. By using  in vitro transcription and translation system, targeted and query protein was synthesized by the same extract. The targeted protein was bound to array by antibody coated in the slide and query protein was used to probe the array. The query protein was tagged with hemagglutinin (HA) epitope. Thus, the interaction between the two proteins was visualized with the antibody against HA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramachandran N, Hainsworth E, Bhullar B, Eisenstein S, Rosen B, Lau AY, Walter JC, LaBaer J | title = Self-assembling protein microarrays | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5680 | pages = 86–90 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15232106 | doi = 10.1126/science.1097639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramachandran N, Raphael JV, Hainsworth E, Demirkan G, Fuentes MG, Rolfs A, Hu Y, LaBaer J | title = Next-generation high-density self-assembling functional protein arrays | language = En | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 535–8 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18469824 | pmc = 3070491 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other potential methods===
Diverse techniques to identify PPIs have been emerging along with technology progression. These include co-immunoprecipitation, [[Microarrays|protein microarrays]], [[analytical ultracentrifugation]], [[light scattering]], [[fluorescence spectroscopy]], luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (LUMIER), resonance-energy transfer systems, mammalian protein–protein interaction trap, [[electro-switchable biosurfaces]], [[protein-fragment complementation assay]], as well as real-time label-free measurements by [[surface plasmon resonance]],  and [[calorimetry]].&lt;ref name="Stelzl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pets" /&gt;

=== Computational Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions ===

==== Genomic Context Methods ====
[[File:Rosetta_Stone_Method.png|thumb|'''Figure A'''. Genes of the same color are homologous. Gene P1 in Genome 1 is an illustration of a fused domain or Rosetta Stone sequence. The red portion of P1 is identical in sequence to genes P3 and P5 and the green portion is identical to P2 and P4. Therefore, genes P3 and P2 in Genome 2 are predicted to interact and their respective homologues, P5 and P4, in Genome 3 are predicted to interact.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raman|first=Karthik|date=2010-02-15|title=Construction and analysis of protein–protein interaction networks|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834675/|journal=Automated Experimentation|volume=2|pages=2|doi=10.1186/1759-4499-2-2|issn=1759-4499|pmc=2834675|pmid=20334628}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''The Rosetta Stone or Domain Fusion method'' is based on the hypothesis that if two or more separate proteins in a genome can be identified as fused into one single protein in the same or another genome, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of this is the dihydro-folate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) enzyme, which is found as one protein in ''Plasmodium falcip''arum but as two separate proteins in the human genome. The enzyme has dihydro-folate reductase (DHFR) activity at its [[N-terminus|N-terminal]] and thymidylate synthase activity (TS) at its [[C-terminus|C-terminal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Date|first=Shailesh V.|date=2008|title=The Rosetta stone method|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18712302|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|volume=453|pages=169–180|doi=10.1007/978-1-60327-429-6_7|issn=1064-3745|pmid=18712302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to identify these sequences, a [[Homology (biology)|sequence similarity]] algorithm such as the one used by [[BLAST]] is necessary. For example, if we had the amino acid sequences of proteins A and B and the amino acid sequences of all proteins in a certain genome, we could check each protein in that genome for non-overlapping regions of sequence similarity to both proteins A and B. '''Figure A''' illustrates a hypothetical instance of domain fusion, in which proteins of the same color are [[Sequence homology|homologous]]. Proteins P2 and P3 in Genome 2 and proteins P4 and P5 in Genome 3 are predicted to interact because protein P1 in Genome 1 has a distinct region of sequence similarity with P2 and P4 (colored green) as well as a distinct region of sequence similarity to P3 and P5 (colored red).

''The Conserved Neighborhood method'' is based on the hypothesis that if genes encoding two proteins are neighbors on a chromosome in many genomes, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method is based on an observation by Bork et al. of gene pair conservation across nine bacterial and archaeal genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-09-01|title=Conservation of gene order: a fingerprint of proteins that physically interact|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000498012742|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|language=en|volume=23|issue=9|pages=324–328|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01274-2|issn=0968-0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is most effective in prokaryotes with [[operon]]s, as the organization of genes in an operon is generally related to function. '''Figure B''' illustrates a hypothetical instance of conserved gene neighborhoods, where genes A and B are co-localized in four different genomes indicating that they are likely functionally related.

''The Phylogenetic Profile method'' is based on the hypothesis that if two or more proteins are concurrently present or absent across several genomes, then they are likely functionally related.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Phylogenetic profiles of proteins can be represented as a list of numbers, where a 1 indicates presence and a 0 indicates absence. '''Figure C''' illustrates a hypothetical situation in which proteins A and B are identified as functionally linked due to their identical phylogenetic profiles across 5 different genomes. Protein Link Explorer (PLEX) is a database that can be used to construct a phylogenetic profile for any given sequence across 89 genomes in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Date|first=Shailesh V.|last2=Marcotte|first2=Edward M.|date=2005-05-15|title=Protein function prediction using the Protein Link EXplorer (PLEX)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15701682|journal=Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)|volume=21|issue=10|pages=2558–2559|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bti313|issn=1367-4803|pmid=15701682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, PLEX can be used to investigate domain fusion and conserved neighborhoods between proteins.

===Text mining methods===
[[File:Text mining protocol.png|thumb|500px|Text mining protocol.]]
Publicly available information from biomedical documents is readily accessible through the internet and is becoming a powerful resource for collecting known protein-protein interactions (PPIs), PPI prediction and protein docking. Text mining is much less costly and time-consuming compared to other high-throughput techniques. Currently, text mining methods generally detect binary relations between interacting proteins from individual sentences using rule/pattern-based information extraction and [[machine learning]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Badal VD, Kundrotas PJ, Vakser IA | title = Text Mining for Protein Docking | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 12 | pages = e1004630 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26650466 | pmc = 4674139 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004630 | bibcode = 2015PLSCB..11E4630B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of text mining applications for PPI extraction and/or prediction are available for public use, as well as repositories which often store manually validated and/or computationally predicted PPIs. Text mining can be implemented in two stages: ''information retrieval'', where texts containing names of either or both interacting proteins are retrieved and ''information extraction,'' where targeted information (interacting proteins, implicated residues, interaction types, etc.) is extracted.

There are also studies using phylogenetic profiling, basing their functionalities on the theory that proteins involved in common pathways co-evolve in a correlated fashion across species. Some more complex text mining methodologies use advanced [[Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) techniques and build knowledge networks (for example, considering gene names as nodes and verbs as edges). Other developments involve kernel methods to predict protein interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Papanikolaou N, Pavlopoulos GA, Theodosiou T, Iliopoulos I | title = Protein-protein interaction predictions using text mining methods | journal = Methods | volume = 74 | pages = 47–53 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25448298 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2014.10.026 | series = Text mining of biomedical literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine learning methods===
These methods use machine learning to distinguish how interacting protein pairs differ from non-interacting protein pairs in terms of pairwise features such as cellular colocalization, gene co-expression, how closely located on a DNA are the genes that encode the two proteins, and so on.&lt;ref name="mkgNPJS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganapathiraju MK, Thahir M, Handen A, Sarkar SN, Sweet RA, Nimgaonkar VL, Loscher CE, Bauer EM, Chaparala S | title = Schizophrenia interactome with 504 novel protein-protein interactions | journal = NPJ Schizophrenia | volume = 2 | page = 16012 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27336055 | pmc = 4898894 | doi = 10.1038/npjschz.2016.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yqProteomics"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qi Y, Dhiman HK, Bhola N, Budyak I, Kar S, Man D, Dutta A, Tirupula K, Carr BI, Grandis J, Bar-Joseph Z, Klein-Seetharaman J | title = Systematic prediction of human membrane receptor interactions | journal = Proteomics | volume = 9 | issue = 23 | pages = 5243–55 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19798668 | pmc = 3076061 | doi = 10.1002/pmic.200900259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Random Forest]] has been found to be most-effective machine learning method for protein interaction prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qi Y, Bar-Joseph Z, Klein-Seetharaman J | title = Evaluation of different biological data and computational classification methods for use in protein interaction prediction | journal = Proteins | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 490–500 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16450363 | pmc = 3250929 | doi = 10.1002/prot.20865 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods have been applied for discovering protein interactions on human interactome, specifically the interactome of [[Membrane proteins]]&lt;ref name="yqProteomics"/&gt; and the interactome of Schizophrenia-associated proteins.&lt;ref name="mkgNPJS"/&gt;

== Databases ==
Large scale identification of PPIs generated hundreds of thousands interactions, which were collected together in specialized [[biological databases]] that are continuously updated in order to provide complete [[interactomes]]. The first of these databases was the [[Database of Interacting Proteins|Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP)]].&lt;ref name="pmid10592249"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xenarios I, Rice DW, Salwinski L, Baron MK, Marcotte EM, Eisenberg D | title = DIP: the database of interacting proteins | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 289–91 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10592249 | pmc = 102387 | doi = 10.1093/nar/28.1.289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the number of public databases has been increasing. Databases can be subdivided into primary databases, meta-databases, and prediction databases.&lt;ref name="Rivas"/&gt;

''Primary databases'' collect information about published PPIs proven to exist via small-scale or large-scale experimental methods. Examples: [[Database of Interacting Proteins|DIP]], [[Biomolecular Interaction Network Database]] (BIND), Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets ([[BioGRID]]), Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), IntAct Molecular Interaction Database, Molecular Interactions Database (MINT), MIPS Protein Interaction Resource on Yeast (MIPS-MPact), and MIPS Mammalian Protein–Protein Interaction Database (MIPS-MPPI).&lt;ref name="Rivas" /&gt;

''Meta-databases'' normally result from the integration of primary databases information, but can also collect some original data. Examples: Agile Protein Interactomes Dataserver (APID),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alonso-López D, Gutiérrez MA, Lopes KP, Prieto C, Santamaría R, De Las Rivas J | title = APID interactomes: providing proteome-based interactomes with controlled quality for multiple species and derived networks | language = en | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = W1 | pages = W529–35 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27131791 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw363 | pmc=4987915}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Microbial Protein Interaction Database (MPIDB),&lt;ref name="GollRajagopala2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goll J, Rajagopala SV, Shiau SC, Wu H, Lamb BT, Uetz P | title = MPIDB: the microbial protein interaction database | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 24 | issue = 15 | pages = 1743–4 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18556668 | pmc = 2638870 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) platform, (GPS-Prot),&lt;ref name="Fahey M"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fahey M, Brewer, M | title = GPS-Prot: A web-based visualization platform for integrating host-pathogen interaction data | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 12 | pages = 238 | year = 2011 | pmc = 3213248 | pmid = 21777475 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-12-298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wiki-Pi.&lt;ref name="Ganapathiraju MK"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orii N, Ganapathiraju MK | title = Wiki-pi: a web-server of annotated human protein-protein interactions to aid in discovery of protein function | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = e49029 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23209562 | pmc = 3509123 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0049029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prediction databases'' include many PPIs that are predicted using several techniques (main article). Examples: Human Protein–Protein Interaction Prediction Database (PIPs),&lt;ref name="McDowallScott2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDowall MD, Scott MS, Barton GJ | title = PIPs: human protein-protein interaction prediction database | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = Database issue | pages = D651–6 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18988626 | pmc = 2686497 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interlogous Interaction Database (I2D), [[STRING|Known and Predicted Protein–Protein Interactions (STRING-db)]], and Unified Human Interactive (UniHI).&lt;ref name="Rivas" /&gt;

''Coverage'' differs greatly between databases. In general, primary databases have the fewest total protein interactions recorded as they do not integrate data from multiple other databases, while prediction databases have the most because they include other forms of evidence in addition to experimental. For example, the primary database IntAct has 572,063 interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/about/statistics?conversationContext=2|title=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/about/statistics?conversationContext=2|last=IntAct|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meta-database APID has 678,000 interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cicblade.dep.usal.es:8080/APID/init.action#tabr4|title=Agile Protein Interactomes DataServer: About APID|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the predictive database STRING has 25,914,693 interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://string-db.org/cgi/about.pl?footer_active_subpage=statistics|title=STRING: functional protein association networks|website=string-db.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that some of the interactions in the STRING database are only predicted by computational methods such as Genomic Context and not experimentally proven.

== Interaction networks ==
{{main|Interactome}}
&lt;!--[[Image:Human interactome.jpg|thumb|Network visualisation of the human [[interactome]] where each point represents a protein and each blue line between them is an interaction.|200px]]--&gt;
[[File:Schziophrenia PPI.jpg|400px|right|thumb | Schizophrenia PPI.&lt;ref name="mkgNPJS"/&gt;]]
Information found in PPIs databases supports the construction of interaction networks. Although the PPI network of a given query protein can be represented in textbooks, diagrams of whole cell PPIs are frankly complex and difficult to generate.

One example of a manually produced molecular interaction map is the Kurt Kohn's 1999 map of cell cycle control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwikowski B, Uetz P, Fields S | title = A network of protein-protein interactions in yeast | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 1257–61 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11101803 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/82360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on Kohn's map, Schwikowski et al. in 2000 published a paper on PPIs in yeast, linking 1,548 interacting proteins determined by two-hybrid screening. They used a layered graph drawing method to find an initial placement of the nodes and then improved the layout using a force-based algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rigaut G, Shevchenko A, Rutz B, Wilm M, Mann M, Séraphin B | title = A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 1030–2 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10504710 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/13732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prieto C, De Las Rivas J | title = APID: Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W298–302 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16845013 | pmc = 1538863 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioinformatic tools have been developed to simplify the difficult task of visualizing molecular interaction networks and complement them with other types of data. For instance, [[Cytoscape]] is an open-source software widely used and lots of plugins are currently available.&lt;ref name="Rivas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kohl |first1=Michael |last2=Wiese |first2=Sebastian |last3=Warscheid |first3=Bettina |year=2011 | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Cytoscape: Software for Visualization and Analysis of Biological Networks |title=Data Mining in Proteomics |doi=10.1007/978-1-60761-987-1_18 |pmid=21063955 |volume=696 |pages=291–303 |series=Methods in Molecular Biology |isbn=978-1-60761-986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pajek software is advantageous for the visualization and analysis of very large networks.&lt;ref name=Raman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raman K | title = Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction networks | journal = Automated Experimentation | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | page = 2 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20334628 | pmc = 2834675 | doi = 10.1186/1759-4499-2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of functional modules in PPI networks is an important challenge in bioinformatics. Functional modules means a set of proteins that are highly [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] to each other in PPI network. It is almost similar problem as community detection in [[social network]]s. There are some methods such as Jactive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ideker T, Ozier O, Schwikowski B, Siegel AF | title = Discovering regulatory and signalling circuits in molecular interaction networks | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 18 Suppl 1 | pages = S233–40 | date = 2002-01-01 | pmid = 12169552 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.suppl_1.s233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; modules and MoBaS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = MOBAS: identification of disease-associated protein subnetworks using modularity-based scoring|journal = EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology|date = 2015-06-30|issn = 1687-4153|pages = 1–14|volume = 2015|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/s13637-015-0025-6| pmid = 28194175|pmc = 5270451|first = Marzieh|last = Ayati|first2 = Sinan|last2 = Erten|first3 = Mark R.|last3 = Chance|first4 = Mehmet|last4 = Koyutürk | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jactive modules integrate PPI network and [[gene expression]] data where as MoBaS integrate PPI network and [[Genome-wide association study|Genome Wide association Studies]].

The awareness of the major roles of PPIs in numerous physiological and pathological processes has been driving the challenge of unravel many interactomes. Examples of published interactomes are the thyroid specific DREAM interactome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivas M, Villar D, González P, Dopazo XM, Mellstrom B, Naranjo JR | title = Building the DREAM interactome | journal = Science China. Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 8 | pages = 786–92 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21786202 | doi = 10.1007/s11427-011-4196-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the PP1α interactome in human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esteves SL, Domingues SC, da Cruz e Silva OA, Fardilha M, da Cruz e Silva EF | title = Protein phosphatase 1α interacting proteins in the human brain | journal = OMICS | volume = 16 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–17 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22321011 | pmc = 3275796 | doi = 10.1089/omi.2011.0041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein-protein relationships are often the result of multiple types of interactions or are deduced from different approaches, including co-localization, direct interaction, suppressive genetic interaction, additive genetic interaction, physical association, and other associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Domenico M, Nicosia V, Arenas A, Latora V | title = Structural reducibility of multilayer networks | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | page = 6864 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25904309 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7864 | bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E6864D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signed interaction networks ===
[[File:Genetic interactions between Ras signalling and chromatin remodelling-A.jpg|thumb|500px|The protein protein interactions are displayed in a signed network that describes what type of interactions that are taking place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischer B, Sandmann T, Horn T, Billmann M, Chaudhary V, Huber W, Boutros M | title = A map of directional genetic interactions in a metazoan cell | journal = eLife | volume = 4 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25748138 | pmc = 4384530 | doi = 10.7554/eLife.05464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Protein–protein interactions often result in one of the interacting proteins either being 'activated' or 'repressed'. Such effects can be indicated in a PPI network by "signs" (e.g. "activation" or "inhibition"). Although such attributes have been added to networks for a long time,&lt;ref&gt;Ideker T., Tan K. &amp; Uetz P. (2005) Visualization and integration of protein-protein interactions. In: Golemis, E. (ed.) Protein-Protein Interactions – A Molecular Cloning Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Vinayagam et al. (2014) coined the term ''Signed network'' for them. Signed networks are often expressed by labeling the interaction as either positive or negative. A positive interaction is one where the interaction results in one of the proteins being activated. Conversely a negative interaction indicates that one of the proteins being inactivated.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vinayagam A, Zirin J, Roesel C, Hu Y, Yilmazel B, Samsonova AA, Neumüller RA, Mohr SE, Perrimon N | title = Integrating protein-protein interaction networks with phenotypes reveals signs of interactions | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 94–9 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24240319 | pmc = 3877743 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.2733 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein–protein interaction networks are often constructed as a result of lab experiments such as yeast two hybrid screens or 'affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometry techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen GI, Gingras AC | title = Affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) of serine/threonine phosphatases | journal = Methods | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 298–305 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17532517 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2007.02.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However these methods do not provide the layer of information needed in order to determine what type of interaction is present in order to be able to attribute signs to the network diagrams.

==== RNA interference screens ====
[[RNA interference]] (RNAi) screens (repression of individual proteins between transcription and translation) are one method that can be utilized in the process of providing signs to the protein-protein interactions. Individual proteins are repressed and the resulting phenotypes are analyzed. A correlating phenotypic relationship (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in the same phenotype) indicates a positive, or activating relationship. Phenotypes that do not correlate (i.e. where the inhibition of either of two proteins results in two different phenotypes) indicate a negative or inactivating relationship. If protein A is dependent on protein B for activation then the inhibition of either protein A or B will result in a cell losing the service that is provided by protein A and the phenotypes will be the same for the inhibition of either A or B. If, however, protein A is inactivated by protein B then the phenotypes will differ depending on which protein is inhibited (inhibit protein B and it can no longer inactivate protein A leaving A active however inactivate A and there is nothing for B to activate since A is inactive and the phenotype changes). Multiple [[RNA interference|RNAi]] screens need to be performed in order to reliably appoint a sign to a given protein-protein interaction. Vinayagam et al. who devised this technique state that a minimum of nine [[RNA interference|RNAi]] screens are required with confidence increasing as one carries out more screens.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Successful implementation of RCM will lead to increase in cost effectiveness, reliability, machine uptime, and a greater understanding of the level of risk that the organization is managing. It is defined by the technical standard SAE JA1011, Evaluation Criteria for RCM Processes.(Article 5277)

==Context==
It is generally used to achieve improvements in fields such as the establishment of safe minimum levels of maintenance, changes to operating procedures and strategies and the establishment of capital maintenance regimes and plans. Successful implementation of RCM will lead to increase in cost effectiveness, machine uptime, and a greater understanding of the level of risk that the organization is managing.

The late John Moubray, in his  book ''RCM2'' characterized reliability-centered maintenance as a process to establish the safe minimum levels of maintenance. This description echoed statements in the Nowlan and Heap report from United Airlines.

It is defined by the technical standard SAE JA1011, Evaluation Criteria for RCM Processes, which sets out the minimum criteria that any process should meet before it can be called RCM. This starts with the seven questions below, worked through in the order that they are listed:

:1. What is the item supposed to do and its associated performance standards?
:2. In what ways can it fail to provide the required functions?
:3. What are the events that cause each failure?
:4. What happens when each failure occurs?
:5. In what way does each failure matter?
:6. What systematic task can be performed proactively to prevent, or to diminish to a satisfactory degree, the consequences of the failure?
:7. What must be done if a suitable preventive task cannot be found?

Reliability centered maintenance is an engineering framework that enables the definition of a complete maintenance regimen. It regards maintenance as the means to maintain the functions a user may require of machinery in a defined operating context. As a discipline it enables machinery stakeholders to monitor, assess, predict and generally understand the working of their physical assets. This is embodied in the initial part of the RCM process which is to identify the operating context of the machinery, and write a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The second part of the analysis is to apply the "RCM logic", which helps determine the appropriate maintenance tasks for the identified failure modes in the FMECA. Once the logic is complete for all elements in the FMECA, the resulting list of maintenance is "packaged", so that the periodicities of the tasks are rationalised to be called up in work packages; it is important not to destroy the applicability of maintenance in this phase. Lastly, RCM is kept live throughout the "in-service" life of machinery, where the effectiveness of the maintenance is kept under constant review and adjusted in light of the experience gained.

RCM can be used to create a cost-effective maintenance strategy to address dominant causes of equipment failure. It is a systematic approach to defining a [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] program composed of cost-effective tasks that preserve important functions.

The important functions (of a piece of equipment) to preserve with routine maintenance are identified, their dominant failure modes and causes determined and the consequences of failure ascertained. Levels of criticality are assigned to the consequences of failure. Some functions are not critical and are left to "run to failure" while other functions must be preserved at all cost. Maintenance tasks are selected that address the dominant failure causes. This process directly addresses maintenance preventable failures. Failures caused by unlikely events, non-predictable acts of nature, etc. will usually receive no action provided their risk (combination of severity and frequency) is trivial (or at least tolerable). When the risk of such failures is very high, RCM encourages (and sometimes mandates) the user to consider changing something which will reduce the risk to a tolerable level.

The result is a maintenance program that focuses scarce economic resources on those items that would cause the most disruption if they were to fail.

RCM emphasizes the use of [[predictive maintenance]] (PdM) techniques in addition to traditional preventive measures.

==Background==

The term "reliability-centered maintenance" was first used in public papers&lt;ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by [[Tom Matteson]], [[Stanley Nowlan]], [[Howard Heap]], and other senior executives and engineers at [[United Airlines]] (UAL) to describe a process used to determine the optimum maintenance requirements for aircraft. Having left United Airlines to pursue a consulting career a few months before the publication of the final Nowlan-Heap report, Matteson received no authorial credit for the work. However, his contributions were substantial and perhaps indispensable to the document as a whole. The [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DOD) sponsored the authoring of both a textbook (by UAL) and an evaluation report (by [[Rand Corporation]]) on Reliability-Centered Maintenance, both published in 1978. They brought RCM concepts to the attention of a wider audience.

The first generation of jet aircraft had a crash rate that would be considered highly alarming today, and both the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and the airlines' senior management felt strong pressure to improve matters. In the early 1960s, with FAA approval the airlines began to conduct a series of intensive engineering studies on in-service aircraft. The studies proved that the fundamental assumption of [[design engineer]]s and maintenance planners—that every airplane and every major component in the airplane (such as its engines) had a specific "lifetime" of reliable service, after which it had to be replaced (or [[wikt:overhaul|overhaul]]ed) in order to prevent failures—was wrong in nearly every specific example in a complex modern jet airliner.

This was one of many astounding discoveries that have revolutionized the managerial discipline of physical asset management and have been at the base of many developments since this seminal work was published. Among some of the [[paradigm shift]]s inspired by RCM were:
* an understanding that the vast majority of failures are not necessarily linked to the age of the asset
* changing from efforts to predict life expectancies to trying to manage the process of failure
* an understanding of the difference between the requirements of assets from a user perspective, and the design reliability of the asset
* an understanding of the importance of managing assets on condition (often referred to as condition monitoring, condition based maintenance and predictive maintenance)
* an understanding of four basic routine maintenance tasks
* linking levels of tolerable risk to maintenance strategy development

Today RCM is defined in the standard SAE JA1011, Evaluation Criteria for Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) Processes. This sets out the minimum criteria for what is, and for what is not, able to be defined as RCM.

The standard is a watershed event in the ongoing evolution of the discipline of physical asset management. Prior to the development of the standard many processes were labeled as RCM even though they were not true to the intentions and the principles in the original report that defined the term publicly.

Today companies can use this standard to ensure that the processes, services and software they purchase and implement conforms with what is defined as RCM, ensuring the best possibility of achieving the many benefits attributable to rigorous application of RCM.

==Basic features==

The RCM process described in the DOD/UAL report recognized three principal risks from equipment failures: threats
* to safety,
* to operations, and
* to the maintenance budget.

Modern RCM gives threats to the environment a separate classification, though most forms manage them in the same way as threats to safety.

RCM offers five principal options among the risk management strategies:
* Predictive maintenance tasks,
* Preventive Restoration or Preventive Replacement maintenance tasks,
* Detective maintenance tasks,
* Run-to-Failure, and
* One-time changes to the "system" (changes to hardware design, to operations, or to other things).

RCM also offers specific criteria to use when selecting a risk management strategy for a system that presents a specific risk when it fails. Some are technical in nature (can the proposed task detect the condition it needs to detect? does the equipment actually wear out, with use?). Others are goal-oriented (is it reasonably likely that the proposed task-and-task-frequency will reduce the risk to a tolerable level?). The criteria are often presented in the form of a decision-logic diagram, though this is not intrinsic to the nature of the process.

==In use==

After being created by the commercial aviation industry, RCM was adopted by the U.S. military (beginning in the mid-1970s) and by the U.S. commercial nuclear power industry (in the 1980s).

Starting in the late 1980s, an independent initiative led by John Moubray corrected some early flaws in the process, and adapted it for use in the wider industry. John was also responsible for popularizing the method and for introducing it to much of the industrial community outside of the Aviation industry. (RCM2)

In the two decades since RCM2 was first released, industry has undergone massive change. Increased economic pressures and competition, tied with advances in lean thinking and efficiency methods meant that companies often struggled to find the people required to carry out an RCM initiative.

At this point in time many methods sprung up that took an approach of reducing the rigour of the RCM approach. The result was the propagation of many methods that called themselves RCM, yet had little in common with the original concepts. In some cases these were misleading and inefficient, while in other cases they were even dangerous.

Since each initiative is sponsored by one or more consulting firms eager to help clients use it, there is still considerable disagreement about their relative dangers (or merits). Also there is a tendency for consulting firms to promote a software package as an alternative methodology in place of the knowledge required to perform analyses.

The RCM standard ([http://standards.sae.org/ja1011_200908 SAE JA1011], available from http://www.sae.org) provides the minimum criteria that processes must comply with if they are to be called RCM.

Although a voluntary standard, it provides a reference for companies looking to implement RCM to ensure they are getting a process, software package or service that is in line with the original report.

[[Disney]] introduced RCM to its parks in 1997, led by [[Paul Pressler]] and consultants [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], laying off a large number of maintenance workers and saving large amounts of money. Some people blamed the new cost-conscious maintenance culture for some of the [[Incidents at Disneyland Resort]] that occurred in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/09/local/me-disney9/3 Disney Ride Upkeep Assailed], Mike Anton and [[Kimi Yoshino]], Los Angeles Times, Nov 9 2003 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503055426/http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/09/local/me-disney9/3 |date=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Russia}}
'''Russian architecture''' follows a tradition whose roots were in war [[Kievan Rus']]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|fall of Kiev]], [[Russia]]n [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], the succeeding states of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the including architecture). The great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of Kievan Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic region. The architectural style of the Kievan state, which quickly established itself, was strongly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly built from wood, with their simplest form known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured many small domes, which has led some art historians to infer how the pagan Slavic temples may have appeared.

[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044–52), on the other hand, expressed a new style which exerted a strong influence on Russian [[church architecture]]. Its austere thick walls, small, narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Further departures from the Byzantine model are evident in succeeding Novgorod cathedrals: St Nicholas' (1113), St Anthony's (1117–19), and St George's (1119). The secular architecture of [[Kievan Rus']] has barely survived. Until the 20th century only the [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of the pre-Mongol period. During the 1940s, archaeologist Nikolai Voronin discovered the well-preserved remains of [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]]'s palace in [[Bogolyubovo]] (dating from 1158 to 1165).

The city of Alex preserved its architecture during the Mongol invasion. The first churches were commissioned by the princes; however, after the 13th century merchants, [[guild]]s and communities began to commission cathedrals. The citizens of 13th-century Novgorod were noted for their shrewdness, diligence and prosperity, expanding from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[White Sea]]. The architecture in Novgorod did not begin to flourish until the turn of the 12th century. The Novgorod Sophia cathedral was modeled after the original [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]; it is similar in appearance but smaller, narrower and (in a development of North Russian architecture) [[Onion dome|onion-shaped]] domes replace [[cupola]]s. Construction was supervised by workmen from [[Kiev]], who also imported bricks. The primary building materials were [[Fieldstone church|fieldstone]] and [[Ashlar|undressed]] limestone blocks. It is said that the interiors were painted in frescoes, which have now vanished. The doors were made of bronze.

The [[katholikon]] of [[Yuriev Monastery]] was commissioned in 1119 by Prince Vsevolod Mstislavovich. The architect was known as Master Peter, one of the few architects who have been recorded at this time in Russia. The exterior is characterized by narrow windows and double-recessed niches, which proceed in a rhythm across the façade; the interior walls reach a height of {{convert|20|m|ft}}. Its pillars are closely spaced, emphasizing the height of the vaulted ceilings. The interior was covered in frescoes from the prince’s workshops, including some of the rarest Russian paintings of the time.

The Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior was a memorial to [[Ilya Muromets]]. During the Mongol invasion, Ilya was reputed to have saved the city; the church was built in his honor on Elijah Street in 1374. During this time the city-state of Novgorod established a separate district for the princes, subdividing the city into a series of streets where the church still stands. The church windows are more detailed, the niches deeper and the dome (seen in larger cathedrals) is augmented by a pitched roof.

Another church closely resembling the Church of the Transfiguration is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kozhevniki. It was constructed in 1406, and the primary difference is in building material. The detail is focused on the west and south facades. New ornamental motifs in the brick appear at this time. Brick was also used for the [[pilaster]]s which delineate the façade. It was originally plastered, but underwent restoration after it was damaged during World War II. Its [[apse]] points towards the river, which provides a welcome sight for ships approaching from the Baltic. The shingled roof resembles the [[bochka roof]]s popular at the time. The walls were built from local [[Rubble masonry|quarrystone]], which contrasted with the red bricks. The ground plan of the church is almost square with four pillars, one apse and one dome.

Russian architecure is much more special because it is a mix of Byzantine and Pagan architecture. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.

== Early Muscovite period (1230–1530) ==

The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols]] looted the country so thoroughly that even capitals (such as [[Moscow]] or [[Tver]]) could not afford new stone churches for more than half a century. Novgorod and [[Pskov]] escaped the Mongol yoke, however, and evolved into successful commercial republics; dozens of medieval churches (from the 12th century and after) have been preserved in these towns. The churches of Novgorod (such as the Saviour-on-Ilyina-Street, built in 1374), are steep-roofed and roughly carved; some contain magnificent medieval [[fresco]]es. The tiny and picturesque churches of Pskov feature many novel elements: [[kokoshnik|corbel arch]]es, church [[porch]]es, exterior galleries and [[belltower|bell towers]]. All these features were introduced by Pskov masons to [[Muscovy]], where they constructed numerous buildings during the 15th century (including the Deposition Church of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] (1462) and the Holy Spirit Church of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Holy Trinity Lavra]], built in 1476).

The 14th-century churches of [[Muscovy]] are few, and their ages are disputed. Typical monuments—found in [[Nikolskoye, Volkovskoye Rural Settlement, Ruzsky District, Moscow Oblast|Nikolskoe]] (near [[Ruza, Ruzsky District, Moscow Oblast|Ruza]], possibly from the 1320s) and [[Kolomna]] (possibly from the second decade of the 14th century)—are diminutive single-domed fortified churches, built of roughly hewn ("wild") stone and capable of withstanding brief sieges. By the construction of the Assumption Cathedral in [[Zvenigorod]] (possibly in 1399), Muscovite masons regained the mastery of pre-Mongol builders and solved some of the construction problems which had puzzled their predecessors. Signature monuments of early Muscovite architecture are found in the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Holy Trinity Lavra]] (1423), Savvin Monastery of Zvenigorod (possibly 1405) and [[St. Andronik Monastery]] in [[Moscow]] (1427).

By the end of the 15th century Muscovy was so powerful a state that its prestige required magnificent, multi-domed buildings on a par with the pre-Mongol cathedrals of Novgorod and Vladimir.  They reproduced ancient Vladimir structures in three large cathedrals in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], and decorated them with [[Italian Renaissance]] motifs. These ambitious Kremlin cathedrals  (among them the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition]] and [[Archangel Cathedral]]s) were imitated throughout Russia during the 16th century, with new edifices tending to be larger and more ornate than their predecessors (for example, the [[Hodegetria]] Cathedral of [[Novodevichy Convent]] from the 1520s).

Apart from churches, many other structures date from Ivan III's reign. These include fortifications ([[Kitai-gorod]], the [[Kremlin]] (its current towers were built later), [[Ivangorod]]), towers ([[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]]) and palaces (the [[Palace of Facets]] and the [[Uglich]] Palace). The number and variety of extant buildings may be attributed to the fact that Italian architects persuaded Muscovites to abandon prestigious, expensive and unwieldy [[limestone]] for much cheaper and lighter [[brick]] as the principal construction material.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Middle Muscovite period (1530–1630) ==

In the 16th century, the key development was the introduction of the [[tented roof]] in brick architecture. Tent-like roof construction is thought to have originated in northern Russia,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} since it prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. In wooden churches (even modern ones), this type of roof has been very popular. The first tent-like brick church is the Ascension church in [[Kolomenskoe]] (1531), designed to commemorate the birth of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Its design gives rise to speculation; it is likely that this style (never found in other Orthodox countries) symbolized the ambition of the nascent Russian state and the liberation of Russian art from Byzantine canons after [[Constantinople]]'s fall to the Turks.

Tented churches were popular during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Two prime examples dating from his reign employ several tents of exotic shapes and colors, arranged in an intricate design: the Church of St John the Baptist in [[Kolomenskoye]] (1547) and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] (1561). The latter church unites nine tented roofs in a striking circular composition.

== Late Muscovite period (1630–1712) ==
{{See also|List of Russian church types}}

After the [[Time of Troubles]] the church and state were bankrupt, unable to finance any construction works; an initiative was taken by rich merchants in [[Yaroslavl]], on the [[Volga]]. During the 17th century, they built many large cathedral-type churches with five onion-like [[cupolas]], surrounding them with tents of [[bell towers]] and [[Aisle#Cathedral architecture|aisles]]. At first the churches' composition was sharply asymmetrical, with different parts balancing each other on the "scale-beam" principle (e.g., the Church of Elijah the Prophet, 1647–50). Subsequently, the Yaroslavl churches were strictly symmetrical, with cupolas taller than the building itself, and amply decorated with [[polychrome]] tiles (e.g., the Church of John the Chrysostom on the Volga, 1649–54). A zenith of Volga architecture was reached in the [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl|Church of St John the Baptist]] (built 1671-87)—the largest in Yaroslavl, with 15 cupolas and more than 500 frescoes. The brick exterior of the church, from the cupolas down to the tall porches, was elaborately carved and decorated with tiles.

The 17th-century Moscow churches are also profusely decorated, but they are much smaller in size. Earlier in the century, the Muscovites still favoured tent-like constructions. The chief object of their admiration was the "Miraculous" Assumption Church in [[Uglich]] (1627): it had three graceful tents in a row, reminiscent of three burning candles. This composition was extravagantly employed in the Hodegetria Church of [[Vyazma]] (1638) and the [[Nativity Church at Putinki]], Moscow (1652). Assuming that such constructions ran counter to the traditional Byzantine type, the Patriarch Nikon declared them un-canonical. He encouraged building elaborate ecclesiastical residences (such as the [[Rostov]] Kremlin on the [[Nero Lake]] which featured five tall churches, many towers, palaces, and chambers). Nikon designed his new residence at the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] which was dominated by a rotunda-like cathedral, the first of its type in Russia.

Since the tents were banned, the Muscovite architects had to replace them with successive rows of [[corbel]] arches ([[kokoshniki]]), and this decorative element was to become a hallmark of 17th-century Moscow flamboyant style.&lt;!---Be careful not to link this to Flamboyant Gothic, one of the distinct phases of Gothic in Western Europe. The word means "flame-like" and is applied to an arch or dome which has an S curve, or onion shape.---&gt; An early example of the flamboyant style is the [[Kazan Cathedral on Red Square]] (1633–36). By the end of the century, more than 100 churches in the fiery style were erected in Moscow, and perhaps as many again in the neighbouring region. Among the more splendid examples are the Moscow [[Kitai-gorod#Architecture|churches of the Holy Trinity]] at Nikitniki (1653), [[Church of St. Nicholas of the Weavers|St Nicholas at Khamovniki]] (1682), and Holy Trinity at [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] (1692). Probably the most representative flamboyant-style structure was the Church of St Nicholas (the "Grand Cross") in the [[Kitai-gorod]], brutally destroyed at [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] behest.

As Russian architecture degenerated into the purely decorative, it was also influenced by the [[Polish Baroque|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]. The first [[baroque]] churches were small chapels built on the [[Naryshkin]] family estates near Moscow, so the name of [[Naryshkin baroque]] is often applied to this style. Some of these churches are tower-like, with cubic and octagonal floors placed atop each other (the Saviour Church at Ubory, 1697); others have a ladder-like composition, with a bell tower rising above the church itself (the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession Church at Fili]], 1695). The Baroque and flamboyant-style decoration is often so profuse that the church seems to be the work of a jeweller rather than a mason (e.g., the Trinity Church at Lykovo, 1696). Perhaps the most delightful example of the Naryshkin baroque was the multi-domed [[Naryshkin Baroque|Assumption Church on the Pokrovka Street]] in Moscow (built 1696-99, demolished 1929). Its architect was also responsible for the "red and white" reconstruction of several Moscow monastic structures, notably the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]].

The Baroque style quickly spread throughout Russia, gradually replacing more traditional and canonical architecture. The [[Stroganov]] merchants sponsored construction of majestic Baroque structures in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] (the [[Nizhny Novgorod#Strongest fortress of Muscovy|Nativity Church]], 1703) and in the remote tundra region (the Presentation Cathedral in [[Solvychegodsk]], 1693). During the first decades of the 18th century, some remarkable Baroque cathedrals were built in such eastern towns as [[Kazan]], [[Solikamsk]], [[Verkhoturye]], [[Tobolsk]] and [[Irkutsk]]. Also interesting are the traditional wooden churches by carpenters of the Russian North. Working without hammer and nails, they constructed such bizarre structures as the 24-domed Intercession Church at [[Vytegra]] (1708, burnt down 1963) and the 22-domed Transfiguration Church at [[Kizhi]] (1714).

== Imperial Russia (1712–1917) ==
{{see also|Petrine Baroque|Neoclassical architecture in Russia|Russian Revival architecture}}

In 1712, [[Peter I of Russia]] moved the capital from Moscow to [[St Petersburg]], which he planned to design in the Dutch style usually called [[Petrine baroque]]. Its major monuments include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the [[Elizabethan Baroque]] are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].

[[Catherine the Great]] dismissed Rastrelli and patronized [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architects invited from [[Scotland]] and [[Italy]]. Some representative buildings from her reign are the [[Alexander Palace]] (by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]) and the Trinity Cathedral of the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]] (by [[Ivan Starov]]). During Catherine's reign, the Russian Gothic Revival style was developed by [[Vasily Bazhenov]] and [[Matvei Kazakov]] in [[Moscow]].
[[Alexander I of Russia]] favoured the [[Empire style]], which became ''de facto'' the only style of his period, evidenced by the [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]], the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], [[St Isaac's Cathedral]], and the [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]s in Saint Petersburg. The Empire style's influence was even greater in Moscow, which had to rebuild thousands of houses destroyed by the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of 1812]].

In the 1830s [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] eased regulation in architecture, opening the trade to several incarnations of early [[eclecticism]]. [[Konstantin Ton]]'s pseudo-Russian designs became the preferred choice in church construction ([[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], 1832–1883), while his public buildings followed [[Renaissance]] tradition, exemplified in the [[Great Kremlin Palace]] (1838–49) and the [[Kremlin Armoury]] (1844–1851). The subsequent reigns of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] promoted a Russian Byzantine revival in church architecture, while civil construction followed the same variety of eclectisicm common in all European countries; this featured ever-growing national revival trends, vernacular and imaginary (see [[Russian Revival architecture]]).

Between 1895 and 1905 architecture was briefly dominated by [[Art Nouveau]], most active in Moscow ([[Lev Kekushev]], [[Fyodor Schechtel]] and [[William Walcot]]). While it remained a popular choice until the outbreak of [[World War I]], in 1905-1914 it gave way to the [[Russian neoclassical revival]]—merging the Empire style and [[palladian architecture|palladian]] tradition with contemporary construction technology.

{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

In the first year of Soviet rule all architects refusing to emigrate (and the new generation) denounced any classical heritage in their work and began to propagate [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], the most influential of all [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] themes. Great plans were drawn for large, technically advanced cities. The most ambitious of all was the [[Tatlin's Tower|Tower of the Third Internationale]], planned in 1919 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]] (1885–1953)—а 400-[[meter]] spiral, wound around a tilted central axis with rotating glass chambers. Impossible in real life, the Tatlin Tower inspired a generation of [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] architects in Russia and abroad. The [[Shukhov Tower]], rising {{convert|160|m|ft}} above Moscow, was completed in 1922. According to the initial plans the [[Hyperboloid structure|Hyperboloid Tower]] by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft}} had an estimated mass of {{convert|2200|t|kg}}, while the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris (with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft}}) weighs {{convert|7300|t|kg}}.

Residents of apartment buildings were sealed, they were hooked by new tenants. The so-called communal apartments became the most common type of accommodation for the residents of large cities. In each communal apartment one room belonged to one family, while bathroom, toilet and kitchen were shared. Such a scheme was widespread until the mid-1950s, and in some cities there are more communal apartments. At the same time with the 1930s for senior people began to build houses with separate bedroom apartments, where one family was given the whole apartment. An example of such a house called [[House on the Embankment]] (Dom na naberezhnoi) in Moscow, built in 1927-1931, respectively.

An important priority during the post-revolutionary period was the mass reconstruction of cities. In 1918 [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1873–1949) and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]] founded the [[Mossovet]] Architectural Workshop, where the complex planning of Moscow's reconstruction as a new Soviet capital took place. The workshop employed young architects who later emerged as [[avant-garde]] leaders. At the same time architectural education, concentrated in the [[Vkhutemas]], was divided between revivalists and modernists.

In 1919 [[Petrograd]] saw a similar planning and educational setup, headed by experienced revivalist [[Ivan Fomin]] (1872–1936). Other cities followed suit, and the results of the work carried out there were to make dramatic changes in traditional Russian city layout. The first large-scale development templates (''generalny plan'') were drawn there. The city was planned as a series of new wide avenues, massive public structures and the improvement of workers' housing with heat and plumbing. The first apartment building of this period was completed in 1923, followed by a surge of public-housing construction in 1925-1929.

In Petrograd from 1917 to 1919 the first example of the new style was built on the [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]]— a monument, "Strugglers of the Revolution", designed by [[Lev Rudnev]] (1886–1956). This complex consisted of a series of simple, expressive granite monoliths and became the focal point for further development in Soviet sculptural and memorial architecture.
The most famous construction of this time, however, was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] by Alexey Shchusev. Originally it was a temporary wooden structure, topped by a pyramid, with two wings (for entry and exit). In 1930 it was replaced with the present building, built of stone. The combination of dark red and black [[labradorite]] enhanced its slender, precise construction.

The rapid development of technological processes and materials also influenced constructivist elements in structure design. During the erection of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station (1918–26, architects O.Munts and V.Pokrovsky), the traditional outline on the window arches is still used (despite concrete being used in construction). The [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1927–32), built by a collective of architects headed by [[Viktor Aleksandrovic Vesnin|Viktor Vesnin]] (1882–1950), has an innovative design featuring a curved dam with a rhythmic pattern of foundations.

Creative unions played a large role in the architectural life of 1920s Russia. One of these was the Association of New Architects (''Asnova''), formed in 1923, which promoted the idea of synthesising architecture and other creative arts to give buildings an almost sculptural feeling. These buildings were to serve as visual points for the orientation of a human in space. Members of ''Asnova'' also designed Moscow's first skyscrapers, none of which were realised at the time (1923–1926).

Another innovation from post-revolutionary Russia was a new type of public building: the workers' club and the [[Palace of Culture]]. These became a new focus for architects, who used the visual expression of large elements combined with industrial motifs. The most famous of these was the [[Zuev Workers' Club|Zuev Club]] (1927–29) in Moscow by [[Ilya Golosov]] (1883–1945), whose composition relied on the dynamic contrast of simple shapes, planes, complete walls and glazed surfaces.

Symbolic expression in construction was a feature in works designed by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] (1890–1974), notably the [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1927–1929) in Moscow. Visually, the building resembles part of a gear; each of the three cantilevered concrete "teeth" is a balcony of the main auditorium, which could be used individually or combined into a large theater hall. The sharpness of its composition and the "transition" of internal space (called by Melnikov a "tensed muscle") made it one of the most important examples of Soviet architecture.

{{main|Stalinist Architecture}}

[[Stalinist architecture]] put a premium on conservative monumentalism. During the 1930s there was rapid urbanisation as a result of Stalin's policies, and there was an international competition to build the [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow at that time.
After 1945, the focus was on both rebuilding structures destroyed in [[World War II]] and erecting new ones: [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven high-rise buildings]] were built at symbolic points in the Moscow area. The construction of [[Moscow University]] (1948–1953), by [[Lev Rudnev]] and associates, is particularly notable for its use of space. Another example is the [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|Exhibition Centre in Moscow]], built for the second All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (''VSKhV'') in 1954. This featured a series of pavilions, each decorated in representative style. Other well-known examples are the stations of the [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg Metro]]s built during the 1940s and 1950s, famous for their extravagant design and vivid decoration. In general, Stalinist architecture changed the appearance of many post-war cities; much survives to this day in central avenues and public buildings.

Following Stalin's death in 1953, social and political changes rocked the country; construction priorities and architecture were also affected. In 1955 [[Nikita Khrushchev]], faced with the slow pace of housing construction, called for drastic measures to accelerate the process. This involved developing new mass-production technology and removing "decorative extras" from buildings. On special plants that were built in every major city had launched production of special concrete blocks ready openings for doors and windows of which were built houses. These blocks were brought from the factory ready-made and installed on the steel frame of a house. Houses built in this way were called block houses. All projects such houses have become standardized and have been summarized in several series (for example II-32 series), which were built houses. Projects for a buyout built schools, kindergartens and hospitals were also typical.
This put an effective end to Stalinist architecture; however, the transition was slow. Most projects in the planning state or under construction by 1955 were directly affected; the result, at times, was entire areas becoming esthetically asymmetrical.
A well-known example occurred in the postwar reconstruction of the Ukrainian capital, [[Kiev]], in which the planned [[Khreshchatyk|Kreschatik]] avenue and its central square ([[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Ploschad Kalinina]]) were to form a single rich space enclosed by Stalinist construction. However, as the buildings enclosing the latter were in completion, the architects were forced to alter their plans and the area was left unfinished until the early 1980s. In particular [[Hotel Ukrayina]], which was to crown the square with a look similar to one of [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Moscow's "Seven sisters"]], was left as a solid shape without a top spire or any rich external decoration.

Nevertheless, as the buildings became more square and simple they brought with them a new style fueled by the [[Space Age]]: functionality. The [[State Kremlin Palace]] is an hommage to an earlier attempt to bridge rapidly changing styles dictated by the state. The [[Ostankino Tower]], by [[Nikolai Nikitin]], symbolizes technological advances and the future.
In addition to simpler buildings, the 1960s are remembered for massive housing plans. A typical project was developed using concrete panels to make a simple, five-story house. These ''Pyatietazhki'' became the dominant housing construction. Although rapidly built, their quality was poor compared with earlier housing; their monotonous appearance contributed to the grey and dull stereotype characteristic of socialist cities.

As the 1970s began, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] allowed architects more freedom; soon, housing of varied design was built. Blocks of flats were taller and more decorated; large mosaics on their sides became a feature. In nearly all cases, these were built not as standalone construction but as part of large estates ({{lang-fr|housing massif}}) which soon became a central feature of socialist cities. In contrast to the houses built in the 1950s-1960s, which had up to 5 floors, new residential buildings were higher and could have up to 9 or more floors, although the house with fewer floors continued to be built. Each complex includes an extensive area with a yard for walks, a playground with swings, a sandbox for the games and sites for parking vehicles, which are often supplemented by garages for cars, lined up separately from the residential buildings. This principle remains today.Public buildings were built with a variety of themes. Some (like the [[White House of Russia]]) made direct connections to earlier 1950s architecture, with a white marble-faced exterior and large ''bas-reliefs'' on the wings.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Modern Russia ==
[[File:Moscow City2018.jpg|350px|thumb|Moscow International Business Center]]
As the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union fell apart]] many of its projects were put on hold, and some cancelled altogether. However, for the first time there was no longer any control over what theme a building should have or how high it should be. As a result, with generally improving financial conditions architecture grew at a high rate. For the first time modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented, this resulted in an ambitious [[Moscow International Business Center]]. In other cases, architects returned to successful designs of Stalinist architecture, which resulted in buildings like the [[Triumph Palace]] in Moscow. [[New Classical Architecture]] is also appearing more consistently throughout modern Russia, with a large complex being proposed for [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2014/russias-classical-future/|title=Russia's Classical Future|author=|date=30 September 2014|website=andrewcusack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4701">'''SQLf''' is a [[SQL]] extended with [[Fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] application for expressing flexible ([[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]]) queries to traditional (or ″Regular″) Relational Databases. Among the known extensions proposed to SQL, at the present time, this is the most complete, because it allows the use of diverse fuzzy elements in all the constructions of the language SQL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=SQLf: a relational database language for fuzzy querying|journal=IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems|date=1995|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1109/91.366566|issn=1063-6706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=Knowledge Management in Fuzzy Databases|date=2000|publisher=Physica-Verlag HD|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-7908-1865-9|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQLf is the only known proposal of flexible query system allowing linguistic quantification over set of rows in queries, achieved through the extension of SQL nesting and partitioning structures with fuzzy quantifiers. It also allows the use of quantifiers to qualify the quantity of search criteria satisfied by single rows. Several mechanisms are proposed for query evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=SQLf Query Functionality on Top of a Regular Relational Database Management System|date=2000|pages=171–190|doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-1865-9_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most important being the one based on the derivation principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=On the efficiency of the alpha-cut distribution method to evaluate simple fuzzy relational queries|journal=World Scientific Publishing|date=1995|pages=251–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consists in deriving classic queries that produce, given a threshold ''t'', a ''t''-cut of the result of the fuzzy query, so that the additional processing cost of using a fuzzy language is diminished.

== Basic block ==
The fundamental querying structure of SQLf is the multi-relational block. The conception of this structure is based on the three basic operations of the [[relational algebra]]: [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]], [[cartesian product]] and [[Selection (relational algebra)|selection]], and the application of fuzzy sets’ concepts. The result of a SQLf query is a fuzzy set of rows that is a fuzzy relation instead of a regular relation.
A basic block in SQLf consists of a &lt;code&gt;[[Select (SQL)|SELECT]]&lt;/code&gt; clause, a &lt;code&gt;[[From (SQL)|FROM]]&lt;/code&gt; clause and an optional &lt;code&gt;[[Where (SQL)|WHERE]]&lt;/code&gt; clause. The semantic of this query structure is:
* The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the projection. It specifies the relations’ attributes (or attribute expressions) that will be selected. The resulting table is a fuzzy set and it is given in decreasing ordered of satisfaction degree. 
* The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause specifies also a calibration that is intended to restrict the set of rows retrieved. There are two kinds of calibrations: quantitative and qualitative. In quantitative calibration the user specifies the number of results to be retrieved, so that the query will retrieve the rows with highest membership degrees up to the number of required answers. In qualitative calibration the user specifies a minim level of satisfaction that must have any retrieved row.
* The &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the Cartesian Product. The consult is made on the Cartesian Product of the relations that are specified in this clause. 
* The &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the selection. It specifies the condition for which the satisfaction degree will be calculated. Rows that do not satisfy at all the condition are rejected. This condition is a fuzzy predicate that may involve any attribute of the relations.

The following is an example of a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; query that returns a list of hotels that are cheap. The query retrieves all rows from the ''Hotels'' table that satisfice the fuzzy predicate ''cheap'' defined by the fuzzy set &lt;big&gt;μ&lt;/big&gt;=({{math|∞|size=100%}}, {{math|∞|size=100%}}, 25, 30). The result is sorted in descending order by the membership degree of the query.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT name, address
  FROM  Hotels
  WHERE price = cheap;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Sex manuals''' are [[book]]s which explain how to perform [[Human sexual activity|sexual practices]]; they also commonly feature advice on [[birth control]], and sometimes on [[safe sex]] and [[sexual relationship]]s.

== Early sex manuals ==
[[File:Kamasutra5.jpg|thumb|Artistic depiction of a [[sex position]]]]

In the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
[[Philaenis|Philaenis of Samos]], possibly a [[hetaira]] ([[courtesan]]) of the [[Hellenistic period]] (3rd–1st century BC).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Erôs in Ancient Greece|last1=Sanders |first1=E.|last2=Thumiger |first2=C.|last3=Carey |first3=C. |last4=Lowe |first4=N.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199605507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt7JkvxScSkC|page=287|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved by a series of fragmentary  [[papyrus]]es which attest its popularity, it served as a source of inspiration for  [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', written around 3&amp;nbsp;BC, which is partially a sex manual, and partially a burlesque on the art of love.

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual, although only a small part of its text is devoted to sex. It was compiled by the Indian sage Vatsyayana sometime between the second and fourth centuries CE. His work was based on earlier [[Kamashastra]]s or ''Rules of Love'' going back to at least the seventh century BCE, and is a compendium of the social norms and love-customs of patriarchal Northern India around the time he lived. Vatsyayana's ''Kama Sutra'' is valuable today for his psychological insights into the interactions and scenarios of love, and for his structured approach to the many diverse situations he describes. He defines different types of men and women, matching what he terms "equal" unions, and gives detailed descriptions of many love-postures.

The ''Kama Sutra'' was written for the wealthy male city-dweller. It is not, and was never intended to be, a lover's guide for the masses, nor is it a "Tantric love-manual". About three hundred years after the ''Kama Sutra'' became popular, some of the love-making positions described in it were reinterpreted in a Tantric way. Since Tantra is an all-encompassing sensual science, love-making positions are relevant to spiritual practice.

The earliest East Asian sex manual is the ''Su Nü Jing''. Probably written during the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), the work was long lost in China itself, but preserved in Japan as part of the medical anthology ''[[Ishinpō]]'' (984). It is a Daoist text purporting to describe how one might achieve long life and immortality by manipulating the [[yin and yang]] forces of the body through sexual techniques, which are described in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%B4%A0%E5%A5%B3%E7%BB%8F&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sex manuals include the lost works of [[Elephantis]], by [[Constantine the African]]; ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'', a 12th-century collection of [[Hindu]] erotic works; and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]'', a 16th-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] work by [[Sheikh Nefzaoui]]. The fifteenth-century ''[[Speculum al foderi]]'' (The Mirror of Coitus) is the first medieval European work to discuss sexual positions. Constantine the African also penned a medical treatise on sexuality, known as ''Liber de coitu''. The medieval Jewish physician and writer [[Maimonides]] is author of a ''Treatise on Cohabitation.''

== Modern sex manuals ==
Despite the existence of ancient sex manuals in other cultures, sex manuals were banned in Western culture for many years. What sexual information was available was generally only available in the form of illicit [[pornography]] or medical books, which generally discussed either sexual physiology or sexual disorders. The authors of medical works went so far as to write the most sexually explicit parts of their texts in [[Latin]], so as to make them inaccessible to the general public (see [[Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' as an example).

A few translations of the ancient works were circulated privately, such as ''The Perfumed Garden''….

In the late 19th Century, [[Ida Craddock]] wrote many serious instructional tracts on human sexuality and appropriate, respectful sexual relations between married couples. Among her works were ''The Wedding Night'' and ''Right Marital Living''. In 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published ''[[Married Love]]'', considered groundbreaking despite its limitations in details used to discuss sex acts.

[[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]]'s book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' ''(The Perfect Marriage)'', published in 1926, was well known in [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Estonia]]. In Germany, ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 despite its being placed on the list of forbidden books, the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]], by the Roman Catholic Church. In Sweden, ''Det fulländade äktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. In English, [[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]] has 42 printings in its original 1930 edition, and was republished in new editions in 1965 and 2000.

David Reuben, M. D.'s book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'', published in 1969, was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s. Although it did not feature explicit images of sex acts, its descriptions of sex acts were  detailed, addressing common questions and misunderstandings Reuben had heard from his own patients. Most notably, Reuben dismissed popular medical-psychiatric notions of "vaginal" vs. "clitoral" orgasm, explaining exactly how female physiology works.

''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' by Dr. [[Alex Comfort]] was the first visually explicit sex manual to be published by a mainstream publisher. It was followed by ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' and ''[[The Joy of Lesbian Sex]]''. Its appearance in public bookstores in the 1970s opened the way to the widespread publication of sex manuals in the West. As a result, hundreds of sex manuals are now available in print.

Sex manuals and works of the sort became so popular during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1970s that even religious groups developed their own manuals.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeRogatis |first=A.  |title=What Would Jesus Do?

F. |year=1978 |title=Act of Marriage |location= |publisher=Bantam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manuals such as Marabel Morgan's [[The Total Woman]] emphasized the importance of the female orgasm. While they all required marriage, heterosexuality and complementarianism, they did push the bounds of accepted practice within their respective spheres of influence.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; Today, Christian authors continue to produce similar manuals and guides to their constituents in search of appropriate, fulfilling behavior. Books such as Mark and Grace Driscoll's [[Real Marriage]] encourage Christians to experiment in the bedrooms with their spouses, even encouraging acts that have long been rejected by protestant tradition such as anal sex.

One of the currently most well known in America is ''[[The Guide to Getting it On]]!'' by Paul Joannides. Now in its seventh edition, it has won several prestigious awards and been translated into 12 foreign languages since appearing in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | first = P. | last = Joannides | title = The Guide To Getting It On | edition = fifth | publisher = Goofy Foot Press | place = Oregon, USA | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-885535-69-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816182246/http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | archivedate = 2007-08-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1800">{{about|underground passages||Shaft (disambiguation)}}

In civil engineering a '''shaft''' is an underground vertical or inclined passageway. Shafts are constructed for a number of reasons including:

* For the construction of a tunnel
* For [[Ventilation (mining)|ventilation]] of a tunnel or [[Subterranea (geography)|underground structure]]
* As a drop shaft for a sewerage or water tunnel
* For access to a tunnel or underground structure, also as an escape route

==Construction==
There are a number of methods for the construction of shafts, the most significant being:

* The use of sheet piles, [[Slurry wall |diaphragm walls]] or bored piles to construct a square or rectangular braced shaft
* The use of segmental lining installed by [[underpinning]] or [[caisson (engineering)|caisson]] sunk to form a circular shaft
* Incremental excavation with a shotcrete circular or elliptical lining
* Incremental excavation supported by shotcrete, rock bolts, cable anchors and steel sets or ribs

Shafts can be sunk either dry or for methods such as the caisson method they can be sunk wet. Sinking a dry shaft means that any water that flows into the excavation is pumped out to leave no significant standing or flowing water in the base of the shaft. When wet sinking a shaft the shaft is allowed to flood and the muck is excavated out of the base of the shaft underwater using a grab on the end of a crane or similar excavation method. Because the shaft is flooded, the lining can not be constructed at the excavation level of the shaft so this method only suits methods where the lining is installed before shaft sinking (such as the use of sheet piles) or where the lining is sunk down with the shaft such as the caisson method.

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/rz/v34n136/v34n136a4.pdf El metabolismo social: una nueva teoría socioecológica.] Relaciones. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9095">'''Specimen provenance complications (SPCs)''' result from instances of [[biopsy|biopsy specimen]] transposition, extraneous/foreign cell contamination or misidentification of cells used in clinical or anatomical [[pathology]]. If left undetected, SPCs can lead to serious diagnostic mistakes and adverse patient outcomes.

== Causes ==
According to recent reports from the [[American Cancer Society]], an estimated 12.7 million cases of [[cancer]] were diagnosed in 2008, and that number is expected to rise to more than 20 million by 2030 due to population growth and aging alone. The problem will likely be further exacerbated by the widespread adoption of certain lifestyle factors (smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, etc.) that increase the risk of developing the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cancer Facts &amp; Figures 2012|url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@epidemiologysurveilance/documents/document/acspc-031941.pdf|publisher=American Cancer Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The process of collecting and evaluating the biopsy specimens used to render these cancer diagnoses 
involves nearly 20 steps and numerous medical professionals from the time the sample is originally taken from the patient to the time it is received by pathology for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bronner|first=M|title=DNA fingerprint analysis for specimen identification|journal=Cleveland Clinic Clinical and Translational Pathology Research|year=2006|issue=Fall|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;   With such a complex process executed at a large scale, the potential for a variety of Specimen Provenance Complications is a serious concern for both physicians and patients. 
 
While enforcement of strict protocols and procedures for the handling of samples helps to minimize error, identification issues in anatomic and clinical pathology labs still occur. The most common error is a mislabeled or unlabeled specimen. Another potential complication is the presence of a contaminant tissue fragment - commonly referred to as a floater - that does not belong to the patient being evaluated. Floaters can be introduced in the laboratory during tissue sectioning, processing or gross dissection, or potentially in a clinical setting as well when the biopsy is being performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harada|first=S|author2=Gocke C |title=Specimen identity testing using deoxyribonucleic acid analysis in clinical and surgical pathology setting|journal=Pathol Case Rev|year=2010|volume=15|issue=4|pages=116–120|doi=10.1097/pcr.0b013e3181e69af3}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If one of these floaters is from a malignant specimen, a healthy patient could be falsely diagnosed as having cancer.

== Frequency of occurrence ==
Medical research, reports from respected news organizations and real-life cases document the existence of Specimen Provenance Complications in the diagnostic testing cycle for cancer. One such report from the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' indicates that three to five percent of specimens taken each year are defective in some way, whether that be from insufficient extraction of tumor cells, a mix-up of patients’ samples or some other issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hospitals move to cut dangerous lab errors|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115023520852679334|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study published in the ''Journal of Urology'' in 2014 concluded that more than 1 in every 200 prostate biopsy patients is misdiagnosed due to undetected specimen provenance complications. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wojno|first=K|author2= Hornberger J |author3= Schellhammer P|author4= Dai M|author5=Morgan T|title=The clinical and economic implications of specimen provenance complications in diagnostic prostate biopsies|journal=JUrol|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2014.11.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
A study conducted by the [[College of American Pathologists]] extrapolated that reported misidentification errors from 120 pathology labs would result in more than 160,000 adverse patient outcomes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valenstein|first=PN|author2=Raab SS |author3=Walsh MK |title=Identification error involving clinical laboratories: a College of American Pathologists Q-probes study of patient and specimen identification errors at 120 institutions|journal=Arch Pathol Lab Med|year=2006|volume=130|issue=8|pages=1066–1113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The study further cautioned that the true incidence of both errors and resulting adverse events would be much higher than can be presently measured since the research results were based solely on errors that were actually detected.

To determine an estimate for the rate of occult Specimen Provenance Complication occurrence, researchers at [[Washington University School of Medicine]] conducted prospective analysis of approximately 13,000 prostate biopsies performed as part of routine clinical practice. Published in the ''American Journal of Clinical Pathology'', this study classified biopsy misidentification errors into two segments: a complete transposition between patients (Type 1) and contamination of a patient’s tissue with one or more unrelated patients (Type 2). The frequency of occult Type 1 and Type 2 errors was found to be 0.26% and 0.67% respectively, or a combined error rate of 0.93%. However, each case involves at least two individuals, so this error rate actually underestimates the percentage of patients potentially affected by incidents of biopsy misidentification. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that errors occur across a variety of practice types and diagnostic laboratories, indicating no one setting is immune from this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pfeifer|first=JD|author2=Liu J |title=Rate of occult specimen provenance complications in routine clinical practice|journal=Am J Clin Path|year=2013|volume=139|issue=1|pages=93–100|doi=10.1309/ajcp50wezhwifciv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Additionally, in a study published in the ''American Journal of Clinical Pathology'' in 2015, the researchers at Washington University’s School of Medicine Genomics and Pathology Services center in St Louis, MO, determined that 2% of tissue samples received in their lab for next generation sequencing were contaminated by another person’s DNA to an extent to be clinically significant (i.e. greater than 5% of the sample was contaminated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sehn|first=Jennifer|author2= Spencer D |author3= Pfeifer J|author4= Bredemeyer A|author5=Cottrell C|author6=Abel H|author7= Duncavage E|title= Occult Specimen Contamination in Routine Clinical Next-Generation Sequencing Testing |journal= Am J Clin Pathol |year=2015|doi=10.1309/AJCPR88WDJJLDMBN |volume=144|pages=667–674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As data substantiates, SPCs are an under-recognized problem in clinical practice that warrants further investigation and consideration of additional safety measures such as required [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]] to confirm the identity of biopsy samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marberger|first=M|author2=McConnell JD |author3=Fowler I |title=Biopsy misidentification identified by DNA profiling in a multicenter trial|journal=J Clin Oncol|year=2011|volume=29|issue=13|pages=1744–1749|doi=10.1200/jco.2010.32.1646|pmc=3107764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
In terms of outcomes, diagnostic mistakes due to Specimen Provenance Complications can have devastating results for both patients and the medical professionals involved in their care. One patient may receive an unnecessary treatment that significantly affects his or her quality of life, while the other patient’s cancer remains undiagnosed, and thus continues to advance.

An example of the consequences of SPCs is the story of a [[Long Island, New York]] woman who underwent an unnecessary double [[mastectomy]] due to a misidentification error that caused her biopsy test results to be switched with those of another patient. Consequently, necessary treatment was delayed for the woman who did have breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Celizic|first=Michael|title=Cancer-free woman underwent double mastectomy because of lab mix-up|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/21127917/ns/today-today_health/t/i-dont-want-happen-anyone-else/#.T-nf0heXtr9|newspaper=Today|date=October 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In another case, a young Australian woman received an unnecessary radical [[hysterectomy]], leaving her infertile and dependent on hormone replacement therapy, after her biopsy sample was contaminated with malignant tissue from another patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Medew|first=J|title=The lab blunder that stole a woman's fertility|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-lab-blunder-that-stole-a-womans-fertility-20090904-fbg3.html|newspaper=The Age|date=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To ensure diagnostic accuracy of pathology lab results and prevent these types of adverse outcomes, a DNA Specimen Provenance Assignment (DSPA) aslso known as DNA Specimen Provenance Assay test can be performed to confirm that surgical biopsies being evaluated belong exclusively to the patient being diagnosed and that they are free from contamination.

'''Structural linguistics''' is an approach to [[linguistics]] originating from the work of Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and is part of the overall approach of [[structuralism]]. Structural linguistics involves collecting a [[Speech corpus|corpus of utterances]] and then attempting to classify all of the elements of the corpus at their different linguistic levels: the [[phoneme]]s, [[morpheme]]s, [[Lexical category|lexical categories]], [[noun phrase]]s, [[verb phrase]]s, and [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] types.&lt;ref name="Searle1972"&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/19720629.htm John R. Searle, "Chomsky's Revolution in Linguistics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911081630/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/19720629.htm |date=2013-09-11 }}, ''New York Review of Books'', June 29, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saussure's ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'', published posthumously in 1916, stressed examining language as a static system of interconnected units. He is thus known as a father of modern linguistics for bringing about the shift from [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] (historical) to [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] (non-historical) analysis, as well as for introducing several basic dimensions of [[semiotic]] analysis that are still important today. Two of these are his key methods of [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] and [[paradigmatic analysis]] (or 'associations' as Saussure was still calling them),&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand de Saussure, ''Course in General Linguistics'', Open Court House.&lt;/ref&gt; which define units [[Syntax|syntactically]] and [[Lexicon|lexically]], respectively, according to their contrast with the other units in the system.

== History ==
Structural linguistics begins with the posthumous publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' in 1916, which was compiled from lectures by his students. The book proved to be highly influential, providing the foundation for both modern linguistics and [[semiotics]]. Structuralist linguistics is normally seen as giving rise to independent European and American traditions.

===European structuralism===
In [[Europe]], Saussure influenced: (1) the [[Geneva School]] of [[Albert Sechehaye]] and [[Charles Bally]], (2) the [[Prague School]] of [[Roman Jakobson]] and [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], whose work would prove hugely influential, particularly concerning [[phonology]], (3) the [[Copenhagen school (linguistics)|Copenhagen School]] of [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and (4) the Paris School of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;Siobhan Chapman and Christopher Routledge (eds.), ''Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 107: "Algirdas Greimas".&lt;/ref&gt; Structural linguistics also had an influence on other disciplines in Europe, including [[anthropology]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Marxism]], bringing about the movement known as [[structuralism]].

===American structuralism===
First, in America, linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield|Leonard Bloomfield's]] reading of Saussure's course proved influential, bringing about the Bloomfieldean phase in American linguistics that lasted from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s. Bloomfield "bracketed" all questions of [[semantics]] and meaning as largely unanswerable, and encouraged a mechanistic approach to linguistics. Those working in more or less the tradition of Bloomfield included [[Charles Hockett]], [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.]], and [[Zellig Harris]]. Bloomfieldean linguistics in America was challenged by [[generative grammar]], initially articulated in the publication of [[Noam Chomsky|Noam Chomsky's]] ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' in 1957.

== Basic theories and methods ==
The foundation of structural linguistics is a ''[[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]'', which in turn has two components: a "signified" is an idea or concept, while the "signifier" is a means of expressing the signified. The "sign" is thus the combined association of signifier and signified. Signs can be defined only by being placed in contrast with other signs, which forms the basis of what later became the paradigmatic dimension of semiotic organization (i.e., collections of terms/entities that stand in opposition). This idea contrasted drastically with the idea that signs can be examined in isolation from a language and stressed Saussure's point that linguistics must treat language synchronically.

Paradigmatic relations hold among sets of units that (in the early Saussurian renditions) exist in the mind, such as the set distinguished phonologically by variation in their initial sound ''cat, bat, hat, mat, fat'', or the morphologically distinguished set ''ran, run, running''. The units of a set must have something in common with one another, but they must contrast too, otherwise they could not be distinguished from each other and would collapse into a single unit, which could not constitute a set on its own, since a set always consists of more than one unit. Syntagmatic relations, in contrast, are concerned with how units, once selected from their paradigmatic sets of oppositions, are 'chained' together into structural wholes.

One further common confusion here is that syntagmatic relations, assumed to occur in time, are anchored in speech and are considered either diachronic (confusing syntagmatic with historical) or are part of parole ("everyday speech": confusing syntagmatic with performance and behaviour and divorcing it from the linguistic system), or both. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic organizations  both belong to the abstract system of language ''[[langue (linguistics)|langue]]'' (French for "Language;" or an abstract, Platonic ideal). Different linguistic theories place different weight on the study of these dimensions: all structural and generative accounts, for example, pursue primarily characterisations of the syntagmatic dimension of the language system (syntax), while functional approaches, such as [[systemic linguistics]], focus on the paradigmatic. Both dimensions need to be appropriately included, however.

Syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations provide the structural linguist with a tool for categorization for phonology, morphology and syntax. Take morphology, for example. The signs ''cat'' and ''cats'' are associated in the mind, producing an abstract paradigm of the word forms of ''cat''. Comparing this with other paradigms of word forms, we can note that in the English language the plural often consists of little more than adding an ''S'' to the end of the word. Likewise, through paradigmatic and syntagmatic analysis, we can discover the syntax of sentences. For instance, contrasting the syntagma {{lang|fr|je dois}} ("I should") and {{lang|fr|dois je?}} ("Should I?") allows us to realize that in French we only have to invert the units to turn a statement into a question. We thus take syntagmatic evidence (difference in structural configurations) as indicators of paradigmatic relations (e.g., in the present case: questions vs. assertions). The most detailed account of the relationship between a paradigmatic organisation of language as a motivator and classifier for syntagmatic configurations is that set out in the systemic-network organization of [[systemic functional grammar]], where paradigmatic relations and syntagmatic configurations each have their own separate formalisation, related by realization constraints. Modern linguistic formalisms that work in terms of lattices of linguistic signs, such as [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]], similarly begin to separate out an explicit level of paradigmatic organization.

Saussure developed structural linguistics, with its idealized vision of language, partly because he was aware that it was impossible in his time to fully understand how the human brain and mind created and related to language: 
:Saussure set out to model language in purely linguistic terms, free of psychology, sociology, or anthropology. That is, Saussure was trying precisely ''not'' to say what goes on in your or my mind when we understand a word or make up a sentence. ... Saussure was trying to de-psychologize linguistics.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1992) The Critical I, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07650-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent perceptions of structuralism==
Those working in the generativist tradition often regard Structuralist approaches as outdated and superseded. For example, Mitchell Marcus writes that structural linguistics was "fundamentally inadequate to process the full range of natural language".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Mitchell, (1984) "Some Inadequate Theories of Human Language Processing." ''Talking Minds: The Study of Language in Cognitive Science''. Eds. Thomas G. Bever, John M. Carroll, and Lance A. Miller. Cambridge MA: MIT P, 1984. 253–277.&lt;/ref&gt; Holland&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt; writes that Chomsky had "decisively refuted Saussure". Similar views have been expressed by [[Jan Koster]],&lt;ref&gt;"Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language," Koster, Jan. (1996) "Saussure meets the brain", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., ''Language and Cognition'' '''5'''. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115–120.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Turner,&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Mark. 1987. ''Death is the Mother of Beauty: Mind, Metaphor, Criticism''. University of Chicago Press, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;Fabb, Nigel. (1988) "Saussure and literary theory: from the perspective of linguistics". ''Critical Quarterly'' '''30''':2 (June 1988), 58–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan. (2005) "From Lacan to Darwin", in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005, pp. 38–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others however stress the continuing importance of Saussure's thought and Structuralist approaches. In 2012, [[Gilbert Lazard]] dismissed the Chomskyan approach as passé while applauding a return to Saussurrean structuralism as the only course by which linguistics can become more scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Lazard. "The case for pure linguistics." ''Studies in Language'' '''36''':2 (2012), 241–259. doi 10.1075/sl.36.2.02laz&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthews (2001) notes the existence of many "linguists who are structuralists by many of the definitions that have been proposed, but who would themselves vigorously deny that they are anything of the kind", suggesting a persistence of the structuralist paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Peter. ''A Short History of Structural Linguistics'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of structuralist linguistics upon other disciplines==
In the 1950s Saussure's ideas were appropriated by several prominent figures in [[Continental philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and from there were borrowed in [[literary theory]], where they are used to interpret novels and other texts. However, several critics have charged that Saussure's ideas have been misunderstood or deliberately distorted by continental philosophers and literary theorists and are certainly not directly applicable to the textual level, which Saussure himself would have firmly placed within parole and so not amenable to his theoretical constructs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]]. Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory, Macmillan Press 1988, 2nd ed. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Raymond. ''Theorrhoea and After'', Macmillan, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Glasgow Looking Glass''''' was the first mass-produced publication to tell stories using illustrations, and as such is regarded as the earliest comics magazine.  The final issue was published on 3 April 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's first comic book from Glasgow in spotlight |url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/world-s-first-comic-book-from-glasgow-in-spotlight-1-2974087 |first=Tristan |last=Stewart-Robertson |work=The Scotsman |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
The title was published by Glasgow [[Lithography|lithographic]] printer John Watson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Glasgow Looking Glass|url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/june2005.html|work=University of Glasgow|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its principal strip illustrator was [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath]].  The fourth issue contained ''History of a Coat'', its first comic strip. After the fifth issue, the title was changed to ''The Northern Looking Glass'' to reflect broader Scottish concerns.

==Format==
The fortnightly publication provided satirical snapshots of Glasgow society, British culture and Nineteenth century fashions. Innovations included use of the term "[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]" and [[word balloons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">In astronomy, a '''transit instrument''' is a small [[telescope]] with extremely precisely graduated [[telescope mount|mount]] used for the precise observation of [[star position]]s.  They were previously widely used in [[astronomical observatory|astronomical observatories]] and [[naval observatory|naval observatories]] to measure star positions in order to compile [[nautical almanac]]s for use by mariners for [[celestial navigation]], and observe [[star transit]]s to set extremely accurate clocks ([[regulator clock|astronomical regulator]]s) which were used to set [[marine chronometer]]s carried on ships to determine [[longitude]], and as primary time standards before atomic clocks.  The instruments can be divided into three groups:
[[Image:Meridian Circle - Kuffner Observatory.jpg|thumb|right|Meridian circle at the [[Kuffner observatory]] in Vienna, Austria]]

== Meridian instruments ==
for observation of [[star transit]]s in the exact direction of South or North:
* [[Meridian circle]]s, [[Mural quadrant]]s etc.
* [[Passage instrument]]s (transportable, also for [[prime vertical]] transits)

== Universal instruments ==
which allow transit measurements in ''any'' direction
* [[Theodolite]] (Describing a theodolite as a ''transit'' may refer to the ability to turn the telescope a full rotation on the horizontal axis, which provides a convenient way to reverse the direction of view, or to sight the same object with the yoke in opposite directions, which causes some instrumental errors to cancel.) (Wolf and Brinker 183&amp;ndash;6)
* [[Altaz]] telescopes with graduated eyepieces (also for satellite transits)
* [[Cinetheodolite]]s

== Zenith instruments and Astrolabes ==
* [[Zenith telescope]]
* [[Photozenith tube]] (PZT)
* [[zenith camera]]s
* Danjon [[astrolabe]], Zeiss [[Ni2]] astrolabe, [[Circumzenital]]

== Observation techniques and accuracy ==
Depending on the type of instrument, the measurements are carried out
* visually and manual time registration ([[stopwatch]], Auge-Ohr-Methode, [[chronograph]])
* visually by [[impersonal micrometer]] (moving thread with automatic registration)
* photographic registration
* [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or other [[electro optic]] sensors.

The accuracy reaches from 0.2" (theodolites, small astrolabes) to 0.01" (modern meridian circles, Danjon). Early instruments (like the mural quadrants of [[Tycho Brahe]]) had ''no telescope'' and were limited to about 0.01°.

[[File:Horrocks observing the 1639 transit of Venus by Eyre Crowe.jpg|thumb|Jeremiah Horrocks observing the 1639 transit of Venus (''The Founder of English Astronomy'' by [[Eyre Crowe (painter)|Eyre Crowe]], 1891)]]

The first known observations and recording of a [[transit of Venus]] were made in 1639 by the English [[astronomer]]s [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] and his friend and correspondent [[William Crabtree]].&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt; The pair made their observations independently on 4&amp;nbsp;December that year (24&amp;nbsp;November under the [[Julian calendar]] then used in England); Horrocks from [[Carr House (Bretherton, Lancashire, England)|Carr House]], then in the village of [[Much Hoole]], [[Lancashire]], and Crabtree from his home in [[Broughton, Greater Manchester|Broughton]], near [[Manchester]].

The friends, followers of the new astronomy of [[Johannes Kepler]], were self-taught [[Theoretical astronomy#Tools of theoretical astronomy|mathematical astronomers]] who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler's [[Rudolphine tables]] by observation and measurement. In 1639, Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent; others became aware of it only after the event when Horrocks's report of it was circulated. Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations, their ground-breaking work was influential in establishing the size of the Solar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]], are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy.

==Background==
[[File:Kepler's 1631 notice.jpg|thumb|right|Kepler's ''De raris mirisque Anni 1631'' notice to astronomers of the impending transits of Mercury and Venus, 1631]]
By the 17th century, two developments allowed for the [[Astronomical transit|transits]] of planets across the face of the Sun to be predicted and observed: the [[telescope]] and the new astronomy of [[Johannes Kepler]], which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, [[Orbit|planetary orbits]].&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt;

In 1627, Kepler published his [[Rudolphine Tables]]. Two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet ''De raris mirisque Anni 1631'' which included an ''admonitio ad astronomos'' (warning to astronomers) concerning a [[transit of Mercury]] in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761.

===Jeremiah Horrocks===
{{main|Jeremiah Horrocks}}
Jeremiah Horrocks (1618&amp;nbsp;– 3&amp;nbsp;January 1641)&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt; was born in Lower Lodge, [[Toxteth|Toxteth Park]] – now part of [[Liverpool]] but at that time a separate town. His father James was a [[watchmaker]], and his mother Mary Aspinwall was from a notable Toxteth Park family.&lt;ref name="Aughton 2004 115"&gt;{{harvnb |Aughton |2004 |p=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of the Aspinwall family were also in the watchmaking trade, and it is said that a watchmaker uncle first interested Jeremiah in astronomy.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Horrocks.html |title=Jeremiah Horrocks |last=O'Connor |first=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E. F. |date=2004 |work=Biographies |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremiah joined [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] on 11 May 1632 and [[matriculation|matriculated]] as a member of the [[University of Cambridge]] on 5 July 1632 as a [[sizar]], which meant he did not have the means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees.&lt;ref name="MCS" /&gt;  At Cambridge, he would have studied [[the arts]], [[classical languages]], a little [[geometry]], and some traditional astronomy, but not the latest work by Galileo, [[Tycho Brahe]] and Kepler. He used his spare time to teach himself the more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with the latest thinking.&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt; Horrocks read most of the astronomical treatises of his day, identified their weaknesses, and was suggesting new lines of research by the age of 17. In 1635, he left Cambridge without formally [[graduation|graduating]], presumably owing to the cost of the graduation ceremony.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{acad |id=HRS632J |name=Horrox, Jeremiah }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving Cambridge, Horrocks returned to his home in Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest, the study of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Aughton |2004 |p=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1639, he left home and moved about 18 miles along the coast to the village of [[Much Hoole]]. This was probably to become [[tutor]] to the children of the Stones family, prosperous [[haberdasher]]s who lived at [[Carr House (Bretherton, Lancashire, England)|Carr House]], within the [[Bank Hall]] Estate, Bretherton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Aughton |2004 |p=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the [[Moon]] moved in an elliptical path around the Earth. He also wrote a treatise on Keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically the properties of the force that became known as [[gravity]]. Decades later, [[Isaac Newton]] acknowledged Horrocks's work in relation to the Moon in Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Isaac; '[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]', Book 3, Proposition 35, Scholium&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Crabtree===
{{Main|William Crabtree}}
[[File:Ivy Cottage, Broughton, Salford.jpg|thumb|Ivy Cottage, Broughton: the house from which William Crabtree is thought to have made his observation of the transit]]
William Crabtree (1610–1644) was a cloth merchant from Broughton Spout, a hamlet in the [[township]] of Broughton near [[Manchester]], which is now part of [[City of Salford|Salford]]. The son of John Crabtree, a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means, and Isabel Crabtree (née Pendleton), he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester&amp;nbsp;– probably the forerunner of [[Manchester Grammar School]], which was then situated between the [[Manchester Cathedral|Collegiate Church]] and what is now [[Chetham's School of Music]]. He worked in Manchester, married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]. He carefully measured the movements of the planets, undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing [[Rudolphine Tables]] with improved accuracy. He maintained an active correspondence, much of it now lost, with Horrocks, two other young astronomers&amp;nbsp;– [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] and [[Towneley (family)|Christopher Towneley]]&amp;nbsp;– and [[Samuel Foster]], Professor of astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London and [[alumnus]] of Emmanuel College.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"&gt;"Crabtree, William." Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, 2008; Retrieved May 10, 2012 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901016.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree ever met in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly, and, because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler, referred to themselves, along with William Gascoigne, as ''nos Keplari'' (we Keplarians).&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom 2"/&gt;

Crabtree’s observations had convinced him that, despite their errors, Kepler’s Rudolphine Tables were superior to the commonly used [[Philip Van Lansberg|Lansberg's tables]], and he became one of the first converts to Kepler’s new astronomy. By 1637, he had convinced Horrocks of the superiority of the Keplerian system, and, using their own planetary observations, both men made many corrections to Kepler's tables, which Crabtree converted to decimal form.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia" /&gt;

===Transit of Mercury===
On 29 September 1638, Horrocks wrote to Crabtree about a likely forthcoming transit of Mercury on 21 October 1638 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]) which Kepler had not predicted. He explained that he intended to construct what would later be called a [[helioscope]] by attaching his telescope to an "oblong stick, carrying a plane surface at right angles to itself on which to receive the Sun’s image", and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings on a sheet of paper on which to project the image of the Sun. In the event, no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit, but the exercise proved to be an important dry-run for the later observation of the transit of Venus.&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt;

In October 1639, Horrocks had calculated that transits of Venus occur not singly, but in pairs eight years apart,&lt;ref name="UCLAN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/history.htm |title=Transit of Venus |last=Anonymous |work=History |publisher=University of Central Lancashire |accessdate=14 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730175223/http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/history.htm |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and realised that the second transit would occur in less than four weeks. He was convinced that a measurement could be made of the apparent diameter of the planet to within a fraction of a [[Minute of arc|second of arc]] when it was seen as a dull black disk on the face of the Sun, compared to an accuracy of around one minute of arc when seen in its normal position as the bright morning star close to the Sun.&lt;ref name="Aughton 2004 115"/&gt; He wrote to his younger brother and to Crabtree in Broughton, advising them to observe the event on Sunday, 24 November (4 December New Style).&lt;ref name="Marston"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/conference/history.html |title=History of Jeremiah Horrocks |last=Marston |first=Paul |work=Extracted from course notes for Great Astronomers in History |publisher=University of Central Lancashire |accessdate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115182600/http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/conference/history.html |archivedate=15 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote Horrocks: "The more accurate calculations of Rudolphi very much confirmed my expectations; and I rejoiced exceedingly in the prospect of seeing Venus".&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt;

[[File:Horrocks Venus in sole.jpg|thumb|An image of the solar disk Hevelius added to his report, based on Horrocks's description of his observation. The image does not, however, give a true representation of what Horrocks would have seen.{{refn| According to Van Roode (2012), Horrocks actually wrote “ad sinistram” (to the left) rather than “ad dextram”, as does a letter from Nicolaus Mercator to Samuel Hartlib, quoting directly from Horrocks's own writing. Hevelius thought Horrocks was in error and changed it to “ad dextram”. John Wallis also added the note “lege dextram” (read right) after “sinistram” in his ''Opera Posthuma'' of Horrocks.
Van Roode assumes from this that both Hevelius and Wallis must have been confused about the orientation of the projected image from a Galileian telescope&amp;nbsp;– which is inverted top to bottom, but not left to right. Also. the three disks of Venus are evenly spaced whereas the observations were made at intervals of 20 and 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="Van Roode"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transitofvenus.nl/wp/2012/01/25/what-did-horrocks-really-see/ |title=What did Horrocks really see? |last=Van Roode |first=Steven |date=25 January 2012 |work=The Transit of Venus Project |publisher=astonomerswithoutborders.org |accessdate=11 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606002057/http://transitofvenus.nl/wp/2012/01/25/what-did-horrocks-really-see/ |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In A.B. Whatton's translation of ''Venus in sole Visa'' Horrocks writes:
"I found that the shadow of Venus at the aforesaid hour, namely fifteen minutes past three, had entered the Sun's disk about 620 30', certainly between 600 and 650, from the top towards the right. This was the appearance in the dark apartment; therefore out of doors beneath the open sky, according to the laws of optics, the contrary would be the case, and Venus would be below the centre of the Sun, distant 620 30' from the lower limb, or the nadir, as the Arabians term it."&lt;ref name="MaunderMoore"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1852336218 |lay-url=http://www.venus-transit.de/1639/horrox.htm |url=http://www.venus-transit.de/1639/horrox.htm |last1=Maunder |first1=M. |last2=Moore |first2=P. |date=2000 |lay-source=Transit&amp;nbsp;– When Planets cross the Sun |publisher=Springer-Verlag London Limited |accessdate=14 May 2012 |title=Jeremiah Horrox: Venus in sole visa }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}]]
Horrocks was concerned that the weather would be unfavourable for the transit as he believed the rare planetary conjunction would produce severe weather:

{{quote|text=The chance of a clouded atmosphere caused me much anxiety; for Jupiter and Mercury were in conjunction with the Sun almost at the same time as Venus. This remarkable assemblage of the planets (as if they were desirous of beholding, in common with ourselves, the wonders of the heavens, and of adding to the splendour of the scene), seemed to forebode great severity of weather. Mercury, whose conjunction with the Sun is invariably attended with storm and tempest, was especially to be feared. In this apprehension I coincide with the opinion of the astrologers, because it is confirmed by experience; but in other respects I cannot help despising their more puerile vanities.|sign=Jeremiah Horrocks|source=''Venus in sole visa''&lt;ref name="MaunderMoore" /&gt;}}

At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened his room and focused the rays of sunlight coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Aughton |2004 |p=112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm, and observed for half an hour until sunset at 3:53&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name="MaunderMoore"/&gt;

{{quote|text=When the time of the observation approached, I retired to my apartment, and having closed the windows against the light, I directed my telescope, previously adjusted to a focus, through the aperture towards the Sun and received his rays at right angles upon the paper&amp;nbsp;... I watched carefully on the 24th from sunrise to nine o'clock, and from a little before ten until noon, and at one in the afternoon, being called away in the intervals by business of the highest importance which, for these ornamental pursuits, I could not with propriety neglect&amp;nbsp;... About fifteen minutes past three in the afternoon, when I was again at liberty to continue my labours, the clouds, as if by divine interposition, were entirely dispersed&amp;nbsp;... I then beheld a most agreeable spectacle, the object of my sanguine wishes, a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly circular shape, which had already fully entered upon the Sun's disk on the left&amp;nbsp;... Not doubting that this was really the shadow of the planet, I immediately applied myself sedulously to observe it&amp;nbsp;... although Venus continued on the disk for several hours, she was not visible to me longer than half-an-hour, on account of [the Sun] so quickly setting&amp;nbsp;... The inclination was the only point upon which I failed to attain the utmost precision; for, owing to the rapid motion of the Sun, it was difficult to observe with certainty to a single degree&amp;nbsp;... But all the rest is sufficiently accurate, and as exact as I could desire.|sign=Jeremiah Horrocks|source=''Venus in sole visa'''
&lt;ref name="MaunderMoore" /&gt;{{refn|For the full text of Horrocks's account of the observation see [http://www.venus-transit.de/1639/horrox.htm Jeremiah Horrox: Venus in sole visa].|group="note"}}}}
Crabtree made his observations using a similar set-up but had insufficient time to make any measurements, as it was cloudy in Broughton, and thus he only saw the transit briefly. According to Horrocks: "Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time, scarcely trusting his own senses, through excess of joy&amp;nbsp;... In a little while, the clouds again obscured the face of the Sun, so that he could observe nothing more than that Venus was certainly on the disc at the time."&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt;  Afterwards, he made "so rapid a sketch" of Venus as it had passed across the Sun's disc, allowing Crabtree to estimate the angular size of Venus to be 1' 3", accurate to within 1 second of arc of its actual size; Horrocks's estimate of 1' 12" was less accurate.&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt;

==Results==
Kepler had found that the distance between the planets increased in proportion to their distance from the Sun, and this led him to assume that the universe was created with a divine harmony, and that the size of the planets would increase in the same way. He had written in 1618, "Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitude should be the same as the order of the spheres".&lt;ref name="Hughes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=David |date=February 2005 |title=Horrocks's bogus law |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |publisher=The Royal Society |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1.14-1.16 |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=2005A%26G....46a..14H&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES |accessdate=4 June 2012 |bibcode=2005A&amp;G....46a..14H|doi = 10.1046/j.1468-4004.2003.46114.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Horrocks's measurements of Venus, coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi, seemed to confirm this, Horrocks tentatively{{refn|Horrocks wrote in ''Venus in sole visa'' "I do not put forward this conjecture as a certain demonstration, but as a probability".&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt;|group="note"}} proposed a law which stated that all planets (with the exception of Mars) would be the same angular size when viewed from the Sun, this being 28 arc seconds. This meant that the assumption Kepler had made about the sizes of the planets held true, and led Horrocks to the false conclusion that the distance between each planet and the Sun was about 15,000 times its radius. Thus he estimated the average distance from the Earth to the Sun to be approximately 60 million miles (97 million km), suggesting that the Solar System was ten times larger than traditionally believed.&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dioi.org/kn/birth.htm |title=Horrocks and the Dawn of British Astronomy |last=Kollerstrom |first=Nicholas |date=1998 |publisher=University College London |accessdate=11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes" /&gt; His figure was much lower than the 93&amp;nbsp;million miles (150&amp;nbsp;million km) that the [[Astronomical Unit]] is known to be today, but, despite being based on a false premise, was more accurate than any suggested up to that time.

By 1640, Gascoigne had developed a [[reticle]] and a [[micrometer]] for his telescope, both of which would have been invaluable to Horrocks. He showed them to Crabtree, who told Horrocks about them, and reported back to Gascoigne saying: "My friend Mr Horrox professeth, that little Touch I gave him, hath ravished his mind quite from itself, and left him in an Exstasie between Admiration and Amazement. I beseech you, Sir, slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders."&lt;ref name="Chapman IAU" /&gt;

Horrocks produced several drafts of a Latin treatise ''Venus in sole visa'' (Venus seen on the Sun) based on his observations, which he presumably intended to publish, but he died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641, aged 22.&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Horrocks window Much Hoole Church.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial to Jeremiah Horrocks in St Michael's Church, Hoole.

Some of the drafts of ''Venus in Sole Visa'' were kept by Crabtree, who died in 1644, three years after Horrocks. Their other correspondent, William Gascoigne, died the same year in the [[Battle of Marston Moor]]. Horrocks's papers remained with his family for a short time; some were destroyed during the [[English civil war|civil war]], some were taken to Ireland by a brother, Jonas, and never seen again, and others passed into the collection of [[antiquarian]] and astronomer, Christopher Towneley, where they were consulted by Jeremy Shakerley, who wrote three books on astronomy in the mid-17th century.&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt; Others were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. The manuscripts were widely circulated from the late 1650s although they remained unpublished for many years.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

The coronation of King Charles II took place on 23 April 1661 (3 May, New Style), the day of a Mercury transit across the Sun. Dutch astronomer [[Christiaan Huygens]] attended the coronation, during which he heard about the Horrocks's manuscript, found in 1659 by [[John Worthington (academic)|John Worthington]] (Master of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] and [[alumnus]] of Emmanuel College, where he was a contemporary of Horrocks),&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt; together with some fragments of correspondence with Crabtree.&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Roode" /&gt; Huygens knew the eminent Polish astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]], and gave him the manuscript copy. Hevelius appended it to his report on the Mercury transit, ''Mercurius in sole visus Gedani'', published in 1662.&lt;ref name="Kollerstrom" /&gt; The publication of ''Venus in Sole Visa'' by Hevelius caused great consternation at the newly founded [[Royal Society]] when it was realised that such an elegant and important paper by an Englishman had been neglected in his own country for so long. The mathematician [[John Wallis]], who was a friend of Horrocks at Emmanuel College, and a founder member and leading light of the society, summed up the view of its members when he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I cannot help being displeased, that this valuable observation, purchasable with no money, elegantly described and prepared for the press, should have laid for two-and-twenty years, and that no-one should have been found to take charge of so fair an offspring at its father's death, to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country's credit and for the advantage of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Aughton |2004 |pp=1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Royal Society assumed responsibility for publication of most of the remainder of Horrocks's work as ''Jeremiae Horroccii Opera Posthuma'' in 1672–73.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

The recording of the transit is seen by many as the birth of modern astronomy in Britain.&lt;ref name="Chapman IAU"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=Allan |date=2004 |title=Jeremiah Horrocks, William Crabtree, and the Lancashire observations of the transit of Venus of 1639 |journal=Transits of Venus: new views of the solar system and galaxy: proceedings of the 196th Colloquium of the International Astronomical Union held in Preston, Lancashire, United Kingdom: 7–11 June 2004 |publisher=International Astronomical Union |volume=196 |url=http://www.gbv.de/dms/goettingen/490847641.pdf |accessdate=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flamsteed|John Flamsteed]] later said he regarded Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to [[Galileo]] and Kepler.&lt;ref name="Chapman IAU" /&gt; and began his three folio volume, ''Historia Coelestis Britannica'' (1745) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643.&lt;ref name="Chapman IAU" /&gt;

[[File:Broughton, transit of Venus.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating Crabtree's observation near his home in Broughton]]
During the 19th century there was a revival of interest in Horrocks's and Crabtree's achievement. Rev. A. B. Whatton, who translated ''Venus in sole visa'' from Latin, assumed that Horrocks's comment about "business of the highest importance which, for these ornamental pursuits, I could not with propriety neglect" must have referred to the duties of a curate. It seems more probable they were his duties as tutor at the house, or perhaps his "business" was merely to attend the church.&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt; The notion of the impoverished curate gained popular traction and in 1874, after much lobbying, a memorial was mounted in Westminster Abbey opposite to that of Newton which reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In memory of Jeremiah Horrocks, Curate of Hoole in Lancashire who died on 3rd of Jan, 1641 in or near his 22nd year.

Having in so short a life detected the long inequality in the mean motion of Jupiter and Saturn discovered the orbit of the moon to be an ellipse determined the motion of the lunar apse suggested the physical cause of its revolution and of Venus which was seen by himself and his friend William Crabtree on Sunday the 24th of November (O.S.) 1639. This tablet facing the monument of Newton was raised after the lapse of more than two centuries. Dec. 9, 1874.&lt;ref name="Marston" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Rev. Robert Brickel, Rector of St. Michael's Church, Hoole from 1848–1881, raised money by public subscription in Lancashire, [[Oxford]] and Cambridge to fund the creation of a new [[chancel]] and [[sanctuary#Religious sanctuary|sanctuary]] to the church to be named "The Horrocks Chapel". The chancel was completed by 1824, and the sanctuary by 1858. The vestry was extended in 1998–1999, and the first window in the north wall, originally installed in 1872, has stained glass roundels commemorating the transits of Venus of 1874 and 2004. There is also a marble tablet commemorating Horrocks. The church clock, contributed by the parishioners as their commemoration of Horrocks, was installed in 1859; the sundial, installed in 1875, has a quotation from Horrocks ("Sine Sole Sileo") that translates as "Without the sun I am silent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoolevillage.com/home/st_michaels/guide_stmichaels_church.html |title=St Michael's Church, Hoole; Visitors Guide |last=Gleave |first=Prof. Barrie |work=hoolevillage.com |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 the artist [[Ford Madox Brown]] was commissioned to produce the murals known as [[The Manchester Murals]] for [[Manchester Town Hall]]. The painting entitled ''Crabtree watching the transit of Venus AD 1639'' is a romanticised depiction of Crabtree's observation of the event.&lt;ref name="Chapman IAU" /&gt;

On 9&amp;nbsp;June 2004, the day after the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits occurred as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft.&lt;ref name="Salford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/venustransit.htm |title=William Crabtree, Venus genius |last=Anonymous |date=28 January 2010 |work=Local History |publisher=Salford City Council |accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family at the time he was collaborating with Horrocks.&lt;ref name="Salford" /&gt; The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the [[NASA]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venustransit.nasa.gov/webcasts/muchhoole/|title=Sun Earth Day:Shadows of the Sun|date=6 June 2012|work=Live webcast streams|publisher=NASA|accessdate=6 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605140925/http://venustransit.nasa.gov/webcasts/muchhoole/|archivedate=5 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1580747_salford-marks-transit-of-venus-from-home-of-man-who-first-saw-it-in-1639---video|title=Salford marks Transit of Venus from home of man who first saw it in 1639 - video|last=Osuh|first=Chris|date=June 6, 2012|work=Manchester Evening News|publisher=MEN Media|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zipf's law''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ɪ|f}}) is an [[empirical law]] formulated using [[mathematical statistics]] that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the [[physical science|physical]] and [[social science|social]] sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete [[power law]] [[probability distribution]]s.  ''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.

For example, Zipf's law states that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gençay|pages=133–153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E. A.|editor2-last=Giles|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420070361}}.

The law is named after the American [[linguistics|linguist]] [[George Kingsley Zipf]] (1902–1950), who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he did not claim to have originated it.&lt;ref name=Powers1998&gt;{{cite journal| last = Powers | first = David M W| url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/W98-1218 |title=Applications and explanations of Zipf's law| year = 1998| conference = Joint conference on new methods in language processing and computational natural language learning| pages = 151–160| publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French stenographer [[Jean-Baptiste Estoup]] (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D.

(1913) Das Gesetz der Bevölkerungskonzentration. Petermann’s Geographische Mitteilungen 59, 74–76&lt;/ref&gt; (1856–1933).

==Other datasets==
The same relationship occurs in many other rankings unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, income rankings, ranks of number of people watching the same TV channel,&lt;ref&gt;M.

Sjöström, [http://apachepersonal.miun.se/~mageri/myresearch/bmsb2013-Eriksson.pdf Efficient Interactive Multicast over DVB-T2 - Utilizing Dynamic SFNs and PARPS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502183246/http://apachepersonal.miun.se/~mageri/myresearch/bmsb2013-Eriksson.pdf |date=2014-05-02}}, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (BMSB'13), London, UK, June 2013. Suggests a heterogeneous Zipf-law TV channel-selection model&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1913"/&gt; Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.&lt;ref name="Clausetetal2009"&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C. R., &amp; Newman, M. E. J. (2009). Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data. SIAM Review, 51(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111&lt;/ref&gt; When Zipf's law is checked for cities, a better fit has been found with exponent ''s'' = 1.07; i.e. the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; largest settlement is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^{1.07}}&lt;/math&gt; the size of the largest settlement.

==Theoretical review==
Zipf's law is most easily observed by [[graph of a function|plotting]] the data on a [[log-log]] graph, with the axes being [[logarithm|log]] (rank order) and log (frequency). For example, the word ''"the"'' (as described above) would appear at ''x'' = log(1), ''y'' = log(69971). It is also possible to plot reciprocal rank against frequency or reciprocal frequency or interword interval against rank.&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt; The data conform to Zipf's law to the extent that the plot is [[linear equation|linear]].

Formally, let:
* ''N'' be the number of elements;
* ''k'' be their rank;
* ''s'' be the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.
Zipf's law then predicts that out of a population of ''N'' elements, the normalized frequency of elements of rank ''k'', ''f''(''k'';''s'',''N''), is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1/k^s}{\sum\limits_{n=1}^N (1/n^s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Zipf's law holds if the number of elements with a given frequency is a random variable with power law distribution &lt;math&gt;p(f) = \alpha f^{-1-1/s}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Adamic2000&gt;Adamic, Lada A. (2000) [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html "Zipf, Power-laws, and Pareto - a ranking tutorial", originally published at http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/ranking/ranking.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026062626/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this representation of Zipf's law is more suitable for statistical testing, and in this way it has been analyzed in more than 30,000 English texts. The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Moreno-Sánchez|first = I|last2 = Font-Clos|first2 = F|last3 = Corral|first3 = A|date = 2016|title = Large-Scale Analysis of Zipf’s Law in English Texts|url =|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0147073|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example of the frequency of words in the English language, ''N'' is the number of words in the English language and, if we use the classic version of Zipf's law, the exponent ''s'' is 1. ''f''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.

The law may also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H&lt;sub&gt;N,s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].

The simplest case of Zipf's law is a "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; function." Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur ½ as often as the first.  The third most common frequency will occur ⅓ as often as the first. The fourth most common frequency will occur ¼ as often as the first. The ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most common frequency will occur &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.

In human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.

As long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 then
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta (s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}&lt;\infty. \!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ζ'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].

Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the "words" follow the general trend of Zipf's law (appearing approximately linear on log-log plot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wentian Li |title=Random Texts Exhibit Zipf's-Law-Like Word Frequency Distribution |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |volume=38 |issue=6 |year=1992 |pages=1842–1845 |doi=10.1109/18.165464 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527030629/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |archivedate=2016-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vitold Belevitch]] in a paper, ''On the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution'' offered a mathematical derivation.  He took a large class of well-behaved [[statistical distribution]]s (not only the [[normal distribution]]) and expressed them in terms of rank. He then expanded each expression into a [[Taylor series]]. In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first-order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law|Mandelbrot's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter G.

The [[principle of least effort]] is another possible explanation:
Zipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language want to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" or "success breeds success") that results in the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610173330/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and population versus city rank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610203644/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; better than Zipf's law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.

==Related laws==

[[Image:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|left|320px|A plot of word frequency in Wikipedia (November 27, 2006). The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&amp;nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&amp;nbsp; is the total number of the word’s occurrences. Most popular words are "the", "of" and "and", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&amp;nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2.0&lt;/sup&gt;) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]

''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of "rank data," in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''ζ''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with "zeta distribution," since probability distributions are sometimes called "laws". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.

A generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;N,q,s)=\frac{[\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The "constant" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt;

Zipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.&lt;ref name="Adamic2000"/&gt;

The Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N. L. Johnson |author2=S. Kotz |author3=A. W. Kemp  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-54897-9|ref=harv}}, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is analogous to the continuous [[Pareto distribution]] in the same way that the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]] is analogous to the [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniform distribution]].

The tail frequencies of the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] are approximately

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;\rho) \approx \frac{[\text{constant}]}{k^{\rho+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[parabolic fractal distribution]], the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship.&lt;ref name="Galien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |title=Factorial randomness: the Laws of Benford and Zipf with respect to the first digit distribution of the factor sequence from the natural numbers |author=Johan Gerard van der Galien |date=2003-11-08 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305150334/http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |archivedate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Eftekhari (2006) Fractal geometry of texts.

It has been argued that [[Benford's law]] is a special bounded case of Zipf's law,&lt;ref name="Galien"/&gt; with the connection between these two laws being explained by  their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;L.

''Physica A'' 293: 297–304.&lt;/ref&gt; The ratios of probabilities in Benford's law are not constant. The leading digits of data satisfying Zipf's law with s = 1 satisfy Benford's law.

== Applications ==
In [[information theory]], a symbol (event, signal) of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt; [[bit]]s of information. Hence, Zipf law for natural numbers: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(x) \approx 1/x&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent with number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; into information already stored in a natural number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we should go to &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x') \approx \log_2(x) + \log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, in standard binary system we would have &lt;math&gt;x' = 2x + s&lt;/math&gt;, what is optimal for &lt;math&gt;\Pr(s=0) = \Pr(s=1) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; probability distribution. Using &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt; rule for a general probability distribution is the base of [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of  [[entropy coding]] methods used in [[data compression]], which state distribution is also governed by Zipf law.

Zipf's law also has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |title=Parallel Document Identification using Zipf's Law |last1=Mohammadi |first1=Mehdi |author-link1= |date=2016 |publisher= |book-title=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora |pages=21–25, |location=Portorož, Slovenia |conference=LREC 2016 |id= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154706/https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
