'''Aymeric Chauprade''' (born 13 January 1969), is a French writer, political scientist and politician for the independent right wing. He left the National Front on 9 November 2015, mostly for "moral and political" principles, to found [[Les Français Libres (political party)|Les Français Libres]]. A student and disciple of [[François Thual]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Sévillia]], [http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2009/02/07/01006-20090207ARTFIG00176--le-poids-des-civilisations-dans-l-histoire-.php Le poids des civilisations dans l'histoire], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 6 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; he is an advocate of [[realpolitik]].&lt;ref&gt;" Les frontières de l'Europe : pour un retour au réalisme géopolitique " ''[[Revue politique et parlementaire]]'', no. 1036, July–August–September 2005, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[European Parliament]] from the National Front for the [[Île-de-France (European Parliament constituency)|Île-de-France]] constituency in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (France)|2014 European Parliament election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/en-ile-de-france-l-ump-nettement-devant-le-fn-26-05-2014-1827846_20.php En Ile-de-France, l'UMP nettement devant le FN] {{fr icon}} ''Le Point''. 26 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Career ===
Graduating from the Paris [[Institute of political studies paris|Institute of Political Studies]] in 1993, Chauprade received a Master of International Law degree in 1996 and a doctorate in political science in 2001 from [[Paris Descartes University]].&lt;ref&gt;''La géopolitique : genèse d'une science politique, déterminants et modèles explicatifs'', sous la direction d'[[Edmond Jouve]], ''cf''. [http://www.sudoc.fr/145490890 identifiant pérenne notice Sudoc]&lt;/ref&gt; Trained in mathematics,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} he is a lecturer in geopolitics at the Royal College of Higher Military Education of the Kingdom of Morocco, director of the ''Revue française de géopolitique'' (''French Review of Geopolitics'') and editor of several collections published by Ellipses in Paris (''Grands enjeux'', ''Taupe-Niveau'' and ''Référence géopolitique''). From 2003 to 2009, Chauprade was a lecturer on the history of political ideas at the [[University of Neuchâtel]] in Switzerland. He has taught at the [[Collège interarmées de défense]] (CID: French Joint Defense College) since 1999, where he oversees geopolitics courses.

Chauprade is a contributor to African historian [[Bernard Lugan]]'s magazine, ''L'Afrique réelle'' (Real Africa), works for [[Dominique Venner]]'s ''[[La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire]]''. He dedicated his book, ''Géopolitique, constantes et changements dans l'histoire'' (''Geopolitics, Constants and Changes in History'') to the students at CID. Chauprade is an officer in the [[La réserve Marine|French Naval Reserve]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

After the publication of his book, ''Chronique du choc des civilisations'' ("Chronicle of the Clash of Civilizations" reedited in 2015), Chauprade was accused by French journalist Jean Guisnel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-monde/chauprade-l-homme-qui-forme-les-officiers-et-deforme-l-histoire/1648/0/313659 « Chauprade, l'homme qui forme les officiers et déforme l'histoire »], [[Jean Guisnel]] ''[[Le Point]]'', 4 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of espousing [[September 11 conspiracy theories]]. He was always fighting against those allegations which he found false. Chauprade was removed from his chair at the CID by Supervising Minister Hervé Morin in early February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites/herve-morin-congedie-un-geopoliticien-suite-a-un-article-du-point/1648/0/313843 « Hervé Morin congédie un géopoliticien suite à un article du Point »], [[Jean Guisnel]] ''[[Le Point]]'', 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/societe/20090205.OBS3279/morin_limoge_un_grade_pour_ses_propos_sur_le_11_septemb.html « Morin limoge un gradé pour ses propos sur le 11 September »], ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'', 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/02/05/01011-20090205FILWWW00494-119complot-morin-limoge-un-prof.php « 11/9/complot : Morin limoge un prof »], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the controversy, Chauprade (who filed a complaint against the Minister and the magazine ''[[Le Point]]'') received support from CID students&lt;ref&gt;[http://secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr/defense/2009/02/un-enseignant-d.html « Un enseignant du Collège interarmées de Défense congédié par Hervé Morin »], par [[Jean-Dominique Merchet]], ''Secret défense'', 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and his former university professor Edmond Jouve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nadaillac.sosblog.fr/E-Jouve-b1/253-Courage-Aymeric-Chauprade-b1-p59247.htm Article] sur le blog d'Edmond Jouve, 12 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although CID head Vincent Desportes expressed reservations about Chauprade's writings, Desportes said: "He has never proselytized in his courses or expressed his vision of the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agoravox.fr/article.php3?id_article=51528 « Affaire Chauprade : le géopoliticien attaque Hervé Morin en justice »], ''[[AgoraVox]]'', 17 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A website supporting Chauprade was set up. On 24 March 2009 the Paris Administrative Court ruled in his favour, suspending Morin's decision and saying that the minister had violated a "fundamental freedom".&lt;ref&gt;''Le Figaro'' du 24 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juritel.com/Ldj_html-1397.html|title=La Jurisprudence gratuite en ligne (Juritel - Droit de l'internet, informations legales, contrats,..)|author=Juritel|work=juritel.com|accessdate=15 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171543/http://www.juritel.com/Ldj_html-1397.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2011 the court upheld its ruling, saying that Morin's decision resulted "from an irregular procedure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianne2.fr/blogsecretdefense/La-justice-donne-raison-a-Aymeric-Chauprade-contre-le-ministere-de-la-Defense_a305.html « La justice donne raison à Aymeric Chauprade contre le ministère de la Défense »] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829141004/http://www.marianne2.fr/blogsecretdefense/La-justice-donne-raison-a-Aymeric-Chauprade-contre-le-ministere-de-la-Defense_a305.html |date=29 August 2011 }}, par [[Jean-Dominique Merchet]], ''Secret défense'', 28 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauprade organized a conference with Jacques Frémeaux and Philippe Evanno in February 2013 at the [[Sorbonne]] (University of Paris IV) on threats in North Africa and the [[Sahel]] and Europe's overall security (''Menaces en Afrique du Nord et au Sahel et sécurité globale de l'Europe''), the proceedings of which were published in April 2013 by Ellipses Editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editions-ellipses.fr/product_info.php?products_id=9210|title=Menaces en Afrique du Nord et au Sahel et sécurité globale de l`Europe - Actes de colloque|work=editions-ellipses.fr|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2010, he has funded a geopolitical website.&lt;ref name="Site2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realpolitik.tv|title=Realpolitik.tv, la géopolitique sur le net, depuis 2010. Site fondé par Aymeric Chauprade|work=realpolitik.tv|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognized as one of 100 most important international authors in geopolitics and International relations("Les grands théoriciens des relations intérnationales" 2015, Studyrama).

=== Geopolitics ===
According to Chauprade, he follows a new French geopolitical school emphasizing ''realpolitik'' and deemphasizing ideology. Its ideas appear in the ''Revue française de géopolitique'' (''French Review of Geopolitics'') and the International Academy of Geopolitics, of which Chauprade is secretary-general.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Huissoud, ''Dictionnaire de géopolitique et de géoéconomie'', sous la direction de [[Pascal Gauchon]], PUF, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
His geopolitical philosophy follows that of [[François Thual]], and can be found in the introduction to ''Géopolitique, constantes et changements dans l'histoire''.&lt;ref&gt;André Brigot, " [http://www.ehess.fr/cirpes/ds/ds47/geopol.html Rejets et nécessité d'une géographie politique européenne] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113214127/http://www.ehess.fr/cirpes/ds/ds47/geopol.html |date=13 November 2013 }} ", ''Le Débat Stratégique'', 47, 1999 et " [http://www.ehess.fr/cirpes/publi/abmod.html Persistance et utilité des recherches de géopolitique] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113214452/http://www.ehess.fr/cirpes/publi/abmod.html |date=13 November 2013 }} ", ''Revue Québécoise – Études internationales'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chauprade considers [[Francophonie]] a cornerstone of French independence and power. A strong supporter of a Europe of nations within European borders (without Turkey), he advocates a political agreement with Russia and supports a multi-polar world with a balanced relationship between China and the United States. Chauprade maintains strong relations with Morocco&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maroc-hebdo.press.ma/Site-Maroc-hebdo/archive/Archives_810/html_810/lenouveau.html|title=Le nouveau visage terroriste du Polisario|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where he teaches), and travels regularly to the Middle East, Central Europe, Central Asia, Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandrelatsa.ru/2014/03/conference-daymeric-chauprade-a-moscou-mardi-18-mars-2014/|title=Conférence d’Aymeric Chauprade à Moscou, Mardi 18 mars 2014|work=alexandrelatsa.ru|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China.

=== {{anchor|Civilisations according to Aymeric Chauprade}}Civilisations ===
According to Jean-Marc Huissoud, Chauprade is considered a founder of the new French geopolitics, describing the "continuous and discontinuous" in his analysis of international questions.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Chauprade has said, "France is at war against some Muslims, not at war with the Muslims but with some Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEUruaIUKqI|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interview for ITélé he said that France is better than a race, it's a civilization. Chauprade defends Judeo-Christian roots of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mReokYWlPY8|title=09/11/2015 - Tirs Croisés - L'invité politique de Laurence Ferrari|first=|last=Aymeric Chauprade|date=9 November 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Chauprade supported the list headed by [[Philippe de Villiers]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (France)|2004 European Parliament election]].&lt;ref&gt;"Je voudrais saluer également et dans le même esprit, Aymeric Chauprade. Vous avez bien compris qu'Aymeric Chauprade, qui est le directeur des études de l'école de Guerre, a décidé de descendre dans l'arène. Il est connu sur les plateaux de télévision pour ses interventions de géopolitologue, il nous a apporté un message d'espoir exprimé brillamment. Je le remercie parce que, pour ceux qui ne le sauraient pas, il est reconnu non-seulement dans tous les milieux intellectuels, mais aussi bien au-delà par toutes les sensibilités souverainistes. On en a eu la preuve ce matin. Et merci de faire le lien avec toutes les sensibilités souverainistes qui vous reconnaissent et vous écoutent. " Philippe de Villiers, " [http://lesdiscours.vie-publique.fr/pdf/033003755.pdf L'agenda 2004 du souverainisme]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ", Université d'été du souverainisme, [[Lamoura]], 7 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chauprade should be the National Front's top candidate in the Île-de-France district for the 2014 European elections and Le Pen's advisor on foreign-policy issues.

In an interview with the French bi-monthly magazine ''L'Homme nouveau'' on 27 November 2013, he said that the "ideological bipolarity" separating the world is no longer the one opposing liberalism and communism (which are "two materialisms") but the one opposing "materialism and traditionalism": "On one side are those who believe that the individual is the supreme value, on the other are those who think that transcendence or the common good are superior to the human person".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hommenouveau.fr/825/societe/aymeric-chauprade---l-ennemi--c-est-la-dictature-du-relativisme.htm – Aymeric Chauprade : l’ennemi, c’est la dictature du relativisme]. L'Homme nouveau, 27 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Chauprade's "commitment is clearly in the second camp," and he intends "to participate in a project that not only raises the issue of identity in France, but also raises the problem of materialism and rehabilitates transcendence in politics".

Chauprade defends the multipolar vision of politics which includes peaceful relations with Russia and the USA. He travelled to Crimea to "monitor" the [[Crimean status referendum, 2014#Non-OSCE observers|Crimean status referendum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2014/12/17/62388-russkiy-mir-171-natsionalnogo-fronta-187 Russki Mir - "National Front"], Nowaja Gaseta, 17. Dezember 2014&lt;/ref&gt; having been invited by the far-right [[Eurasian Observatory for Democracy &amp; Elections]] (EODE) according to [[La Liberation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Shekhovtsov]]: ''Russia and the Western Far Right: Tango Noir'' Routledge Studies in Fascism and the Far Right, Routledge, 2017, {{ISBN|9781317199953}}, chapter "Cooperation with Civic Control"&lt;/ref&gt; He was personnally commenting the events live on Russia Today on March 16.

In his ITélé interview of 9 November 2015 Chauprade appealed for the return of Philippe de Villiers and showed a strong desire of work by his side.

=== Quitting the National Front ===
November 9, 2015 – He announces his quitting the National Front due to “moral and ideological issues”.&lt;ref name="europe1.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lelab.europe1.fr/aymeric-chauprade-quitte-le-fn-2617803|title=Aymeric Chauprade quitte le FN : "On ne peut pas penser au Front national" - Le Lab Europe 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some other members, he deplores the influence of Florian Philippot on Marine Le Pen and on the party’s political path.&lt;ref name="europe1.fr"/&gt; He also stated that Alain Soral’s (anti-Semitic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.licra.org/alain-soral-de-nouveau-condamne|title=Alain Soral de nouveau condamné - LICRA|website=www.licra.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) influence on a part of the party is one of the main reasons that made him quit the National Front. He stands for a right wing re-composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://droites-extremes.blog.lemonde.fr/2014/10/31/comment-alain-soral-veut-evincer-aymeric-chauprade-du-fn/|title=Comment Alain Soral veut évincer Aymeric Chauprade du FN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On her side, Marine Le Pen claims that “after the Air Cocaine gate, our disagreements with Aymeric Chauprade became too important for him to stay at the National Front”.
At the European parliament he quits the Europe of Nations and Freedom group (ENL), which he joined at its creation. He is since an independent MEP.
In January 13, 2016 he announces the creation of his own party, Les Francais Libres, with the purpose of “unifying a credible and assumed right wing”. He refused to make a choice during 2017’s French presidential election between “globalised socialism and a nationalist socialism”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marianne.net/politique/aymeric-chauprade-le-petit-parti-et-le-gros-coup-de-com-de-lex-fn|title=Aymeric Chauprade : le petit parti et le gros coup de com' de l'ex-FN|date=13 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
April 2016 – he admits being closer to Les Republicains and wishes to “take part in an eventual government from the right wing”, without taking part in the election of Les Républicains’ candidate to run for office. At the European Parliament he tried to join the French delegation of the European Popular Party – Valeurs actuelles states that “even benefiting from Michele Alliot-Marie’s, Nadine Morano’s and Brice Hortefeux’s support, he faces oppositions from juppeists”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://droites-extremes.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/04/15/lappel-du-pied-tres-appuye-daymeric-chauprade-en-direction-des-republicains/|title=L’appel du pied très appuyé d’Aymeric Chauprade en direction des Républicains|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the election of Les Républicains’ candidate to run for office, he supported Nicolas Zarkozy for the first-round ballot and Francois Fillon for the second-round ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections/presidentielles/primaires-droite/2016/11/22/35004-20161122ARTFIG00279-l-ex-fn-chauprade-soutient-fillon-pour-barrer-la-route-a-marine-le-pen.php|title=L'ex-FN Chauprade soutient Fillon pour barrer la route à Marine Le Pen|date=22 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During French 2017’s presidential election he supported Francois Fillon for the first-round ballot before supporting Emmanuel Macron due to the elimination of the first one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.fr/actu/politique/presidentielle-2017-aymeric-chauprade-emmanuel-macron-7788404140|title=Pourquoi Aymeric Chauprade va voter Emmanuel Macron|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
March 16, 2017, he expresses himself for one of the first times about the “shadow men” around the National Front presidency, in an Envoyé Special documentary. According to him “Marine Le Pen is not free, she is held by those people (Frédéric Chatillon, Axel Loustau et Philippe Péninque). If she comes to power, those people will too.

== Air Cocaine gate ==

On March 20, 2013, two French passengers are arrested at the Punta Cana airport in the Dominican Republic while they were about to take off with suitcases filled with cocaine.&lt;ref name="nouvelobs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/justice/20160502.OBS9615/affaire-air-cocaine-le-role-de-christophe-naudin-en-9-dates.html|title=Affaire Air Cocaïne : le rôle de Christophe Naudin en 9 dates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was registered as a commercial one and the baggage were checked by the airport security. According to the Civil Aviation Code the crew is not responsible for luggage content. Despite this, the two pilots of the Falcon were arrested with no distinction being made between them and the passengers by the Dominican police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2014/02/25/01016-20140225ARTFIG00117-des-pilotes-francais-ne-veulent-plus-desservir-la-republique-dominicaine.php|title=Les pilotes français ne veulent plus desservir la République Dominicaine|date=25 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapidly, a support committee is formed by Air France pilots and former French air force pilots. Bruno Odos and Pascal Forret being both former French Air Force pilots, one of them was even part of the French strategic nuclear task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXkb148mA-U|title=Soutien à nos pilotes français prisonniers|first=|last=Aymeric Chauprade|date=20 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autumn 2014 – The MEP Aymeric Chauprade joins the supporting committee on Christophe Naudin’s (Airport Security expert and Criminologist) demand.

May 15, 2015 – Aymeric Chauprade posts a video denouncing a justice denial made by the Dominican Republic. During one year and a half, the four Frenchmen without any distinction, have seen their trial reported (more than 30 times &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/auvergne-rhone-alpes/proces-air-cocaine-pascal-fauret-bruno-odos-devront-encore-attendre-671361.html|title=Procès "Air cocaïne": Pascal Fauret et Bruno Odos devront encore attendre!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and had no way to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/auvergne-rhone-alpes/air-cocaine-20-ans-prison-requis-contre-iserois-bruno-odos-rhodanien-pascal-fauret-783947.html|title="Air cocaïne": 20 ans de prison requis contre l'Isérois Bruno Odos et le Rhodanien Pascal Fauret|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2015 – At the end of the trial, the 30 Dominican defendants were acquitted, while the 4 Frenchmen were declared guilty and sentenced to 20 years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/francais-condamnes-en-republique-dominicaine-un-sentiment-d-injustice-907468.html|title=Air cocaïne: " J'ai perdu foi en la justice dominicaine "|first=|last=BFMTV|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the trial, the pilots appealed and remained free under surveillance. During October they were extracted.&lt;ref name="nouvelobs.com"/&gt;

The role played by Aymeric Chauprade in this operation remains blurry. Did he facilitate it by his presence in the Dominican Republic at the time the exfiltration took place? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/fr/20151028-air-cocaine-fn-role-depute-front-national-aymeric-chauprade-exfiltration-pilotes|title="Air cocaïne" : quel rôle a joué le député FN Aymeric Chauprade ? - France 24|date=28 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the extraction of the two pilots, the Dominican authorities blamed Aymeric Chauprade and many others without having any evidence.
Three international arrest warrants are issued by the Dominican Republic against Christophe Naudin, Aymeric Chauprade and Pierre Malinowski 
Being unable to present any criminal charge, the Dominican Republic fabricated charges against them – “People smuggling and trafficking in human beings”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2015/11/23/mandat-arret-aymeric-chauprade-air-cocaine-justice_n_8626466.html|title=Air Cocaïne : mandat d'arrêt dominicain contre trois Français qui avaient participé à l'évasion, dont Aymeric Chauprade|date=23 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/justice/air-cocaine-mandat-d-arret-dominicain-contre-aymeric-chauprade-23-11-2015-1983875_2386.php|title=Air Cocaïne : Aymeric Chauprade "étonné" par un mandat d'arrêt "loufoque"|first=Le Point,|last=magazine|date=23 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Aymeric Chauprade had been informed by Interpol that he did not have an investigation opened against him following the exfiltration of two French pilots from the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Lettre de l'Expansion, lundi 23 juillet 2018, n° 2379&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ayu Islands''' (Kepulauan Ayu), are a small archipelago south of the [[Asia Islands]] and north of [[Raja Ampat Islands]] in Indonesia. This group is formed by two coral [[atoll]]s. The highest point is 106 m.&lt;ref&gt;Pub164, 2004 Sailing Directions (Enroute): New Guinea&lt;/ref&gt;

In older maps these islands appear as the '''Ajoe Islands''', following the Dutch spelling "Ajoe-eilanden".

The beaches of these islands are a breeding ground for the [[leatherback turtle]] ''(Dermochelys coriacea)''. The waters off the Ayu Islands are a good snorkeling and scuba diving site.

Administratively the Ayu Islands belong to the Indonesian province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]].

The '''Black Death persecutions and massacres''' were a series of violent attacks on [[Jewish communities]] blamed for an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in Europe from 1348 to 1351.

==History of persecutions==
Christians despised Jews for their lack of conviction in Jesus Christ. The official church policy was to protect Jews because Jesus was born into the Jewish race. But in reality Jews were targets of Christian loathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diane Zahler|title=The Black Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPtGVsPv_0sC&amp;pg=PT64|year=2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-9076-7|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the plague swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, annihilating nearly half the population, Jews were taken as [[scapegoat#Political/sociological scapegoating|scapegoats]], likely because they were affected less than other people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sixmillioncrucifixions.com/Blaming_the_Jews_for_the_Black_Death_plague.html|title=Blaming the Jews for the Black Death Plague|website=www.sixmillioncrucifixions.com|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishhistory.org/the-black-death/|title=The Black Death|website=www.jewishhistory.org|access-date=2016-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations spread that Jews had caused the disease by deliberately [[well poisoning|poisoning wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe After the Black Death'' 2000 Page 146 "There were several reasons for this, including, it has been suggested, the observance of laws of hygiene tied to ritual practices and a lower incidence of alcoholism and venereal disease"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Levy ''Antisemitism'' 2005 Page 763 "Panic emerged again during the scourge of the Black Death in 1348, when widespread terror prompted a revival of the well poisoning charge. In areas where Jews appeared to die of the plague in fewer numbers than Christians, possibly because of better hygiene and greater isolation, lower mortality rates provided evidence of Jewish guilt."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first massacres directly related to the plague took place in April 1348 in [[Toulon, France]], where the Jewish quarter was sacked, and forty Jews were murdered in their homes, then in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe after the black death '' 2000 p. 13 "This was the context in which the Plague made its appearance in 1348. THE BLACK DEATH The Plague was not unknown in ... The first massacres took place in April 1348 in Toulon, where the Jewish quarter was raided and forty Jews were murdered in their homes. Shortly afterward, violence broke out in Barcelona and in other Catalan cities."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1349, massacres and persecution spread across Europe, including the [[Erfurt massacre (1349)]], the [[Basel massacre]], massacres in Aragon, and Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Judaica: chronological index of Jewish history''; p. 203 Máttis Kantor - 2005 "1349 The Black Death massacres swept across Europe. ... The Jews were savagely attacked and massacred, by sometimes hysterical mobs — normal social order had ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall ''John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture''; p. 376 2006 "The period of the Black Death saw the massacre of Jews across Germany, and in Aragon, and Flanders",&lt;/ref&gt; 2000 Jews were burnt alive on 14 February 1349 in the "Valentine's Day" [[Strasbourg pogrom|Strasbourg massacre]], where the plague had not yet affected the city. While the ashes smouldered, Christian residents of Strasbourg sifted through and collected the valuable possessions of Jews not burnt by the fires.&lt;ref name="Robert S. Gottfried 74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert S.

Within the 510 Jewish communities destroyed in this period, some members killed themselves to avoid the persecutions.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. "The Renaissance" Simon and Schuster (1953), page 730–731, {{ISBN|0-671-61600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1349 the Jewish community in Frankfurth-am-Main was annihilated. This was followed by the destruction of Jewish communities in Mainz and Cologne. The 3000 strong Jewish population of Mainz initially defended themselves and managed to hold off the Christian attackers. But the Christians managed to overwhelm the Jewish [[ghetto]] in the end and killed all of its Jews.&lt;ref name="Robert S. Gottfried 74"/&gt;

At [[Speyer]], Jewish corpses were disposed in wine casks and cast into the Rhine. By the close of 1349 the worst of the pogroms had ended in Rhineland. But around this time the massacres of Jews started rising near the Hansa townships of the Baltic Coast and in Eastern Europe. By 1351 there had been 350 incidents of anti-Jewish pogroms and 60 major and 150 minor Jewish communities had been exterminated. All of this caused the eastward movement of Northern Europe's Jewry to Poland and Russia, where they remained for the next six centuries. King [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir]] of Poland enthusiastically gave refuge and protection to the Jews. The motives for this action is unclear. The king was well disposed to Jews and had a Jewish mistress. He was also interested in tapping the economic potential of the Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert S.

Perhaps too he was anxious to have the commercial skills which some of the immigrants could offer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for relative Jewish immunity ==
There are many possible reasons why Jews were accused to be the cause for the plague. One reason was because there was a general sense of anti-Semitism in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jews were also isolated in the ghettos, which meant in some places that Jews were less affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise History of the Jewish People|last=Pasachoff|first=Naomi E.|last2=Littman|first2=Robert J.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2005|isbn=0-7425-4365-X|location=Lanham|page=154|quote=However, Jews regularly ritually washed and bathed, and their abodes were slightly cleaner than their Christian neighbors'. Consequently, when the rat and the flea brought the Black Death, Jews, with better hygiene, suffered less severely ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P Byrne, ''Encyclopedia of the Black Death'' Volume 1 2012—Page 15 "Anti–Semitism and Anti–Jewish Violence before the Black Death .. Their attention to personal hygiene and diet, their forms of worship, and cycles of holidays were off-puttingly different."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are many Jewish laws that promote cleanliness: a Jew must wash his or her hands before eating bread and after using the bathroom, it was customary for Jews to bathe once a week before the Sabbath, a corpse must be washed before burial, and so on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Government responses==
In many cities the civil authorities either did little to protect the Jewish communities or actually abetted the rioters.&lt;ref&gt;Howard N. Lupovitch ''Jews and Judaism in world history'' p92—2009 "In May 1349, the city fathers of Brandenburg passed a law a priori condemning Jews of well poisoning: Should it become evident and proved by reliable men that the Jews have caused or will cause in the future the death of Christians,..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Clement VI]] (the French born Benedictine, Pierre Roger) tried to protect the Jewish communities by two [[papal bull]]s (the first on July 6, 1348 and another 26 September 1348) saying that those who blamed the plague on the Jews had been "seduced by that liar, the Devil" and urging clergy to protect the Jews. In this, Clement was aided by the researches of his personal physician [[Guy de Chauliac]] who argued from his own treatment of the infected that the Jews were not to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Faye |last=Getz |title=Book review: ''Inventarium sive Chirurgia Magna''. Vol. 1, Text |journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume=72 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=533–535 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v072/72.3br_mcvaugh.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clement's efforts were in part undone by the newly elected [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] making property of Jews killed in riots forfeit, giving local authorities a financial incentive to turn a blind eye.&lt;ref&gt;Howard N. Lupovitch ''Jews and Judaism in world history'' p. 92 2009 "On July 6, 1349, Pope Clement tried to curb anti-Jewish violence by issuing a papal bull. Its effectiveness was limited by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, who made arrangements for the disposal of Jewish property in the event of a ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
As the plague waned in 1350, so did the violence against Jewish communities. In 1351, the plague and the immediate persecution was over, though the background level of persecution and discrimination remained. Ziegler (1998) comments that "there was nothing unique about the massacres".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ziegler ''The Black Death'' 1998 "The persecution of the Jews waned with the Black Death itself; by 1351 all was over. Save for the horrific circumstances of the plague which provided the incentive and the background, there was nothing unique about the massacres."&lt;/ref&gt; 20 years after the Black Death the [[Brussels massacre]] (1370) wiped out the Belgian Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shengold Jewish Encyclopedia'' Mordecai Schreiber—2011 "In 1370, after the Black Death, the brutal Brussels Massacre wiped out the Belgian Jewish community"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tales of Black Death in Early Modern Period==
Though told for nearly 350 years, there were no written accounts of the Black Death through Jewish tales until 1696, by Yiftah Yosef ben Naftali Hirts Segal Manzpach in the Mayse Nissim. Yuzpa Shammes, as he frequently was referred to, was a scribe and [[Gabbai|shammash]] of the Worms community for several decades. His accounts intend to show that the Jews were not idle but that they took action against inevitably becoming the scapegoat. Despite Yuzpa's assertion that the Jews fought against the massacres, there are contradicting accounts that claim that there was no evidence of "armed resistance".&lt;ref&gt;''Die Chronik des Mathias von Neuenburg'', 1955. "While a Christian chronicler reports that during the pogrom of March 1, 1349, the beleaguered Jews of Worms set fire to their own houses, as may have happened elsewhere, there is no evidence of armed resistance."&lt;/ref&gt; These contradicting tales display the effect of oral tradition being manipulated to fit certain circumstances.

"Ordinary folk hated the Jews because they had served the merchants and aristocrats, and with their loans and with their capital, helped establish urban economy and the city's governing political and territorial independence. Further, the Jews had exploited artisans 'with loans at usurious rates'."&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Black Death' and Antisemitism'', 1998. "Ordinary folk hated the Jews because they had served the merchants and aristocrats, and with their loans and with their capital, helped establish urban economy and the city's governing political and territorial independence. Further, the Jews had exploited artisans 'with loans at usurious rates'."&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons gave the "ordinary folk" the motive to kill the Jews because they were gaining political and social standings. Breuer also included that "others ... saw the massacres as the revenge of impoverished debtors against privileged elite of Jewish creditors."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel K. Cohen Jr. ''The Black Death and the Burning of Jews'', 2007. "others ... saw the massacres as the revenge of impoverished debtors against privileged elite of Jewish creditors."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also considered part of [[Central Africa]]. Burundi's capital is [[Bujumbura]]. The southwestern border is adjacent to [[Lake Tanganyika]].

The [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent [[Kingdom of Burundi|kingdom]], until the beginning of the 20th century, when [[German Empire|Germany]] colonised the region.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Strizek, "Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft", Berlin: Ch. Links Verlag, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[First World War]] and Germany's defeat, it ceded the territory to [[Belgium]]. Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. Despite common misconceptions, Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation.

Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a [[Kingdom of Burundi|monarchy]], but a series of assassinations, coups and a general climate of [[Congo Crisis|regional instability]] culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966. Bouts of [[ethnic cleansing]] and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the [[Burundian Genocide#1972|1970s]] and again in the [[Burundian Civil War|1990s]] left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|world's poorest]].&lt;ref name="xlix"&gt;[[#Eggers|Eggers]], p. xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 witnessed [[2015 Burundian unrest|large-scale political strife]] as President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] opted to run for a third term in office, a [[2015 Burundian coup d'état attempt|coup attempt failed]] and the country's [[Burundian legislative election, 2015|parliamentary]] and [[Burundian presidential election, 2015|presidential]] elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Burundi}}
Burundi is one of the few countries in Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups; the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics.&lt;ref&gt;Uvin, Peter. 1999. "Ethnicity and Power in Burundi and Rwanda: Different Paths to Mass Violence" in Comparative Politics, Vol. 31, No. 3 (Apr., 1999), pp. 253-271 Published by: Comparative Politics, Ph.D. Programs in Political Science, City University of New York. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is important to note that the nature of culture and ethnic groups is always fluid and changing. While the groups might have migrated to the area at different times and as distinctly different ethnic groups, the current distinctions are contemporary socio-cultural constructs. Initially the different ethnic groups lived together in relative peace. The first conflicts between ethnic groups can be dated back to the 17th century, when land was becoming ever more scarce because of the continuous growth in population.

===Kingdom of Burundi===
{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi}}
The first evidence of the Burundian state dates back to the late 16th century where it emerged on the eastern foothills. Over the following centuries it expanded, annexing smaller neighbours.
The Kingdom of Burundi, or Urundi, in the Great Lakes region was a polity ruled by a traditional monarch with several princes beneath him; succession struggles were common.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"Kingdom of Burundi". Encyclopædia Britannica (Online ed.). Retrieved 15 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, known as the mwami (translated as ruler) headed a princely aristocracy (ganwa) which owned most of the land and required a tribute, or tax, from local farmers (mainly Hutu) and herders (mainly Tutsi).  The Kingdom of Burundi was characterized by a hierarchical political authority and tributary economic exchange.&lt;ref&gt;VANDEGINSTE, S., Stones left unturned: law and transitional justice in Burundi, Antwerp-Oxford-Portland, Intersentia, 2010, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-18th century, the Tutsi royalty consolidated authority over land, production, and distribution with the development of the ubugabire—a patron-client relationship in which the populace received royal protection in exchange for tribute and land tenure. By this time, the royal court was made up of the Tutsi-Banyaruguru, they had higher social status than other pastoralists such as the Tutsi-Hima.  In the lower levels of this society were generally Hutu people, and at the very bottom of the pyramid were the Twa. The system had some fluidity however, some Hutu people belonged to the nobility and in this way also had a say in the functioning of the state.&lt;ref&gt;R. O. Collins &amp; J. M. Burns. 2007. A History of Sub-Saharan Africa, Cambridge University Press. Page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of Hutu or Tutsi was not merely based on ethnic criteria alone. Hutu farmers that managed to acquire wealth and livestock were regularly granted the higher social status of Tutsi, some even made it to become close advisors of the Ganwa. On the other hand, there are also reports of Tutsi that lost all their cattle and subsequently lost their higher status and were called Hutu. Thus, the distinction between Hutu and Tutsi was also a socio-cultural concept, instead of a purely ethnic one.&lt;ref&gt;Chrétien, Jean-Pierre (2003). The Great Lakes of Africa: Two Thousand Years of History. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|978-1-890951-34-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weissman"&gt;WEISSMAN, S., Preventing genocide in Burundi: lessons from international diplomacy, Washington D.C., United States Institute of Peace Press, 1998, p5.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many reports of marriages between Hutu and Tutsi people.&lt;ref&gt;Conflicten Bank Burundi, http://www.cmo.nl/conflictenbank/index.php?Afrika:Grote-Merengebied:Burundi {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701141046/http://www.cmo.nl/conflictenbank/index.php?Afrika:Grote-Merengebied:Burundi# |date=1 July 2015 }}, (consultatie 4 februari 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, regional ties and tribal power struggles played a far more determining role in Burundi's politics than ethnicity.&lt;ref name="weissman" /&gt;

Burundi ceased to be a monarchy when king Ntare V Ndizeye was deposed by his Prime Minister and Chief of Staff, Capt. Michel Micombero, who abolished the monarchy and declared a republic following the November 1966 coup d'état.

===Colonisation===
{{Main|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}
From 1884, the [[German East Africa Company]] was active in the African Great Lakes region. As a result of heightened tensions and border disputes between the German East Africa Company, the [[British Empire]] and the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], the [[German Empire]] was called upon to put down the [[Abushiri revolt]]s and protect the empire's interests in the region. The German East Africa Company transferred its rights to the German Empire in 1891, in this way establishing the German colony of [[German East Africa]], which included Burundi, Rwanda, and the mainland part of [[Tanzania]] (formerly known as [[Tanganyika]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa|title=German East Africa {{!}} former German dependency, Africa|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902012730/https://www.britannica.com/place/German-East-Africa#|archive-date=2 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Empire stationed armed forces in Ruanda and Burundi during the late 1880s.  The location of the present-day city of [[Gitega]] served as an administrative centre for the Ruanda-Urundi region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Gitega|title=Gitega {{!}} Burundi|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902015516/https://www.britannica.com/place/Gitega#|archive-date=2 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African Campaign]] greatly affected the African Great Lakes region. The [[Allies of World War I|allied powers]], the [[British Empire]] and [[Belgium]] launched a coordinated attack on the German colony. The German army stationed in Burundi was forced to retreat by the numerical superiority of the Belgian army and by 17 June 1916, Burundi and Rwanda were occupied. The Force Publique and the British [[Lake Force]] then started a thrust to capture [[Tabora]], an administrative centre of central German East Africa. After the war, as outlined in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany was forced to cede "control" of the Western section of the former German East Africa to [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strachan, H. (2001). The First World War: To Arms. I. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-926191-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 1924, [[Ruanda-Urundi]], which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, became a Belgian [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandate territory]], with [[Bujumbura|Usumbura]] as its capital. In practical terms it was considered part of the [[Belgian colonial empire]]. Ruanda-Urundi continued its kingship [[dynasty]] despite the invasion of Europeans.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html CIA – The World Factbook – Burundi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128152115/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html# |date=28 January 2018 }} [[CIA]].

The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions, the Burundian monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Following the [[Second World War]], Ruanda-Urundi was classified as a [[United Nations Trust Territory]] under Belgian administrative authority.&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt; During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On 4 October 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of Burundi's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers.&lt;ref name="wein5"/&gt; In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form [[political parties]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; These factions contributed to Burundi gaining its independence from Belgium, on 1 July 1962.

On 20 January 1959, Burundi's ruler [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwami Mwambutsa IV]] requested Burundi's independence from Belgium and dissolution of the Ruanda-Urundi union.&lt;ref name="wein7"&gt;{{cite book |last = Weinstein|first = Warren |author2=Robert Schrere |title = Political Conflict and Ethnic Strategies: A Case Study of Burundi|publisher=Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs |year = 1976|location = Syracuse University |isbn = 0-915984-20-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months, Burundian political parties began to advocate for the end of Belgian colonial rule and the separation of Rwanda and Burundi.&lt;ref name="wein7"/&gt; The first and largest of these political parties was the [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA).

Burundi's push for independence was influenced by the [[Rwandan Revolution]] and the accompanying instability and ethnic conflict that occurred there.

In subsequent months, the Tutsi-dominated government of [[Micombero]] used the army to combat Hutu rebels and commit genocide, murdering targeted members of the Hutu majority.

Following the civil war and genocide, Micombero became mentally distraught and withdrawn. In 1976, Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], a Tutsi, led a [[1976 Burundian coup d'état|bloodless coup]] to toppled Micombero and set about promoting reform. His administration drafted a new constitution in 1981, which maintained Burundi's status as a [[one-party state]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.

Major [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) [[1987 Burundian coup d'état|overthrew Bagaza in 1987]], suspended the constitution and dissolved political parties. He reinstated military rule by a Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN).&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to killings of Tutsi peasants in the northern communes of [[Ntega]] and [[Marangara]] in August 1988. The government put the death toll at 5,000{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}; some international NGOs believed this understated the deaths.

The new regime did not unleash the harsh reprisals of 1972. Its effort to gain public trust was eroded when it decreed an [[amnesty]] for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings. Analysts have called this period the beginning of the "culture of impunity." Other analysts put the origins of the "culture of impunity" earlier, in 1965 and 1972, when a small number of identifiable Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to Pierre [[Buyoya]], asking for more representation of the Hutu in the administration. They were arrested and jailed. A few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government, with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi ministers. He appointed [[Adrien Sibomana]] (Hutu) as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission to address issues of national unity.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; In 1992, the government created a new constitution that provided for a multi-party system,&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; but a [[civil war]] broke out.

An estimated total of 250,000 people died in Burundi from the various conflicts between 1962 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;

===First attempt at democracy and genocide against Tutsi===
In June 1993, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], leader of the Hutu-dominated [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election. He became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. In October 1993, Tutsi soldiers assassinated Ndadaye, an act which resulted in a genocide against Tutsi, which led to years of violence between Hutu rebels and Tutsi majority army. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm Country profile Burundi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007175839/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1068873.stm# |date=7 October 2011 }}.

In early 1994, the parliament elected [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]] (Hutu) to the office of president. He and [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], the president of Rwanda, died together [[Assassination of Habyarimana and Ntaryamira|when their aeroplane was shot down]] in April 1994. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Speaker of Parliament, [[Sylvestre Ntibantunganya]] (Hutu), was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. A feared general massacre was averted, but violence broke out. A number of Hutu refugees in the capital,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Bujumbura, were killed. The mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.

In 1996, [[Pierre Buyoya]] (Tutsi) again took power through a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|coup d'état]]. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998, this was the start of his second term as president, after his first term from 1987 to 1993. In response to rebel attacks, the government forced much of the population to move to [[refugee camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/burundi.htm Burundi Civil War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229122327/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/burundi.htm# |date=29 December 2017 }}. Global Security&lt;/ref&gt; Under Buyoya's rule, long peace talks started, mediated by [[South Africa]]. Both parties signed agreements in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Pretoria]], South Africa, to share power in Burundi. The agreements took four years to plan.

On 28 August 2000, a transitional government for Burundi was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power-sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled Burundian government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-64D9N7?OpenDocument Global Ceasefire Agreement between Burundi and the CNDD-FDD]. 20 November 2003.

===Peace agreements===
[[File:Burundi soldiers.png|thumb|alt=three soldiers in a wood by roadside with machine gun|Tutsi militia near the Zairian border, 1996]]
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] in 1995; following his death, South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]] and United States President [[Bill Clinton]] also lent their respective weight.

The peace talks took the form of [[Track I mediation]]s. This method of negotiation can be defined as a form of diplomacy involving governmental or intergovernmental representatives, who may use their positive reputations, mediation or the "carrot and stick" method as a means of obtaining or forcing an outcome, frequently along the lines of "bargaining" or "win-lose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ramsbotham, Oliver; Woodhouse, Tom and Miall, Hugh |title=Contemporary Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IbuQE02-KkC&amp;pg=PA24|year=2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4974-0|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main objective was to transform the Burundian government and military structurally in order to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsi and Hutu. It was to take place in two major steps. First, a transitional power-sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the armed forces, where the two groups would be represented equally.

As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, the mediators and negotiating parties confronted several obstacles. First, the Burundian officials perceived the goals as "unrealistic" and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Burundians believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was sceptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they had been deceived by the Tutsi in past agreements.

In 2000, the Burundian President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. Disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government, and when the ceasefire would begin. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in Tanzania, the Burundian president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.

===UN involvement===

Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South Africa and [[Uganda]], gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South African Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect Burundian leaders returning from exile. These forces became part of the [[African Union Mission in Burundi|African Union Mission to Burundi]], deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in Burundi.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"&gt;Howard, Lise Morje (2008). UN Peacekeeping in Civil Wars. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission's mandate, under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]], has been to monitor cease-fire; carry out disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants; support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return; assist with elections; protect international staff and Burundian civilians; monitor Burundi's troublesome borders, including halting illicit arms flows; and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well. It has greatly benefited from the transitional government, which has functioned and is in the process of transitioning to one that will be popularly elected.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/&gt;

The main difficulty in the early stages was continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organisation continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN's presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and its representatives were brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing:  no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/&gt;

The focus of the UN's mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Burundi_2005?lang=en Constitution] was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.

While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders, as well as the population at large.&lt;ref name="Howard, Lise Morje 2008"/&gt; It was involved with several "quick effect" projects, including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.

===2006 to 2015===

The 2007 report&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; of [[Amnesty International]] mentions many areas where improvement is required. Civilians are victims of repeated acts of violence done by the FLN. The latter also recruits child soldiers. The rate of violence against women is high. Perpetrators regularly escape prosecution and punishment by the state. There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. [[Genocide]], [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] remain unpunished. The establishment of a [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] and a Special [[Tribunal]] for investigation and prosecution has not yet been implemented. The freedom of expression is limited; journalists are frequently arrested for carrying out legitimate professional activities. A total of 38,087 Burundian refugees have been repatriated between January and November 2007.

In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them 'provisional immunity' from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity .&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.

On 17 April 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The Burundian army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on 26 May 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader [[Agathon Rwasa]], with the mediation of [[Charles Nqakula]], South Africa's Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agreed to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114 Peace Building Commission Update, A project of the Institute for Global Policy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819200320/http://www.pbcupdate.org/?p=114#more-114#more-114 |date=19 August 2017 }}, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics of Burundi}}

Burundi's political system is that of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic based upon a multi-party state. The President of Burundi is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. There are currently 21 [[List of political parties in Burundi|registered parties in Burundi]].&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; On 13 March 1992, Tutsi coup leader [[Pierre Buyoya]] established a constitution,&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition.&lt;ref name="PH"/&gt; Six years later, on 6 June 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]]'s seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents. Because of the [[Arusha Accords (Burundi)|Arusha Accord]], Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000.&lt;ref name="unburundi"/&gt;

Burundi's legislative branch is a [[bicameral]] assembly, consisting of the Transitional National Assembly and the [[Senate of Burundi|Transitional Senate]]. {{As of|2004}}, the Transitional National Assembly consisted of 170 members, with the Front for Democracy in Burundi holding 38% of seats, and 10% of the assembly controlled by UPRONA. Fifty-two seats were controlled by other parties. Burundi's constitution mandates representation in the Transitional National Assembly to be consistent with 60% Hutu, 40% Tutsi, and 30% female members, as well as three Batwa members.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt; Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote and serve five-year terms.&lt;ref name=Puddington/&gt;

The Transitional Senate has fifty-one members, and three seats are reserved for former presidents. Due to stipulations in Burundi's constitution, 30% of Senate members must be female. Members of the Senate are elected by electoral colleges, which consist of members from each of Burundi's provinces and communes.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2821.htm Background Note: Burundi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126181743/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2821.htm# |date=26 January 2018 }}.

{{Main|Geography of Burundi}}

One of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi is landlocked and has an equatorial climate. Burundi is a part of the [[Albertine Rift]], the western extension of the [[East African Rift]]. The country lies on a rolling [[plateau]] in the centre of Africa. The average elevation of the central plateau is {{convert|5600|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, with lower elevations at the borders. The highest peak, [[Mount Heha]] at {{convert|8810|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; lies to the southeast of the capital, Bujumbura. The source of the [[Nile River]] is in Bururi province, and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the [[Ruvyironza River]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} [[Lake Victoria]] is also an important water source, which serves as a fork to the [[Kagera River]].&lt;ref&gt;Klohn, Wulf and Mihailo Andjelic.

Burundi's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture.

The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Burundi will remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors – foreign aid represents 42% of Burundis national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community in 2009, which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and also in 2009 received $700 million in debt relief.

Lack of access to financial services is a serious problem for the majority of the population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. [[Microfinance]], however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits and short- to medium-term credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/burundi/burundi-financial-sector-profile.html |title=Burundi: Financial Sector Profile |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513112229/http://www.mfw4a.org/burundi/burundi-financial-sector-profile.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df=dmy }}. mfw4a.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Burundi's currency is the [[Burundian franc]] (ISO 4217 code BIF). It is nominally subdivided into 100 [[centime]]s, though coins have never been issued in centimes in independent Burundi; centime coins were circulated only when Burundi used the [[congolese franc|Belgian Congo franc]].

Burundi's culture is based on local tradition and the influence of neighbouring countries, though cultural prominence has been hindered by [[civil unrest]]. Since farming is the main industry, a typical Burundian meal consists of [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize|corn]] and [[pea]]s. Due to the expense, meat is eaten only a few times per month.

When several Burundians of close acquaintance meet for a gathering they drink ''impeke'', a beer, together from a large container to symbolise unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/burundi/eating.html |title=Eating the Burundian Way |accessdate=21 July 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616201411/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/burundi/eating.html |archivedate=16 June 2006 |df=dmy }}.

The '''Central African Republic''' ('''CAR'''; [[Sango language|Sango]]: ''Ködörösêse tî Bêafrîka''&lt;span style="margin-left:1px"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; {{lang-fr|République centrafricaine}}&amp;nbsp; {{IPA-fr|ʁepyblik sɑ̃tʁafʁikɛn|pron}}, or ''{{lang|fr|Centrafrique}}'' {{IPA-fr|sɑ̃tʁafʁik|}}) is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Central Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Chad]] to the north, [[Sudan]] to the northeast, [[South Sudan]] to the east, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the south, the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the southwest and [[Cameroon]] to the west. The CAR covers a land area of about {{convert|620,000|km2|sqmi}} and had an estimated population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Central African Republic}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.

Most of the CAR consists of Sudano-Guinean [[savanna]]s, but the country also includes a [[Sahel]]o-[[East Sudanian savanna|Sudanian]] zone in the north and an [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic|equatorial forest zone]] in the south. Two thirds of the country is within the [[Ubangi River]] basin (which flows into the [[Congo River|Congo]]), while the remaining third lies in the basin of the [[Chari River|Chari]], which flows into [[Lake Chad]].

What is today the Central African Republic has been inhabited for millennia; however, the country's current borders were established by France, which ruled the country as a colony starting in the late 19th century. After gaining independence from France in 1960, the Central African Republic was ruled by a series of autocratic leaders, including an [[Central African Empire|abortive attempt at a monarchy]];&lt;ref name=Bokassa&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/jean-bedel-bokassa-posthumous-pardon 'Cannibal' dictator Bokassa given posthumous pardon]. ''The Guardian''. 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; by the 1990s, calls for democracy led to the first multi-party democratic elections in 1993. [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] became president, but was later removed by [[François Bozizé|General François Bozizé]] in the [[2003 Central African Republic coup d'état|2003 coup]]. The [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began in 2004 and, despite a peace treaty in 2007 and another in 2011, [[Central African Republic conflict (2012–present)|fighting broke out]] between various factions in December 2012, leading to ethnic and [[religious cleansing]] of the Muslim minority and massive population displacement in 2013 and 2014.

Despite its significant [[mineral]] deposits and other resources, such as [[uranium]] reserves, [[crude oil]], [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[cobalt]], [[lumber]], and [[hydropower]],&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; as well as significant quantities of [[arable land]], the Central African Republic is among the ten poorest countries in the world, with the lowest GDP per capita at purchasing power parity in the world as of 2017.&lt;ref name="IMF 2017"&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2017&amp;ey=2017&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;pr1.x=55&amp;pr1.y=9&amp;c=512%2C946%2C914%2C137%2C612%2C546%2C614%2C962%2C311%2C674%2C213%2C676%2C911%2C548%2C193%2C556%2C122%2C678%2C912%2C181%2C313%2C867%2C419%2C682%2C513%2C684%2C316%2C273%2C913%2C868%2C124%2C921%2C339%2C948%2C638%2C943%2C514%2C686%2C218%2C688%2C963%2C518%2C616%2C728%2C223%2C836%2C516%2C558%2C918%2C138%2C748%2C196%2C618%2C278%2C624%2C692%2C522%2C694%2C622%2C142%2C156%2C449%2C626%2C564%2C628%2C565%2C228%2C283%2C924%2C853%2C233%2C288%2C632%2C293%2C636%2C566%2C634%2C964%2C238%2C182%2C662%2C359%2C960%2C453%2C423%2C968%2C935%2C922%2C128%2C714%2C611%2C862%2C321%2C135%2C243%2C716%2C248%2C456%2C469%2C722%2C253%2C942%2C642%2C718%2C643%2C724%2C939%2C576%2C644%2C936%2C819%2C961%2C172%2C813%2C132%2C726%2C646%2C199%2C648%2C733%2C915%2C184%2C134%2C524%2C652%2C361%2C174%2C362%2C328%2C364%2C258%2C732%2C656%2C366%2C654%2C734%2C336%2C144%2C263%2C146%2C268%2C463%2C532%2C528%2C944%2C923%2C176%2C738%2C534%2C578%2C536%2C537%2C429%2C742%2C433%2C866%2C178%2C369%2C436%2C744%2C136%2C186%2C343%2C925%2C158%2C869%2C439%2C746%2C916%2C926%2C664%2C466%2C826%2C112%2C542%2C111%2C967%2C298%2C443%2C927%2C917%2C846%2C544%2C299%2C941%2C582%2C446%2C474%2C666%2C754%2C668%2C698%2C672&amp;s=PPPPC&amp;grp=0&amp;a= World Economic Outlook Database, January 2018], [http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28 International Monetary Fund].

{{main|History of the Central African Republic}}
[[File:Bouar Megaliths stamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Bouar]] Megaliths, pictured here on a 1967 Central African stamp, date back to the very late Neolithic Era (c. 3500–2700 BC).]]

=== Early history ===
Approximately 10,000 years ago, [[desertification]] forced hunter-gatherer societies south into the Sahel regions of northern Central Africa, where some groups settled.&lt;ref name="Eastern Africa 2011, pg. 4"&gt;[[#McKenna|McKenna]], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Farming began as part of the [[Neolithic Revolution|Neolithic Revolution.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brierley|first=Chris|last2=Manning|first2=Katie|last3=Maslin|first3=Mark|date=2018-10-01|title=Pastoralism may have delayed the end of the green Sahara|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06321-y|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=9|issue=1|pages=4018|doi=10.1038/s41467-018-06321-y|issn=2041-1723|pmc=6167352|pmid=30275473|bibcode=2018NatCo...9.4018B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial farming of [[Dioscorea rotundata|white yam]] progressed into [[millet]] and [[sorghum]], and before 3000 BC&lt;ref&gt;Fran Osseo-Asare (2005) ''Food Culture in Sub Saharan Africa''.

During the [[Bantu expansion|Bantu Migrations]] from about 1000 BC to AD 1000, [[Ubangian]]-speaking people spread eastward from Cameroon to Sudan, [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people settled in the southwestern regions of the CAR, and [[Central Sudanic]]-speaking people settled along the [[Ubangi River]] in what is today Central and East CAR.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Banana]]s arrived in the region{{when|date=June 2014}} and added an important source of carbohydrates to the diet; they were also used in the production of [[alcoholic beverages]]. Production of [[copper]], [[salt]], [[dried fish]], and [[textiles]] dominated the economic trade in the Central African region.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McKenna|McKenna]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries [[slave trade]]rs began to raid the region as part of the expansion of the Saharan and Nile River slave routes. Their captives were enslaved and shipped to the Mediterranean coast, Europe, Arabia, the Western Hemisphere, or to the slave ports and factories along the West and North Africa or South the Ubanqui and Congo rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=International Business Publications, USA|title=Central African Republic Foreign Policy and Government Guide (World Strategic and Business Information Library)|date=7 February 2007|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=978-1433006210|page=47|volume=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfIVA5KMEb8C&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="africanhistory.about.com"&gt;Alistair Boddy-Evans.

=== French colonial period ===
{{Main|Ubangi-Shari}}
The European penetration of Central African territory began in the late 19th century during the [[Scramble for Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Centr_Afr_Rep.shtml French Colonies – Central African Republic]. Discoverfrance.net. Retrieved 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans, primarily the French, [[Germans]], and [[Belgians]], arrived in the area in 1885. France created [[Ubangi-Shari]] territory in 1894. In 1911 at the [[Treaty of Fez]], France ceded a nearly 300,000&amp;nbsp;km² portion of the Sangha and Lobaye basins to the [[German Empire]] which ceded a smaller area (in present-day [[Chad]]) to France. After [[World War I]] France again annexed the territory. Modeled on [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]]'s [[Congo Free State]], concessions were doled out to private companies that endeavored to strip the region's assets as quickly and cheaply as possible before depositing a percentage of their profits into the French treasury. The concessionary companies forced local people to harvest rubber, coffee, and other commodities without pay and held their families hostage until they met their quotas. Between 1890, a year after the French first arrived, and 1940, the population declined by half due to diseases, famine and exploitation by private companies.&lt;ref name=fp1015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/28/one-day-we-will-start-a-big-war-central-african-republic-un-violence/|title=One day we will start a big war|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Gaulle Bangui 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Charles de Gaulle]] in Bangui, 1940.]]
In 1920 [[French Equatorial Africa]] was established and Ubangi-Shari was administered from [[Brazzaville]].&lt;ref name="Francophone Africa 1997, pg. 111"&gt;Thomas O'Toole (1997) ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa''. Westview Press. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1920s and 1930s the French introduced a policy of mandatory cotton cultivation,&lt;ref name="Francophone Africa 1997, pg. 111"/&gt; a network of roads was built, attempts were made to combat [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christianity)|missions]] were established to spread Christianity. New forms of forced labor were also introduced and a large number of Ubangians were sent to work on the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]]. Through the period of construction until 1934 there was a continual heavy cost in human lives, with total deaths among all workers along the railway estimated in excess of 17,000 of the construction workers, from a combination of both industrial accidents and diseases including [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/07/africa_malaria_train/html/3.stm |title=In pictures: Malaria train, Mayomba forest |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, a major insurrection, the [[Kongo-Wara rebellion]] or 'war of the hoe handle', broke out in Western Ubangi-Shari and continued for several years. The extent of this insurrection, which was perhaps the largest anti-colonial rebellion in Africa during the interwar years, was carefully hidden from the French public because it provided evidence of strong opposition to French colonial rule and forced labor.

In September 1940, during the [[Second World War]], [[Charles de Gaulle|pro-Gaullist]] French officers took control of Ubangi-Shari and [[General Leclerc]] established his headquarters for the [[Free French Forces]] in [[Bangui]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/40700/The-colonial-era Central African Republic: The colonial era – Britannica Online Encyclopedia]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 [[Barthélémy Boganda]] was elected with 9,000 votes to the [[French National Assembly]], becoming the first representative of the CAR in the French government. Boganda maintained a political stance against racism and the colonial regime but gradually became disheartened with the French political system and returned to CAR to establish the [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]] (''Mouvement pour l'évolution sociale de l'Afrique noire'', MESAN) in 1950.

=== Since independence (1960–present) ===
In the [[Ubangi-Shari parliamentary election, 1957|Ubangi-Shari Territorial Assembly election]] in 1957, MESAN captured 347,000 out of the total 356,000 votes,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; and won every legislative seat,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. xxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Boganda being elected president of the Grand Council of [[French Equatorial Africa]] and vice-president of the Ubangi-Shari Government Council.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year, he declared the establishment of the Central African Republic and served as the country's first prime minister. MESAN continued to exist, but its role was limited.&lt;ref name="Kalck2005p136"&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; After Boganda's death in a plane crash on 29 March 1959, his cousin, [[David Dacko]], took control of MESAN and became the country's first president after the CAR had formally received [[independence]] from France. Dacko threw out his political rivals, including former Prime Minister and [[Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa|Mouvement d'évolution démocratique de l'Afrique centrale]] (MEDAC), leader [[Abel Goumba]], whom he forced into exile in France. With all opposition parties suppressed by November 1962, Dacko declared MESAN as the official party of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kalck|Kalck]], p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Central African Empire}}
[[File:Bokassa colored.png|thumb|upright|[[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], self-crowned [[Emperor of Central Africa]].&lt;ref name=Bokassa/&gt; ]]
On 31 December 1965, Dacko was overthrown in the [[Saint-Sylvestre coup d'état]] by Colonel [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], who suspended the constitution and dissolved the National Assembly. President Bokassa declared himself President for Life in 1972, and named himself Emperor Bokassa I of the [[Central African Empire]] (as the country was renamed) on 4 December 1976. A year later, Emperor Bokassa crowned himself in a lavish and expensive ceremony that was ridiculed by much of the world.&lt;ref name=Bokassa/&gt;

In April 1979, young students protested against Bokassa's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives. The government violently suppressed the protests, killing 100 children and teenagers. Bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7803421.stm 'Good old days' under Bokassa?]". BBC News. 2 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1979, [[Operation Barracuda|France overthrew Bokassa]] and restored Dacko to power (subsequently restoring the name of the country to the Central African Republic). Dacko, in turn, was again overthrown in a [[1981 Central African Republic coup d'état|coup]] by General [[André Kolingba]] on 1 September 1981.

==== Central African Republic under Kolingba ====
Kolingba suspended the constitution and ruled with a military junta until 1985. He introduced a new constitution in 1986 which was adopted by a nationwide referendum. Membership in his new party, the [[Rassemblement Démocratique Centrafricain]] (RDC), was voluntary. In 1987 and 1988, semi-free elections to parliament were held but Kolingba's two major political opponents, [[Abel Goumba]] and [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] were not allowed to participate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#Why-Visit|title=Central African Republic - Discover World|website=www.discoverworld.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, inspired by the fall of the Berlin Wall, a pro-democracy movement arose. Pressure from the United States, France, and from a group of locally represented countries and agencies called GIBAFOR (France, the USA, Germany, Japan, the EU, the [[World Bank]], and the UN) finally led Kolingba to agree, in principle, to hold free elections in October 1992 with help from the UN Office of Electoral Affairs. After using the excuse of alleged irregularities to suspend the results of the elections as a pretext for holding on to power, President Kolingba came under intense pressure from GIBAFOR to establish a "Conseil National Politique Provisoire de la République" (Provisional National Political Council, CNPPR) and to set up a "Mixed Electoral Commission", which included representatives from all political parties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When a second round of elections were finally held in 1993, again with the help of the international community coordinated by GIBAFOR,  Ange-Félix Patassé won in the second round of voting with 53% of the vote while Goumba won 45.6%. Patassé's party, the ''Mouvement pour la Libération du Peuple Centrafricain'' (MLPC) or Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People, gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament, which meant Patassé's party required coalition partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Patassé Government (1993–2003) ====
{{one source|section|date=January 2015}}
Patassé purged many of the Kolingba elements from the government and Kolingba supporters accused Patassé's government of conducting a "witch hunt" against the Yakoma. A new constitution was approved on 28 December 1994 but had little impact on the country's politics. In 1996–1997, reflecting steadily decreasing public confidence in the government's erratic behaviour, three mutinies against Patassé's administration were accompanied by widespread destruction of property and heightened ethnic tension. During this time (1996) the Peace Corps evacuated all its volunteers to neighboring Cameroon.  To date, the Peace Corps has not returned to the Central African Republic.  The [[Bangui Agreements]], signed in January 1997, provided for the deployment of an inter-African military mission, to Central African Republic and re-entry of ex-mutineers into the government on 7 April 1997. The inter-African military mission was later replaced by a U.N. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1159|peacekeeping force (MINURCA)]]. Since 1997, the country has hosted almost a dozen peacekeeping interventions, earning it the title of "world champion of peacekeeping".&lt;ref name=fp1015/&gt;

In 1998, parliamentary elections resulted in Kolingba's RDC winning 20 out of 109 seats but in 1999, in spite of widespread public anger in urban centers over his corrupt rule, Patassé won a second term in the presidential election.

On 28 May 2001, rebels stormed strategic buildings in Bangui in an [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|unsuccessful coup attempt]]. The army chief of staff, Abel Abrou, and General François N'Djadder Bedaya were killed, but Patassé regained the upper hand by bringing in at least 300 troops of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] rebel leader [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] and Libyan soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Crisis Group|title=Central African Republic: Anatomy of a Phantom State|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|website=CrisisGroup.org|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=24 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626162538/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/africa/central-africa/central-african-republic/Central%20African%20Republic%20Anatomy%20of%20a%20Phantom%20State.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the aftermath of the [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|failed coup]], militias loyal to Patassé sought revenge against rebels in many neighborhoods of [[Bangui]] and incited unrest including the murder of many political opponents. Eventually, Patassé came to suspect that General [[François Bozizé]] was involved in another coup attempt against him, which led Bozizé  to flee with loyal troops to Chad. In March 2003, Bozizé launched a surprise attack against Patassé, who was out of the country. Libyan troops and some 1,000 soldiers of Bemba's Congolese rebel organization failed to stop the rebels and Bozizé's forces succeeded in overthrowing Patassé.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.discoverworld.com/Central-African-Republic:In-depth#History|title=Central African Republic History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=DiscoverWorld.com|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

François Bozizé suspended the constitution and named a new cabinet, which included most opposition parties. Abel Goumba was named vice-president, which gave Bozizé's new government a positive image.{{why?|date=September 2018}} Bozizé established a broad-based National Transition Council to draft a new constitution, and announced that he would step down and run for office once the new constitution was approved.

In 2004 the [[Central African Republic Bush War]] began, as forces opposed to Bozizé took up arms against his government. In May 2005, Bozizé won the presidential election, which excluded Patassé, and in 2006 fighting continued between the government and the rebels. {{clarify|date=September 2018}} In November 2006, Bozizé's government requested French military support to help them repel rebels who had taken control of towns in the country's northern regions.&lt;ref name="bbc20061114"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6146748.stm |title=CAR hails French pledge on rebels |accessdate=26 December 2012 |date=14 November 2006 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the initially public details of the agreement pertained to logistics and intelligence, the French assistance eventually {{when?|date=September 2018}} included strikes by [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] fighters against rebel positions.&lt;ref name="bbc20061130"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6196652.stm |title=French planes attack CAR rebels |accessdate=26 December 2012 |date=30 November 2006 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syrte Agreement in February and the Birao Peace Agreement in April 2007 called for a cessation of hostilities, the billeting of [[Democratic Front of the Central African People|FDPC]] fighters and their integration with FACA, the liberation of political prisoners, integration of FDPC into government, an amnesty for the [[Union of Democratic Forces for Unity|UFDR]], its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the national army. Several groups continued to fight but other groups signed on to the agreement, or similar agreements with the government (e.g. UFR on 15 December 2008). The only major group not to sign an agreement at the time was the [[Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace|CPJP]], which continued its activities and signed a peace agreement with the government on 25 August 2012.

In 2011 Bozizé was reelected in an election which was widely considered fraudulent.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

In November 2012, [[Séléka]], a coalition of rebel groups, took over towns in the northern and central regions of the country.  These groups eventually reached a peace deal with the Bozizé's government in January 2013 involving a power sharing government&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; but this deal broke down and the rebels seized the capital in March 2013 and Bozizé fled the country.&lt;ref name="cnn20130324"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/24/world/africa/central-african-republic-unrest/index.html |title=Central African Republic president flees capital amid violence, official says |date=24 March 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2013 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt20130325"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/world/africa/leader-of-central-african-republic-francois-bozize-is-in-cameroon.html | title =Leader of Central African Republic Fled to Cameroon, Official Says | author = Lydia Polgreen| work =The New York Times | date =25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Djotodia]] took over as president. Prime Minister [[Nicolas Tiangaye]] requested a [[UN]] peacekeeping force from the [[UN Security Council]] and on 31 May former President Bozizé was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/crisiswatch/2013/crisiswatch-117.aspx "CrisisWatch N°117"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920154410/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/crisiswatch/2013/crisiswatch-117.aspx |date=20 September 2013 }}. crisisgroup.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Republique Centrafricaine - Boali - Chutes de Boali.jpg|thumb|upright|Falls of Boali on the Mbali River]]
[[File:CARvillagefromthesky.jpg|thumb|A village in the Central African Republic]]
The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation within the interior of the African continent. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of the Congo. The country lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel north|2°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[14th meridian east|14°]] and [[28th meridian east|28°E]].

Much of the country consists of flat or rolling plateau [[savanna]] approximately {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]]. Most of the northern half lies within the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[East Sudanian savanna]] [[ecoregion]]. In addition to the Fertit Hills in the northeast of the CAR, there are scattered hills in the southwest regions. In the northwest is the Yade Massif, a [[granite]] plateau with an altitude of {{convert|1,143|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.

At {{convert|622,941|km2|sqmi|0}}, the Central African Republic is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|world's 45th-largest country]]. It is comparable in size to [[Ukraine]].

Much of the southern border is formed by [[Tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Congo River]]; the [[Mbomou River]] in the east merges with the [[Uele River]] to form the [[Ubangi River]], which also comprises portions of the southern border. The [[Sangha River]] flows through some of the western regions of the country, while the eastern border lies along the edge of the [[Nile River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]].

It has been estimated that up to 8% of the country is covered by forest, with the densest parts generally located in the southern regions. The forests are highly diverse and include commercially important species of [[Ayous]], [[Sapele|Sapelli]] and [[Sipo (timber)|Sipo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/540539 "Sold Down the River (English)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413014533/http://www.forestsmonitor.org/en/reports/540539 |date=13 April 2010 }}. forestsmonitor.org.&lt;/ref&gt; The deforestation rate is about 0.4% per annum, and [[Illegal logging|lumber poaching]] is commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carpe.umd.edu/resources/Documents/THE_FORESTS_OF_THE_CONGO_BASIN_State_of_the_Forest_2006.pdf/view |title=The Forests of the Congo Basin: State of the Forest 2006 |accessdate=2010-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220052802/http://carpe.umd.edu/resources/Documents/THE_FORESTS_OF_THE_CONGO_BASIN_State_of_the_Forest_2006.pdf/view |archivedate=20 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

===Wildlife===
{{main|Wildlife of the Central African Republic}}
In the southwest, the Dzanga-Sangha National Park is located in a rain forest area. The country is noted for its population of [[forest elephant]]s and [[western lowland gorilla]]s. In the north, the [[Manovo-Gounda St Floris National Park]] is well-populated with wildlife, including [[African leopard|leopards]], [[Central African lion|lions]], [[Sudan cheetah|cheetahs]] and [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], and the [[Bamingui-Bangoran National Park]] is located in the northeast of CAR.

According to the 2003 national census, 80.3% of the population was [[Christianity|Christian]]—51.4% [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and 28.9% [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]]—and 10% is [[Islam|Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2010|url=http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?year=2016&amp;dlid=268630|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work from the Pew Research Center estimated that, as of 2010, Christians constituted 89.8% of the population (with Protestantism at 60.7% and Catholicism 28.5%) while Muslims make up 8.9%.&lt;ref name="Pew Christians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/|title=Table: Christian Population as Percentages of Total Population by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew Muslims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|title=Table: Muslim Poplation by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=2011-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church claims over 1.5 million adherents, approximately one-third of the population.&lt;ref name="Catholic Stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/sccf1.html|title=Central African Republic, Statistics by Diocese|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy.org|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous belief ([[animism]]) is also practiced, and many indigenous beliefs are [[Syncretism#Religious syncretism|incorporated into]] Christian and Islamic practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148671.htm|title=Central African Republic|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A UN director described religious tensions between Muslims and Christians as being high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24802898|title=Central African Republic: Religious tinderbox|publisher=BBC News|date=2013-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many missionary groups operating in the country, including [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Baptists]], [[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches|Grace Brethren]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. While these missionaries are predominantly from the United States, France, Italy, and Spain, many are also from [[Nigeria]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and other African countries. Large numbers of missionaries left the country when fighting broke out between rebel and government forces in 2002–3, but many of them have now returned to continue their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71292.htm |title=Central African Republic.

According to Overseas Development Institute research, during the crisis ongoing since 2012, religious leaders have mediated between communities and armed groups; they also provided refuge for people seeking shelter.&lt;ref name="odi.org"&gt;Veronique Barbelet (2015) [http://www.odi.org/publications/10103-protection-car-africa-conflict-seleka-anti-balaka-peacekeepers Central African Republic: addressing the protection crisis] London: Overseas Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of the Central African Republic}}
The Central African Republic's two official languages are [[French language|French]] and [[Sango language|Sango]] (also spelled Sangho), a [[Creole language|creole]] developed as an inter-ethnic [[lingua franca]] based on the local [[Ngbandi language]]. CAR is one of the few African countries to have an African language as their official language.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of official languages by state|See list of official languages by state on Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Basketball is the country's most popular sport and a good way to connect with its people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indoafrican.org/centralafricanrepublic.htm Country Profile – Central African Republic-Sports and Activities], ''Indo-African Chamber of Commerce and Industry'' Retrieved 24 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iexplore.com/travel-guides/africa/central-african-republic/things-to-do Central African Republic — Things to Do], ''iExplore'' Retrieved 24 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Central African Republic national basketball team|national team]] won the [[AfroBasket|African Championship]] twice and was the first Sub-Saharan African team to qualify for the [[Basketball World Cup]].

The country also has a [[Central African Republic national football team|national football team]], which is governed by the [[Fédération Centrafricaine de Football]], and stages matches at the [[Barthélemy Boganda Stadium]].

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of the Central African Republic|Central African Republic Council of Ministers|List of political parties in the Central African Republic}}

Politics in the Central African Republic formally take place in a framework of a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[republic]]. In this system, the [[Heads of state of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|President]] is the [[head of state]], with a  [[Heads of government of the Central African Republic (and Central African Empire)|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and parliament.

Changes in government have occurred in recent years by three methods: violence, negotiations, and elections. A new constitution was approved by voters in a referendum held on 5 December 2004. The government was rated 'Partly Free' from 1991 to 2001 and from 2004 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIW Score|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FIW%20All%20Scores%2C%20Countries%2C%201973-2012%20%28FINAL%29.xls|work=Freedom House|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive branch===

The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term, and the prime minister is appointed by the president. The president also appoints and presides over the [[Central African Republic Council of Ministers|Council of Ministers]], which initiates laws and oversees government operations. However, as of 2018 the official government is not in control of large parts of the country, which are governed by rebel groups.

Acting president since April 2016 is [[Faustin Archange Touadera]] who followed the interim government under [[Catherine Samba-Panza]], interim prime minister [[André Nzapayeké]].

===Legislative branch===
The [[National Assembly of the Central African Republic|National Assembly]]  (''Assemblée Nationale'') has 105 members, elected for a five-year term using the two-round (or [[Two-round system|Run-off]]) system.

===Judicial branch===
Like in many other former French colonies, the Central African Republic's legal system is based on [[French law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Legal System |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court, or ''Cour Supreme'', is made up of judges appointed by the president. There is also a Constitutional Court, and its judges are also appointed by the president.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{See also|Central African Armed Forces|Foreign relations of the Central African Republic}}

====Foreign aid and UN Involvement====
The Central African Republic is heavily dependent upon foreign [[aid]] and numerous [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] provide services that the government does not provide.

In 2006, due to ongoing violence, over 50,000 people in the country's northwest were at risk of starvation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=58581 CAR: Food shortages increase as fighting intensifies in the northwest].  irinnews.org, 29 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but this was averted due to assistance from the [[United Nations]].{{citation needed|date=December 2007}} On 8 January 2008, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon declared that the Central African Republic was eligible to receive assistance from the Peacebuilding Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unpbf.org/countries/central-african-republic/ Central African Republic Peacebuilding Fund – Overview]. United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Three priority areas were identified: first, the reform of the security sector; second, the promotion of good governance and the rule of law; and third, the revitalization of communities affected by conflicts. On 12 June 2008, the Central African Republic requested assistance from the [[UN Peacebuilding Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/pbc39.doc.htm |title=Peacebuilding Commission Places Central African Republic On Agenda; Ambassador Tells Body 'CAR Will Always Walk Side By Side With You, Welcome Your Advice' |publisher=United Nations |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was set up in 2005 to help countries emerging from conflict avoid devolving back into war or chaos.

In response to concerns of a potential genocide, a peacekeeping force – the International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) – was authorised in December 2013. This African Union force of 6,000 personnel was accompanied by the French Operation Sangaris.&lt;ref name="odi.org"/&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:Bangui Shopping District.jpg|thumb|[[Bangui]] shopping district]]
{{main|Economy of the Central African Republic}}

The [[per capita income]] of the Republic is often listed as being approximately $400 a year, [[List of countries by GNI (PPP) per capita|one of the lowest in the world]], but this figure is based mostly on reported sales of exports and largely ignores the unregistered sale of foods, locally produced [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[diamond]]s, [[ivory]], [[bushmeat]], and [[traditional medicine]].

The currency of Central African Republic is the [[Central African CFA franc|CFA franc]], which is accepted across the former countries of French West Africa and trades at a fixed rate to the euro. Diamonds constitute the country's most important export, accounting for 40–55% of export revenues, but it is estimated that between 30% and 50% of those produced each year leave the country clandestinely.
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Central African Republic.jpeg|thumb|left|Graphical depiction of Central African Republic's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]

Agriculture is dominated by the cultivation and sale of food crops such as [[cassava]], [[peanut]]s, [[maize]], [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[sesame]], and [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. The annual real GDP [[Economic growth|growth rate]] is just above 3%. The importance of food crops over exported [[cash crops]] is indicated by the fact that the total production of cassava, the staple food of most Central Africans, ranges between 200,000 and 300,000 [[tonnes]] a year, while the production of [[cotton]], the principal exported cash crop, ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 tonnes a year. Food crops are not exported in large quantities, but still constitute the principal cash crops of the country, because Central Africans derive far more income from the periodic sale of surplus food crops than from exported cash crops such as cotton or coffee.{{citation needed|date=October 2010|reason=Needed for the whole paragraph}} Much of the country is self-sufficient in food crops; however, [[livestock]] development is hindered by the presence of the [[tsetse fly]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Republic's primary import partner is the [[Netherlands]] (19.5%). Other imports come from [[Cameroon]] (9.7%), France (9.3%), and [[South Korea]] (8.7%). Its largest export partner is [[Belgium]] (31.5%), followed by [[China]] (27.7%), the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (8.6%), [[Indonesia]] (5.2%), and [[France]] (4.5%).&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

The CAR is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA). In the 2009 [[World Bank Group]]'s report ''Doing Business'', it was ranked 183rd of 183 as regards 'ease of doing business', a [[Composite (finance)|composite index]] which takes into account regulations that enhance business activity and those that restrict it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Business 2010.

[[File:Central African Republic - Trucks in Bangui.jpg|thumb|Trucks in [[Bangui]]]]
Bangui is the transport hub of the Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, [[Cameroon]], Chad and [[South Sudan]]; of these, only the toll roads are paved. During the rainy season from July to October, some roads are impassable.&lt;ref name=e200&gt;[[#Eur|Eur]], pp. 200–202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Booth|author2=G.

River [[ferry|ferries]] sail from the [[river port]] at Bangui to [[Brazzaville]] and [[Zongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zongo]]. The river can be navigated most of the year between Bangui and Brazzaville. From Brazzaville, goods are transported by rail to [[Pointe-Noire]], Congo's Atlantic port.&lt;ref name=Finanace&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102152/Central-African-Republic/40691/Finance-and-trade

[[Bangui M'Poko International Airport]] is Central African Republic's only international airport. As of June 2014 it had regularly scheduled direct flights to [[Maya-Maya Airport|Brazzaville]],  [[Mohammed V International Airport|Casablanca]], [[Cadjehoun Airport|Cotonou]], [[Douala International Airport|Douala]], [[N'djili Airport|Kinshasha]], [[Lomé-Tokoin Airport|Lomé]], [[Quatro de Fevereiro Airport|Luanda]], [[Malabo International Airport|Malabo]], [[N'Djamena International Airport|N'Djamena]],  [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle|Paris]], [[Pointe Noire Airport|Pointe-Noire]], and [[Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport|Yaoundé]].

Since at least 2002 there have been plans to connect Bangui by [[Rail transport|rail]] to the [[Transcameroon Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eur|Eur]], p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy ===
{{See also|Energy in the Central African Republic}}
The Central African Republic primarily uses [[hydroelectricity]] as there are few other resources for energy and power for the world around them.

=== Communications ===
{{See also|Communications in the Central African Republic}}
Presently, the Central African Republic has active television services, radio stations, [[internet service providers]], and [[Mobile network operator|mobile phone carriers]]; [[Socatel]] is the leading provider for both internet and mobile phone access throughout the country. The primary governmental regulating bodies of telecommunications are the Ministère des Postes and Télécommunications et des Nouvelles Technologies. In addition, the Central African Republic receives international support on telecommunication related operations from [[ITU-D|ITU Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D)]] within the [[International Telecommunication Union]] to improve infrastructure.

== Human rights ==
{{main|Human rights in the Central African Republic}}
The 2009 Human Rights Report by the [[United States Department of State]] noted that human rights in CAR were poor and expressed concerns over numerous government abuses.&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/af/135944.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Central African Republic].

It also alleged harsh and life-threatening conditions in [[prison]]s and detention centers, arbitrary [[arrest]], prolonged [[Remand (detention)|pretrial detention]] and denial of a [[Right to a fair trial|fair trial]], restrictions on freedom of movement, official [[corruption]], and restrictions on [[Labor rights|workers' rights]].&lt;ref name="2009 Human Rights Report" /&gt;

The '''coat of arms of [[Gabon]]''' was designed by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[heraldist]] and [[vexillologist]] Louis Mühlemann, one of the founding members of the [[International Federation of Vexillological Associations|FIAV]] and also designer of the former [[Coat of arms of the Republic of the Congo|coat of arms of Congo]]. It has been in use since 15 July 1963.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Geoffrey|title=National Heraldry of the World|date=1974|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=9780670504527}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
The supporters of the symbol are [[Leopard (heraldry)|panther]]s which symbolize the vigilance and courage of the president who protects the nation. The bezants (golden discs) in chief of the shield symbolize the mineral wealth of the country.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; The ship at the lower part represents [[Gabon]] moving towards a brighter future.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; According to Briggs,&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; "green represents the great dense forests; yellow, the sun; blue, the sea; and black, the people of Africa". The [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoumé tree]] at the top of the shield symbolizes the timber trade.&lt;ref name=Briggs /&gt; 

The coat of arms is unusual in having two ribbons with mottos in two different languages. The ribbon below the shield has a motto in French 'UNION, TRAVAIL, JUSTICE' ('Unity, Work, Justice'). The second ribbon is placed beneath the branches of the [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoumé tree]] and has a motto in Latin 'UNITI PROGREDIEMUR' ('We shall go forward united').

In the UK, a '''compulsory stock obligation''' (CSO) is a minimum stock of fuel reserves that must be held by a supplier against shortages or interruptions in supply. The scheme is administered by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI).

Companies incur an obligation if they are a supplier of a volume of 100,000 tonnes of fuel per annum or greater. This obligation is assessed as being a holding of 67.5 days' stock (50 days for the UK).

'''Ethiopid''' (also spelled '''Aethiopid''', '''Erythriote''') is a historical [[Race (human classification)|racial classification]] of humans. It was equivalent with the [[Hamites|Eastern Hamite]] division of the [[Caucasian race]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=John Randal|title=Race|date=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192129546|pages=225-226|url=https://www.google.com/books/about/Race.html?id=PD-BAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Meyers Konversationslexikon'' 4th ed. (Leipzig, 1885–1890), [[:File:Meyers b11 s0476a.jpg|ethnographic map]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin, distribution and physiognomy==
Ethiopids are typically classified as a [[Caucasian race|Caucasoid]] (Europid) subrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=George Eaton|last2=Yinger|first2=J. Milton|title=The Meaning of Race|journal=Racial and Cultural Minorities|date=1985|pages=27-39|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-0551-2_2|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Baker (biologist)|John Baker]] (1974), in their stable form, their center of distribution was considered to be [[Horn of Africa]], among that region's [[Afroasiatic languages|Hamito-Semitic]]-speaking populations.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

Physically, the classic Ethiopid was of medium height, with a dolicocephalic or mesocephalic skull (see [[cephalic index]]). Facial form was essentially Caucasoid, with an orthognathic profile (no [[prognathism]]) and a rather prominent, narrow nose. Hair form was often ringlety and skin color was invariably brown, with either a reddish or blackish tinge. It is not certain which Caucasoid subrace formed the basis of this stock, but authorities usually suggested [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranid]] or Proto-Mediterranid ancestors.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt;

The '''flag of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]]''' flag shows a yellow [[hammer and sickle]] and outlined star on a red field above a band of water waves near the bottom,&lt;ref&gt;''Guide to the Flags of the World'' by Mauro Talocci, revised and updated by Whitney Smith ({{ISBN|0-688-01141-1}}), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the Estonian SSR on February 6, 1953.

The description of the flag is described from the [[Riigikogu|Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR]]: 

{{bquote|''"The national flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic consists of the flag with the red background, through which the blue wavy stripe with two white stripes on top, forming along the length of the flag six spiky waves. Blue wavy stripe with white stripes of three-tenths (3/10) of the flag's width. The top red bar is half the width of the flag, the lower red stripe - one-fifth (1/5) of the flag's width at the top of the red part of the flag in the upper left corner, at a distance of one-sixth of the flag's length from the flagpole, depicts a gold [[hammer and sickle]] and above them is a five-pointed [[red star]] framed by a gold border. The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 1:2 "''&lt;ref name=ENSV&gt;[http://www.vexillographia.ru/estonia/index.htm Эстонская ССР]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==History==
From 1940, the flag was red with a gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner. Above the hammer and sickle were the gold [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] characters ''ENSV'' (''Eesti Nõukogude Sotsialistlik Vabariik'') in a [[sans-serif]] font. The flag was restored again in 1944 after the re-capture of Estonia from [[Nazi Germany]].

On February 6, 1953, the final version of the Estonian SSR flag was adopted. Though similar to the [[flag of the Soviet Union]], it has the six spiky blue wavy stripes with the white stripe on the bottom. Neither the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Estonian SSR, nor in the statute of the national flag of the Estonian SSR did not mentioned the shade of blue wavy stripes on the flag. Soviet vexillologist V. N. Streltsov in [[Odessa]] described it as "electric blue".&lt;ref name=ENSV /&gt;

During that period, many of the Estonian diaspora continued to use the blue-black-white flag including the [[Estonian government-in-exile|government in-exile]] over the years during occupation.

The Soviet flag of Estonia was gradually discarded during the ''[[perestroika]]'' period between 1988 and 1989. Beginning in 1990, the flag was reverted to the [[Flag of Estonia|tricolor flag used in 1918]] which remained as the flag after the restoration of independence only a year later. This was defined on May 10, 1990 when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Estonia adopted a resolution "On the use of the national flag as a national symbol of the restoration of independence of the Republic of Estonia" (''Eesti rahvuslipu kui taastatava iseseisva vabariigi riikliku sümboli kasutamise korra kohta''), which was regulated use of the tricolor flag.&lt;ref name=ENSV /&gt;

'''Freedom Day''' ({{lang-mt|Jum il-Ħelsien}}) is a Maltese national holiday celebrated annually on 31 March.  This is the anniversary of the withdrawal of British troops and the [[Royal Navy]] from [[Malta]] in 1979.  On taking power in 1971, the Labour Government indicated it wanted to re-negotiate the lease agreement with the United Kingdom. Following protracted and sometimes tense talks, a new agreement was signed whereby the lease was extended till the end of March 1979 at a vastly increased rent. On 31 March 1979 the last British Forces left Malta. For the first time in a millennium, Malta was no longer a military base of a foreign power and it became independent ''de facto'' as well as ''de jure''.

The main events of the activities commemorating this date take place at the Freedom Day Monument at [[Birgu|Birgu (Vittoriosa)]] and at the War Memorial in Floriana. In the afternoon the Grand Harbour hosts a competitive regatta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.officeholidays.com/countries/malta/freedom_day.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[the Gambia]] on 25 January 2007. Forty-eight members of the [[National Assembly of the Gambia|National Assembly]] were elected, with another five being appointed by the President.&lt;ref name=Jazeera&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A592DA20-3283-4ECF-AD6D-9BC3836D1CE5.htm "Gambia's ruling party wins majority"], Al Jazeera, January 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a victory for the ruling [[Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction]] (APRC), which won 42 of the 48 seats.

After the elections, President [[Yahya Jammeh]] said that "constituencies that voted the opposition should not expect my government's development projects. I want to teach people that opposition in Africa does not pay." He expressed satisfaction with the results and said that "voters have thrown out the two empty barrels from the National Assembly"; this was believed to be a reference to the defeat of two prominent opposition politicians, [[Halifa Sallah]] and [[Hamat Bah]]. Salleh blamed the opposition's poor performance on a split in its ranks and said that he intended to retire from politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/24072 "Gambian President laughs at opponents"], afrol News, January 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
A total of 103 candidates were approved by the Independent Electoral Commission. The ruling APRC was the only party to contest all 48 seats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6276283.stm Q&amp;A: Gambian legislative elections], BBC News, January 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and ran unopposed in five constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/g/gambia/gambia2007.txt Republic of the Gambia] Psephos&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Search for Khnum''''', a novel by writer and [[Egyptologist]] [[Hussein Bassir]], is the first book with a [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] setting among contemporary Egyptian literature in the style of ‘90s generation’. It is arguably the first work of his own literary style and also his first experiment in regenerating the Pharaonic inspiration for modern Egyptian [[belles-lettres]] following the innovations of [[Naguib Mahfouz]] that were published in the first half of the twentieth century.

This novel was published at the start of 1998 by the Egyptian organization of the Department of Culture. The reception which it received from readers and critics since its appearance has meant that it became out of print in record time.

==Plot summary==
The events of the novel take place in [[Ancient Egypt]] and in particular during the transitional period after the [[New Kingdom]], towards the start of the [[Third Intermediate Period]], during the 21st Dynasty (c. 1070-945 BC). At this time, Egypt was ruled by the High Priests of the god [[Amun-Ra]], who dwelt in the traditional capital [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], which was also known as Waset in ancient times, and is known today as [[Luxor]]. This period is known as one of theocratic rule, due to the religious nature of the governments’ authority. Among historians, this is considered one of the rare times when ancient Egypt was directly controlled by the high priests. There was also a civil government who very probably had family ties with Pharaoh Ramses XI (c. 1099-1069 BC), the last king of the last dynasty of the New Kingdom (c. 1539-1070 BC), also known as the Imperial age or (by Egyptologists) as the 20th Dynasty (1186-1069 BC).

With the end of the so-called New Kingdom, Egypt lost much of the power, prestige and domination that she had enjoyed earlier. Beyond her borders, the holdings of her empire had diminished, and within the country there was anarchy for a variety of causes. The most important was the split in government between the north and the south. The north was managed by [[Smendes]], the governor of [[Tanis]], a town in the eastern Delta, while the south was managed by the High Priest of Amun-Ra, [[Herihor]], resident at Thebes. The events of the Tale of Wenamun are a good example of the decline in Egyptian possessions as defined by territories and states that characterized this period. In his tale Wenamun leaves the temple of Amun-Re at Thebes to acquire wood from the eastern coastal region of the Mediterranean which had previously been under Egyptian control for several centuries, in order to build a sacred bark for this god. During the dangerous journey the hero of this tale, [[Wenamun]], experiences numerous difficulties: he is driven from one of the towns he visits and is once even threatened with death. All of these unfortunate events show how serious the situation of Egypt is at this time. The events of In Search of [[Khnum]] take place in this historical context. In a narrative framework, the author describes an imaginary situation that takes place in precisely this period of Ancient Egyptian history. It is thus not a real or even an experienced history, as was the case with the [[Pharaonic]] writings of the very great novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]]: Khufu’s Wisdom, Rhadopis of Nubia, Thebes at War, Before the Throne, [[Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth]]. 

In consequence this story takes place in ancient Egypt to reconstruct the reality and to observe it rather than reproducing it. At the same time, this novel is not only concerned with past time, but also reflects a diaphanous shadow on the present with a skillful literary talent. It is a novel that is as engaged with the present as it is associated with the past and with the fundamental aim of declaring itself optimistic for the future. What is truly remarkable about this literary work is its surprising capacity to reconstruct the Egyptian past and dwell on its details without bombarding the reader with subjects and historical events, and without compromising the truth of this distant period. Thus the history of Ancient Egypt is presented in such a literary and artistic manner that it confirms art’s true role and incredible capacity in preserving and reanimating cultural heritage. The author also knows how to renew and refashion this heritage in an engaging style which allows the observer to view it with a fresh eye, and both to enrich his thoughts about life and to deepen his knowledge of literature. It is not an easy matter to create a setting similar to the ambiance of the period’s chronicles, and this is what gives this work its originality and brilliance. The author’s style gives the novel its splendor to the novel, since he is a specialist in Egyptology and has a passion to make this science both his career and the subject of his writing.

==History==
In 1985 the Standing International Forum on Ethnic Conflict, Development and Human Rights (SIFEC) was founded with the purpose of addressing the issue of conflict and to alert governments and the world to developing crises. The following year, SIFEC merged with another organization, International Alert on Genocide and Massacres, to become International Alert (IA).  Alert was founded in 1986 by [[Leo Kuper]], [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]], [[Martin Ennals]] and [[Luis Kutner]] in response to growing frustration in the international development and human rights community that internal conflicts were impeding the ability to protect and provide for civilian populations and that there was no effective international mechanism to address this situation.&lt;ref name="galchinsky-2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galchinsky|first=Michael|title=Jews and Human Rights: Dancing at Three Weddings|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|date=2008|pages=99|isbn=9780742552678|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IUUuFeeM1OwC&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;ots=XrqfEnr6iX&amp;dq=international%20alert%20leo%20kuper&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=%22international%20alert%22&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="charny-2013"&gt;{{

From its first days, the conflict in [[Sri Lanka]] was a particular focus.  [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], the former [[Archbishop]] of [[Cape Town]] was engaged in the formation of the formation of the new organization and became Vice Chairman of its Board of Trustees.
  
[[Martin Ennals]], the former Secretary General of [[Amnesty International]] and founder of [[Article 19]], served as Secretary General of the new organization.&lt;ref name=award_bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Ennals: A Giant Human Rights Defender|url=http://www.martinennalsaward.org/mea/en/martinennals/index.html|publisher=Martin Ennals Award|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415072609/http://www.martinennalsaward.org/mea/en/martinennals/index.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1986-1989, Ennals was International Alert’s only full-time staff member.  He was joined by Andy Carl (later the founder of [[Conciliation Resources]], who managed IA from 1992-1993 following Ennals’ death.  Alert expanded rapidly in 1994-1996 under the leadership of [[Kumar Rupesinghe]], growing to over 50 staff with major programs in Sri Lanka, [[Burundi]], and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;  NGOs in Conflict: An Evaluation of International Alert (1997) https://issuu.com/cmi-norway/docs/1180-ngos-in-conflict-an-evaluation-of-internation&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998 Alert had a budget of approximately UK£5 million and 80 staff, managing programs in over 15 countries in conflict.

==Notable initiatives==

===Data mining for conflict prevention===

International Alert was an early advocate for the development of [[conflict early warning]] systems.&lt;ref name="nyheim-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nyheim|first=David|title=Conflict and Fragility: Preventing Violence, War and State Collapse|editor=Deutscher, Eckhard|publisher=[[OECD]]|date=2009|isbn=978-92-64-05980-1|url=https://www.oecd.org/dac/conflict-fragility-resilience/docs/preventing%20violence%20war%20and%20state%20collapse.pdf|language=English|pages=28, 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work on [[gender]] and peacebuilding was important in establishing the necessity of incorporating gender relations and female stakeholders in conflict early warning systems.&lt;ref name="nyheim-2009" /&gt;

The '''Kamenny Island Theatre''' (also known as the '''Stone Island Theatre''', in Russian: Каменноостровский театр) is a wooden theatre on the grounds of the [[Kamennoostrovsky Palace]], [[Kamenny Island]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It is the only surviving wooden theatre in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], and one of the few remaining in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rtgtv.com/films/688/|title=Films &amp; ProgramsThe wooden theatre on Kamenny Island – details &amp; schedule – RTG TV|website=rtgtv.com|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre is a world heritage site protected by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baltic Piling|last=Mets, Raudsepp|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=1315879549|location=|pages=50|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, the theatre is home to a second stage of the [[Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theater|Bolshoi Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2007/03/14/082/|title=У БДТ тоже появится "вторая сцена"|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the building==
The theatre was built in 1826 to a design by [[Smaragd Shustov]] in just 40 days. The building was intended to stand for seven years, but it survived much more. In 1843, [[Alberto Cavos]] was commissioned to develop a new project. Reconstruction of the theatre has principally changes the building's outlook, but the auditorium received only minor changes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdt.spb.ru/%D1%81%D1%85%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%80/|title=Каменноостровский театр|last=|first=|date=|website=БДТ|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964-1967, the venue was restorated according to a project overseen by [[Irina Benois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdt.spb.ru/%D1%81%D1%85%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B0/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%80/|title=Каменноостровский театр|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=БДТ|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the facade of the theatre was kept intact, the auditorium was completely rearranged. After the reconstruction, the theatre was made property of the [[Petersburg – Channel 5|St. Petersburg Television Company]]. In 2005, a decree of the [[President of Russia]] has transferred the Kamenny Island Theatre to the [[Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theater|Bolshoi Drama Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fontanka.ru/2012/01/29/030/|title=Каменноостровский театр - зрителям вход воспрещен|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive renovation took place in between 2005 and 2012, when the theatre has opened as the second stage of the Bolshoi Drama.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Kurantbanken''' (also known as the '''københavnske Assignationsbanken''', '''Vekselbanken''' or '''Laanebankbanken''') was a Danish-Norwegian [[private limited company]] set up in [[Copenhagen]] in 1736, when it received its royal ''oktroj'' or [[royal charter|charter]]. This charter gave it the right to issue banknotes as legal tender for the state (but not for other citizens) - these notes were to be fully convertible (for silver coin).

'''Lee Abrams''' (born 1952) is an American media executive who has held a number of posts for large and influential companies, and is generally credited with developing the [[Album Oriented Rock]] format employed by hundreds of radio stations across the country, as well as co-founding [[XM Satellite Radio]].

==Career==
Born in [[Chicago]], Abrams became a [[Radio in the United States|radio]] [[DJ]]. He pioneered systematic audience research and [[psychographics]], connecting people's lifestyles to their listening habits. He modified the album-oriented rock music format, or AOR, from a looser, freeform style to a tighter form, using playlists rather than allowing DJs the freedom to play anything they chose from albums. This followed the evolution in the late 1960s and 1970s from the music industry's focus on singles to albums. Some of his other work at this time included numerous [[voice-over]]s, notably the introduction commentary in ''Let's Talk About Me'' from the 1984 [[Alan Parsons Project]] album, ''[[Vulture Culture]]''. Abrams co-founded XM Satellite Radio and served as Chief Programming Officer at that company until his departure in 2008. More recently Abrams was the [[chief innovation officer]] for the [[Tribune Company]] (2008–2010) but prior to that, founded and ran notable radio consulting company Burkhart/Abrams, served as an internal consultant for ABC Radio, and helped develop nationwide radio formats such as [[Z-Rock]] and [[Radio Disney]].

Additionally, he has been involved on the recording side of the music industry, producing [[Ah Via Musicom]] for guitarist [[Eric Johnson]] and appearing on several [[Alan Parsons Project]] CDs.  He has also consulted and managed acts such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[The Moody Blues]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Bob Seger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin, Richard|title=Would You Buy the Future of Radio From This Man? |publisher=Wired|volume=12.10|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/xmradio.html|date=October 2004|accessdate=2007-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
''[[Newsweek]]'' listed Abrams as one of their "100 Cultural Elite" in 1993, and he was cited by industry publication [[Radio Ink]] as one of the 75 most important radio figures of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=FMQB|author=Fred Deane|title=Up Close with XM Satellite Radio SVP &amp; Chief Creative Officer Lee Abrams|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=226599|date=June 9, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrams was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the "Legends of Rock Radio-Programming" category for his work with WRIF in 2014.

==Email controversy==
On October 15, 2010, Abrams resigned from Tribune Company following revelations that he wrote an email to staff with a link to a video that some within the company considered offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune Co. Executive Abrams Resigns After `Offensive' E-mail With Video|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-15/tribune-co-executive-abrams-resigns-after-offensive-e-mail-with-video.html|publisher=Bloomberg|date=October 15, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-15|first=Brett|last=Pulley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same day, ''[[New York Times]]'' public editor Arthur S Brisbane published an editorial questioning his paper's use of anonymous sourcing as one of the "load bearing" elements of the story, particularly as it was a "sensational episode" in a story about a competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unnamed Sources in Tribune Story Lead Weigh on Readers’ Trust|url=http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/unnamed-sources/|publisher=New York Times|date=October 19, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-15|first=Arthur S.|last=Brisbane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2010, [[Forbes]] reporter Jeff Bercovici published an email from Abrams defending himself, including some specifics not included in mainstream coverage, notably, that the video was from parody site ''[[The Onion]]'' and that it had been previously shown at a ''Chicago Tribune'' sales meeting to a positive reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tribune’s Lee Abrams Defends Himself: "I Will Not Stop Pushing"|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/jeffbercovici/2010/10/19/tribunes-lee-abrams-defends-himself/?boxes=financechannelforbes|publisher=Forbes|date=October 19, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-15|first=Jeff|last=Bercovici}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9935">International [[development aid]] is given by many non-private donors. The first table is based on [[official development assistance]] (ODA) figures published by the [[OECD]] for members of its [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC). Non-DAC members included in the OECD's publishing are listed separately.

Sweden made the largest contribution as a percentage of gross national income (GNI) at 1.40% and the United Nations’ ODA target of 0.7% of GNI was also exceeded by the UAE, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|OECD|2016}} The European Union accumulated a higher portion of GDP as a form of foreign aid than any other economic union.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=New York|year=2014|isbn=9780199371020|location=New York|pages=516–517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest donor countries in 2015 were the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and France, though China, acting outside the DAC apparatus, made higher donations overall than any individual country, with more than double the GNI percentage of the United States.  

==Net official development assistance by donor==
To qualify as official development assistance, a contribution must contain three elements:
#Be undertaken by the ''official sector'' (that is, a government or government agency);
#With promotion of economic ''development'' and welfare as the main objective;
#At ''concessional'' financial terms (that is, with favorable loan terms.)

Thus, by definition, ODA does not include private donations. 

The sum of contributions by EU member states, considered separately from EU institutions, was $73.80 billion.{{sfn|OECD|2016}}


The OECD's Development Assistance Committee members' total budget reached 132 billion dollars and was contributed by the following donors:{{sfn|OECD|2016}}

The '''People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism''' (PDOIS) is a radical [[socialist]] [[political party]] in [[the Gambia]]. Since 2005, it has been part of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD). It was part of [[Coalition 2016]] in the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], whose candidate, [[Adama Barrow]], defeated long-time incumbent [[Yahya Jammeh]]. The PDOIS also publishes a party newspaper, ''[[Foroyaa]]'', which was noted for its opposition to the Jammeh regime.

== History ==
The People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS) was founded on 31 July 1986. It emerged from an earlier group, the People’s Movement for Independence against Neo-Colonialism and Capitalism in The Gambia (PMINCC), whose members included [[Halifa Sallah]], Sam Sarr, Amie Sillah, Adama Bah and Momodou Sarho. The PMINCC were also believed to be the publishers of the newspaper ''The Voice of the Future'', and six members were put on trial for its publication in 1984, although all were acquitted.

Initially, the PDOIS had no official leader until December 1997, when [[Sidia Jatta]] was chosen as its first leader. It began publishing its own newspaper, ''[[Foroyaa]]'', in July 1987, where it was critical of the pro-Western foreign policy of [[Dawda Jawara]], and opposed the [[Senegambia Confederation]]. In 1987, it put forward five candidates in the parliamentary election, but all were defeated. In 1992, it put forward 14 candidates, but again, all were defeated. Jatta stood in the [[Gambian general election, 1992|presidential election]] that year, and came fourth, winning 5.24% of the vote. The PDOIS was not banned following the [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|1994 coup]] by [[Yahya Jammeh]] as it did not publicly denounce it, but both Jatta and Sallah turned down the cabinet posts they were offered.

Jatta won 3% of the vote in the 1996 and 2001 presidential elections. In the 1997 parliamentary election, Jatta won their first seat in the [[National Assembly of the Gambia|National Assembly]] of [[Wuli District|Wuli]] West. In 2002, Jatta retained the seat and Sallah additionally won the seat of [[Serekunda]] Central. From 2002 to 2007, PDOIS was the largest opposition party in the National Assembly, and Sallah served as Leader of the Opposition. In 2005, the PDOIS joined the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD), and Sallah was selected as the NADD candidate in the 2006 presidential election, but only won 6% of the vote. In the 2007 parliamentary election, NADD only won one seat, Jatta's, with Sallah losing his.&lt;ref name=Perfect/&gt;

'''Sports Tracker''', earlier ''Nokia Sports Tracker'' was originally a software tool for [[S60 (software platform)|Symbian Series 60]] phones (particularly those that included a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] facility such as the [[Nokia N95]], or bluetooth phones with the addition of a bluetooth-compatible GPS receiver) that allowed its user to track their route, speed, timings and energy expenditure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''TiVi5 Monde''' ({{IPA-fr|ti vi sɛ̃k mɔ̃d}}), stylized as '''TiVi5 MONDE''', is a television channel launched at the end of January 2012&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consulfrance-miami.org/spip.php?article3079|title=Tivi5 Monde, la première télé en français dédiée au jeune public|last=Gratta|first=Laura|date=May 17, 2012|website=Miami's French Consulate website|publisher=|language=French|access-date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Francophonie|Francophone]] channel [[TV5 Monde]], which is aimed mainly to [[French language|French-speaking]] [[Africa]]n children (4–13 years).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://actualite.housseniawriting.com/afrique/2016/06/13/chaine-tivi5-monde-afrique/16241|title=La chaîne TiVi5 Monde arrive en Afrique|last=Nguema|first=Boubakar|date=2016|work=Actualité Houssenia Writing|language=French|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the channel is to teach French to young children through dedicated programs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
=== 2012: American launch ===
Tivi5Monde is the first [[America]]n channel and the only one to date targeting only children with a 24/7 program entirely in [[French language|French]]. This new channel is available on [[Dish Network]] and is part of the "Bouquet français" offering [[TV5 Monde]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 2016: African launch ===
On {{Start date|2016|6|11}}, TiVi5 Monde, the [[TV5 Monde]] channel dedicated to children, is launched in [[Africa]]. Already broadcast in the [[United States]] since 2012, it is now hosting African productions and broadcasting in some forty countries over Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/332445/economie/media-tivi5-monde-chaine-petits-francophones-debarque-afrique/|title=TiVi5 Monde, la chaîne des petits francophones, débarque en Afrique|last=Godet|first=Aurélie|date=June 10, 2016|work=Jeune Afrique|language=French|access-date=December 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While TV5 Monde targets adults, TiVi5 Monde targets children. "In order to children choose [[French language|French]], it is necessary to support this language in Africa", explains Yves Bigot, CEO of TV5 Monde.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The channel started broadcasting [[free-to-air]] on the SES4 satellite and is made accessible on channel 274 of [[Canalsat|Canalsat Horizons]]. It is sponsored by [[Dominique Ouattara]], first lady of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and president of the Children of Africa Foundation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The content already offered by TiVi5 Monde to young [[America]]ns since 2012 has not changed, with only one difference: 12% of the productions broadcast are African.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The channel had however to be satisfied with a modest budget. The initially announced amount of 1.4 million euros has been revised downwards as several expected financings have not arrived. It is therefore necessary to find a rational economic model :&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the channel's responsibles decided to pool TiVi5 Monde Afrique with that already active in the United States. The same programs are broadcast on both continents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Programing ==
TiVi5 Monde airs educational programs, cartoons, children's series and games. Starting 2012, 12% of the productions broadcast in the channel are [[Africa]]n. All the programs are 100% [[French language|French-speaking]]; the channel doesn't make any French dubbing of [[America]]n series.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its programs both playful and educational are broadcast without advertising.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This is a list of the programs formerly or currently broadcast on the channel:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv5monde.com/cms/USA/TiVi5MONDE/p-20208-lg3-What-s-on-TiVi5MONDE-.htm|title=What's On TiVi5MONDE|last=|first=|date=|website=TV5MONDE USA website|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United Platform''' ({{Lang-pt|Plataforma Unida}}, PU) was a political alliance in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The PU was established in 2003 as an alliance of the [[Democratic Convergence Party (Guinea-Bissau)|Democratic Convergence Party]], the [[Democratic Front (Guinea-Bissau)|Democratic Front]], the [[Democratic Social Front]], [[Struggle Front for the National Independence of Guinea|FLING]] and the [[Solidarity and Work Party]], and was led by [[Hélder Vaz Lopes]], a former leader of the [[Resistance of Guinea-Bissau-Bafatá Movement]].&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p399&lt;/ref&gt; A co-founder was his cousin [[Zinha Vaz]].&lt;ref name="MendyJr.2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Karibe Mendy|author2=Lobban Jr.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbJ8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA394|date=17 October 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8027-6|pages=394–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance received 4.5% of the vote in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]], but failed to win a seat. The PU did not nominate a candidate for the [[Guinea-Bissau presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential elections]], but supported runner-up [[Malam Bacai Sanhá]] of the [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]].&lt;ref name=M1&gt;Mendy, p326&lt;/ref&gt; The PU was dissolved before the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2008|2008 parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref name=M1/&gt;

'''Wirtschaftsphysik''' is a relatively new course of studies, introduced at the [[University of Ulm]] in 1997. The name might be translated into English by [[Econophysics]] but it is questionable if both terms mean the same thing.
It is composed of studies in [[Physics]], [[Economics]], [[Computer Science]] and [[Mathematics]]. In the first two years, the emphasis is on Physics and Mathematics but after the Bachelor Economics and Computer Science become more important.
In comparison to regular physics students, '''Wirtschaftsphysik''' students have to participate in about half as many experiments in [[experimental physics]] and are only required to take three of the usual five lectures in [[Theoretical Physics]].
