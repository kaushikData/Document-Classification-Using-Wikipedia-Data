'''''Adab al-Tabib''''' ({{lang-ar|أدب الطبيب}} ''Adab aț-Ṭabīb'', "[[Adab (Islam)|Morals]] of the physician") is the common title of a historical Arabic book on [[medical ethics]], written by [[Al-Ruhawi]], a 9th-century physician.  The title can be roughly translated "Practical Ethics of the Physician".  As the name suggests, it focuses on [[Adab (Islam)|adab]], the Islamic concept of etiquette and personal ethics, as it is defined in a medical context. One of the earliest texts on Islamic medical ethics, it has been called the "crowning achievement" of early works concerning ''adab'' in medicine.&lt;ref name=bioethics&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padella|first=Aasim|year=2007|title=Islam Medical Ethics|journal=Bioethics|volume=21|pages=169–178|url=http://www.aseanbiotechnology.info/Abstract/21025281.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2007.00540.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Al-Ruhawi was born a Christian, probably of the [[Nestorianism|Nestorian sect]] that had split from mainstream Christianity in 530.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, John (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10755a.htm Nestorius and Nestorianism]. ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved September 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not entirely clear, he was most likely still a Christian when he wrote ''Adab al-Tabib''.&lt;ref name=bioethics/&gt;&lt;ref name=levey/&gt;&lt;ref name=jishim&gt;{{cite journal|title=none|last=Al-Ghazal|first=Sharif|year=2004|volume=3|journal=Journal of the International Society for the History of Islamic Medicine|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his beliefs, ''Adab al-Tabib'' is primarily an Islamic text, built upon Islamic beliefs and practices.&lt;ref name=bioethics/&gt;  Due to this strong Islamic influence, a modern scholar has disputed this interpretation, claiming that only a full Muslim could have produced such a text.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy, Sahin (2002). "[http://www.ishim.net/ishimj/5/03.pdf The Religious Tradition of Ishaq ibn Ali al-Ruhawi: the Author of the First Medical Ethics Book in Islamic Medicine]. ''International Congress on the History of Medicine''. Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Adab al-Tabib'' builds on the works of several earlier Muslim and middle-eastern Christian philosophers and medical authorities, like [[Al-Kindi]] and [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]].  However, it draws from many other historical traditions as well, especially those of ancient Greece.  The book incorporates themes and direct quotes from Greek philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], and [[Hippocrates]], among others. It also borrows particularly heavily from the writings of the prominent Roman physician [[Galen]].  Despite his thoroughness in citing his influences, Al-Ruhawi notably makes no mention or acknowledgement to any earlier texts that specifically deal with Islamic medical ethics, suggesting that this book may have been the earliest work on the subject.&lt;ref name=levey/&gt;  

Because contemporary and later Islamic works have been relatively neglected in analysis, it is difficult to ascertain Al-Ruhawi's impact on later thinkers in the field.  Given Al-Ruhawi's extensive research and reliance on older traditions, and the degree to which Islamic medical ethics followed his ideas, it is likely that Al-Ruhawi's book was generally well-received and accepted.&lt;ref name=levey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levey|first=Martin|year=1967|title=Medical Ethics of Medieval Islam with Special Reference to Al-Ruhawi's 'Practical Ethics of the Physician'|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society|volume=57|pages=1–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Adab al-Tabib'' is divided into twenty chapters, each dealing with a specific topic of medical ethics.  They fall into three general categories: the conduct of the physician, the conduct of the patient, and the conduct of the public at large towards the medical profession and their patients. The text covers a physician's personal beliefs and practices, placing great importance on his faith in God and personal health and hygiene, as well as his manner with his colleagues, nurses, and patients.  Al-Ruhawi emphasizes respect for the physician in patients and visitors, even allowing for a doctor to overrule a patient's wishes when it is necessary for their health to do so.  He says that doctors should be placed high in the social hierarchy, with enough pay that they aren't forced into other work, although he also instructs doctors not to flaunt their wealth.  Al-Ruhawi says that the fees charged for rich patients should be enough to cover the expenses of poor patients who cannot pay for themselves, as otherwise medical care for both the rich and the poor suffer.&lt;ref name=levey/&gt;&lt;ref name=jishim/&gt;

In ''Adab al-Tabib'', Al-Ruhawi also discusses legislative practices and penalties for false and incompetent doctors.  To weed out quacks, he advocates medical exams and licenses, the contents of which would be heavily based on the works of Galen.  He encourages doctors to keep records of the patient's symptoms, treatments, and progress, so that it may be reviewed by peers should the patient die under his care.  Although he admits that patient survival is not always possible and is ultimately up to God, Al-Ruhawi recommends severe penalties for doctors who allow patients to die through negligence, even up to execution.&lt;ref name=levey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2528">In [[Scholasticism|Scholastic philosophy]], the '''aevum''' (also called '''aeviternity''') is the mode of existence experienced by [[angel]]s and by the [[saint]]s in [[heaven]]. In some ways, it is a state that logically lies between the [[eternity]] (timelessness) of [[God]] and the [[Time|temporal]] experience of [[Matter (philosophy)|material beings]].  It is sometimes referred to as "improper eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Anzulewicz, Henryk. "''Aeternitas'' - ''aevum'' - ''tempus''. The Concept of Time in the System of Albert the Great". ''The Medieval Concept of Time: Studies on the Scholastic Debate and Its Reception in Early Modern Philosophy''. Ed. Pasquale Porro. Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''aevum'' is [[Latin]], originally signifying "age", "aeon", or "everlasting time";&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1879), 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; the word ''aeviternity'' comes from the [[Medieval Latin]] [[neologism]] ''aeviternitas''.
 
The concept of the aevum dates back at least to [[Albertus Magnus]]'s treatise ''De quattuor coaequaevis''.&lt;ref&gt;Albertus Magnus, ''De IV coaequaevis'', tract. 2, qu. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its most familiar description is found in the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Aquinas identifies the aevum as the measure of the existence of beings that "recede less from permanence of being, forasmuch as their being neither consists in change, nor is the subject of change; nevertheless they have change annexed to them either actually, or potentially". As examples, he cites the [[Classical planet|heavenly bodies]] (which, in medieval science, were considered changeless in their nature, though variable in their position) and the angels, which "have an unchangeable being as regards their nature with changeableness as regards choice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas]], ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', First Part, Question 10, Article 5. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1010.htm#article5]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Frank Sheed]], in his book ''Theology and Sanity'', said that the aevum is also the measure of existence for the saints in heaven: "Aeviternity is the proper sphere of every created spirit, and therefore of the human soul... At death, [the body's] distracting relation to matter's time ceases to affect the soul, so that it can experience its proper aeviternity."&lt;ref&gt;Sheed, Frank. ''Theology and Sanity''. 2nd ed. San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations". [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows: "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg".

[[File:William Godwin by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|[[William Godwin]] (1756–1836), liberal, utilitarian and individualist philosopher thought of as the founder of [[philosophical anarchism]], in a portrait by Henry William Pickersgill]]
In founding [[philosophical anarchism]], [[William Godwin]] developed what many consider the first expression of [[modernism|modern]] anarchist thought.&lt;ref name="godwinsep"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Peter Kropotkin]], Godwin was "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work".&lt;ref name="EB1910"&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1910&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical anarchism contends that the [[State (polity)|state]] lacks [[legitimacy (political)|moral legitimacy]]; that there is no individual obligation or duty to obey the state and conversely that the state has no right to command individuals, but it does not advocate revolution to eliminate the state. According to ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought'', philosophical anarchism "is a component especially of [[individualist anarchism]]".&lt;ref name=outhwaite&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.).

Philosophical anarchists may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as an unfortunate and usually temporary "necessary evil", but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; As conceived by Godwin, it requires individuals to act in accordance with their own judgments and to allow every other individual the same liberty—conceived egoistically as by [[Max Stirner]], it implies that "the unique one" who truly "owns himself" recognizes no duties to others; and within the limit of his might, he does what is right for him.&lt;ref name=outhwaite/&gt; Godwin opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[minarchy|minimal state]] as a present "necessary evil"&lt;ref&gt;Godwin: "...however we may be obliged to admit it as a necessary evil for the present, it behoves us, as the friends of reason and the human species, to admit as little of it as possible, and carefully to observe whether, in consequence of the gradual illumination of the human mind, that little may not hereafter be diminished."

Retrieved 7 December 2006, from [http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9037183 Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin felt discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable.

Rather than throwing bombs or taking up arms to bring down the state, philosophical anarchists "have worked for a gradual change to free the individual from what they thought were the oppressive laws and social constraints of the modern state and allow all individuals to become self-determining and value-creating".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Brenda. The Provinceton Platers and the Culture of Modernity. Cambridge University Press 2005. pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; They may oppose the immediate elimination of the state by violent means out of concern that it would be left unsecured against the establishment of a more harmful and oppressive state. This is especially true among those anarchists who consider violence and the state as synonymous, or who consider it counterproductive where public reaction to violence results in increased "law enforcement" efforts.

== Classical anarchist schools of thought ==
=== Mutualism ===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]]]]
[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] began in 18th-century English and French labor movements, then took an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"A member of a community," ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticized [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to Josiah Warren or another dissident Owenite in the same circles; Wilbur, Shawn, 2006, "More from the 1826 "Mutualist"?"&lt;/ref&gt; This influenced individualist anarchists in the United States such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[William B. Greene]]. [[Josiah Warren]] proposed similar ideas in 1833&lt;ref&gt;Warren published the periodical "The Peaceful Revolutionist" in 1833, seven years before Proudhon's "What is Property."&lt;/ref&gt; after participating in a failed [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] experiment.&lt;ref&gt;"While more learned men lost faith in utopias and in human nature when the New Harmony experiment failed, Warren became more trusting than before in man's intelligence and perfectibility." – ''Native American Anarchism'', pg. 94, Eunice Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]]&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his "Bank of the People"] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William B. Greene]] introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to [[Benjamin R. Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., "On Picket Duty", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)'' (1881–1908); 5 January 1889; 6, 10; APS Online, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], [[Freedom of association|free association]], voluntary contract, federation and credit and currency reform. Many mutualists believe a market without [[government intervention]] drives prices down to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent and interest according to the [[labor theory of value]]. Firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, raising wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Preface |last=Carson |first=Kevin |title=Studies in Mutualist Political Economy |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |chapterurl=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html |year=2007 |isbn=1-4196-5869-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v8wrbTrn?url=http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member." From "Communism versus Mutualism", Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) by [[William Batchelder Greene]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some see mutualism as between individualist and collectivist anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

"[http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/greene/wbg-css.html Communism&amp;nbsp;– Capitalism&amp;nbsp;– Socialism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002234/http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/greene/wbg-css.html |date=27 September 2007 }}", ''Equality'' (1849), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Later individualist anarchists used the term mutualism, but retained little emphasis on synthesis while [[social anarchism|social anarchists]] such as the authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] claim mutualism as a subset of their philosophical tradition.&lt;ref name="faq-social"/&gt;

=== Social anarchism ===
{{main|Social anarchism}}
[[Social anarchism]] is an umbrella term used to identify a broad category of anarchism independent of [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name="faq-social"/&gt; Where individualist forms of anarchism emphasize [[autonomy|personal autonomy]] and the rational nature of human beings, social anarchism sees "individual freedom as conceptually connected with social equality and emphasize community and mutual aid".&lt;ref&gt;Suissa, Judith(2001) "Anarchism, Utopias and Philosophy of Education", ''Journal of Philosophy of Education'' 35 (4), 627–46. {{doi|10.1111/1467-9752.00249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism is used to specifically describe anarchist tendencies within anarchism that have an emphasis on the communitarian and cooperative aspects of anarchist theory and practice. Social anarchism includes (but is not limited to) [[collectivist anarchism]], [[anarcho-communism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]].&lt;ref name="faq-social"/&gt;

==== Collectivist anarchism ====
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
[[File:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]
[[Collectivist anarchism]] is a revolutionary&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"&gt;Patsouras, Louis. 2005. Marx in Context. iUniverse. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; form of anarchism most commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Johann Most]] and the anti-authoritarian section of the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] (1864–1876).&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive elite group through acts of violence, or "[[propaganda by the deed]]", which would inspire the workers to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.&lt;ref name="Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54"/&gt; Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. Although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin's associate, [[James Guillaume]], put it this way in his essay, ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]''(1876): {{quotation|When... production comes to outstrip consumption... [e]veryone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly reduce, abuse and waste.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but it opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite Marxism striving for a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin, Mikhail; ''[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm Statism and Anarchism]'': {{quotation|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some collectivist anarchists do not oppose the use of currency. Some support workers being paid based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase commodities in a communal market.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin, Mikhail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods "to each according to his need". Many modern-day collectivist anarchists hold their form of anarchism as a permanent society rather than a carryover to anarcho-communism or a gift economy. Some collectivist anarchists such as proponents of [[participatory economics]] believe in [[remuneration]] and a form of credit but do not believe in money or markets.

Although collectivist anarchism shares many similarities with anarchist communism, there are also many key differences between them. For example, collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe that the concept of ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Beckman. What is Anarchism?, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchists]] often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to the amount of time spent contributing to society and production while anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished all together and goods should be distributed "[[From each according to his ability to each according to his need|to each according to his or her need"]].

In the early 20th century, [[anarcho-syndicalism]] arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism. More heavily focused on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, [[syndicalism]] posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles of syndicalism include workers' solidarity, [[direct action]] (such as [[general strike]]s and [[recovered factory|workplace recuperations]]) and [[workers' self-management]].

Anarcho-syndicalism and other branches of anarchism are not mutually exclusive: anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution. According to [[An Anarchist FAQ]], anarcho-syndicalist economic systems often take the form of either a [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] economic system or an [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] economic system.&lt;ref name="faq-social"&gt;"[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3#seca32 Are there different types of social anarchism?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123103313/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionA3 |date=23 November 2010 }}", [[An Anarchist FAQ]].

[[Rudolf Rocker]] is considered a leading anarcho-syndicalist theorist.&lt;ref name="faq-social"/&gt; He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism'' by Rudolph Rocker] '.' Retrieved 7 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more frequently associated with labor struggles of the early 20th century (particularly in [[Anarchism in France|France]] and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]]), many syndicalist organizations are active today, including the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden|SAC]] in Sweden, the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|USI]] in Italy and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Spain. A number of these organizations are united across national borders by membership in the [[International Workers Association]].

=== Individualist anarchism ===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
[[Individualist anarchism]] refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems.&lt;ref name="ryner"&gt;"What do I mean by individualism? I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience."[https://www.marxists.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucker"&gt;"I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty.

[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|221x221px|[[19th century philosophy|19th century philosopher]] [[Max Stirner]], usually considered a prominent early [[individualist anarchist]] (sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]])]]
[[Egoist anarchism]] is a school of anarchist thought that originated in the [[philosophy of Max Stirner|philosophy]] of [[Max Stirner]], a nineteenth-century [[Young Hegelians|Hegelian]] philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of [[individualist anarchism]]".&lt;ref name="SEP-Stirner"&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=max-stirner |title=Max Stirner |last=Leopold  |first=David|date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner's philosophy is usually called "[[egoist anarchism|egoism]]" as he says that the egoist rejects devotion to "a great idea, a  cause, a doctrine, a system, a lofty calling", saying that the egoist has no political calling but rather "lives themselves out" without regard to "how well or ill humanity may fare thereby".&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is his power to obtain what he desires.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge. Encyclopedia Corporation. p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions – including the notion of state, property as a right, natural rights in general and the very notion of society – were mere ''spooks'' in the mind. Stirner wanted to "abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members".&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Stirner's idea of the [[Union of egoists]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Verein von Egoisten}}) was first expounded in ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = [[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]] | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name="nonserviam"&gt;{{citation|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13 |title=The union of egoists |journal=Non Serviam |volume=1 |first=Svein Olav |last=Nyberg |pages=13–14 |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg |oclc=47758413 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012091850/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union requires that all parties participate out of a [[Selfishness|conscious egoism]].

Though Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some [[libertarian socialism|libertarian communists]] and [[anarcho-communist]]s. "For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management" discusses Stirner and speaks of a "communist egoism", which is said to be a "synthesis of individualism and collectivism" and says that "greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society".&lt;ref&gt;For Ourselves, {{cite web|url=http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228054533/http://home.teleport.com/~rasputin/RTBGreedy-v1_2_5-en.htm |archivedate=28 December 2008 }} ''The Right to Be Greedy: Theses On The Practical Necessity Of Demanding Everything'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of [[libertarian communism]] such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]] are influenced by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alfredo_M._Bonanno__The_Theory_of_the_Individual__Stirner_s_Savage_Thought.html Alfredo M.

The Scottish born German writer [[John Henry Mackay]] found out about Stirner while reading a copy of [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance]]''. Later, Mackay looked for a copy of ''The Ego and Its Own'' and after being fascinated with it he wrote a biography of Stirner (''Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk''), published in German in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1907/04/20/archives/ideas-of-max-stirner-first-english-translation-of-his-book-the-ego.html "IDEAS OF MAX STIRNER.; First English Translation of His Book, "The Ego and His Own" – His Attack on Socialism – The Most Revolutionary Book Ever Published." by JAMES HUNEKER]&lt;/ref&gt; Mackay's propaganda of stirnerist egoism and of male homosexual and bisexual rights affected [[Adolf Brand]], who in 1896 published the world's first ongoing homosexual publication, ''[[Der Eigene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] had begun a journal called ''Prometheus'' in 1870, but only one issue was published.

New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another later German anarchist publication influenced deeply by Stirner was ''[[Der Einzige]]''. It appeared in 1919, as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseud. for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseudonym for [[Salomo Friedlaender]]).

Stirnerian egoism became a main influence on [[European individualist anarchism]] including its main proponents in the early 20th century such as [[Emile Armand]] and [[Han Ryner]] in France, [[Renzo Novatore]] in Italy, [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] in Spain and in Russia [[Lev Chernyi]].

''The Bonnot Gang''. Rebel Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The illegalists openly embraced criminality as a lifestyle. Some American individualist anarchists such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], abandoned [[natural rights]] positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s egoist anarchism.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, as well as his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later, [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

An important concern for American individualist anarchism was [[free love]]. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women—for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name="freelove"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html|title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism, By Wendy McElroy|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, "Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism," in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A.

Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name="freelove"/&gt;

[[Freethought]] also motivated activism in this movement. "Freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''Lucifer, the Light-Bearer''".&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title=The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work=Mises Institute|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''Lucifer, the Light-Bearer'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

European individualist anarchists include Max Stirner, [[Albert Libertad]], [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]], [[Émile Armand]], [[Enrico Arrigoni]], [[Lev Chernyi]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Han Ryner]], [[Renzo Novatore]], [[Miguel Giménez Igualada]] and currently [[Michel Onfray]]. Two influential authors in European individualist anarchists are [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (see [[Anarchism and Friedrich Nietzsche]]) and [[Georges Palante]].

From the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of [[Individualist anarchism in Europe#France|French individualist anarchism]]. An early figure was [[Anselme Bellegarrigue]]. He participated in the [[French Revolution of 1848]], was author and editor of ''Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique'' and wrote the important early ''[[Anarchist Manifesto]]'' in 1850. ''Autonomie Individuelle'' was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-presse-anarchiste.net/spip.php?rubrique258|title=Autonomie Individuelle (1887  –  1888)|author=Collectif Sarka-SPIP|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition later continued with such intellectuals as [[Albert Libertad]], [[André Lorulot]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Victor Serge]], [[Zo d'Axa]] and [[Rirette Maitrejean]], who in 1905 developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, ''[[L'Anarchie]]''. Outside this journal, [[Han Ryner]] wrote ''Petit Manuel individualiste'' (1903) and later appeared the journal ''[[L'En-Dehors]]'' created by Zo d'Axa in 1891.

French individualist circles had a strong sense of personal libertarianism and experimentation. [[Naturism]] and [[free love]] contents started to have a strong influence in individualist anarchist circles and from there it expanded to the rest of anarchism also appearing in Spanish individualist anarchist groups.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt;

[[Anarchist naturism]] was promoted by [[Henri Zisly]], [[Emile Gravelle]]&lt;ref name="naturismo2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/1121.htm|title=Robert Brentano, Fernando Fernán-Gómez, Guy Debord, Leo Tolstoy, Alexander Berkman, Émile Gravelle, Louise Michel, Santiago Salvador Franch, Mollie Steimer, Ricardo Flores Magón, Dorothy Day, Joffre Stewart, on this day in recovered history November 21|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist "partisan of the ''[[intentional communities|milieux libres]]'', publisher of "Flambeau" ("an enemy of authority") in 1901 in Vienna. Most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (''communautés expérimentales'') in which he participated in several.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eskimo.com/~recall/bleed/0226.htm|title=Jeanne Morand, Jean Grave, Georges Butaud, Kronstadt, Umanita Nova, Emma Goldman, Marie Ferré..., What Happened on this day, in recovered history February 26|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In this sense, the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of french individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist [[naturism]], the strong defence of birth control methods, the idea of "unions of egoists" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others".&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2044944|title=La insumisión voluntaria.

The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Emile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Clément Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital."&lt;/ref&gt; Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of "might" rather than "right" and for the most part illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal,&lt;ref name="Parry, Richard 1987. p. 15"&gt;Parry, Richard.

Spain received the influence of American individualist anarchism but most importantly it was related to the French currents. At the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain takes force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, [[Federico Urales]] and J. Elizalde, who will translate French and American individualists.&lt;ref name="frenchexperimentation"/&gt; Important in this respect were also magazines such as ''La Idea Libre'', ''[[La revista blanca]]'', ''Etica'', ''[[Iniciales]]'', ''Al margen'' and ''Nosotros''. In Germany, the Scottish-German [[John Henry McKay]] became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. [[Adolf Brand]] (1874–1945) was a German writer, [[stirner]]ist [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and homosexuality. BIn 1896, Brand published a German homosexual periodical, ''[[Der Eigene]]''. The Irish [[anarchism|anarchist]] writer of the [[Decadent movement]] [[Oscar Wilde]] influenced individualist anarchists such as [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;ref&gt;"We must kill the christian philosophy in the most radical sense of the word. How much mostly goes sneaking inside the democratic civilization (this most cynically ferocious form of christian depravity) and it goes more towards the categorical negation of human Individuality.

"Towards the Hurricane" by [[Renzo Novatore]]&lt;/ref&gt; and gained the admiration of [[Benjamin Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;"When Oscar Wilde's plea for penal reform, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, was widely criticized, Tucker enthusiastically endorsed the poem, urging all of his subscribers to read it. Tucker, in fact, published an American edition. From its early championing of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass to a series of short stories by Francis du Bosque in its last issues, ''Liberty'' was a vehicle of controversial, avant-garde literature."[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&amp;chapter=100896&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 "Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, &amp; Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order" by Wendy McElroy]&lt;/ref&gt;

De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]].

Notable contemporary writers espousing green anarchism include [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Daniel Chodorkoff]], anthropologist [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]] and people around [[Institute for Social Ecology]]; and those critical of technology such as [[Layla AbdelRahim]], [[Derrick Jensen]], George Draffan, and [[John Zerzan]]; and others such as [[Alan Carter (philosopher)|Alan Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction|last=Ward|first=Colin|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=2004|isbn=0-19-280477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social ecologists, also considered a kind of socialist anarchist, often criticize the main currents of anarchism for their focus and debates about politics and economics instead of a focus on [[eco-system]] (human and environmental). This theory promotes [[libertarian municipalism]] and [[green technology]]. Anarcho-primitivists often criticize mainstream anarchism for supporting [[civilization]] and modern technology which they believe are inherently based on domination and exploitation. They instead advocate the process of [[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]] or reconnecting with the natural environment. [[Veganarchism]] is the political philosophy of [[veganism]] (more specifically [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]]) and green anarchism.&lt;ref name="essay"&gt;Dominick, Brian. ''Animal Liberation and Social Revolution: A vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism'', third edition, Firestarter Press, 1997, pp. 1, 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This encompasses viewing the [[State (polity)|state]] as unnecessary and harmful to both human and animals whilst practising a vegan diet.&lt;ref name="essay"/&gt;

==== Anarcho-primitivism ====
{{main|Anarcho-primitivism}}
[[Anarcho-primitivism]] is an anarchist critique of the origins and progress of [[civilization]]. According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]] and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-"civilized" ways of life through deindustrialisation, abolition of the [[division of labour]] or [[specialization (functional)|specialization]] and abandonment of large-scale organization [[technology|technologies]]. There are other non-anarchist forms of [[primitivism]], and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern, civilized problems.

Many traditional anarchists reject the critique of civilization while some such as Wolfi Landstreicher endorse the critique but do not consider themselves anarcho-primitivists. Some anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of achieving a [[feral]] state of being through "[[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]]".

==== Anarcho-naturism ====
{{main|Anarcho-naturism}}
[[Anarcho-naturism]] (also anarchist naturism and naturist anarchism) appeared in the late 19th century as the union of anarchist and [[naturist]] philosophies.&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ortega"&gt;"Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related."[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html "Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

==== Social ecology ====
{{main|Social ecology (theory)}}
[[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]] is a philosophy developed by [[Murray Bookchin]] in the 1960s which holds that present [[environmental issues|ecological problems]] are rooted in deep-seated [[social problems]], particularly in dominatory [[hierarchical]] political and social systems. These have resulted in an uncritical acceptance of an overly competitive grow-or-die philosophy. It suggests that this cannot be resisted by individual action such as [[ethical consumerism]], but must be addressed by more nuanced ethical thinking and collective activity grounded in [[radical democracy|radical democratic ideals]]. The complexity of relationships between people and with [[nature]] is emphasised, along with the importance of establishing social structures that take account of this.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy''. Oakland: AK Press, 2005, p. 85-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarcha-feminism ===
{{main|Anarcha-feminism}}
[[File:Emma Goldman seated.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Emma Goldman]], important [[anarcha-feminist]] writer and activist]]
[[Anarcha-feminism]] (occasionally called anarcho-feminism) is a form of anarchism that synthesizes [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views patriarchy (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of involuntary hierarchy which anarchists often oppose. Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Anarcha-feminists are especially critical of marriage. For instance, the feminist anarchist Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that "[woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life".&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, "Marriage and Love", ''Red Emma Speaks'', p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcha-feminists also often criticize the views of some of the traditional anarchists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] who have believed that patriarchy is only a minor problem and is dependent only on the existence of the state and capitalism and will disappear soon after such institutions are abolished. Anarcha-feminists by contrast view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]] and capitalism. As [[L. Susan Brown|Susan Brown]] puts it, "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Susan. "Beyond Feminism:  Anarchism and Human Freedom" 'Anarchist Papers 3' Black Rose Books (1990) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarcho-pacifism ===
{{main|Anarcho-pacifism}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry David Thoreau]], early influence on [[anarcho-pacifism]]]]
[[Anarcho-pacifism]] (also pacifist anarchism or anarchist pacifism) is a form of [[anarchism]] which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. The main precedent was [[Henry David Thoreau]] who through his work [[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]] influenced both [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s advocacy of [[nonviolent resistance]].&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence|title=Resisting the nation state|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a global movement, anarchist pacifism emerged shortly before [[World War II]] in the [[Netherlands]], Great Britain and the United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for [[nuclear disarmament]].

Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced [[propaganda of the deed]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. Tolstoy argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent, since it is by definition opposition to coercion and force and that since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic.  His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by Gandhi, an [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=George|title=Anarchism: a History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|publisher=Broadview Press|location=Peterborough|year=2004|isbn=1-55111-629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France in December 1902, [[Georges Yvetot]] was one of the founders of the ''Ligue antimilitariste'', along with fellow anarchists [[Henri Beylie]], [[Paraf-Javal]], [[Albert Libertad]] and [[Émile Janvion]]. The ''Ligue antimilitariste'' was to become the French section of the ''[[Association internationale antimilitariste]]'' (AIA) founded in Amsterdam in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=38 |last=Miller|first=Paul B.|title=From Revolutionaries to Citizens: Antimilitarism in France, 1870–1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oav-cbjw3QcC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=2014-12-03 |date=2002-03-14|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious anarchism ===
{{details|Anarchism and religion}}
[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Leo Tolstoy]], theorist of [[Christian anarchism]]]]
[[Religious anarchism]] refers to a set of related anarchist ideologies that are inspired by the teachings of (organized) religions, but many anarchists have traditionally been skeptical of and opposed to [[organized religion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Walter|Walter, Nicolas]] "[http://www.spunk.org/texts/pubs/freedom/raven/sp000614.txt Anarchism and Religion]", South Place Ethical Society, 14 July 1991. Hosted at the [[Spunk Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many different religions have served as inspiration for religious forms of anarchism, most notably Christianity, as Christian anarchists believe that biblical teachings give credence to anarchist philosophy. Non-Christian forms of religious anarchism include [[Buddhist anarchism]], [[Jewish anarchism]] and most recently [[Neopaganism]]. Neopaganism focuses on the sanctity of [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]] and equality and is often of a decentralized nature. This led to a number of Neopagan-inspired anarchists, one of the most prominent of which is [[Starhawk]], who writes extensively about both [[spirituality]] and activism.

==== Christian anarchism ====
[[Christian anarchism]] is a form of religious anarchism that seeks to combine anarchism with Christianity, claiming that anarchism is justified by the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]]. Early Christian communities have been described by Christian anarchists and some historians as possessing [[anarcho-communist]] characteristics. Christian anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Ammon Hennacy]] believe that the teachings of [[Paul of Tarsus]] caused a shift from the earlier more [[egalitarian]] and anarchistic teachings of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Church and State|last=Tolstoy|first=Leo|author2=|publisher=|year=1882|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=|quote=This deviation begins from the times of the Apostles and especially from that hankerer after mastership Paul|authorlink=Leo Tolstoy|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=The Book of Ammon|last=Hennacy|first=Ammon|author2=|publisher=Hennacy|year=1970|isbn=|location=|page=475|pages=|quote=Paul and the Churches|authorlink=Ammon Hennacy|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others believe that Paul with his strong emphasis on God's Providence is to be understood as a holding to anarchist principles.

=== Anarchism without adjectives ===
{{main|Anarchism without adjectives}}
[[File:Voltairine de Cleyre (1891).jpg|thumb|[[Voltairine de Cleyre]]]]
[[Anarchism without adjectives]], in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, "referred to an [[hyphen|unhyphenated]] form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as [[Anarchist communism|communist]], [[collectivism|collectivist]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]], or [[individualist anarchism|individualist]]. For others, [...] [i]t was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools".&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard "Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898" [p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism without adjectives emphasizes harmony between various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs. The expression was coined by Cuban-born [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]], who used it in [[Barcelona]] in November 1889 as a call for [[Toleration|tolerance]], after being troubled by the "bitter debates" between the different movements.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf Rocker]] said that the different types of anarchism presented "only different methods of economy, the practical possibilities of which have yet to be tested, and that the first objective is to secure the personal and social [[Free will|freedom]] of men no matter upon which economics basis this is to be accomplished".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voltairine de Cleyre]] was an anarchist without adjectives who initially identified herself as an individualist anarchist but later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism, while refusing to identify herself with any of the contemporary schools ("The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether . . . Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises").&lt;ref name="Voltairine"&gt;Voltairine De Cleyre, "Why I Am an Anarchist"&lt;/ref&gt; She commented that "Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom" although she stopped short of denouncing these tendencies as un-anarchistic ("There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [these systems] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to").&lt;ref name="Voltairine" /&gt; [[File:Fauresebastien police.jpg|left|thumb|120px|[[Sebastien Faure]]]] [[Errico Malatesta]] was another proponent of anarchism without adjectives, stating that "[i]t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses".&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Max Nettlau, ''A Short History of Anarchism''. p. 198-99&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Synthesis anarchism ====
{{main|Synthesis anarchism}}
[[Synthesis anarchism]], synthesism or synthesis federations is a form of anarchist organization which tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of [[anarchism without adjectives]].&lt;ref name="infoshop.org"&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in An Anarchist FAQ {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=7 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents [[Volin]] and [[Sebastien Faure]].&lt;ref name="infoshop.org" /&gt; It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global [[International of Anarchist Federations]].&lt;ref name="infoshop.org" /&gt;

=== Platformism ===
{{main|Platformism}}
[[Platformism]] is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement which shares an affinity with organising in the tradition of [[Dielo Truda]]'s ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''.&lt;ref name="Platformtext"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000|title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)|last=Dielo Trouda group|publisher=FdCA|year=2006|location=Italy|authorlink=Dielo Trouda|accessdate=2006-10-24|origyear=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Platform'' came from the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 [[October Revolution]], which led eventually to the victory of [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other like-minded groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to explain and address the failure of the anarchist movement during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. As a controversial pamphlet, the Platform drew both praise and [[Dielo Truda#Controversy|criticism from anarchists]] worldwide.

== Contemporary developments ==
{{main|Contemporary anarchism}}
Anarchism generates many eclectic and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]] philosophies and movements. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century,&lt;ref name="revival"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Leonard|date=September 2007|title=Anarchism Revived|journal=New Political Science|volume=29|issue=3|pages=297–312|doi=10.1080/07393140701510160}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools have appeared. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] has posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the last century" contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], ecological and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas" and who by the start of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.&lt;ref name="graeber" /&gt;

=== Post-left anarchy ===
{{details|Post-left anarchy}}
[[Post-left anarchy]] is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional [[Left-wing politics|leftism]]. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organizations and [[morality]].&lt;ref name="ideology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/postleft.htm|title=insurgentdesire.org.uk|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the work of [[Max Stirner]]&lt;ref name="ideology" /&gt; and by the [[Situationist International]],&lt;ref name="ideology" /&gt; post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social [[insurrectionary anarchism|insurrection]] and a rejection of leftist social organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macphee |first=Josh |title=Realizing the Impossible |publisher=AK Press |location=Stirling |year=2007 |isbn=1-904859-32-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazines ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', ''[[Green Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'' have been involved in developing post-left anarchy. Individual writers associated with the tendency are [[Hakim Bey]], [[Bob Black]], [[John Zerzan]], [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Fredy Perlman]], [[Lawrence Jarach]] and Wolfi Landstreicher. The contemporary network of collectives [[CrimethInc.]] is an exponent of post-left anarchist views.

=== Post-anarchism ===
{{details|Post-anarchism}}
The term [[post-anarchism]] was originated by [[Saul Newman]] and first received popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. However, subsequent to Newman's use of the term it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International|situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and [[Zapatismo]]. By its very nature, post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Lewis Call]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]] and [[Michel Onfray]].

=== Queer anarchism ===
{{main|Queer anarchism}}
[[Queer anarchism]] is a form of [[socialism]] which suggests anarchism as a solution to the issues faced by the [[LGBT community]], mainly [[heteronormativity]], [[homophobia]], [[transphobia]] and [[biphobia]]. Anarcho-queer arose during the late 20th century based on the work of Michel Foucault ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.

=== Left-wing market anarchism ===

[[Left-wing market anarchism]] is associated with scholars such as [[Kevin Carson]],&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Kevin A. (2008).  ''Organization Theory: A Libertarian Perspective''.

=== Anarcho-capitalism ===
[[Anarcho-capitalism]] is an ideology that espouses anything voluntary is moral.  This includes a voluntary employee/employer hierarchy. Anarcho-Capitalism advocates the elimination of the [[state (polity)|state]] in favour of [[sovereign individual|individual sovereignty]] in a [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Caplan |first1= Bryan|authorlink1= Bryan Caplan|editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title=Anarchism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi= 10.4135/9781412965811.n7|isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=10-13 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham, ''Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nft4e62nicsC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anarcho-capitalism+libertarian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=R9JiTMCQOYH6lwfGw-SICg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20libertarian&amp;f=false p 51]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state [[libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]],&lt;ref name=Tormey&gt;Tormey, Simon.

'''Andreas Röschlaub''' (21 October 1768 – 7 July 1835) was a German physician born in [[Lichtenfels, Bavaria]].

He studied medicine at the Universities of [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Bamberg|Bamberg]], gaining his doctorate at the latter institution in 1795. In 1798 he became a full professor of [[pathology]] at [[Bamberg]], and in 1802 transferred to the [[University of Landshut]], where he was director of the medical school. In 1826 he relocated to the [[University of Munich]] as a professor of medicine.
He died on July 7, 1835 during a recreational trip to [[Ulm]].

Röschlaub is remembered for development of the ''Erregbarkeitstheorie'' (excitability theory), which was a modification of [[Brunonian system of medicine|Brownianism]], a speculative theory of medicine that was initially formulated by Scottish physician [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]] (1735–1788).

He was editor of ''Magazin zur Vervollkommnung der theoretischen und praktischen Heilkunde'' (Magazine for the Perfection of Theoretical and Practical Medicine), and the author of a textbook on classification of diseases titled ''Lehrbuch der Nosologie''.

== Role in German [[Romantic medicine|Romantic Medicine]] ==

Until recently, the history of German medicine, particularly of Romantic medicine, had essentially denigrated, then largely forgotten, the contributions of the physician Andreas Röschlaub of Bamberg, a process that one reviewer terms "a curious combination of obscurity and notoriety." (Nigel Reeves) However, a major revision of his place in German and European medicine, in particular Romantic medicine and the advancement of the [[Brunonian system of medicine|Brunonian system]], by N. Tsouyopoulos, has come to the conclusion that he "was one of the most well-known, controversial and influential personalities of his time." His writings were extensive and influential as regards the problem of the reform of medicine and its placing on a sound scientific footing, and it was these writings that framed much of the debate in Germany at the time. Important figures of the time, such as Schelling and Hufeland undertook trips to Bamberg to meet him and seek his views. As one contemporary historian wrote "even public teachers and not insignificant figures wrote textbooks in which almost every paragraph begins with 'Röschlaub teaches' " .&lt;ref name="Nelly book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tsouyopoulos|first=Nelly|title=Andreas Röschlaub und die Romantische Medizin: Die philosophische Grundlagen der modernen Medizin|year=1982|publisher=Fischer Verlag|location=Stuttgart: Gustav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main reason for the neglect of Röschlaub's place in history is likely his acceptance of the ideas of Dr. [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]] while a medical student and their enthusiastic promotion, including making it the basis of a doctoral dissertation. He then further advanced Brown's ideas on graduation, making Germany the main centre for the implementation of the [[Brunonian system of medicine]]. Brown's ideas had been known in Germany some 10 years after the publication of ''Elementa Medicinae'' in 1780, when Dr. Christoph Girtanner, a well-known physician in [[Göttingen]], wrote a paper in a French journal on Brunonianism without attributing the ideas to Brown, creating a minor scandal. Subsequently, a medical student at the university of Bamberg sent a copy of Brown's text to Professor Adam M. Weikard (1742-1803), who was sufficiently impressed to arrange the first German printing in 1794, and then to follow this with the publication the following year of his translation into German (Johann Brown's ''Grundsätze der Arzneilehre aus dem Lateinischen übersetzt'', Frankfurt). Then in 1796 a second translation, by Christoff Pfaff, was made available.

Röschlaub made his own translation, but did not publish it until 1806-7 (in three volumes as ''John Brown's sämtliche Werke'') out of consideration for Weikard. Meanwhile, Röschlaub worked closely on his graduation with Adalbert Marcus, the director of the famous hospital in Bamberg, to work out the implementation of the Brunonian system and were ready to publish the results in 1797. The main work was Röschlaub's ''Untersuchungen über Pathogenie oder Einleitung in die Heilkunde'', 3 vols. Frankfurt, 1798-1800. The work and writings that came out of the Bamberg clinic made the town a famous, intellectual and medical centre."&lt;ref name="Nelly Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsouyopoulos|first=Nelly|title=The Influence of John Brown's Ideas in Germany|journal=Medical History|year=1988|volume=Supplement No. 8|pages=63–74|pmc=2557344|doi=10.1017/s0025727300070800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaboration with Schelling ===
In 1799 Röschlaub created a journal, the ''Magazin der Vervollkommung der theoretischen und praktischen Heilkunde'', published eventually in 10 volumes between 1799 and 1809. In the first volume, the famous natural philosopher, [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], wrote an article replying to a critical review of Brunonian literature in the renowned ''Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung'' earlier that year. While Schelling had been initially critical of Brown's work (''Weltseele'', 1798), seeing in it but a mechanical approach, his contact with Röschlaub allowed him to appreciate the dynamic, vital nature of Brown's approach as he expressed in his ''The first outline of a system of a philosophy of nature'' (1799). Schelling's embracing of Brown's ideas led to a close collaboration with Röschlaub and a visit to [[Bamberg]] in 1800. Schelling's main contribution to the theory of excitability was to explain that there was a receptive and active antithetical function, which involved the generative power ([[Blumenbach|Blumenbach's]] ''Bildungstrieb'' and Dr, Samuel Hahnemann's ''Lebenserzeugungskraft''). Schelling held that each organism needs a 'special rhythm' and that this was a function of a certain degree of receptivity and activity, deviation from which meant disorder "because it disturbs the rhythm of self-reproduction and finally influences the reproduction process itself, thus causing not only quantitative but also qualitative changes in the organism." &lt;ref name="Nelly Article"/&gt;

The nature of Schelling's influence in German culture was such as to further promote the Brunonian system, as presented by Röschlaub. "It was Röschlaub's explanation which made Brown's principle [of life as a 'forced state'] acceptable" to the German mind which had a more dynamic conception of life. Röschlaub helped to bring out the dynamic interplay between the outer stimulant ('excitant') and the inner life potential (excitability) resulting in the activity known as life (biological excitation). The organism possesses an intrinsic receptive activity to be acted upon but also a proactive ability to respond. Röschlaub also refined Brown's idea that disorders resulted from an excess (hypersthenia) or deficit (hyposthenia) of stimuli by adding that this involved a disporoportion between the receptive and pro-active sides of excitability.&lt;ref name="Nelly Article"/&gt;

=== Role of Physiology ===
Röschlaub's work also allowed him to tie Brown's elements of a system of medicine to the emerging idea that physiology was the key to a scientific medicine. In this regard, Brown's central idea that pathology was simply a sub-set of physiology, a stretching of normal healthy dynamic rhythms or functions beyond a certain supportable degree, was central to then allowing German medicine to consider that "pathology, nosology and clinical practice could be linked to physiology" which seemed the way to establish a solid foundation for medicine in natural science.&lt;ref name="Nelly Article"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
:Scientific physiology was a part of medical education in Germany…but they could not see how they could use these basic sciences in the treatment of diseases.&lt;ref name="Nelly Article"/&gt;
Medicine, for Röschlaub, becomes a science only when a true scientific physiology exists. "Only then will medicine be possible as a true 'art' when organismic physiology becomes a truly perfected science."&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt;  (1801) This meant that physiology had to take into account a life principle (Lebensprinzip) that organized matter, but was not dependent on matter.&lt;ref name=Broman&gt;{{cite book|last=Broman|first=Thomas H.|title=The Transformation of German Academic Medicine 1750-1820|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521552311|pages=Chapter 5: Breaking the shackles of history: The Brunonian revolution in Germany|url=http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521552318}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Röschlaub worked with Johann Christian Reil's general conception of physiology, which accepted that physiology was a product of natural forces, but tended to see these in chemical terms uniquely.&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt;

Röschlaub's explanation of excitability (''Erregbarkeit'') as a dynamic, polarity between two antithetical functions - receptivity and pro-activity - made Brown's principle acceptable and also verifiable "and as such applicable to practical medical diagnosis and therapy."&lt;ref name="Nelly Article"/&gt; His continued work, while it led to some differences with Schelling, further elaborated the Brunonian system, but Röschlaub eventually came to realize that it could not be taken further without a more overarching theory for excitation itself and the understanding of life energy [Nelly article p.&amp;nbsp;72] (which would eventually emerge in the work of [[Wilhelm Reich]] on orgone energy).

=== Debate on Human Nature ===
The Enlightenment view of human nature was an essentially static one (the unique individual who could be perfected according to reason), that of Romantic medicine dynamic (man was unique, but also evolving). While the idea of the mutability of human nature had emerged in the 1700s, it took root in the "dynamization and historification of consciousness through German philosophy."&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt;

German philosophy had an emerging view of life and consciousness as activity and action, such as expressed by Fichte: "The only Being is Life. And the modes of action are the only reality of the I." which Röschlaub often quoted,
and which idea he expressed himself: "If we call the efficacy of living actions 'Life', then we must say by way of epitomizing this that all these bodies live." (1800) &lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt; 
Out of this conception came the possibility of a new presentation of the relation between subject (I, consciousness-organism) and object (outer world, nature). The outer world wins for the first time a fundamental significance for the 'subject'; it can be seen as the ground of consciousness and life; it conditions namely the mode of the subject without annulling it; it is the stimulus of activity which modulates the subject, a view that was strikingly close to that held by John Brown, but which could not be perceived except in the more dynamic context of German Romantic medicine.

The healthcare implications were that a dynamic view considered therapeutic measures affecting the interior milieu important considerations for the physician.Röschlaub entered the debate on this issue arguing for the role of the physician in "social medicine" or hygiene, and the importance of hygiene itself to a scientific medicine, a position that was largely taken up later by Virchow, whose views on this in 1849 could have been word-for-word those of Röschlaub.

:If medicine is to really fulfill its great task, then it must intervene in political and social life at large; it must list the hindrances which stand in the way of the normal fulfillment of the life processes, and work to eliminate them. Should that ever be achieved, then will medicine be as it ought to be – a common property for all. It will then cease to be medicine and will merge into the general, unified body of scientific knowledge which is synonymous with 'know-how'.&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt;

However, where Virchow only saw hygiene as a prophylactic measure (negative role), Röschlaub also advocated a positive role, that is, the use of remedial measures to promote health. This was an idea that was largely forgotten until revived by Hans Buchner in 1896 in a lecture on ''Biology and Health Doctrine'', which caused quite a stir in German medical circles,&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt; but which also raises the question as to the goal of therapy, a question answered several decades later by the work of Wilhelm Reich and his function of the orgasm (special theory) and the more overarching theory of 'super-imposition.'

=== Influence ===

It was thanks to Röschlaub's interpretation, promotion and elaboration of Brown's new approach to medicine that it came to influence German medicine, and became the core aspect of German Romantic medicine. As the major historian of Röschlaub's contribution states, German medicine was shifted from the mechanism of the 1700s to a more dynamic conception of life and illness.

:The idea of an active, self-reproducing and self-defending power mediating the organism's general reaction has, since then, never ceased to resonate in German medical thinking."&lt;ref name="Nelly Article"/&gt;

Röschlaub strove to unify surgery and medicine, and to place Healthcare on a natural scientific basis whilst also recognizing the need for special methods in approaching clinical practice that went beyond the natural sciences, but also went beyond the purely speculative symptomatic prescribing of traditional medicine (semiotics).

:The thought that medicine as a unitary natural science could only be realized by a transformation of the semiotic clinic into a treatment center was what was truly innovative in Röschlaub's conception.&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt;

Röschlaub's championing of the new views of man and environment from Fichte and Schelling, stemming from Locke, and integrating these into the Brunonian system provided a scientific basis for considering Healthcare, one that continues to find echoes in medicine, such as expressed half a century later in the works of Claude Bernard. The new conception of man, as being acted upon by and acting in response to the world around him to create an individual ambient that was distinct from the environment more generally, is one that has persisted in medicine, particularly in various physicians concerned with hygiene, and the interaction of the organism and its environment, such as in the field of clinical ecology or 'environmental' medicine. As Röschlaub himself wrote quite presciently,

:A body can only be an organic individual, and assert itself as such, in that it tears itself away from organic nature by dint of its own activity and self-efficacy. But this activity would expire were it not for an activity that deals with objects. The body must therefore be exposed to external objects and possess receptivity for them. And thus the activity determines the receptivity and is in turn determined by it." (1800)&lt;ref name="Nelly book" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23446">'''Andrew Joseph Galambos''' (born Ifj. Galambos József András; June 28, 1924 in [[Hungary]] – April 10, 1997 in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]]) was an [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and [[philosopher]] who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and [[Free will|freedom]]. While Galambos had much in common with his [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] contemporaries, his most unusual contributions concerned his theories on [[intellectual property]], and his advocacy of a stateless society totally free of coercion, political or otherwise. He also is noteworthy for his integration of a wide variety of scientific, economic, and historical inputs in the creation of his ideal social structure, which he termed ''The Natural Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}} p.73 ''[[property]]'' is the most fundamental parameter of volitional science, where ''[[Volition (psychology)|volition]]'' refers to the ''act of choosing'' (p. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Galambos distinguished his theory from that of [[Ludwig von Mises]], subscribing to the same 'subjective theory of value' in [[Austrian School|economics]] but deriving it from his own definition of [[property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}} pp.198–199 Galambos emphasized that von Mises failed to cover the production and marketing of intellectual property, that is, Primary Property, as noted in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The well-known [[libertarian]] author and 1996 Presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party, [[Harry Browne]] wrote of Andrew Galambos after his death:

"He was an influential libertarian, but I refer to him as 'the unknown libertarian' because he never wrote a book or appeared on national radio or TV. His renown will be limited mostly to those who came in personal contact with him. But he had a profound effect on thousands of individuals who took his courses—who in turn affected others. Undoubtedly the ripples from the stones he dropped eventually touched some of today's leading libertarians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browne|first=Harry|title=Andrew Galambos — the Unknown Libertarian|journal=Liberty|date=November 1977|url=http://www.harrybrowne.org/articles/Galambos.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Galambos was born in [[Hungary]] in 1924. His father, Joseph Galambos-Brown, had been an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army in [[World War I]] and then became a highly regarded architect. After the war, Galambos' father decided to emigrate to America to avoid his son becoming "cannon fodder" in a second world war, which he saw coming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galambos|first=Andrew J. and Suzanne J.|title=More Lasting Than Bronze|year=1991|isbn=0880780002|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his father's wish to keep his son out of war, Galambos volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army during WWII. After completing his undergraduate work at City College of New York, he moved to Minnesota in 1948 where he met his future wife, Suzanne Siegel, a fellow student at the [[University of Minnesota]]. They married in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic G. Marks, attorney for Andrew J. Galambos from 1968–1989 and author of the internet book www.CapitalismTheLiberalRevolution.com is the source of this statement.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Galambos earned degrees in physics from City College of New York (now [[City University of New York]]) and the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref name="capitalismtheliberalrevolution.com"/&gt;

==Early career==
Galambos moved to Los Angeles in 1952 to work for [[North American Aviation]]. Beginning in 1958, Galambos worked in the Space Technology Laboratory (STL) division of [[TRW Inc.|Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation]], which later became TRW Space Technology Laboratories.&lt;ref name="Browne 1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Galambos worked as an astrophysicist calculating trajectories for [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas ICBM's]] before the advent of high-speed digital computers. On the side, Galambos partnered with colleague Donald H. Allen in a business known as Universal Shares, which was an insurance and securities dealership.&lt;ref name ="Lowi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowi|first=Alvin|title=Galambos – A Lasting Encounter|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig3/lowi1.html|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Galambos' ideas on freedom and proprietary government crystallized, he became disillusioned with his work at STL, which had evolved almost exclusively to focus on the development of inter-continental ballistic missiles for military purposes. Galambos did not want to work on weapons of war.&lt;ref name="Marks"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Frederic|title=History of the Origins of the V-50 and V-201 lectures|url=http://www.capitalismtheliberalrevolution.com/people-ideas/|work=Capitalism: The Liberal Revolution|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1958–1959 Galambos formulated a proposal to the director of STL, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]], for a project to develop rockets for space exploration, including lunar landings. Mueller turned it down. A few years later, however, Mueller took a position with [[NASA]] where he worked on the Apollo 11 manned lunar landing project, the same type of project he had turned down when Galambos proposed it to him at STL.&lt;ref name="Marks"/&gt;

In 1960, Galambos left the aerospace industry and joined the faculty of [[Whittier College]] to teach physics, astrophysics, and mathematics. While at Whittier, Galambos presented a popular extracurricular class entitled, "The Decline and Renaissance of Laissez-Faire Capitalism." He also taught previously at New York University, Brooklyn College, Stevens Institute of Technology of Hoboken, New Jersey, the University of Minnesota, and Carleton College of Northfield, Minnesota.&lt;ref name="capitalismtheliberalrevolution.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Frederic|title=A History of the Origins of the V-50 and V-201 lectures|url=http://www.capitalismtheliberalrevolution.com/people-ideas/|work=Capitalism: The Liberal Revolution|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Galambos traveled with his colleague, Alvin Lowi Jr., to New York City where they met with Leonard Read of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) who introduced them to [[Henry Hazlitt]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Murray Rothbard]], and [[Ayn Rand]].&lt;ref name="Lowi"/&gt;

== The Free Enterprise Institute ==
In 1961, Galambos established The Free Enterprise Institute (FEI) which was the name he used for his teaching business. His initial course was entitled Course 100, Capitalism: The Key to Survival. He eventually taught courses on intellectual property, investments and insurance, financial planning, physics, and journalism, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Frederic|title=A History of the Origins of the V-50 an dV-201 Lectures|url=http://www.capitalismtheliberalrevolution.com/people-ideas/|work=Capitalism: The Liberal Revolution|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Free Enterprise Institute|url=http://www.fei-ajg.com|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos had an important colleague in Jay Stuart Snelson (1936–2011). Snelson was the senior lecturer for FEI from 1964–1978, teaching both V-50 and V-201. In large part due to Snelson's teaching, at least 20,000 individuals attended courses offered by FEI during his tenure.

==Courses V-50 and V-201==
Course V-50T (the "T" was for Tape) was transcribed and published as ''Sic Itur Ad Astra'' (see below).  Another course, V-201, focused on mechanisms for intellectual property protection for innovators. The initial letter "V" stands for [[volition (linguistics)|volition]], meaning the act of choosing, which is a fundamental characteristic of human beings.

V-50T and V-201T are occasionally offered as tape recorded courses by The Free Enterprise Institute.

In 1999 volume one of Sic Itur Ad Astra ("This is the Way to the Stars") ({{ISBN|0-88078-004-5}}) was first published. The book is a transcription of Course V-50. Volume two, for course V-201, as of January 2014 has not yet been published.

==Volitional science==
Galambos rejected the term social science, in part because most social scientists do not employ the scientific method to test their hypotheses. Jay Snelson suggested the term "volitional science" for its implication that volition, meaning the act of choosing, is at the center of Galambos' philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}} p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

In course V-50, Galambos laid out his two postulates of volitional science: 
* "Postulate Number One: All volitional beings live to pursue happiness,"&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, p. 96, also called the Pursuit of Happiness Postulate, p. 745
&lt;/ref&gt; and
* "Postulate Number Two: All concepts of happiness pursued through moral action are equally valid."&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, phraseology from p. 756, also called this the Moral Postulate
&lt;/ref&gt;
Galambos equates immoral action with coercion&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, p. 78
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, p. 633 notes that a [[contract]], or "voluntary agreement between two or more people" is a proper alternative to [[coercion]]
&lt;/ref&gt; and defines freedom as "the societal condition wherein every individual has one hundred percent control over his own property."&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, p. 115
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Thus making the [[enslavement]] of others [[immoral]] by [[definition]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Galambos derives his theory from these postulates. The essence of Course V-50 is Galambos' elaboration of his theory of volitional science and his application of that science to solve the problems of human society.

==Property==
Galambos' concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a man's life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life.

Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: "Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galambos|first=Andrew|title=Sic Itur Ad Astra|year=1999|publisher=The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc.|location=San Diego, California|isbn=0-88078-004-5|pages=868–869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galambos defines property as having the following elements:

* '''Primordial property''', which is an individual's life
* '''Primary property''', which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions
* '''Secondary property''', which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individual's primary property.

Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual's life; this means children are not the property of their parents,&lt;ref name="Galambos 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and also "primary property" (a person's own ideas).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, pp. 39, 52, 84, 92, 93, 153, 201, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property.

For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual's money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person's primordial property. In the U.S. as of the early 21st century, there is a widespread public impression that military conscription no longer exists. To the contrary, it is required that all men between ages 18 and 26 register for conscription. Failure to do so is punishable by imprisonment and substantial fines.

==Intellectual property==
In course V-201 Galambos focuses on primary property, which in his usage is quite similar to what has been called "[[intellectual property]]". Galambos argued that intellectual property owners should have primary control over their own ideas and over how others might use those ideas. According to Galambos, all forms of property come from a combination of "primordial property" (a person's life)&lt;ref name="Galambos 1999"/&gt; and "primary property" (a person's own ideas).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  By using the natural resources available in the physical universe, individuals use their primordial property, guided by primary property (actions, guided by ideas, respectively) to create "secondary property".&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, pp. 104, 201, 326
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, p. 671 notes that [[Land (economic)|land]] cannot be owned, whereas the [[rights]] and [[Land claim|claims]] of ''access'' to land, and ''use'' of land is secondary property
&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos posited that intellectual property deserved every bit as much, if not more, protection and recognition as secondary property. His rationale for this can be explained by the following example:

Few would question that [[Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven's]] music was his intellectual property and that it should be protected. Current copyright laws do protect musical compositions but only for a limited period of time. Galambos taught that protection of artistic creations should be perpetual.

While most would acknowledge Beethoven's intellectual property in the form of his musical compositions, almost everyone would deny that [[Isaac Newton|Isaac Newton's]] discovery and description of the universal law of gravitation is Newton's property. Newton's law of gravitation, as he expounded it, is no less a creation of his mind than Beethoven's 5th symphony. Beethoven created his music by his unique skill in the musical arts of composition, melody, harmony, counterpoint, and orchestration. Newton created his description of the universal law of gravitation by his unique skill in integrating the discoveries of his intellectual antecedents such as [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]]. Furthermore, in order to work out his theory of gravitation, Newton had to innovate a completely new form of mathematics, the [[calculus]]. (Newton's contemporary, [[Gottfried Leibniz]], also developed the calculus independently of Newton.)

Galambos recognized that more than one person could create a specific new idea, including a scientific theory, independently of each other. He allowed for that in course V-201 by innovating a method to determine whether two or more innovators of the same thing are independent of each other.

In the spirit of his teaching on intellectual property, some of Galambos' students were required to acknowledge a "proprietary notice" which asked those students to give credit (both intellectually and financially) for the information gleaned from his courses; later he required that all participants in his lectures sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] to prevent publication of his ideas before he published them himself.  Students were allowed to take notes for their private use and most lectures were taped.

Galambos acknowledged and gave credit to antecedent sources such as [[Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine's]] writings, as typified by [[Common Sense]] and article 4 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] – "4.  Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law."

==Government versus the State==
Galambos defined government as "any person or organization that sells services to protect property to which the owner of the property can voluntarily subscribe." He described the term "state" as any person or organization that claims to protect property by coercing the owner of the property to use and pay for its services, claiming 'legality' as justification. According to these definitions, a government mechanism can be an insurance company that protects an individual's home from criminal activity and casualty loss such as fire or storm damage. A state is any political entity with coercive power, from a municipality to the political organization known as the United States of America.&lt;ref name="Sic" /&gt;

==Golden Rule==
Galambos explained that the positive version of the [[Golden Rule]] ("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you") was problematic because it implied that it was acceptable for person A to "meddle" in the affairs of another provided person A would likewise appreciate the same thing done "unto" him/her. Galambos instead preferred the double negative version of the Golden Rule as the foundation for his philosophy. The double negative version is: "Do not do unto others as you would not have them do unto you." Galambos explained that this version is "not subject to meddlesome interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galambos|first=Andrew|title=Sic Itur Ad Astra|year=1999|publisher=The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc.|location=San Diego, California|isbn=0-88078-004-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of Galambos' philosophy==
Early in his career Galambos supported [[Barry Goldwater|Barry Goldwater's]] candidacy for the Republican nomination as president in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Galambos|1999}}, pp. 874–875 "The point at which ''conservatism'' becomes destructive is when it employs ''coercion'' to stifle the acceptance of a new idea."
&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Galambos' understanding of the destruction and violence caused by the political state deepened, he ultimately rejected politics as a means of solving social problems. He instead advocated proprietary, profit-seeking companies as the best means for protection of all forms of property. He supported private property protection and defense, the absolute rights of the owner of [[private property]], and was opposed to political [[voting]] and other forms of [[political activism]].&lt;ref name="Estes 6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Estes|first=Chuck|title=We Never Called Him 'Andy' – My Recollections of the Person and philosophy of the Earlier Joseph A. Galambos Alias Andrew Joseph Galambos—The Liberal|journal=The Voluntaryist|date=February 1996|issue=78|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos' first lectures given in 1961 focused on limited government. His early societal models were modified versions of the United States republic, with the addition of the "Resistor," a body empowered to repeal laws passed by Congress if it judged them to be contrary to the Constitution."&lt;ref name="Estes 6"/&gt;

Beginning around 1963, Galambos modified his lectures as a result of exposure to ideas from several of his contemporaries. 
Through his student, engineer Charles Estes and others including his colleague Alvin Lowi, Galambos came into contact with the ideas of [[Robert LeFevre]], who advocated the idea that the state was absurd at best, and was actually an enemy of human freedom.&lt;ref name=Lowi /&gt;

Whereas Galambos highlighted in his lectures the state's abysmal performance in protecting life and property, Peter Bos (a colleague of Lowi who attended FEI lectures) suggested that insurance companies could replace the state in this vital role.&lt;ref name="CTLR"/&gt; Bos and Galambos envisioned a broader concept of insurance than the word implies to most people. In his lectures, Galambos theorized that insurance could include not only reimbursement for loss, but also prevention of loss, detection of individuals who cause loss, and the seeking of restitution from such individuals.&lt;ref name="CTLR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marks|first=Frederic|title=A History of the Origin of the V-50 and V-201 Lectures|url=http://www.capitalismtheliberalrevolution.com/people-ideas/|work=Capitalism: The Liberal Revolution|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Estes had innovated an idea of restitution-based justice and a private, non-state justice system, to which Galambos was exposed in 1963. By 1964, the idea of restitution-based justice was incorporated firmly into Course V-50. When Alvin Lowi terminated his employment with FEI in 1963, he recommended Jay Stuart Snelson as his substitute. Snelson agreed to lecture for FEI provided the course was amended to incorporate the ideas of LeFevre, Bos, and Estes.&lt;ref name="Lowi"/&gt; 
Galambos eventually agreed. His original philosophy, which was undergoing major changes during that period, was modified to incorporate the respective ideas of LeFevre, Bos, and Estes on the disutility of government, the application of the insurance mechanism for protecting property, and a private-based justice system focused on restitution as opposed to incarceration.

==Criticism and controversy==
Galambos' teaching was controversial from the outset. The mere idea of a stateless society is controversial because the vast and overwhelming number of people cannot conceive of such a thing. Most believe that regrettable as it may be, coercion in the form of a political state is necessary for peace and security; that a stateless society would degenerate immediately into chaos.&lt;ref name ="Statism"&gt;[[Statism]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Galambos taught that the state was really not a protector of property, but in effect was a protection racket, no different in principle than the mafia or the drug cartels plaguing Mexico, Central America and the United States.&lt;ref name="Sic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Galambos|first=Andrew|title=Sic Itur Ad Astra|year=1999|publisher=Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc.|location=San Diego, California|isbn=0-88078-004-5|pages=882–883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos' idea of according property rights to ideas is controversial. Among the most passionate opponents of this idea are libertarian intellectuals who are aghast at the idea that anyone could limit their access to ideas of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinsella|first=Stephan|title=Against Intellectual Property|journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies|year=2001|volume= 15| issue = 2|pages=1–53|url=http://mises.org/journals/jls/15_2/15_2_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In the 1980s, Galambos was diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He died on April 10, 1997.

A '''baby bonus''' is a government payment to parents of a newborn baby or adopted child to assist with the costs of childrearing.

== Australia ==
The government of [[Andrew Fisher]] introduced a baby bonus of £5&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Day | first=D. | year=2008 | title=Andrew Fisher: prime minister of Australia | publisher=HarperCollinsPublishers | isbn=978-0-7322-7610-2 | pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; per child in late 1912. The bonus was available irrespective of marital status and could also be received by husbands of women who died in childbirth. While Fisher told parliament that the aim was to help mothers in their time of need, the intention was also to increase birth and infant survival rates in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Day|2008|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby bonus scheme was reintroduced by the Federal Government of [[Australia]] in the 2002 budget was aimed at offsetting the expenses associated with bearing a child. The scheme was also introduced as a means of increasing Australia's fertility rate and to mitigate the effects of Australia's [[Population ageing|ageing population]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2003/s860631.htm PM - Federal Opposition says Government's baby bonus has flopped&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2004 budget the bonus was raised from $3,000 effective 1 July 2004 to $12,000 payable in 2007 but indexed to inflation so that in October 2007, the amount receivable per eligible child was $4,133.&lt;ref name = CISAutumn2007&gt;[http://www.cis.org.au/POLICY/autumn_07/autumn07_guest.htm The Baby Bonus: A Dubious Policy Initiative&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The bonus was paid in a lump sum to a nominated financial institution. From 1 January 2009 the payment is paid in 13 fortnightly installments. The receivable amount in January 2012 was $5,437. The receivable amount in September 2012 is $5,000 in 13 fortnightly instalments (parents will receive a higher first instalment of $846.20 and 12 fortnightly instalments of $346.15), or if the baby died or was a stillborn, parents may ask for their Baby Bonus to be paid in a lump sum instead of fortnightly instalments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/enablers/centrelink/baby-bonus/payment-rates&lt;/ref&gt;

In the draft of the 2013 federal budget, the "baby bonus" would be slashed from $5,000.00 to $2056.45 as of 1 March 2014. The first newborn child will receive $2056.45, and for every subsequent child thereafter, a limited $1028.15 will be submitted.

== Canada ==
A baby bonus was introduced in [[Canada]] following the [[World War II|Second World War]].  A family allowance scheme known as the "baby bonus" made regular monthly payments of $5 to $8 to all parents of children under 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/federal_politics/clips/1031/ | work=CBC News | title='Baby Bonus' unveiled - CBC Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Politics of Quebec|the Quebec government]] introduced the ''Allowance for Newborn Children'' that paid up to $8,000 to a family after the birth of a child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/Milligan_Backgrounder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the [[Canada Child Tax Benefit]] (CCTB) is one of a number of child and family benefits offered by the government of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/bnfts/menu-eng.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Czech Republic ==
Currently there is a baby bonus of 13000 CZK (approx. 670 USD) for each first child born to mothers with low income. The mother must be a citizen or permanent resident of the [[Czech Republic]].

== Italy ==
Currently, there is a bonus of €960 (approx. $1,133) for every child born to household with income lower than €26,000 (approx. $30,700), and €1920 (approx. $2,266) for every child born to household with income lower than €7.000 (approx. $8,271).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guidafisco.it/inps-modulo-domanda-bonus-bebe-1195&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lithuania ==
Currently, there is a bonus of €405 ($475) for every child in [[Lithuania]].

== Luxembourg ==
Luxembourg's baby bonus system is split into three stages, known as ''allocation prénatale'' (prenatal allowance), ''allocation de naissance'' (birth allowance) and ''allocation postnatale'' (postnatal allowance). The allowance is universal and is not means-tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/famille/parents/allocation-naissance/allocation-naissance.html|title=Maternity allowance|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total allowance amounts to €1,740.09, paid in three sums of €580.03 once each stage is complete.

The prenatal allowance can be claimed once a woman has undergone 5 obstetric examinations and 1 dental examination.

The birth allowance can be claimed once a woman has undergone a postnatal gynaecological examination. This way, a woman whose baby is stillborn or dies shortly after birth is still entitled to the first two parts of the baby bonus.

The postnatal allowance can be claimed once the child has turned 2 years old and has undergone 6 medical examinations with a paediatrician.

== Poland ==
In April 2016, the PiS government, in response to low fertility rates in Poland, introduced the Family 500+ program. For every second child, parents receive 500PLN ($133) monthly until the child turns 18. For example, if a family has three children, they would receive 1000PLN every month until the oldest child turns 18, after which they would receive 500PLN.&lt;ref&gt;https://rodzina500plus.gov.pl/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russia ==
{{As of|2015}}, Russia offers 453,026 (USD 9,000) for second and every following child. Amount is indexed annually with inflation. This can only be spent on housing, education, healthcare, or a mother's pension.

== Singapore ==
By having two children, a middle-income Singaporean household may receive various incentives which are equivalent to S$166,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Sustainable Population For A Dynamic Singapore|url=http://www.nptd.gov.sg/content/NPTD/news/_jcr_content/par_content/download_98/file.res/population-white-paper.pdf|publisher=National Population and Talent Division (NPTD)|work=Population White Paper|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} For third and subsequent child, the household will get an additional S$8,000 as Baby Bonus&lt;ref name=mcys_babybonus_faq /&gt; and S$20,000 as Parenthood Tax Rebate.

=== Baby Bonus Scheme ===
The Baby Bonus Scheme (formerly known as Child Development Co-Savings Scheme) was first introduced in Singapore on 1 April 2001, with enhancements made on 1 August 2004, August 2008 and 1 March 2012. The objective of this scheme is to improve on the country's fertility rate by providing cash incentives, with the hope of reducing the financial burden of raising children and thereby encouraging them to have more children. The scheme is consist of two components, Cash Gift and Children Development Account (CDA).&lt;ref name=mcys_babybonus_home /&gt;

==== Cash Gift ====
For Singapore Citizen children born on or after 26 August 2012, the maximum amount of cash gift from the government is S$8,000, which can be spent without any restriction. It is available to each of the first four children.&lt;ref name=mcys_babybonus_faq&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/faq.html |title=Baby Bonus Scheme FAQ |publisher=Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902140320/http://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/faq.html |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Children Development Account (CDA) ====
The Singapore government contributes a dollar for a dollar matching the amount of savings that parents contribute to their child's savings in the Children Development Account (CDA). The amount is capped at S$6,000 each for the first and second child, and S$12,000 each for the third and fourth child, and S$18,000 each for the fifth and subsequent child. The savings in this account may be used by the child and his/her siblings at the approved institutions for Child Care Centre, Early Intervention Programmes, Healthcare Institutions, Kindergarten, Special Education Centre, Assistive Technology Device Provider, Optical Shop and Pharmacy. With effect from 1 January 2013, the CDA of a child will remain open until the end of the child's 12th year, instead of the current 6th year. To date, the birth rate of Singapore has gone up by 0.2%.&lt;ref name=mcys_babybonus_home&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/index.html |title=Child Development Co-Savings (Baby Bonus) Scheme |publisher=Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315151856/http://www.babybonus.gov.sg/bbss/html/index.html |archivedate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Papua New Guinea}}'''Bernard Mullu Narokobi''' (1943 &amp;ndash; March 2010&lt;ref name="RNZI_52414"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=52414 |title=Former PNG Parliamentary Speaker, Bernard Narakobi, dies |date=11 March 2010 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Papua New Guinea]]n [[politician]], [[jurist]], and [[philosopher]]. He was serving as the Papua New Guinean [[High Commissioner]] to [[New Zealand]] prior to his death. Between 1987 and 1997 he represented his Wewak Open Electorate as a Member in the Papua New Guinea's National Parliament. During his time as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), he served as the [[Minister for Justice]] (1988–1992) in the government led by the then Prime Minister [[Rabbie Namaliu]]; Agriculture Minister (1992–1994) under the leadership of Prime Minister Sir [[Julius Chan]] led government; and Opposition Leader between 1998 and 2002 until he lost his seat to the then Wewak MP Kimson Kare during the 2002 elections. He was displaced as a minister in the Chan government for failing to vote in favour of constitutional reforms in the provincial system of government.

In April 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described him as one of Papua New Guinea's "living national icons", along with [[Michael Somare]] and [[Mal Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/country-profile/papua-new-guinea "Country profile: Papua New Guinea"], ''The Guardian'', April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and family life==
Narokobi was born around 1943 in Wautogik village, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea, to his father Anton (Kukum) Narokobi and mother Maria Mokoi and was the second eldest of five siblings. His siblings were Veronica, Apolonia, Caroline and Camillus. Camillus his younger and only brother is intending to stand for the Wewak Open seat. Camillus is also a lawyer in his own right at the family law firm, Narokobi Lawyers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Narokobi's father Anton was taught by pioneer [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] and became one of the early catechists who served the people of Boiken and Dagua villages through teaching the [[Catholic faith]]. Narokobi was a widower, having lost his wife Regina to breast cancer in 2007. He had 7 children: Vergil, Daniel, Anna, Justina, Ottonia, Benedine and Regina (twins). His son Vergil is also a lawyer and after completing a bachelor's degree in law with honours at the University of Papua New Guinea, he went on to do his Masters in law at Cambridge University. His daughter Anna has also recently completed her degree in law in Australia.

Few paper records exist of Narokobi's early life, but it appears that he started primary education at around the age of ten or twelve, roughly around 1952. He began school at the Dagua Catholic Mission and then attended Brandi High School in Wewak, East Sepik Province. In 1959 he was taught by [[Michael Somare]] who later became the first [[Prime Minister]] of Papua New Guinea. From Brandi High School he went on to matriculate at the then Kerevat Senior High School in [[East New Britain Province]], where he met another future Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, [[Rabbie Namaliu]]. In 1966 Narokobi went off to [[Australia]] where he undertook a degree in law at the [[University of Sydney]], where he received an LLB in 1972. In that same year he was made a barrister in the New South Wales. Narokobi was amongst the first few Papua New Guineans to receive education abroad. In those days, preparations were underway for Papua New Guinea to gain political independence from Australia. Soon after completing his law degree, Narokobi was recruited to become the Permanent Consultant to the Constitutional Planning Committee that was chaired by his former teacher Michael Somare. Narokobi thus had a personal hand in the writing of what became the Constitution when Papua New Guinea gained independence in 1975.

Narokobi died in March 2010 after a brief illness. Prime Minister [[Michael Somare]] paid tribute to him as "a humble man who dedicated his life to the development of a legal regime that incorporates Melanesian values".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/7169 "PM pays tribute to Narokobi"], ''[[The National (Papua New Guinea)|The National]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
After [[Papua New Guinea]] gained independence, Narokobi held several jobs including serving as the legal advisor to the provincial government in his home province, East Sepik, he also worked as a private lawyer, a lecturer in law at the University of Papua New Guinea and had a stint as an acting judge in the Papua New Guinea National and Supreme Courts. He has published a number of papers and articles which are scattered in various journals and several books including ''The Melanesian Way''; ''Life and Leadership in Melanesia '' and ''Lo Bilong Yumi Yet'' and a short book of fiction entitled ''Two Seasons''.

Narokobi aligned with a team of like minded Papua New Guineans to start their [[Melanesian Alliance Party]]. The original founders of this Party include John Momis, John Kaputin and Moi Avei. John Momis was the Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Planning Committee which recruited Narokobi as their Permanent Consultant. Narokobi became actively involved in politics when he decided to contest the national elections in 1982 where he ran an unsuccessful campaign against his former teacher Michael Somare for the East Sepik Regional Seat. Learning from his failed election in 1982, Narokobi entered Parliament in 1987 after toppling Tony Bais in the Wewak Open Electorate. He enjoyed three terms as the Member for Wewak and was defeated in the 2002 elections. As a lawyer and thinker, Narokobi was a firm believer in human rights, a staunch advocate of Melanesian philosophy and identity, and he supported strongly the call for a free and independent [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]]. He was also a devout and a highly respected member of the Catholic Church in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Narratives Of Nation In The South Pacific |author= Ton Otto, Nicholas Thomas|year=1997|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_wgKDyylumsC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=%22Bernard+Narokobi%22|isbn=978-90-5702-085-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biopolitics''' is an intersectional field between biology and politics. It is a political wisdom taking into consideration the administration of life and a locality’s populations as its subject. To quote Foucault, it is ‘to ensure, sustain, and multiply life, to put this life in order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://criticallegalthinking.com/2017/05/10/michel-foucault-biopolitics-biopower/#fn-22546-9|title=History of Sexuality (The Will to Knowledge: History of Sexuality)|last=Foucault|first=Michael|publisher=|year=1976|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[Rudolf Kjellén]], who also coined the term [[geopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Esposito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Roberto Esposito]]|title=Bios: Biopolitics and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIZS2GpUzGwC&amp;pg=PA16|year=2008|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-4989-1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his 1905 two-volume work ''The Great Powers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunneflo|first=Markus|year=2015|url=https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/014e3f7b-0a6b-4535-8e83-d04a04d2008c|title=Rudolf Kjellén: Nordic biopolitics before the welfare state|journal=[[Retfærd]]|volume=35|issue=3|issn=0105-1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary US [[political science]] studies, usage of the term is mostly divided between a [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] group using the meaning assigned by [[Michel Foucault]] (denoting social and political power over life) and another group who uses it to denote studies relating [[biology and political science]].&lt;ref name="Liesen"&gt;Liesen, Laurette T. and Walsh, Mary Barbara, The Competing Meanings of 'Biopolitics' in Political Science: Biological and Post-Modern Approaches to Politics (2011). APSA 2011 Annual Meeting Paper {{ssrn|1902949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various definitions==
#In Kjellén's [[organicism|organicist]] view, the [[State (polity)|state]] was a quasi-biological organism, a "super-individual creature". Kjellén sought to study "the civil war between social groups" (comprising the state) from a biological perspective and thus named his putative discipline "biopolitics".&lt;ref name="Lemke2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Lemke]]|title=Biopolitics: An Advanced Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRVNFqFPGtoC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2011|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-5241-8|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[Nazi]]s also used the term occasionally. For example, [[Hans Conrad Julius Reiter|Hans Reiter]] used it in a 1934 speech to refer to their biologically based concept of nation and state and ultimately their [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policy]].&lt;ref name="Liesen"/&gt;
#Previous notions of the concept can actually be traced back to the [[Middle Ages]] in [[John of Salisbury]]'s work ''[[Policraticus]]'' in which the coined term [[body politic]] is actually used. The first modern usage of the term (in English) starts with an article written by GW Harris in an article for the ''New Age'' in 1911 in which he advocates the liquidation of "lunatics" by 'state lethal chamber'.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Age'' 28 December 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The concept then starts to gather pace in the 19th century with [[Walter Bagehot]]'s work ''[[Physics and Politics]]'' in which he reflects on the term as if he was a trained scientist in the form of [[Jakob von Uexküll]]. Bagehot didn't have a scientifically trained mind such as von Uexküll so he (Bagehot) falls rather short in the explanation of the term. Nevertheless the book has some novel points particularly on the subject of [[natural selection]] and politics.&lt;ref&gt; Walter Bagehot Physics and Politics pp. 40-65 1872&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the colonial setting ==
Catastrophes are periodically mobilized as vehicles for historical transformation. European states often found themselves grappling with sociobiological propensities of populations. Mercantilism and capitalist modes of production led to a modern biopolitical approach to famine: the modern state depended on providing a diet sufficient to keep the biological machines of industrial capitalism running. The British developed biopolitics in tandem with colonization to help solidify their control over the Irish. 

The French Third Republic in Western Africa also employed biopolitics in their colonial efforts. The ''fin-de-siecle'' revolution in microbiology and specific developments in public health legislation aided the French. Furthermore, thanks to the germ theory of disease pioneered by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the etiology of some of the most deadly diseases—cholera and typhoid—began to be understood in the 1890s, and the French used this new scientific knowledge in the tropics of West Africa. Illnesses like bubonic plague were isolated, and vectors of malaria and yellow fever were identified for the political purpose of public health. They passed public health laws to introduce up-to-date health standards. The goal was for African subjects to respond in exactly the same way as metropolitan citizens to market incentives and new technologies imposed by a progressive state. Thus, public health was a political concern in the sense that the state hoped citizens would be more productive if they lived longer.

==Michel Foucault==
French philosopher and social theorist [[Michel Foucault]] first discussed his thoughts on biopolitics in his lecture series "Society Must Be Defended" given at the [[Collège de France]] from 1975 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Society Must Be Defended|last = Michel|first = Foucault|publisher = Picador|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foucault's concept of biopolitics is largely derived from his own notion of [[biopower]], and the extension of [[Political power|state power]] over both the physical and political bodies of a population.  While only mentioned briefly in his "Society Must Be Defended" lectures, his notion of the concept of biopolitics (Foucault never invented the concept) has become prominent in social and humanistic sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, T., Casper, M. J., &amp; Moore, L. J. (2011). Biopolitics: an advanced introduction. NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault described biopolitics as "a new technology of power...[that] exists at a different level, on a different scale, and [that] has a different bearing area, and makes use of very different instruments."&lt;ref name="Foucault 1997 242"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than a disciplinary mechanism, Foucault's biopolitics acts as a control apparatus exerted over a population as a whole or, as Foucault stated, "a global mass."&lt;ref name="Foucault 1997 242"/&gt; In the years that followed, Foucault continued to develop his notions of the biopolitical in his "The Birth of Biopolitics" and "The Courage of Truth" lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Woodrow Wilson]] (1918) The New Freedom pp.45-48 Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault (2007) Security, Territory, Population 1977-1978 pp. 311-332 pp. 333-361 pp. 378-380&lt;/ref&gt; 

Foucault gave numerous examples of biopolitical control when he first mentioned the concept in 1976.  These examples include "ratio of births to deaths, the rate of reproduction, the fertility of a population, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this method of social control with political power in the Middle Ages. Whereas in the Middle Ages pandemics made death a permanent and perpetual part of life, this was then shifted around the end of the 18th century with the introduction of [[Milieu intérieur|milieu]] into the [[Biological Sciences|biological sciences]]. Foucault then gives different contrasts to the then [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]] in which the [[industrialisation]] of the population was coming to the fore through the concept of work, where Foucault then argues power starts to become a target for this milieu by the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security, Territory, Population Lectures At The College de France|last=Michel|first=Foucault|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=55-86, 20, 27 (Note 37)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Society Must Be Defended|last=Michel|first=Foucault|publisher=|year=1975|isbn=|location=|pages=241-244, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of vaccines and medicines dealing with public hygiene allowed death to be held (and/or withheld) from certain populations.  This was the introduction of "more subtle, more rational mechanisms: insurance, individual and collective savings, safety measures, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Society Must Be Defended: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1975-1976|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0312422660|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borden Parker Bowne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|n}}; January 14, 1847{{spaced ndash}}April 1, 1910) was an American [[Christian]] philosopher, preacher,&lt;ref&gt;"Bowne, Borden Parker", in ''Concise [[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (1964), New York:  Scribner's.&lt;/ref&gt; and theologian in the [[Methodism|Methodist]] tradition. 
He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1258|title=Nomination Database|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
In 1876 he became a professor of philosophy at [[Boston University]], where he taught for more than thirty years. He later served as dean of the graduate school. Bowne was an acute critic of [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic]] [[determinism]],&lt;ref&gt;"Bowne, Borden Parker", in ''Concise [[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (1964), New York:  Scribner's.&lt;/ref&gt; [[positivism]], and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He categorized his views as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ianized [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]anism, transcendental empiricism and, finally, [[personalism]], a philosophical branch of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]]:  of this branch Bowne is the dominant figure; this personalism is sometimes called '''Boston Personalism''', in contrast with the '''California Personalism''' of [[George Holmes Howison]].  Bowne's masterpiece, ''Metaphysics'', appeared in 1882. Bowne was chiefly influenced by [[Hermann Lotze]].

==Legacy== 

Bowne has influenced philosophy in various ways.  For instance, there has been a direct line of personalists from Bowne through his student, [[Edgar Sheffield Brightman]] (1884-1954), through Brightman's student, Peter Anthony Bertocci (1910{{spaced ndash}}1989), to Bertocci's student, [[Thomas Buford|Thomas O. Buford]] (b. 1932).

There has also been a more general influence, as with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], who studied at Boston University, and spoke in his ''Stride toward Freedom'' of having gained "a metaphysical basis for the dignity and worth of all human personality."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. (1958), ''Stride toward Freedom'', New York:  Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowne received nine nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature between 1906 and 1909—one from his own sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/database.html |title=Nomination Database |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12358">'''[[Contract bridge]]''' can be a friendly, informal social game, or a highly competitive mind-sport when in formal club or tournament play. The rules require players to conduct themselves [[ethics|ethically]] and to be courteous at all times. The rules of the game and expectations for ethical play are codified in the official [[Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge]] and its published interpretations; the rules define which actions at the table are and are not permitted and remedies for rule infractions and irregularities. Players are expected to respect the norms of social [[courtesy]] and behavior; duplicate bridge sponsoring organizations (clubs, regional, national, zonal and world organizations) can define additional standards for player's conduct, including the penalties for violation of personal conduct such as rudeness and other breaches of discipline not covered by applicable [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]s. Some aspects of the rules may be interpreted more strictly in a high-level tournament than in an informal social game.

''Any contestant remaining at a table throughout a session is primarily responsible for maintaining proper conditions of play at the table. (Law 7D)''

===Tournament director===
The Tournament director's powers, duties and responsibilities are defined under laws 81 - 93. As the official representative of the Tournament Organiser he is responsible for managing the tournament and applying the Laws applicable to it. His duties (under Law 81) include:

#'' to maintain discipline and ensure the orderly progress of the game.''
#'' to administer and interpret these Laws and to advise players of their rights and responsibilities thereunder.''
#'' to rectify an error or irregularity of which he becomes aware in any manner, within the Correction Period...'' (The Correction Period is usually 30 minutes after the final entry of the scores)
#'' to assess rectification when applicable and to exercise the powers given him...'' (to penalise or suspend players)
#'' to waive rectification for cause, in his discretion, upon the request of the non-offending side.''
#'' to adjust disputes.''
#'' to refer any matter to an appropriate committee.''
#'' to report the results for the official record if the Tournament  Organiser requires it and to deal with any matters delegated to him by the Tournament Organiser''

Law 81 also states: ''The Director (not the players) has the responsibility for rectifying irregularities and redressing damage''.

===Procedure following an irregularity===
''Unless prohibited by Law, any player may call attention to an irregularity during the auction, whether or not it is his turn to call.'' (the dummy is subject to restrictions to this rule during play) and ''The Director must be summoned at once when attention is drawn to an irregularity.''. A player does not generally have to draw attention to an irregularity committed by their side (Laws 9A4 and 72B2) but must not attempt to conceal an infraction (Law 72B3)

===Cheating===
{{Main article|Cheating in bridge}}
Law 73B2 states: ''The gravest possible offence is for a partnership to exchange information through pre-arranged methods of communication other than those sanctioned in these laws.''

There have been several instances of bridge players found or accused of cheating in high-level tournaments, including in world championships.

===Tempo===
Players are expected to bid and play "in tempo", i.e. without undue haste or delay. Occasionally, in more complex situations, a player may need more time to consider one's bid or play options, but players may not draw inferences based on their partner's break in tempo; doing so may draw a penalty. (see example below)

In duplicate play, "stop" cards are commonly used during auctions to notify the opponents of a skip bid. After the bid is made, the next player is expected to wait 10 seconds before bidding. A quick Pass after an opponent opens the bidding with  2{{spades}}, for example, strongly implies a lack of card values.

===Review and explanation of calls===
(Law 20)

#At their turn to bid, or after the final pass, a player may ask for a review of the auction. The full auction (up to that point), including alerts, must be given.
#A player may request information about a particular call, but this risks giving [[Bridge ethics#Unauthorized information|unauthorized information]].
#A player is entitled to information not only about calls made but also about relevant calls that were not made, and any inferences that can be drawn from them.
#A player may not ask a question for the benefit of their partner.

If misinformation is provided (whether inadvertently or not) and not corrected then a pair may be afforded restitution by the Tournament Director. The assumed declarer or dummy should give the correct explanation at the end of the auction but before the opening lead is faced up. (When the Tournament Director can give the last defender a chance to make another bid and the auction may continue){{clarifyme|date=May 2016}}. Defenders may not correct misinformation until the end of the play of the hand (to do so earlier would give unauthorized information to their partner)

===Unauthorized information===
Law 16 states that ''Players are authorized to base their calls and plays on information from legal calls and plays and from mannerisms of opponents. To base a call or play on other extraneous information may be an infraction of law.''

''When a player accidentally receives unauthorized information about a board he is playing or has yet to play, as by looking at the wrong hand; by overhearing calls, results or remarks; by seeing cards at another table; or by seeing a card belonging to another player at his own table before the auction begins, the Director should be notified forthwith, preferably by the recipient of the information. If the Director considers that the information could interfere with normal play, he may:

#Adjust Positions
#:if the type of contest and scoring permit, adjust the players' positions at the table, so that the player with information about one hand will hold that hand; or, 
#Appoint Substitute
#:with the concurrence of all four players, appoint a temporary substitute to replace the player who received the unauthorized information; or, 
#Award an Adjusted Score
#:forthwith award an artificial adjusted score.

===Conduct and etiquette===
Law 74 deals with a correct attitude (courteous and avoid annoying other players), etiquette (e.g. paying attention, not making gratuitous remarks) and violations of procedure (e.g. boasting about success, varying tempo to disconcert opponents, trying to look at opponent's cards or where they played the card from in the hand).

===Appeals===

A contestant or his captain may appeal for a review of any ruling made at his table by a Director. Any such request if deemed to lack merit may be subject to an additional sanction imposed by Regulation. (Law 92A) It is common practice for a side seeking an appeal to have to make a pecuniary deposit, which will be refunded if the appeal has merit (even if it is lost), and a side instigating an appeal without merit may also have their score reduced.

Such an appeal is normally held by an Appeals committee (usually 3 experienced players) by a Referee (A single experienced player) or by the Director in Charge. Tournament Directors, who make the first ruling, are not necessarily (or even usually), world-class bridge players, and the additional experience of an Appeals committee provides security that a correct ruling is made.

The Appeal committee may not overrule the Director in charge on a point of law, regulation or on disciplinary matters (but may recommend a change of ruling) (Law 93B3). Thus most Appeals deal with 'judgement' decisions - the use of unauthorised information (Law 16B), the effect of misinformation (Law 21), or when a claim for a certain number of tricks is disputed (Law 70).

In some bridge tournaments, players may first approach an official 'screener', who will take details and advise them, based on that information, if they may have possible grounds for an appeal. This does not affect a contestant's right to an appeal; however, it helps ensure that the Appeal committee hear appropriate cases.

== Examples of Bridge Ethics ==

=== Use of Unauthorised Information from Partner (Law 16B) ===

North - opens the bidding with '1 Heart'
East - overcalls by bidding '1 Spade'
South - responds by bidding '2 hearts'
West - makes a bid of '4 Spades'

This bid by West, because it has raised the level of the auction by more than 1 (from 2 hearts to 4 spades), is known as a 'jump bid' and most regulating authorities require him to either say 'Stop' or place the 'Stop card' on the table from the 'bidding box'. North is then required to pause for 10 seconds before making their next call (this gives him time to adjust and reconsider his action).

North - immediately passes i.e. does not wait for the 10 seconds.

This, of itself, is not an infraction; however, it does communicate that North has a relatively weak hand and does not wish to do anything over the 4 spade call. This additional information communicated is 'unauthorised information' and South must "carefully avoid taking advantage" from this information (Law 73C1)

East and South both 'pass' (this finishes the Auction) - and when the hand is played, East makes 10 tricks (i.e. his contract)

It turns out that South held 2 Aces in his hand. Since it was found that "a significant proportion of the class of players in question, using the methods of the partnership" (Law 16B1b) would have doubled the final contract (the double is described as a 'logical alternative') and that South's 'pass' was 'demonstrably suggested' (Law 16B1a) by the fast pass by North, the final contract was changed to '4 spades doubled', making 10 tricks (which scores more for East-West)

(This is a specific example of abuse of a 'Break In tempo' (BIT) - most cases when a BIT occurs happen when a player thinks for a long time before making a call.)

=== Use of Unexpected Explanation ===

North - opens the bidding with '1 - Heart'
East - (holding a hand with 3 spades, 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 7 clubs) - bids '3 - clubs'

However East-West are playing a convention that the actual meaning of this bid is that it shows Spades and Diamonds. West promptly alerts the bid (because it has an unexpected meaning) and, when asked, provides the correct explanation - this explanation is unauthorised information to East, who must not make use of it during the auction (or play). Note that the mis-bid by East is not an infraction.

South - passes
West - bids '3-Spades'

West is actually only giving suit preference (he prefers Spades to Diamonds) however East must regard the bid as being natural (to East, he has shown clubs and partner has a spade suit and the strength to bid over the 3-club bid)

North - passes
East - bids '4-spades'

With 3 card support and a ruffing value, East's hand is better than it might be and so 'carefully avoiding taking advantage of the information' he has, he raises to game.

South (who held 5 spades) then doubled (and three passes followed).

East has behaved ethically throughout the auction (West had no unathorised information). The result of his ethics is that East-West incurred an enormous penalty. An unethical East might have rebid his clubs (such a rebid is sometimes known as 'unauthorised panic') hoping that West might realise that the club bid was natural. In such a situation a Director is likely to change the result of the hand to '4-spades doubled' and, since the club rebid was a deliberate attempt to take advantage of the unauthorised information, impose an additional penalty (Law 72C2).

[[Image:Chr.Jac.Boström.jpg|thumb|right|Boström: oil paining by C.J. Hällström, 1892]]
'''Christopher Jacob Boström''' (1 January 1797 in [[Piteå]], [[Norrbotten]] – 22 March 1866 in [[Uppsala]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[philosopher]].  His ideas dominated Swedish [[philosophy]] until the beginning of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2217786 Book review] of ''Philosophy of Religion'' by Christopher Jacob Bostrom, trans. Victor E. Beck and Robert N. Beck. ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 14, No. 57. (Oct., 1964) p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had a great influence on Swedish cultural life.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Biography==
As a student he briefly studied [[theology]], and [[religion]] remained his primary interest throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Smart"/&gt;

Most of his life was spent teaching at [[Uppsala University]], where he received the appointment in 1838 of adjunct professor of philosophy and from 1840–63 was professor of practical philosophy.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt; He was the teacher and mentor of [[Johan Jakob Borelius]]. For four years, he tutored the royal family in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="Smart"/&gt;  There he was charged with the education of the crown prince,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} later [[Oscar II of Sweden]].

==Philosophy==
According to Richard Falckenberg, he was “the most important systematic thinker of his country.” His philosophy, that of “rational idealism” as he termed it, exercised great influence in Sweden.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;

Reality is presented only as spiritual: God as an absolute, self-conscious unity, in which all living beings are eternally and unchangeably contained, according to degree. The highest aim of humanity should be the conduct and behavior according to reason in harmony with the Divine; that of the state, like the individual should exist solely in God, and in its most perfect form should consist in the harmonious obedience of all its members to a [[constitutional monarch]]; while ultimate perfection should be an all-embracing system of such states governed in obedience to Universal Reason.&lt;ref name=amer/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Boström, Christoffer Jacob |volume=4 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the philosophy of Boström, true philosophy is such knowledge or awareness that is complete with respect to form, content and extent, and thus identical to God's own omniscience. Philosophy insofar as human beings can attain it, however, is identical to human awareness, insofar as it partakes of this divine omniscience: it is man's fully clear and distinct (formally perfect) awareness of true, absolute divine reality. The first task of philosophical science must be to produce the most general concepts whereby to define absolute reality. The character of Boström's philosophy depends on the manner in which he solved this task.

Personally, Boström characterizes his pholosophy as the consistent execution of the principle of rational idealism—i.e., the principle of that ''världsåsikt'' (worldview or metaphysics) according to which absolute reality is free from all the imperfections of spatiotemporal existence (finitude, divisibility, transience, change). As such, it is spiritual, eternal and, in and through its own non-sensual content, and not through shifting and imperfect determinations, completely determined or completely real.

Boström claims [[Plato]] as the source of these metaphysical presuppositions. Boström interprets Plato as having conceived a limited precursor of his own philosophy, constricted by his Paganism. In Plato, the [[Theory of Forms | ideas]] constitute the absolute, whereas Boström stresses the need to move beyond the ideas to that being whose sensations they are. Boström takes himself to show that all spiritual reality necessarily refers to self-consciousness as its principle, and he maintains that true reality is personal and hence that philosophy is the science of personal beings as such, since some such thing as pure self-consciousness only exists in the abstract, whereas everything real is individual or fully determined self-consciousness (consciousness of something), or in other words, sensational being or person. Philosophy can deal with an impressional reality only insofar as this reality is conceived as a determination (sensation) for a personal being and is explained through it.

With respect to the various ways in which these beings are conceived as existing for men and determining their activities, Boström divides philosophy into [[theoretical philosophy]], the science of these beings conceived as determining man's theoretical faculty, i.e., conceived as in every respect true and original being; and [[practical philosophy]], the science of these beings conceived as determining the practical faculty, or will, of man, i.e., conceived as that which unconditionally and under all circumstances ought to be. According to the different kinds of personal beings that are known to us, theoretical philosophy is further divided into [[Speculative philosophy|speculative]] [[theology]], speculative [[ethnology]] and speculative [[anthropology]]; practical philosophy into [[philosophy of religion]], [[philosophy of law]] and [[ethics]], corresponding to the terms of the division of theoretical philosophy

===Theoretical Philosophy===

====Speculative theology====
In speculative theology, the science of the absolute person, or God, Boström gives a more detailed justification of the principle of his system. There, it is first of all maintained that independent reality necessarily must be spiritual (or, as we would say today, mental), and as such an independent consciousness or self-consciousness. This is the only thing that is simple. Since the complex presupposes the simple, self-consciousness must also be the ultimate principle of all reality. This self-consciousness — which Boström identifies with life—can thus not be conceived as attached to a substrate or a substance, but is precisely what is primary and original in everything.

Boström further accounts for the factors that constitute individual self-consciousness or the person. I contrast to the Hegelian notion of an original abstract, empty self-consciousness which, through sensible reality, actualizes itself into a fully conscious and determined (concrete) spirit, Boström maintains that the absolute person is primordial and eternally fully determined. It has its sensations fully present to itself, and does not require for its perfect determination an imperfect world. There exists no exclusion or contradiction among the sensations or ideas of God, but there is complete accord among them, so that it is impossible to conceive perfectly either of God or of any of His ideas without also conceiving the others perfectly. Boström has thereby shown that absolute reality is an absolute system, a spiritual organism in the strongest sense of the term.

Since in every organism, the organs must possess the character of the whole, it follows that Gods ideas are also personal or perceiving beings. Although these beings in and for God, ''qua'' his organs, are absolutely perfect, in and for themselves, ''qua'' perceiving beings, they possess a certain imperfection, precisely since they do not have their true life and self-consciousness in themselves, but in God. Therefore, true reality, God's reality without which nothing exists, is presented to them in a lower form, as a world of phenomena specific to each and every one of them. Conceived with respect to these beings, God is on the one hand more than all of them put together or some aspect or attribute common to all of them; he is an independent and fully concrete being. On the other hand, He is also — due to the perfect organic coherence that obtains in the absolute world — fully present in them, without in the least obstructing their independent life. Thereby, the contradiction between finite and infinite is resolved.

The infinite is present in the finite, while fully preserving its infinitude (and thus not through any "anderssein" or similar). God is simultaneously transcendent and an immanent ground for the finite world, and in so far as this world, ''qua'' finite, is undergoing a developmental process, he is the foundation, law and endpoint of this development, the creator and maintainer of the finite world, its providence and salvation. In relation to this, Boström develops a [[teodicé]] where he teaches that all imperfection and all evil depends entirely on finite beings, whereas God, as a perfect being, cannot be the ground of anything but the eternal life and salvation of these lesser beings.

==Works==
His major work was ''Philosophy of Religion''.&lt;ref name="Smart"/&gt;
His writings, comparatively few in number, edited by Edfelt, were published at Upsala in 1883.&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Americana|wstitle=Boström, Christoffer Jacob|year=1920|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">The '''Common Ground between Islam and Buddhism''' project is an [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] initiative originated by [[14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] and [[Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad]] of Jordan. These two were joined by a panel of select scholars, and the project was officially launched on May 12, 2010, in Bloomington, Indiana, US. The project is based on the book ''Common Ground between Islam and Buddhism'', by [[Reza Shah-Kazemi]], who together with [[Ingrid Mattson]] and [[Eboo Patel]] was part of the scholars’ panel convened for the Bloomington event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islambuddhism.com Main description at the project website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 2010, the Dalai Lama was in Bloomington giving a teaching on the Buddhist [[Heart Sutra]]. As previously arranged, partly through the mediation of [[Fons Vitae]] (publishers in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]), he took time out to meet with a small group of Muslim and interfaith leaders to launch the new book, and the new initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islambuddhism.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26:a-blessing-from-the-dalai-lama&amp;catid=6:in-the-news&amp;Itemid=4 Washington Post article] by Eboo Patel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In his foreword to the book, the Dalai Lama writes, “This is an important and pioneering book, which seeks to find common ground between the teachings of Islam and of Buddhism. It is my hope that on the basis of this common ground, followers of each tradition may come to appreciate the spiritual truths their different paths entail and from this develop a basis for respect for each other's practice and beliefs. This may not have occurred very often before, because there has been so little opportunity for real understanding between these two great traditions. This book attempts to set that right.”&lt;ref&gt;From a review by Elena Lloyd-Sidle, in ''Parabola Magazine'', Spring 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections of the book include, among others, the following: “The Buddha as Messenger”, “Oneness: The Highest Common Denominator”, “''Shūnya'' and ''Shahāda''”, “Detachment: ''Anicca'' and ''Zuhd''”, “The ‘god’ of Desire" and “The Common Ground of Sanctity”.

==Reception==
Apart from notes in the [[Washington Post]], local press and some Buddhist journals, and in spite of the involvement of international leaders like the Dalai Lama and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, this project was and has remained practically ignored by the media.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the topic [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/buddhist-muslim-relations Buddhist-Muslim Dialogue at the Huffington Post].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism''''' is a non-fiction book about [[disinformation]] tactics and history rooted in [[information warfare]]. It was written by former three-star [[general]] in the [[Securitate]], the secret police of [[Communist Romania]], [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], and law professor [[Ronald J. Rychlak]]. It was published in 2013 along with a companion film, ''Disinformation: The Secret Strategy to Destroy the West''.

Pacepa and Rychlak document how the Russian word ''dezinformatsiya'' was coined by [[Joseph Stalin]], who chose a French-sounding title to make others believe it had originated in the Western world. Disinformation was then subsequently employed as a warfare tactic by the [[Stalinist]] government during [[World War II]] and afterwards by the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Pacepa recounts reading Soviet intelligence training manuals describing the inspiration of such deception rooted in the history of [[Potemkin village]]s. The authors describe disinformation campaigns used in the 20th century, including case studies of how [[historical revisionism]] spread through the media.

After its initial publication, the book was re-published in multiple languages including Romanian, Polish, Russian, and Czech. It was included as recommended reading for officers of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA),&lt;ref name=peake /&gt;&lt;ref name=studies /&gt; and incorporated into a college study guide format and one of the [[required reading]]s in a [[graduate-level]] course for [[Liberty University]].&lt;ref name=liberty /&gt;&lt;ref name=samson /&gt;

''Disinformation'' received a favorable reception from: the CIA-published academic journal ''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'',&lt;ref name=peake /&gt; former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[R. James Woolsey]],&lt;ref name=woolsey /&gt; ''The Counter Terrorist'',&lt;ref name=graham /&gt; political commentator [[Glenn Beck]],&lt;ref name=beck /&gt; and a separate review in ''[[TheBlaze]]'' which called it: "vital reading for anyone concerned with our culture, economy, defense, and ultimately survival as a nation."&lt;ref name=weingarten /&gt; The book garnered positive reviews from ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]''&amp;thinsp;&lt;ref name=timmerman /&gt; and ''Distracted Masses'',&lt;ref name=albright /&gt; and was used as a resource by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt; ''[[Movieguide]]'' gave the film companion to the book a strong recommendation, calling it a "brilliant expose".&lt;ref name=movieguide /&gt;

Pacepa describes the origins of the word ''disinformation'', writing that it was coined by [[Joseph Stalin]]. The [[Stalinist]] government utilized disinformation tactics in both [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]] and the [[Cold War]]. Pacepa writes that Stalin gave the tactic a French-sounding title, ''dezinformatsiya'' in Russian, in order to put forth the ruse that it was actually a technique used by the [[Western world]].&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=pacepa&gt;{{citation|title=Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism|year=2013|author= [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] and [[Ronald J.

Pacepa recounts reading Soviet instruction manuals while working as an intelligence officer, that characterized disinformation as a strategy utilized by the [[Russian government]] that had early origins in [[Russian history]]. Pacepa recalls that the Soviet manuals said origins of disinformation stemmed from phony towns constructed by [[Grigory Potyomkin]] in [[Crimea]] to impress [[Catherine the Great]] during her 1783 journey to the region—subsequently referred to as [[Potemkin village]]s.&lt;ref name=adamtaylor /&gt;&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=peake /&gt;

The authors describe disinformation and posit that it played a role in the criticism of Christianity in the [[Western world]]. They discuss the role of disinformation with regards to fomenting [[Islamic terrorism]] against Jewish and American targets, exploiting the historic anti-Semitic sentiments in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism|year=2013|author= [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] and [[Ronald J.

They argue that disinformation campaigns are ultimately successful when they fool the [[mainstream media]] into publicizing deliberate falsehoods, and the consumers of such media then eventually believe these claims are accurate. They write that [[media bias in the United States]] increased the susceptibility of the public to internalizing disinformation and [[historical revisionism]].&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=albright /&gt;&lt;ref name=weingarten /&gt;

Pacepa and Rychlak write that Soviet Union intelligence services used 4,000 [[espionage]] specialists within the [[Muslim world]] in order to stoke political unease towards Israel and the United States. They document a disinformation campaign led by the [[KGB]] whose goal was to spread government dissension by U.S. citizens during the [[Vietnam War]]. The authors describe manipulation from within the [[World Council of Churches]] by the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service]]. They recount how disinformation campaigns came to play a role in the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories]] regarding beliefs of involvement by American officials.&lt;ref name=pacepa /&gt;&lt;ref name=albright /&gt;&lt;ref name=weingarten /&gt;

Former [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[R. James Woolsey]] wrote: "Gen.

Kenneth R. Timmerman wrote for ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'' magazine: "Henry Kissinger once playfully dismissed critics who accused him of paranoia.

Victor Gaetan in his review of the book for the ''[[National Catholic Register]]'' criticizes some of Pacepa's story.&lt;ref name=gaetan/&gt; He states that the story misrepresents the life of a legendary Vatican diplomat and defames him. He also states that it misrepresents the history of interaction between the Catholic and Russian Orthodox institutions.&lt;ref name=gaetan/&gt;

It became popularized when the [[Puritans]] began using it as a [[virtue name]] during the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/faith|title=Behind the Name: Meaning, Origin and History of the Name Faith|author=Mike Campbell|work=Behind the Name|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puritans also used Faith as part of longer phrase names, such as Be-faithful, Faithful, Faith-my-joy, and Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namenerds.com/uucn/listofweek/puritan.html|title=Name Nerds! List of the Week|publisher=Namenerds.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is also the usual [[English language|English]] translation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Saint Faith]], an early Christian child [[martyr]] who was tortured to death along with her sisters Hope and Charity. She is known as Pistis in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] and Fides in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Church Latin]] and her name is translated differently in other languages. 

Faith, [[Hope (given name)|Hope]] and [[Charity (name)|Charity]], the [[theological virtues|three theological virtues]], are names traditionally given to [[Multiple birth|triplet]] girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for [[twin]] girls. There were 40 sets of twins named Faith and Hope born in the [[United States]] in 2009, the second most common name combination for twin girls. In 2011, there were 33 sets of twin girls named Faith and Hope in the United States, the fourth most common name combination for twins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121201174159/http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/twins.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in [[Texas]] and were recognized in 1994 by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's longest lived triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with-faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html|title=AT HOME WITH: Faith, Hope and Charity; 285 Years Young|date=7 July 1994|publisher=Nytimes.com|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faith has been a consistently popular name for girls in the United States, ranking among the top 1,000 names since 1880 and the top 500 names since 1921. It has ranked among the top 100 names in the United States since 1999 and was ranked as the 71st most popular name for newborn girls in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi|title=Popular Baby Names|publisher=Ssa.gov|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cultures also give names in reference to religious faith. The name [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] is used by Muslims for both boys and girls in reference to faith in [[Islam]].

The '''''Five Ranks''''' ({{zh|t=五位|p=Wuwei|w=}}; {{CJKV|j=goi}}) is a poem consisting of five [[stanza]]s describing the stages of realization in the practice of [[Zen Buddhism]]. It expresses the interplay of [[Two Truths Doctrine|absolute and relative truth]] and the fundamental [[Monism#Buddhism|non-dualism]] of Buddhist teaching.

==Origins==
The ranks are referenced in the [[Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi]]. This work is attributed to the Chinese monk [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (Japanese: Tōzan Ryōkan), who lived during the end of [[Tang Dynasty]], as well as two sets of verse commentaries by him.{{sfn|Leighton|2000}} The teachings of the Five Ranks may be inspired by the [[Sandokai]],{{sfn|Wegner|2001}} a poem attributed to [[Shitou Xiqian]] (traditional Chinese: 石頭希遷).

The work is highly significant in both the [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] and [[Linji school|Linji]]/[[Rinzai]] schools of Zen that exist today. [[Eihei Dogen]], the founder of the Japanese Sōtō School, references the Five Ranks in the first paragraph of one of his most widely studied works, [[Genjōkōan]].{{sfn|Cleary|1992|p=29}} [[Hakuin]] integrated the Five Ranks in his system of [[Koan|koan-teaching]].

==Ranks==
The Five Ranks are listed below with two translations of the original poem, one by Miura and Sasaki{{sfn|Miura|Sasaki|1996}} on the left, and the other by Thomas Cleary on the right, followed by commentary and analysis:

===I: The Relative within the Absolute===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
{{quote|In the third watch of the night&lt;br/&gt;
Before the moon appears,&lt;br/&gt;
No wonder when we meet&lt;br/&gt;
There is no recognition!&lt;br/&gt;
Still cherished in my heart&lt;br/&gt;
Is the beauty of earlier days.&lt;br/&gt;{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}}}
{{quote|In the third watch,&lt;br/&gt;
beginning of the night,&lt;br/&gt;
before the moon is bright,&lt;br/&gt;
do not wonder&lt;br/&gt;
at meeting without recognition;&lt;br/&gt;
still held hidden in the heart&lt;br/&gt;
is the beauty of former days{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}}}
{{div col end}}

This rank describes the Absolute, [[Kensho|insight]] into the [[Sunyata|empty nature]] or not-"thing"-ness of everything. {{sfn|Hakuin|2005}} The scholar [[Heinrich Dumoulin]] describes the first rank as the realization that "all diverse things and events are in their essence the same, formless and empty. Emptiness is undisturbed by any subjective element".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}} According to [[Hakuin]], this rank is only the beginning of Zen insight, but it can become a trapping for people who take the absolute to be the end-station: "Although inside and out may be perfectly clear as long as you are hidden away in an unfrequented place where there is absolute quiet and nothing to do, yet you are powerless as soon as perception touches upon different worldly situations, with all their clamor and emotion, and you are beset by a plethora of miseries".{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}

===II: The Absolute within the Relative===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
{{quote| A sleepy-eyed grandma&lt;br/&gt;
Encounters herself in an old mirror.&lt;br/&gt;
Clearly she sees a face,&lt;br/&gt;
But it doesn't resemble her at all.&lt;br/&gt;
Too bad, with a muddled head,&lt;br/&gt;
She tries to recognize her reflection!{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}}}
{{quote| A woman who's overslept&lt;br/&gt;
encounters an ancient mirror;&lt;br/&gt;
clearly she sees her face-&lt;br/&gt;
there is no other reality.&lt;br/&gt;
Nevertheless, she still mistakes&lt;br/&gt;
her reflection for her head{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}}}
{{div col end}}

The second rank describes the recognition of the Absolute within "the midst of the variety of different situations in action; you see everything before your eyes as your own original true clean face, just as if you were looking at your face in the mirror".{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}} That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions. However, seeing the absolute within the relative does not extend to one's behavior towards others. Hakuin describes that at this point one "is neither conversant with the deportment of the [[bodhisattva]], nor does he understand the causal conditions for a [[Pure land|Buddha-land]]. Although he has a clear understanding of the Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas."&lt;ref group=web name=Hakuin&gt;[http://www.kaihan.com/fives.htm Hakuin's commentary on the Five Ranks, first published in ''The Zen Koan'' (1965) by Isshu Miura and Ruth Fuller Sasaki] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330170439/http://www.kaihan.com/fives.htm |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===III: Coming from within the Absolute===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
{{quote| Within nothingness there is a path&lt;br/&gt;
Leading away from the dusts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;
Even if you observe the taboo&lt;br/&gt;
On the present emperor's name,&lt;br/&gt;
You will surpass that eloquent one of yore&lt;br/&gt;
Who silenced every tongue.&lt;br/&gt;{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}}}
{{quote| Within nothingness is a road&lt;br/&gt;
out of the dust;&lt;br/&gt;
just be able to avoid violating&lt;br/&gt;
the present taboo name&lt;br/&gt;
and you will surpass&lt;br/&gt;
the eloquence of yore&lt;br/&gt;
that silenced every tongue.{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}}}
{{div col end}}

This rank describes enlightened behaviour: "Enlightened beings do not dwell in the state of result they have realized; from the ocean of effortlessness, they radiate unconditional compassion".{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}

===IV: Arrival at Mutual Integration===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
{{quote| When two blades cross points,&lt;br/&gt;
There's no need to withdraw.&lt;br/&gt;
The master swordsman&lt;br/&gt;
Is like the lotus blooming in the fire.&lt;br/&gt;
Such a man has in and of himself&lt;br/&gt;
A heaven-soaring spirit.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}}}
{{quote| When two blades cross,&lt;br/&gt;
no need to flee;&lt;br/&gt;
an expert is like&lt;br/&gt;
a lotus in fire-&lt;br/&gt;
clearly there is a spirit&lt;br/&gt;
spontaneuosly soaring.{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}}}
{{div col end}}

The fourth rank describes "the bodhisattva of indomitable spirit"&lt;ref group=web name=Hakuin /&gt; who "[[Ten Bulls|go into the marketplace]] extending their hands, acting for others".{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}} It is powerful enlightened behaviour. "This is what is called being on the road without leaving home, leaving home without being on the road. Is this an ordinary person? Is this a sage? Demons and outsiders cannot discern such a person; even Buddhas and Zen masters can do nothing".{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}} But even this  "cannot be considered the place to sit in peace [...] You must know there is another rank, attainment in both".{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}

===V: Unity Attained===
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
{{quote| Who dares to equal him&lt;br/&gt;
Who falls into neither being nor non-being!&lt;br/&gt;
All men want to leave&lt;br/&gt;
The current of ordinary life,&lt;br/&gt;
But he, after all, comes back&lt;br/&gt;
To sit among the coals and ashes.{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}}}

{{quote| If you are not trapped&lt;br/&gt;
in being or nonbeing,&lt;br/&gt;
who can dare to join you?&lt;br/&gt;
Everyone wants to leave&lt;br/&gt;
the ordinary current,&lt;br/&gt;
but in the final analysis&lt;br/&gt;
you come back&lt;br/&gt;
and sit in the ashes.{{sfn|Hakuin|2005}}}}
{{div col end}}

The fifth rank describes "the mellow maturity of consciousness".{{sfn|Sekida (translator)|1996|p=57}} According to Sekida, this rank is described in case 13 of the Mumonkan:
{{quote|One day Tokusan went down toward the dining room, holding his bowls.&lt;br/&gt; 
Seppõ met him and asked, "Where are you off to with your bowls? The bell has not rung, and the drum has not sounded." Tokusan turned and went back to his room.&lt;br/&gt;
Seppõ mentioned this to Gantõ, who remarked, "Tokusan is renowned, but he does not know the last word."&lt;br/&gt;
Tokusan heard about this remark and sent his attendant to fetch Gantõ. "You do not approve of me?" he asked.&lt;br/&gt;
Gantõ whispered his meaning.&lt;br/&gt;
Tokusan said nothing at the time, but the next day he ascended the rostrum, and behold! he was very different from usual!&lt;br/&gt;
Gantõ, going toward the front of the hall, clapped his hands and laughed loudly, saying, "Congratulations! Our old man has got hold of the last word!&lt;br/&gt;
From now on, nobody in this whole country can outdo him!"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/zen/mumonkan.htm Tokusan Holds His Bowls]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{See also|Two truths doctrine#East Asian Buddhism|l1=Two truths doctrine}}

When Buddhism was introduced to China, the Two Truths doctrine was a point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ''ontological truths'': reality exists of two modalities.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=11}} The doctrines of [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Sunyata]] were understood as akin to [[Tao|Dao]] and the Taoist non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003|p=8}}  It was centuries later that Chinese Buddhism took Sunyata to mean the underlying unchanging essence of reality, the non-duality of being and non-being.{{sfn|Lai|2003}}

In Madhyamaka the Two Truths are two ''epistemological truths'': two different ways to look at reality, a relative truth and an ultimate truth. The [[Prajnaparamita|Prajnaparamita-sutras]]  and [[Madhyamaka]] emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[heart sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} The ultimate truth in Madhyamaka is the truth that everything is empty ([[Sunyata]]), that which is an underlying unchanging essence.{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=91}} Sunyata itself is also "empty," 'the emptiness of emptiness', which means that ''Sunyata'' itself does not constitute a higher or ultimate "essence" or "reality."{{sfn|Garfield|2002|p=38–39}}{{sfn|Siderits|2003}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://emptinessteachings.com/2014/09/11/the-two-truths-of-buddhism-and-the-emptiness-of-emptiness/ Susan Kahn, ''The Two Truths of Buddhism and The Emptiness of Emptiness'']}}

Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above Sunyata and the Two Truths. The idea that ultimate reality is present within the daily world of relative reality melded well with Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:
{{quote|To deny the duality of samsara and nirvana, as the Perfection of Wisdom does, or to demonstrate logically the error of dichotomizing conceptualization, as [[Nagarjuna]] does, is not to address the question of the relationship between samsara and nirvana -or, in more philosophical terms, between phenomenal and ultimate reality [...] What, then, is the relationship between these two realms?{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}}}}

This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]]. Various terms are used for "absolute" and "relative."{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A}}&lt;ref group=web name=Hakuin /&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Genetic discrimination''' occurs when people treat others (or are treated) differently because they have or are perceived to have a [[gene]] [[mutation]](s) that causes or increases the risk of an [[Genetic disorder|inherited disorder]]. It may also refer to any and all discrimination based on the [[genotype]] of a person rather than their individual merits.

Some legal scholars have argued for a more precise and broader definition of genetic discrimination: "Genetic discrimination should be defined as when an individual is subjected to negative treatment, not as a result of the individual’s physical manifestation of disease or disability, but solely because of the individual’s genetic composition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic Testing Meets Big Data: Torts and Contract Law Issues|ssrn = 2460891|date = 2014|location = Rochester, NY|first = Ifeoma|last = Ajunwa | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic Discrimination is considered to have its foundations in genetic determinism and genetic essentialism,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic Data and Civil Rights|ssrn = 2460897|date = 2015|location = Harvard Civil Rights- Civil Liberties Law Review|first = Ifeoma|last = Ajunwa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the concept of '''genism''', i.e. distinctive human characteristics and capacities are [[genetic determinism|determined by genes]].&lt;ref name="Annas 2003"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Annas |first=George |authorlink=George Annas | name-list-format = vanc |title=Genism, Racism, and the Prospect of Genetic Genocide |date=2003 |url=http://www.gjga.org/inside.asp?a=1&amp;action=item&amp;source=documents&amp;id=19 |access-date=2008-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726104538/http://www.gjga.org/inside.asp?a=1&amp;action=item&amp;source=documents&amp;id=19 |archive-date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Status==

=== United States ===
Genetic discrimination is illegal in the U.S. after passage of the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA) on May 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2008/05/the-genetic-inf/|title=Genetic Discrimination by Insurers, Employers Becomes a Crime|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush, and]] passed in the US Senate by a vote of 49-0 and in the House of Representatives by 414-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldman EA | title = The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA): public policy and medical practice in the age of personalized medicine | journal = Journal of General Internal Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 743–6 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22314637 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-012-1988-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation bars employers from using individuals’ genetic information when making [[Recruitment|hiring]], [[firing]], job placement, or [[Promotion (rank)|promotion]] decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genome.gov/pages/policyethics/geneticdiscrimination/saponhr493.pdf Statement of Administration policy], Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; GINA also protects individuals from genetic discrimination in healthcare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hudson KL, Holohan MK, Collins FS | title = Keeping pace with the times--the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 | language = EN | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 25 | pages = 2661–3 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18565857 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp0803964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, GINA itself does not define what genetic information is, leaving it up for debate.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGuire AL, Majumder MA | title = Two cheers for GINA? | language = En | journal = Genome Medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 6 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19348693 | pmc = 2651591 | doi = 10.1186/gm6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was passed in 2008 there were 201 cases that cited GINA in 2010 and 333 in 2014. It wasn’t until 2013 that a company actually faced penalties under GINA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Natasha | name-list-format = vanc|date=2015-06-25|title=Why the 'devious defecator' case is a landmark for US genetic-privacy law| |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health insurance discrimination====
In 2008, [[The New York Times|''The New York Times'']] reported that some individuals avoid genetic testing out of fear that it will would impede their ability to purchase insurance or find a job. They also reported that evidence of actual discrimination was rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/health/24dna.html?_r=2&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=Genetic&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Insurance Fears Lead Many to Shun DNA Tests|last=Harmon|first=Amy | name-list-format = vanc |access-date=2018-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016 insurance company GWG Life was found to be collecting saliva samples in order to offer lower rates to people who are epigenetically healthier than others of their age. While this is positive discrimination, this does suggest future potential classification of clients by genetic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupras C, Song L, Saulnier KM, Joly Y | title = Epigenetic Discrimination: Emerging Applications of Epigenetics Pointing to the Limitations of Policies Against Genetic Discrimination | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 9 | pages = 202 | date = 2018-06-08 | pmid = 29937773 | pmc = 6002493 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2018.00202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the 2008 GINA Act does protect against genetic discrimination pertaining to health insurance, it does not protect against genetic discrimination under other forms of insurance, such as life, disability or long-term care insurance. Additionally, 2008 Gina offers no protection for home/mortgage insurance or when an employer has 15 or less employees. Excluded from the Act are also parties  who are covered under Veterans Health Administration or Indian Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/discrimination|title=What is genetic discrimination? |website=Genetics Home Reference |access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because a variety of medical tests serve as proxies for genetic information, proponents of insurer access to genetic information argue that it does not require specific limiting legislation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing ====
Direct-to-consumer genetic testing was first offered in 1997 by [[GeneTree]], a now defunct family history website. These tests are easily accessible on the market and popularized by companies such as [[23andMe]] and [[Ancestry.com]]. These genetic kits are expensive and disproportionately serve wealthy individuals. As a result, when the data collected from testing is sold to research companies, it represents a biased sample of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dna-privacy-at-home-tests-23andme-ancestrydna-sell-data-to-third-parties|title=Behind at-home DNA testing companies sharing genetic data with third parties|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration]] additionally halted all 23andMe marketing in 2013 over unsubstantiated claims 23andMe made regarding disease diagnosis and prevention. The firm was allowed to continue sales after it stopped providing health information to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zettler PJ, Sherkow JS, Greely HT | title = 23andMe, the Food and Drug Administration, and the future of genetic testing | journal = JAMA Internal Medicine | volume = 174 | issue = 4 | pages = 493–4 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24535082 | doi = 10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.14706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
On May 4, 2017, Bill S-201, the Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, received Royal Assent and became law in Canada.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/S-201/royal-assent|title=Public Bill (Senate) S-201 (42-1) - Royal Assent - Genetic Non-Discrimination Act - Parliament of Canada |access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite government opposition in the House of Commons, it survived the lower house by the support of backbench Liberals and the totality of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]], [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] and [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] MPs. The Genetic Non-Discrimination Act makes it a crime for anyone to require an individual to undergo genetic testing as a condition for the provision of goods or services, or as a condition for entering or continuing a contract.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Act also forbids anyone from refusing to enter into a goods or services agreement with another person on the grounds that that person has refused to disclose the results of an already completed genetic test. One who contravenes these prohibitions is liable to being fined (up to $1 million) and/or imprisoned (up to 5 years).

Accordingly, one effect of this legislation will be to prohibit insurance providers from demanding that a prospective client undergo a genetic test - or to disclose an existing test - as a prerequisite to the provision of insurance coverage.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Equality Act of 2010 prohibits the use of genetic information for employment decisions such as hiring and promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents?view=plain|title=Equality Act 2010|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While no formal law exists banning the use of genetic information for insurance policy decisions, the Government of the United Kingdom and the Association of British Insurers voluntarily entered a moratorium from 2014 to 2019 to refrain from using genetic information with regards to insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abi.org.uk/globalassets/sitecore/files/documents/publications/public/2014/genetics/concordat-and-moratorium-on-genetics-and-insurance.pdf Concordat and Moratorium on Genetics and Insurance].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic testing in the workplace==

Some people have genes that make them more susceptible to developing a disease as a result of an occupational exposure. For example, workers with beryllium sensitivity and [[Berylliosis|chronic beryllium disease]] are more likely to carry the gene [[HLA-DPB1]] than workers without these conditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Department for Health and Human Services (2009). ''Genetics in the Workplace: Implications for Occupational Safety and Health''. Washington, D.C.: DHHS.&lt;/ref&gt; By offering optional genetic testing to workers and allowing only the workers to see their own results, employers could protect genetically susceptible individuals from certain occupational diseases. A beryllium manufacturing company initiated a pilot program to test prospective workers for the HLA-DPB1 gene at a university-based laboratory. The company paid for the testing and counseling but received results that did not identify which workers had the gene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1991, the American Medical Association Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs suggested that the following five conditions must be satisfied in order for genetic screening by an employer to be appropriate:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* The disease must develop so rapidly that monitoring would be ineffective in preventing it.
* The genetic test is highly accurate.
* The genetic variation results in an unusually elevated susceptibility to occupational illness.
* Undue expense is needed to protect susceptible workers by lowering the level of the toxic substance in the workplace.
* The worker must provide informed consent prior to being tested.

Several occupational health screening measures similar to genetic testing are already taking place. For example, in 1978, DuPont reported testing African American applicants for sickle cell trait and restricted these workers from exposure to nitro and amino compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt-Rauf PW, Brandt-Rauf SI | title = Genetic testing in the workplace: ethical, legal, and social implications | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 25 | pages = 139–53 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15015916 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.25.101802.123012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research indicates that workers or applicants would not take advantage of genetic testing due to fear of discrimination. A 1995 poll of the general public found that over 85% are concerned about access to use of genetic information by insurers and employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller PS | title = Genetic discrimination in the workplace | journal = Genetics in Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–6 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11388754 | doi = 10.1097/00125817-200105000-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the case of the beryllium manufacturer described above, so few workers participated in the genetic testing that the company decided instead to pursue an “enhanced preventive model of workplace controls.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Intersectionality ==
Within the world of gender, women of childbearing age are less likely to be hired because employers want to avoid physiological abnormalities or any other damage to the possible fetus in utero.&lt;ref name="pmid1831594"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gostin L | title = Genetic discrimination: the use of genetically based diagnostic and prognostic tests by employers and insurers | journal = American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine | volume = 17 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 109–44 | date = 1991 | pmid = 1831594 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with a selected trait are discriminated against for certain activities, such as with sickle cell anemia, as there has to be special care taken due a high risk of dehydration and heat related injury, which could lead to exhaustion, painful episodes, and hip joint problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Rimawi H, Jallad S | title = Sport participation in adolescents with sickle cell disease | journal = Pediatric Endocrinology Reviews | volume = 6 Suppl 1 | pages = 214–6 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 19337181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has lead to the belief that some races are superior to others, and Eugenics must take place to prevent the race suicide of the “more fit” races, leading to practices like immigration caps and minimum wage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=Thomas C | name-list-format = vanc |date=November 2005 |title=Retrospectives: Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/089533005775196642|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=19|issue=4|pages=207–224|doi=10.1257/089533005775196642|issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;, despite the fact that Eugenics has been proven to decrease the amount of genetic diversity, making it harder for a population to cope with future changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Pękalski A |date= September 2000 |title=Effect of eugenics on the evolution of populations |journal=The European Physical Journal B |volume=17|issue=2|pages=329–332|doi=10.1007/s100510070148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

''Genoism'' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[Andrew Niccol]], director and writer of the 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'', used to describe unethical and illegal genetic discrimination. Predictions of physical and mental performance are computed via [[genetics]] from [[DNA]] collected from hair, fingernails, skin flakes, spit swabs, eyelashes, etc.  Upon birth, a number of genetically-induced characteristics are calculated: physical and intellectual capacity, life expectancy, probable successful diseases, and likely causes of death, all determined via [[blood sample]]s and [[genetic testing]]. Job interviews, health insurance purchasing, and even potential dates can be sized up according to the perceived quality of the person's DNA due to advancements in [[genome sequencing]].  This put an ironic twist to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[sexual selection]] for good [[genes]].  According to the movie, "We now have discrimination down to a [[science]]."

{{quote|My father was right. It didn't matter how much I lied on my resume. My real resume was in my cells. Why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there were a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it's illegal to discriminate, 'genoism' it's called. But no one takes the law seriously. If you refuse to disclose, they can always take a sample from a door handle or a handshake, even the saliva on your application form. If in doubt, a legal [[drug test]] can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company.|Vincent Freeman ([[Ethan Hawke]])|''[[Gattaca]]'', 1997}}

'''George Young''' (1692–1757) was an Edinburgh surgeon, physician, philosopher and empiric. As a young man he was a member of [[the Rankenian Club]], a group of intellectuals who were to go on to become some of the most influential figures of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Stewart MA. Berkeley and the [[Rankenian Club]]. Hermathena: A Trinity College Dublin Review 1985; 139:24–45&lt;/ref&gt; Young's lecture notes (1730–31) give a clear account of contemporary medical and surgical practice and are characterised by the empirical approach to the advancement of medical knowledge, especially in the evolving understanding of nerve and muscle function.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Young G. Lectures on medicine. Edinburgh: Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; 1730-1&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Treatise on Opium'' (1753) was a practical guide for physicians in the use of the drug which emphasises its complications.&lt;ref name="Young_a"&gt;Young G. A treatise on opium, founded upon practical observations. London: printed for A.Millar; 1753&lt;/ref&gt; It was the longest, most balanced and most comprehensive English language account written yet written. Young's legacy is also apparent in the work of his pupil Robert Whytt (1714–1766)&lt;ref&gt;French RK. Robert Whytt, the soul, and medicine. London: Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine; 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and his surgical apprentice [[James Hill (surgeon)'|James Hill (1703–1776)]]. Young had taught both the value of repeated observation and a sceptical approach to prevailing dogma. Whytt was to advance knowledge of nerve and muscle function &lt;ref name="dx"&gt;Whytt R. An essay on the vital and other involuntary motions of animals. Edinburgh: Hamilton, Balfour and Neill; 1751. {{DOI|10.1037/11796-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Hill went on to make important contributions to the understanding and management of head injury.

== Early life ==

Young was born in Edinburgh in 1692. On 14 March 1711 he was apprenticed to the Edinburgh surgeon-apothecary Alexander Simpson.&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;Wallis PJ, Wallis R, Whittet T. Eighteenth century medics: subscriptions, licenses, apprenticeships. Newcastle: University of Newcastle; 1985&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1719 he passed the entrance examination for the [[Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], becoming a freeman or fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/b21465812|title=List of fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh [electronic resource] : from the year 1581 to 31st December 1873|last=Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|last2=University of Glasgow. Library|date=1874|publisher=Edinburgh : Printed by George Robb|others=University of Glasgow Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time he joined [[the Rankenian Club]], and was the only surgeon known to have done so.
The Rankenian was regarded as one of the most important of the many learned clubs and societies which were a defining feature of the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt; The Scots Magazine in May 1771 reckoned that "the Rankenians were highly instrumental in disseminating throughout Scotland freedom of thought, boldness of disquisition, liberality of sentiment, accuracy of reasoning, correctness of taste and accuracy of composition." Its members were to become major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment

== Medical career ==

Young worked as surgeon-apothecary in Edinburgh from about 1720, and between then and 1754 trained twelve surgical apprentices.&lt;ref name="Wallis" /&gt; Yet he was atrracted to  a career as a physician and to qualify as such he applied for, and on 21 June 1736 was awarded, the degree of MD (St Andrews) ''in absentia'' &lt;ref&gt;University of St Andrews. Muniments. University of St Andrews; UV452/4/211&lt;/ref&gt;
The next year he successfully applied to become a licentiate of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] (RCPE).

=== Young's lectures ===

In 1730–31 Young delivered lectures in Edinburgh on medicine and surgery and a copy of which is in the RCPE library.&lt;ref name="Young" /&gt; His surgical background and the influence of his Rankenian friends are apparent throughout his lectures; he repeatedly emphasises the need to rely on observed rather than inferred phenomena before reaching conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Macintyre | first1 = IMC | year = 2012 | title = A sceptic and an empiric in medicine: George Young (1692–1757) and the beginnings of the Scottish medical Enlightenment | doi = 10.4997/JRCPE.2012.415 | journal = J R Coll Physicians Edinb | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 352–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy of medicine based on observation and experience is very much in the tradition of [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624–1689), the English physician who emphasised careful observation and objective characterisation of disease. The lectures provide a comprehensive account of contemporary medical, and some surgical practice but also deal with contemporary theories about nerve and muscle function. Young was well versed in the literature of the day and analysed the theories of James Keill (1673–1719), the Edinburgh physician and anatomist, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] (1700–1782) the Swiss mathematician and physician, [[John Mayow]] (1641–79), who had devised the 'gunpowder theory' of muscle function. He was sceptical about the iatromechanical theories of [[Herman Boerhaave]] (1668–1738) and [[Thomas Willis]] (1621–75). 
The lectures were documented by his pupil [[Robert Whytt]] (1714–1766) and their influence on his thinking on nerve and muscle function is apparent in Whytt's ''Essay on the Vital and Other Involuntary Motions of Animals''&lt;ref name="dx" /&gt; published in 1751.

=== Treatise on opium ===

The treatise&lt;ref name="Young_a" /&gt; was published as a response to an important paper on opium published in 1742 by Young's Edinburgh contemporary [[Charles Alston (botanist)|Charles Alston]] (1683–1760), professor of botany and materia medica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alston | first1 = C | year = 1742 | title = A dissertation on opium | url = | journal = Medical essays and observations | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 110–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alston described opium's history and its preparation from poppies he had grown, the first person in Britain to have done so. Young took exception to Alston's conclusion that 'opium does more honour to medicine than any other remedy whatever' and counters this by emphasising the risks '...that I may prevent such mischief as I can, I here give it as my sincere opinion... that opium is a poison by which great numbers are daily destroyed.' In 41 chapters he provides a comprehensive account of the indications for the drug including its complications. True to his reputation he is critical about writers whose knowledge of the drug is based on chemical or animal experiments rather than clinical practice.
The treatise is a detailed, balanced and valuable guide to prevailing knowledge and practice.

=== Young's apprentice James Hill ===

[[James Hill (surgeon)|James Hill]] (1703–1776) was apprenticed to George Young in 1723 and went on to work as a surgeon in Dumfries.  In 1772 he published ''Cases in Surgery'' which was in effect an account of cases that he had treated over a working lifetime in surgery including head injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Hill J. Cases in surgery, particularly of cancers, and disorders of the head from external violence. With observations. To which is added an account of the sibbens. Edinburgh: John Balfour; 1772.&lt;/ref&gt; Hill had been taught by Young the value of observation and the need for scepticism. Hills's series of head injuries which he had treated were the best published in the eighteenth century. Hill’s ability to clinically diagnose  cerebral compression from bleeding following head injury enabled him to  treat this successfully  by directed trephine and drainage. His writing was  an important addition to the increasing understanding of the basis of the management of head injury and were being quoted 100 years after publication.

== Legacy ==

Young was recognised by Whytt (and presumably by other contemporaries) as a sceptic and empiric, and, in his discussions with fellow Rankenians may well have influenced the early thoughts on the doctrine of empiricism developed by David Hume and that of scepticism with which he is associated.&lt;ref&gt;Davie GE. The Scotch metaphysics: a century of Enlightenment in Scotland. London: Routledge; 2001. {{DOI|10.4324/9780203471159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities between Young's lectures and what became Hume's analysis of causation, probability, and practice are striking.&lt;ref&gt;Fosl PS. British philosophers, 1500–1799. In: Dematteis PB, Fosl PS, eds. Dictionary of literary biography. Detroit: Gale Group; 2002. pp. 195–223.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence on Hill and Whytt was considerable and his son, Thomas Young became Professor of Midwifery at Edinburgh  credited with setting up, at his own expense, the first lying-in ward in Scotland in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoolihan | first1 = C | year = 1985 | title = Thomas Young, M.D. (1726?–1783) and obstetrical education at Edinburgh | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/40.3.327 | journal = J Hist Med Allied Sci | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 327–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Young's reputation may have been damaged by his actions leading up to the divorce of his son George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Houston | first1 = R | last2 = van der Heijden | first2 = M | year = 1997 | title = Hands across the water: the making and breaking of marriage between Dutch and Scots in the mid-eighteenth century | doi = 10.2307/827651 | journal = Law and History Review | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 215–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy is summarised in his entry in the Dictionary of eighteenth-century British philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Yolton JW, Price JV, Stephens JN.

'''Give-away shops''', '''swap shops''', '''freeshops''', or '''free stores''' are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a [[book]], a piece of [[furniture]], a garment or a [[household]] item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops).

== Concept ==
The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a [[monetary]] framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy.   The anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group [[Diggers (theatre)|the Diggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lytle|first=Mark Hamilton|title=America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w3iBwAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-029184-6|pages=213, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt; Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. 

[[File:Kostnix innsbruck.png|thumb|Inside the KostNix free shop in Innsbruck, Austria]]
Culturally, some people feel that accepting free goods carries a [[social stigma|stigma]], so many people who use these shops are those who are led to them either by need (financially poor, such as [[student]]s, [[single parent]]s, the working-class, and the [[elderly]]) or by conviction ([[anti-capitalist]]s and [[environmentalists]]). [[Barter|Swap]] shops, where you are asked to bring something in order to take something, are one way in which stigma issues are addressed.

== Similar phenomena ==
In the [[United States]], [[Really Really Free Market]] groups organize periodic "market days" in city parks. Participants are encouraged to share unneeded items, food, skills and talents (entertainment, haircutting, etc.), to clean up after themselves and to take home any of their own items they were unable to give away during the event. In other cases, used goods are picked up from the donors' homes, thus eliminating overhead costs. Donors are often not motivated by financial need or strictly [[anti-capitalist]] conviction, but by a desire to get rid of what would otherwise be [[Waste|garbage]] without adding it to [[landfill]]s.

Another recent development in the give-away shop movement is the creation of the [[Freecycle Network]]. It began in the state of [[Arizona]], [[United States]] for the purpose of connecting people who had extra belongings to get rid of with people who needed something, organized as discussion/distribution lists, and usually hosted on one of the free websites.

In 2007 a similar concept began to flourish in Devon, England where a group of free-bookshops called Book-Cycle began; A volunteer-run registered charity, that gives books and trees away in exchange for a donation. Any proceeds are then used to send free books to developing countries and plant trees in the local area.

'''Grace''' is a feminine [[given name]] from the Latin ''gratia''.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;Hanks, Hardcastle and Hodges, ''Oxford Dictionary of First Names'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2nd edition, {{ISBN|978-0-19-861060-1}}, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often given in reference to the [[Christian]] concept of [[divine grace]] and used as a virtue name.

'''Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi''', also known as '''[[Allamah|Allama]] Mashriqi''', (25 August 1888 – 27 August 1963) was a [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] mathematician, logician, political theorist, Islamic scholar and the founder of the [[Khaksars|Khaksar movement]].&lt;ref name=TwoCircles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twocircles.net/2016aug24/1472040770.html|author=Nasim Yousaf|date=24 August 2016|title= The 'Belcha': Allama Mashriqi's powerful symbol for the Khaksar Tehrik|work=TwoCircles.net website|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1930, he founded the Khaksar Movement, aiming to advance the condition of the masses irrespective of any [[faith]], [[sect]], or [[Religion|religion]].&lt;ref name="shabbir2"&gt;S. Shabbir Hussain, Al-Mashriqi: The Disowned Genius, Lahore, [[Jang Group of Newspapers|Jang Publishers]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

===Background===
Inayatullah Khan Mashriqi was born on 25 August 1888 to a [[Rajput]] family in Amritsar.&lt;ref name="Nasim Yousaf page 3"&gt;Nasim Yousaf, ''Pakistan's Freedom &amp; Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'', page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Mashriqi's father Khan Ata Muhammad Khan was an educated man of wealth who owned a bi-weekly publication, ''Vakil'', in Amritsar.&lt;ref name="Nasim Yousaf page 3"/&gt; His forefathers had held high government positions during the [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Sikh Empire]]s. Because of his father's position he came into contact with a range of well-known luminaries including [[Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī]], [[Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Syed Ahmad Khan]], and [[Shibli Nomani]] as a young man.&lt;ref name="Nasim Yousaf page 3"/&gt;

===Education===
Mashriqi was educated initially at home before attending schools in Amritsar.&lt;ref&gt;Nasim Yousaf, ''Pakistan's Freedom &amp; Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'', page 43.&lt;/ref&gt; From an early age, he showed a passion for mathematics. &lt;ref name="shabbir2" /&gt; After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree with First Class honours at [[Forman Christian College]] in Lahore, he completed his master's degree in Mathematics from the [[University of the Punjab]], taking a First Class for the first time in the history of the University.&lt;ref&gt;Nasim Yousaf, ''Pakistan's Freedom &amp; Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'', page 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907 he moved to England, where he matriculated at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], to read for the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|mathematics tripos]]. He was awarded a college foundation scholarship in May 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 June 1908, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1909 he was awarded [[British undergraduate degree classification|first class honours]] in Mathematics Part I, being placed joint 27th out of 31 on the list of [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wranglers]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 June 1909, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next two years, he read for the [[Languages of Asia|oriental languages]] tripos in parallel to the natural sciences tripos, gaining first class honours in the former, and third class in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'',17 June 1911, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Aslam Malik,''Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi'', page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years' residence at Cambridge he had qualified for a Bachelor of Arts degree, which he took in 1910. In 1912 he completed a fourth tripos in mechanical sciences, and was placed in the second class. At the time he was believed to be the first man of any nationality to achieve honours in four different Triposes, and was lauded in national newspapers across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Nasim Yousaf, ''Pakistan's Freedom &amp; Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'', page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Mashriqi was conferred with a DPhil in mathematics receiving a gold medal at his doctoral graduation ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 13 June 1912, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Cambridge and returned to India in December 1912.&lt;ref&gt;M. Aslam Malik,''Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi'', page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Cambridge his religious and scientific conviction was inspired by the works and concepts of Professor [[Sir James Jeans]].&lt;ref name="shabbir"&gt;S. Shabbir Hussain (ed.), God, Man, and Universe, Akhuwat Publications, Rawalpindi, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TwoCircles/&gt;

==Early career==
On his return to India, Mashriqi was offered the premiership of [[Alwar]], a [[Princely states|princely state]], by the Maharaja. He declined owing to his interest in education. At the age of 25, and only a few months after arriving in India, he was appointed vice principal of [[Islamia College (Peshawar)|Islamia College]], [[Peshawar]], by Chief Commissioner [[Sir George Roos-Keppel]] and was made principal of the same college two years later. In October 1917 he was appointed under secretary to the Government of India in the Education Department in succession to [[George Anderson (educator)|Sir George Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Hira Lal Seth, ''The Khaksar Movement Under Search Light And the Life Story of Its Leader Allama Mashriqi'' (Hero Publications, 1946), p 16&lt;/ref&gt; He became headmaster of the High School, Peshawar on 21 October 1919.

In 1920, the British government offered Mashriqi the ambassadorship of Afghanistan, and a year later he was offered a knighthood. However, he however refused both awards.&lt;ref&gt;Nasim Yousaf, ''Pakistan's Freedom &amp; Allama Mashriqi; Statements, Letters, Chronology of Khaksar Tehrik (Movement), Period: Mashriqi's Birth to 1947'', page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, he was passed over for a promotion in the government service, following which he went on medical leave. In 1932 he resigned, taking his pension, and settled down in [[Ichhra]], Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;Shan Muhammed, Khaksar Movement in India, Pub. Meenakshi Prakashan, Meerut, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nobel nomination===
In 1924, at the age of 36, Mashriqi completed the first volume of his book, ''Tazkirah''. It is a commentary on the ''Qur'an'' in the light of science. It was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1925,&lt;ref&gt;M.Aslam Malik,''Allama Inayatullah Mashraqi''&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} subject to the condition it was translated into one of the [[European languages]]. However, Mashriqi declined the suggestion of translation.&lt;ref name=storyofpakistan/&gt;

==Political life==

===Mashriqi's philosophy===
He declared that the science of religions was essentially the science of collective evolution of mankind; all prophets came to unite mankind, not to disrupt it; the basic law of all faiths is the law of unification and consolidation of the entire humanity.&lt;ref name="shabbir"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2012}} According to Markus Daeschel, the philosophical ruminations of Mashriqi offer an opportunity to re-evaluate the meaning of colonial modernity and notion of post-colonial [[nation-building]] in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Daeschel, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=500148 Scientism and its discontents: The Indo-Muslim "Fascism" of Inayatullah Khan Al-Mashriqi], ''Modern Intellectual History'', 3: pp. 443–472, [[Cambridge University Press]]. 2006, Retrieved 22 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Mashriqi is often portrayed as a controversial figure, a religious activist, a revolutionary, and an anarchist; while at the same time he is described as a visionary, a reformer, a leader, and a scientist-philosopher who was born ahead of his time.&lt;ref name="shabbir2" /&gt;

After Mashriqi resigned from government service, he laid the foundation of the [[Khaksars|Khaksar Tehrik]] (also known as Khaksar Movement) around 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Khaksar Tehrik Ki Jiddo Juhad Volume 1. Author Khaksar Sher Zaman&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}
[[File:Al-Islah.jpg|thumb|Al-Islah ([[Khaksar Tehrik]] weekly)]]

===Imprisonments and allegations===
On 20 July 1943, an assassination attempt was made on [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] by [[Rafiq Sabir]] who was assumed to be a Khaksar worker.&lt;ref&gt;Jinnah of Pakistan, [http://www.humsafar.info/1943.htm Calendar of events, 1943] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032636/http://www.humsafar.info/1943.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was deplored by Mashriqi, who denied any involvement. Later, Justice Blagden of the [[Bombay High Court]] in his ruling on 4 November 1943 dismissed any association between the attack and the Khaksars.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar A. Peerbhoy, Jinnah Faces An Assassin, Bombay: Thacker &amp; Co., 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, Mashriqi was imprisoned at least four times: in 1958 for alleged complicity in the murder of republican leader [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan]] (popularly known as Dr. Khan Sahib); and, in 1962 for suspicion of attempting to overthrow [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|President Ayub's]] government. However, none of the charges were proven, and he was acquitted in each case.&lt;ref name="shabbir"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2012}}

In 1957, Mashriqi allegedly led 300,000 of his followers to the borders of [[Kashmir]], intending, it is said, to launch a fight for its liberation. However, the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan government]] persuaded the group to withdraw and the organisation was later disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 29 August 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Mashriqi died at the [[Mayo Hospital]] in Lahore on 27 August 1963 following a short battle with cancer.&lt;ref name="The Pakistan Times 1963"&gt;The Pakistan Times, Lahore Reports, "Allama Mashriqi laid to rest", August 29 (PT 1963, Aug. 30)&lt;/ref&gt;  His funeral prayers were held at the [[Badshahi Mosque]] and he was buried in [[Ichhra]].&lt;ref name="The Pakistan Times 1963"/&gt;  He was survived by his wife and seven children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13044">[[File:伊藤仁斎.jpg|thumb|240px|Itō Jinsai drawn by his student]]
{{Japanese name|Itō}}

{{nihongo|'''Itō Jinsai'''|伊藤 仁斎||August 30, 1627, [[Kyoto]], Japan &amp;ndash; April 5, 1705, Kyoto}}, who also went by the [[pen name]] '''Keisai''', was a Japanese [[Confucianism|Confucian]] philosopher and educator.  He is considered to be one of the most influential Confucian scholars of seventeenth century Japan, and the Tokugawa period (1600–1868) generally, his teachings flourishing especially in Kyoto and the Kansai area through the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate.

Jinsai's school, known as the Kogigaku, criticized the teachings of [[Zhu Xi]] 朱熹 (1130–1200) and instead advocated a philosophical vision based on an understanding of the meanings of key terms in the ''Analects'' and the ''Mencius''.  His school has been considered part of a larger movement, Kogaku ("ancient learning'), including earlier scholars such as [[Yamaga Sokō]] 山鹿素行 (1622–1685), and later thinkers such as [[Ogyū Sorai]] 荻生徂徠 (1666–1728). However, Jinsai never mentions Sokō or his ideas, and Jinsai's own statements of philosophical meaning were strongly and systematically criticized by Sorai. Rather than as a thinker aligned with the so-called Kogaku movement, Jinsai's ideas are best understood on their own terms. Jinsai is widely known for his outspoken affirmation of the validity of human emotions, and his articulation of a metaphysics highlighting the pervasiveness and infinite creative potential of a "unitary generative force" (Jpn: ''ichigenki''). Indicative of his renown in the larger world of East Asian philosophy, Jinsai's writings have frequently been compared to those of the Qing dynasty scholar Dai Zhen 戴震 (1724–1777), whose key work,  ''Mengzi ziyi shuzheng'' (''The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the'' Mencius) is very similar in theme and method to Jinsai's opus, the ''Gomō jigi'' (''The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the'' Analects ''and'' Mencius).

==Life==
Jinsai was born the eldest son of a Kyoto merchant, Itō Ryōshitsu. It is not clear exactly what merchant activities the family was engaged in, however.  He began studying [[Chinese language|Chinese]] from an early age and devoted himself to Zhu Xi's expression of Song dynasty Neo-Confucianism. He continued to study Confucianism throughout his teens, going over old books his uncle had left his father.&lt;ref&gt;Yamashita, Samuel Hideo. (1983). "The Early Life and Thought of Ito Jinsai", in ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies.'' 43:2, pp. 455-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the age of ten, he was studying under his uncle, a noted [[physician]] who had once treated the emperor [[Emperor Go-Yōzei|Go-Yōzei]]. He also likely studied with Matsunaga Sekigo, a Kyoto-based Neo-Confucian scholar who had in turn studied with Fujiwara Seika. Given the distinctively Kyoto lineage of Jinsai's learning, there are good reasons for interpreting it as an expression of the philosophical world of the ancient imperial capital.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, John Allen. (1998). ''Itō Jinsai's Gomō jigi and the Philosophical Definition of Early Modern Japan''. pp. 29-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Itō suffered from an unidentified illness when he was twenty-eight and left the family business to his younger brother.  Afterwards he became a recluse, studying [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]]. During this time he began to have his first doubts over Zhu Xi's philosophy, even changing his pen name which showed his commitment to humaneness (''jin'').&lt;ref name="d206-207"&gt;De Bary, William ''et al.'' (2005). ''Sources Of Japanese Tradition: Volume 2, 1600 to 2000'', pp. 206-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later established a private school, the Kogidō, in Kyoto in 1662. Following Jinsai's death in 1705, leadership at the Kogidō was assumed by his son, Tōgai (1670–1736).  The Kogidō was located on the east bank of the Horikawa River, directly across from the school of [[Yamazaki Ansai]]. During his lifetime, Ansai became a major proponent of Zhu Xi's version of Song Neo-Confucian thought.  Jinsai's school, in contrast, offered a sustained critique of Zhu Xi's ideas.  Especially in Kyoto, Jinsai's school met with great success, attracting three thousand students from many different classes and professions.&lt;ref name="s362"&gt;Shirane, Haruo. (2006). ''Early Modern Japanese Literature: An Anthology, 1600-1900.'' p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==

Jinsai formed his own understanding of Confucian philosophy after coming to realize that Zhu Xi's speculative philosophy of was not practical in everyday ethics.  Instead, he felt one could learn the way of the sages through an understanding of the meanings of words in the ''[[Analects]]'' and the ''[[Mencius]]'', two of the [[Four Books]] that Zhu Xi's philosophy had elevated to nearly canonical status within the broad field of East Asian Confucianism.  The other two of the Four Books, ''[[Doctrine of the Mean|The Doctrine of the Mean]]'' and the ''[[Great Learning]]'', were originally chapters from the Book of Rites (Chinese: Liji), that had been treated as separate volumes, with significant emendations, by Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi. It was largely on the basis of the latter two writings that Zhu Xi in particular had articulated some of his most distinctive Neo-Confucian ideas. In response to Zhu Xi's textual alterations, Jinsai argued, in a very distinctive manner, that "the Great Learning was not a surviving work of the Confucian School", not simply rejecting Zhu Xi's claims on particular points, but in an across the board manner dismissing the text as "not Confucian" in any significant respect.  Instead of the ''Great Learning'', Jinsai's approach was to focus on an explanation of the meanings of philosophical terms as discussed in the ''Analects'' and the ''Mencius''. Jinsai's approach to Confucian scholarship is today known as ''kogigaku'' or "study of ancient meanings".  This approach was taken up by later Confucian scholars, particularly [[Ogyū Sorai]].&lt;ref name="s362"/&gt;

In significant respects, Jinsai can be seen as advancing the Neo-Confucian project that Zhu Xi, his chief philosophical adversary, had otherwise so effectively and persuasively championed. For example, Jinsai's most comprehensive philosophical text, the ''Gomō jigi'' (''The Meanings of Philosophical Terms in the'' Analects ''and'' Mencius), was first recorded as Jinsai was giving a series of lectures on Chen Beixi's 陳北溪 (1156–1223) ''Xingli ziyi'' 性理字義 (''The Meanings of Neo-Confucian Philosophical Terms''). Much of the philosophical structure of Jinsai's ''Gomō jigi'' as well as its methodology of conceptual clarification and analysis clearly derive from Beixi's work. The two texts even share common elements in their titles, ''jigi'' and ''ziyi'' 字義 (Jpn: ''jigi'') being written with the same characters, referring to the meanings of words. In both cases, however, the words that were discussed and defined were distinctively philosophical terms such as ''tendō'' (the way of heaven), ''tenmei'' (the decree of heaven), ''michi'' (the way), ''sei'' (human nature), ''kokoro'' (the mind and heart), ''kotowari'' (principle), ''kishin'' (ghosts and spirits), and many others.

Jinsai is often described as an apolitical philosopher. However, the ''Gomō jigi'' can easily be seen as an inherently political text, one which defines the very philosophical foundations of an ideal political order. In the ''Analects'', 13/3, Confucius, when asked by a disciple what he would do if given political authority, replied that he would "rectify terms" (''zheng ming''). When his disciple responded with bewilderment, Confucius explained that if words were not used correctly, then in effect there could be little hope for order in a state. For that reason, Confucius added, the prince is always careful in his use of words. Jinsai's project of defining philosophical terms rightly is very much a later day expression of Confucius' view that in order to govern effectively, one must ensure that words are understood and used correctly. If that is not done, then all will be lost.

Jinsai had several fundamental philosophical disagreements with Zhu Xi, the premier interpreter of Confucian thought from the late-Song dynasty forward.  For one, Zhu Xi had claimed that human nature is inherently good.  Jinsai disagreed and instead argued it had the potential to become good, but only through daily practice and deeds can this potential be realized.  Additionally, he rejected the dualism of rational principal (''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]'') and material force (''[[qi]]'') proposed by Song Confucianism, believing it was material force alone that led to the creation of life and all things.

Furthermore, Zhu Xi connected the way of heaven (''tendō'') with the human way (''jindō'') through rational principal.  Jinsai on the other hand saw the way (''michi'') as being embedded in the common and everyday, and not ensconced on some elevated plane as Zhu had suggested.  To Jinsai, the central question was how one should conduct oneself in everyday life.  Zhu Xi affirmed that all humans are born with an "original human nature" (''sei''), which is naturally good. Jinsai, however, rejected this.

Rather than the essential goodness of human nature, Jinsai stressed natural human emotions (''ninjō''), which he found in everyday life.  Extending from this came the importance that was placed on poetry which allowed for the expression of human emotions.  This, he believed, provided a needed release of emotions and desires.  Song Confucianism he felt too much advocated seriousness and a restraint of human nature.&lt;ref name="d206-207"/&gt;  His support for literature even led to the Kogidō attracting some students more interested in Chinese poetry than his Confucian teachings.&lt;ref name="s362"/&gt;

Although often grouped with the Edo Confucian scholar, Ogyū Sorai, as a proponent of the ancient learning movement, Jinsai's singlemost harsh critic was none other than Sorai. In a letter written to Jinsai, Sorai early on expressed admiration for the Kyoto philosopher and an interest in his philosophy, having read a pirated edition of Jinsai's ''Gomō jigi'' published long before Jinsai was ready for it to be released in its final form. Jinsai never responded to Sorai, apparently wounding his pride deeply. Whatever Sorai might have made of Jinsai's silence, it is clear that in Sorai's later writings, in the ''Bendō'' and ''Benmei'' (1728) in particular, Sorai takes issue with Jinsai on nearly every count, often criticizing him harshly as in effect no different in philosophical doctrine than the thinker he supposedly was criticizing, Zhu Xi.

In the later writings of the Kaitokudō, a merchant academy based in Osaka, Jinsai found a succession of defenders who returned Sorai's critiques with a series of harsh responses to Sorai's own philosophical statements.

Clay was born "Jacob Claij" in [[Berkhout]] on 18 January 1882 as the son of Pieter Claij and Neeltje Molenaar. After attending the [[Erasmiaans Gymnasium]], he studied physics at the [[University of Leiden]] under [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] and [[Hendrik Antoon Lorentz]]. After obtaining his Ph.D. degree in 1908&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jacob Clay |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Clay_1908.pdf |title=De galvanische weerstand van metalen en legeeringen bij lage temperaturen  |year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; he married [[Tettje Clay-Jolles]] with whom he had a son.

After teaching in Leiden and at the [[Delft University of Technology|Technische Hogeschool]] in [[Delft]] from 1906 to 1920, he was appointed Professor at the newly founded [[Bandung Institute of Technology]]. On a trip back to the Netherlands he measured the [[cosmic radiation]] and noticed an increase the further he was from the equator, which suggested to him that cosmic rays  are deflected by the geomagnetic field and let him to propose that they are charged particles rather than photons. This proposal was generally accepted by 1932. In 1929 he became professor at the [[University of Amsterdam]], publishing over 200 papers until his retirement in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;G. W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5383">'''Joseph Gabel''' (12 July 1912 in [[Hungary]] – 15 June 2004 in [[Paris]]) was a French Hungarian-born [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]]. His work was always strongly influenced by [[Marxism]]; he was against [[Stalinism]] and critical of the work of [[Louis Althusser]].

He first studied [[Psychopathology]] with [[Eugène Minkowski]],&lt;ref name="imec-archives.com"&gt;See [http://www.imec-archives.com/fonds/fiche.php?ind=GBL Notice biographique, fonds Joseph Gabel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405000255/http://www.imec-archives.com/fonds/fiche.php?ind=GBL |date=2008-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then he turned to [[Sociology]] (he was mainly influenced by [[Karl Mannheim]] and [[Georg Lukács]]). He taught at the Mohammed-V University of [[Rabat]] from 1965 to 1971, and at [[Amiens]] University from 1971 to 1980.

In 1962, he published his most important work: ''False Consciousness: An Essay on Reification''. From the standpoint of psychopathology, this study works to synthesize Marxist notions of "[[False Consciousness]]" and [[Reification (Marxism)|reification]] with the study of [[Schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="imec-archives.com"/&gt; In the following years, Gabel's works stressed the analysis of [[Ideology|ideologies]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|marxist theory of alienation]] (''The Sociology of Alienation'', 1971; ''Idéologies'' 1974 - 1978; ''Alienation Today'', 1974). Gabel also wrote the articles "Utopia" and "Ideology" in the ''[[Encyclopedia Universalis]]'' and he was one of the only French specialists on Karl Mannheim.

'''Kim Sawchuk''' (born 1960) is a professor in the Department of Communication Studies, Research Chair in Mobile Media Studies, and Associate Dean of Research and Graduate Studies (Faculty of Arts and Science) at [[Concordia University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Canada]]. A [[feminist]] media studies scholar, Sawchuk's research spans the fields of art, gender, and culture, examining the intersection of technology into peoples lives and how that changes as one ages.

==Early life and career==
Kimberly Anne Sawchuk was born in 1960 in Canada.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} She earned her bachelor's degree in 1982 from the [[University of Winnipeg]], with gold medal honors for a dual-major in Political Science and History.

She has been writing articles on the cultural impact of [[aging]] and technology since 1992,&lt;ref name=WorldCat&gt;{{cite web|title=results for 'kim sawchuk' &gt; 'Sawchuk Kim'|url=https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=kim+sawchuk&amp;fq=ap%3A%22sawchuk+kim%22&amp;dblist=638&amp;fc=yr:_25&amp;qt=show_more_yr%3A&amp;cookie|website=WorldCat|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and examines cultural attitudes towards aging. Sawchuk has noted that if elderly people are portrayed in advertising at all, they are portrayed primarily as [[caricature]]s of their youth. Not who they are, but who they once were.&lt;ref name="Arxer (2013)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arxer|first1=Steven L.|last2=Murphy|first2=John W.|title=The Symbolism of Globalization, Development, and Aging|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-4507-4|pages=23–24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWVIIpaETysC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;ots|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she believes that as marketers and advertisers educate themselves about seniors, targeting older markets can be lucrative.&lt;ref name="Bruzzi (2000)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruzzi|first1=Stella|authorlink1=Stella Bruzzi|last2=Gibson|first2=Pamela Church|title=Fashion Cultures: Theories, Explorations and Analysis|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-415-20685-3|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYGMAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She's also involved in changing the popular image of the elderly and works in collaboration with community organizations and [[Activist ageing|activists]] to address their experience of digital technologies.

Sawchuk has participated in a wide number of research projects. In 2010, she was involved in a project on mobile communications and biomedical imaging.&lt;ref name="Digital Life"&gt;{{cite news|title=JAN 16 Dr Kim Sawchuk|url=http://thedigitallifeshow.com/dr-kim-sawchuk/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=The Digital Life Show|date=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Sawchuk and Barbara Crow conducted a research project sponsored by the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] of Canada on whether services, which are frequently geared to on-line access, are accessible to marginalized or older citizens.&lt;ref name="YFile (2010)" /&gt;

Often exploring feminist issues,&lt;ref name="Digital Life" /&gt; Sawchuk's interests are not limited to [[Feminism in Canada|feminism]]. In 2012, she developed a [[smartphone]] application with film producer Katarina Soukup, which allows users to uncover geographical and historical landmarks using the GPS systems on the phone, becoming virtual underground explorers.&lt;ref name="Virtual Geography"&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual "daylighting" showcases geography, art|url=http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/society-societe/stories-histoires/story-histoire-eng.aspx?story_id=161|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sawchuk began participation in 2014 in a two-year trans-cultural project between Canada and the European Union called "Performigrations: people are the territory".

'''Knowledge environments''' are social practices, technological and physical arrangements intended to facilitate [[collaborative]] [[knowledge building]], [[decision making]], [[inference]] or discovery, depending on the [[epistemology|epistemological]] premises and goals.

== Overview ==
Knowledge environments departing from [[constructivist epistemology]] assume that [[domain knowledge]] is built in and results from cognitive and/or social practices. From this perspective the primary purpose of knowledge environments is to host and support activities of knowledge building, the means including cognitive ergonomics, [[social software]], immediate [[information access]] exploiting means of [[multimedia]] and [[hypertext]], content contribution functionalities and structured [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]. [[Wikipedia]] itself is a prototypical example of a knowledge environment in this sense.

From another perspective, the purpose of a knowledge environment can be defined as a method to facilitate consistent knowledge outcomes. Knowledge outcomes reveal themselves as learning, communication, goals, decisions, etc. Consistent knowledge outcomes imply predictable learning results or replicable communication results and predictable quality of decisions. The design of knowledge environments is both commonplace activity and specialised expert work. At a simplistic level every [[teacher]], every [[author]], every [[librarian]] and every [[database]] manager is a creator of a knowledge environment. At a specialized level, knowledge environments need sophisticated architecture and modeling capabilities. This approach is necessary when the creator of the knowledge environment wants to deliver replicable results in hundreds of specific instances of the same knowledge environment. On the other hand, the strengthening trend of public authorship leads to open-ended ontologies by means of, say, tagging or [[folksonomy|folksonomies]]. In a significant sense, knowledge environments are in such cases created not only by their authors or owners but also by the contributors of their ontologies.

==Types==
There are various kinds of knowledge environments:
* Socio-technological environments, e.g. [[Virtual Learning Environment]]s, of which the goal is collaborative [[knowledge building]]
* Learning environments where the main goal of the participants is to gain some kind of knowledge, skill, or conceptual clarity 
* Virtual environments incorporating communities of participation in, e.g., political processes
* Creative or experimental environments in which knowledge is constructed by means of [[collaborative authoring]] of text, but even non-verbal, e.g. audiovisual content
* [[Online simulation]]s of ecology, economy, or society
* Knowledge-intensive gaming environments
* Communication environments where the main goal of the participants is to transmit to each other some signals or information related to the activities and behavior being generated in that environment
* Decisional environments where the main goal of the participants is to share knowledge and opinions such that decision options are generated and choices made
* Operating environments where the knowledge environment is a support or enabler for the actual process or physical work being carried out

== Issues of development==
===Variables===
Knowledge environments are all pervasive but difficult to build on a scalable and a replicable basis. This is because of two groups of interacting variables:
* Variables associated with diversity of context
* Variables associated with the consequent multiplicity of perspectives to the domains in question
* Variables associated with complexity of domain

===Issues===
Some of the issues in development are:
* How to create a knowledge environment that acknowledges the diversity in participants, and the consequent multiplicity of perspectives to given domain of information
* How to facilitate exploration of multiple perspectives to domains of information
* How to optimize [[cognitive erconomics]]
* How to measure effectiveness of a knowledge environment.
* How to integrate multiple [[Published media|media]].
* How to give users of such environments freedom to discover knowledge in such an environment while placing them within an operating structure.

== Applications==
Knowledge environments are useful for designing:
* Learning
* [[Knowledge management]]
* [[Scenario planning]] in companies
* Decision gaining tools
* Simulations
* Games
* Surrounding

'''Merle Eugene Curti''' (September 15, 1897 – March 9, 1996) was a leading American [[historian]], who taught many graduate students at [[Columbia University]] and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin]], and was a leader in developing the fields of [[social history]] and [[intellectual history]].  He directed 86 finished Ph.D. dissertations and had an unusually wide range of correspondents.  As a [[Historiography#Progressive historians|Progressive historian]] he was deeply committed to democracy, and to the [[Frederick Jackson Turner|Turnerian]] thesis that social and economic forces shape American life, thought and character.  He was a pioneer in peace studies, intellectual history, and social history, and helped develop [[cliometrics|quantitative methods based on census samples]] as a tool in historical research.

== Life ==
Curti was born in [[Papillion, Nebraska]], a suburb of [[Omaha]], on September 15, 1897. His parents were John Eugene Curti, an immigrant from [[Switzerland]], and Alice Hunt, a [[Yankee]] from [[Vermont]]. Curti attended high school in Omaha then obtained a bachelor's degree in 1920 from [[Harvard University]], graduating ''summa cum laude''. He then spent a year studying in [[France]] where he met Margaret Wooster, 1898–1963, who had a Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] and was a pioneer in research on [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss9.html Margaret Wooster Curti Papers , 1898–1963]&lt;/ref&gt;  They married in 1925 and had two daughters.  Curti received his Ph.D. in 1927 from Harvard as one of the last students of [[Frederick Jackson Turner]].

Curti taught at [[Beloit College]], [[Smith College]], and [[Columbia University]], then in 1942 he joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin, where he taught for 25 years. He also taught in [[Japan]], [[Australia]], and [[India]], and lectured throughout [[Europe]].

== Academic career ==
While at Smith College, Curti published his first book, ''The American Peace Crusade, 1815–1860'' (1929).  The book, based on his dissertation, was written after [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]] (who had replaced Turner at Harvard) rejected his first dissertation proposal which was essentially an early version of ''The Growth of American Thought.''

=== Peace studies ===
Moving to [[Teachers College]] at Columbia in 1931, he published a book on [[William Jennings Bryan]] and world peace (''Bryan and World Peace''). It was followed by ''Peace or War: The American Struggle'' in 1936. With these works, Curti helped found [[peace and conflict studies]] as a field of study. He criticized pacifists for ignoring major social changes—especially the  repudiation of old-fashioned competitive capitalism by the [[New Deal]], and the need to repudiate imperial greed if peace were to be achieved. In 1964 he helped found the Conference on Peace Research in History, now called the Peace History Society. ''The Roots of American Loyalty'' (1946) was a history of patriotism.

Curti developed his global vision through travels; he taught in Japan, Australia and India for two years. He left the Episcopal faith of his boyhood for Unitarianism. Although never a Marxist, he voted for Socialist presidential candidates in the name of world peace.

=== Intellectual history ===
Curti turned his attention to [[intellectual history]], and helped to establish that field as a distinct academic discipline. His first foray in the field was ''The Social Ideals of American Educators,'' published in 1935. In 1944, Curti won the Pulitzer Prize in history for his masterwork, ''The Growth of American Thought.'' Its chapters show an encyclopedic knowledge of thinkers great and small from the colonial period to the present, together with his commitment to democracy as a process springing from the ideas of the people. Curti adapted [[Frontier Thesis|Turner's frontier thesis]] to intellectual history, arguing, "Because the American environment, physical and social, differed from that of Europe, Americans, confronted by different needs and problems, adapted the European intellectual heritage in their own way. And because American life came increasingly to differ from European life, American ideas, American agencies of intellectual life, and the use made of knowledge likewise came to differ in America from their European counterparts." (p vi)  Unlike some of the other leaders of the American Studies program, he paid little attention to myths and symbols. Unlike [[Perry Miller]] at Harvard, who strongly influenced a new generation of intellectual historians, Curti never delved too deeply into the internal [[history of ideas]], preferring to link them to multiple external social and economic factors. His book was not so much a history of American thought as a social history of American thought, with strong attention to the social and economic forces that shaped that thought from the bottom up.

=== New social history ===
In the 1950s Curti undertook a collaborative social history of rural [[Trempealeau County, Wisconsin|Trempealeau County]], Wisconsin using avant-garde quantitative analysis of census records. The book which came out of the project, ''The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County'' (1959) immediately became a pioneer work in what would soon be dubbed the [[social history|"new social history."]] Curti's wife Margaret Wooster Curti, provided some of the quantitative methodology. Historians, however, did not emulate it, preferring instead to follow [[Stephan Thernstrom]]'s model in ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century American City'' (1964), which used a similar methodology of tracking workers through their careers using censuses and city directories. The difference was urban and rural—urban history was exploding and rural history was a backwater; in addition the Thernstrom model was easier to replicate by a graduate student writing a Ph.D. thesis alone (Curti had numerous research assistants and coauthors). Whereas the "old" social history comprised descriptions of everyday lifestyles, perhaps with a coverage of grass roots political movements (like the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]]), Curti's "new" social history was a systematic examination of the entire population using statistics and social science methodologies.

=== Teaching ===
In 1942 Curti was called to the Frederick Jackson Turner Professorship of History at the University of Wisconsin, one of the nation's most influential centers of historical scholarship; he retired from the department in 1968. Curti continued to write after retirement, keeping up-to-date his influential textbook ''Rise of the American Nation''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk3tPJ6SKtUC|title=Whitewashing War: Historical Myth, Corporate Textbooks, and Possibilities for Democratic Education|last=Leahey|first=Christopher R.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=978-0-8077-5043-8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1st ed. 1950), coauthored with [[Lewis Todd]], which went through many editions after their deaths.

The Wisconsin department of history was notorious for the angry feuds among the senior professors, which Curti, mild-mannered and small of stature, completely ignored.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Curti supervised 86 finished doctoral dissertations at Columbia and Wisconsin, including many who became well-known scholars: [[Richard Hofstadter]] on [[social Darwinism]]; [[John Higham (historian)|John Higham]] on nativism; Bourke on community studies; Allen Davis on Progressivism and [[Jane Addams]]; and [[Roderick Nash]] on the environment. Curti allowed his students a free hand in content and methodology. He encouraged his students constantly, wrote highly detailed critiques of their chapters, protected them from intradepartmental feuds, helped them get funding, and found them jobs through the "old boys" network of which he was an accomplished maestro, writing hundreds of letters a month to friends and ex-students across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Lillibridge, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memberships, awards and honors ==
Curti won the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] in 1944 for ''The Growth of American Thought'' (1943).

He was president of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association (now the [[Organization of American Historians]]) in 1952 and the [[American Historical Association]] in 1954.

He was a co-founder of the [[American Studies Association]]. He served as the organization's vice-president in 1954 and 1955, and was asked to serve as president in 1956, but he declined the honor because he was going to be out of the country.

Curti was also a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].

In 1977 the [[Organization of American Historians]] established the [[Merle Curti Award]], which is given annually for the best book in social, intellectual, and/or cultural history. (In some years, the organization has awarded two prizes, one in social and/or cultural history and one in intellectual and/or cultural history.)

A '''metasyntactic variable''' is a specific word or set of words identified as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]] in [[computer science]] and specifically [[computer programming]]. These words are commonly found in [[source code]] and are intended to be modified or substituted to be applicable to the specific usage before [[Compiler|compilation]] (translation to an [[executable]]). The words '''foo''' and '''bar''' are good examples as they are used in over 330 [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] [[Request for Comments|Requests for Comments]], which are documents explaining foundational internet technologies like [[HTTP]] (websites), [[TCP/IP]], and [[email]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]s.&lt;ref name="RFC3092"&gt;[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3092.txt RFC 3092 (rfc3092) - Etymology of "Foo"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfc-editor.org/download.html RFC-Editor.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

By mathematical [[analogy]], a metasyntactic variable is a word that is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] for other words, just as in [[algebra]] letters are used as variables for numbers.&lt;ref name="RFC3092"/&gt;

Metasyntactic variables are used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept, which is useful for teaching programming.

==Common metasyntactic variables==
Due to English being the foundation-language, or [[lingua franca]], of most computer programming languages these variables are commonly seen even in programs and examples of programs written for other spoken-language audiences.

The typical names may depend however on the subculture that has developed around a given [[programming language]].

===General usage===
Metasyntactic variables used commonly across all programming languages include ''[[foobar]]'', ''foo'', ''bar'', ''baz'', ''qux'', ''quux'', ''quuz'', ''corge'', ''grault'', ''garply'', ''waldo'', ''fred'', ''[[plugh]]'', ''[[xyzzy (computing)|xyzzy]]'', and ''thud''.&lt;ref name="RFC3092"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''quuz''. Retrieved November 18, 2016, from [https://www.progclub.org/pipermail/programming/2016-November/002305.html programming@ProgClub]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wibble'', ''wobble'', ''wubble'', and ''flob'' are also used in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;''wibble''. (n.d.). Jargon File 4.4.7. Retrieved February 23, 2010, from [http://catb.org/jargon/html/W/wibble.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete reference can be found in a [[MIT Press]] book titled: [[The Hacker's Dictionary]].

===Python===
[[Spam (food)|spam]], ham, and eggs are the principal metasyntactic variables used in the [[Python programming language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.python.org/tut/ Python Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to the comedy sketch ''[[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]]'' by [[Monty Python]], the eponym of the language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-is-it-called-python General Python FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese===
In Japanese, the words ''hoge'' (ほげ)&lt;ref&gt;http://ejje.weblio.jp/content/hoge&lt;/ref&gt; and ''piyo'' (ぴよ) are commonly used, with other common words and variants being ''fuga'' (ふが), ''hogera'' (ほげら), and ''hogehoge'' (ほげほげ).&lt;ref name="ja"&gt;[[:ja:メタ構文変数|メタ構文変数]] {{ja-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2017}} Note that ''-ra'' is a pluralizing ending in Japanese, and reduplication is also used for pluralizing. The origin of ''hoge'' as a metasyntactic variable is not known, but it is believed to date to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="ja" /&gt;

== Usage examples == 

===C===
{{See also|C programming language}}
In the following example the function name '''''foo''''' and the variable name '''''bar''''' are both metasyntactic variables. Lines beginning with '''//''' are comments.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
// The function named foo
int foo(void)
{
   // Declare the variable bar and set the value to 1
   int bar = 1;

   return bar;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
===Python===
[[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[ham]], and [[Egg (food)|eggs]] are the principal metasyntactic variables used in the [[Python programming language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.python.org/tut/ Python Tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reference to the famous comedy sketch, "[[Spam (Monty Python)|Spam]]", by [[Monty Python]], the eponym of the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-is-it-called-python General Python FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following example '''spam''', '''ham''', and '''eggs''' are metasyntactic variables and lines beginning with '''#''' are comments.
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
# Define a function named spam
def spam():

    # Define the variable ham
    ham = "Hello World!"

    # Define the variable eggs
    eggs = 1

    return
&lt;/source&gt;

===Ruby===
{{See also|Ruby programming language}}
In the following example the '''baz''', '''foo''', and '''bar''' are metasyntactic variables and lines beginning with '''#''' are comments.&lt;source lang="ruby"&gt;
# Declare the variable foo and set equal to 1
foo = 1

# Declare the variable bar and set equal to 2
bar = 2

# Declare the method (function) named baz, which prints the text 'Hello world'
def baz
   puts 'Hello world'
end 
&lt;/source&gt;

===IETF Requests for Comments===
Both the [[IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]]s and [[computer programming language]]s are rendered in [[plain text]], making it necessary to distinguish metasyntactic variables by a naming convention, since it would not be obvious from context. 

Plain text example:

RFC 772 (cited in RFC 3092) contains for instance:
  All is well; now the recipients can be specified.
 
      S: MRCP TO:&lt;Foo@Y&gt; &lt;CRLF&gt;
      R: 200 OK
 
      S: MRCP TO:&lt;Raboof@Y&gt; &lt;CRLF&gt;
      R: 553  No such user here
 
      S: MRCP TO:&lt;bar@Y&gt; &lt;CRLF&gt;
      R: 200 OK
 
      S: MRCP TO:&lt;@Y,@X,fubar@Z&gt; &lt;CRLF&gt;
      R: 200 OK
 
   Note that the failure of "Raboof" has no effect on the storage of
   mail for "Foo", "bar" or the mail to be forwarded to "fubar@Z"
   through host "X".

(The documentation for texinfo emphasizes the distinction between metavariables and mere variables used in a programming language being documented in some texinfo file as: "Use the @var command to indicate metasyntactic variables. A metasyntactic variable is something that stands for another piece of text. For example, you should use a metasyntactic variable in the documentation of a function to describe the arguments that are passed to that function. Do not use @var for the names of particular [[Variable (programming)|variables]] in programming languages. These are specific names from a program, so @code is correct for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/texinfo-4.0/html_chapter/texinfo_10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091106004856/http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/texinfo-4.0/html_chapter/texinfo_10.html |archivedate=2009-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Another point reflected in the above example is the convention that a metavariable is to be uniformly substituted with the same instance in all its appearances in a given schema. This is in contrast with [[nonterminal]] symbols in [[formal grammars]] where the nonterminals on the right of a production can be substituted by different instances.&lt;ref name="Tennent2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. D. Tennent|title=Specifying Software: A Hands-On Introduction|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00401-5|pages=36–37 and 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching concepts==
This section includes bits of code which show how metasyntactic variables are used in teaching computer programming concepts.

===C++===

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
void foo(Fruit bar);
void foo(Fruit* bar);
void foo(Fruit&amp; bar);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
void foo(int bar);
void foo(int bar, int baz);
void foo(int bar, int baz, int qux);

A '''modal property''' is a [[property]] representing possession of the qualities (especially action qualities) required to do something or get something done. It is a [[base concept]], one of the [[base concepts]] mentioned as [[base types]] in the [[WordNet]] [[ontology]] of [[semantics]]. It is not a [[mental property]]. It is not a [[physical property]].

In aesthetics, '''nimism''' is a particular kind of [[trope (literature)|trope]] or [[symbol]] characterized  by exaggeration.  
The term is derived from [[Latin]] (''nimis''), "too much" and (''nimietas''), ''excess''.  Unlike a [[hyperbole]] or [[paradox]], it is not applied to linguistic or rhetorical phenomena only, but usually refers to other forms of disparity, e.g. disproportions in sculptures and paintings, or certain sorts of discrepancies in appearance or behaviour (in theatre plays, movies etc.).
Thus nimism, by means of symbolic parallels or analogies, is meant to help the reader, viewer etc. to see the truth. A ''negative nimism'' hints at something bad (a weakness, vice, sin, crime etc.), the less frequently used ''positive nimism'' indicates something good (a virtue or something heroic).

==Examples==

*King Duncan’s cloak, too wide for his murderous successor Macbeth. (Shakespeare's ''[[MacBeth]]'')
*The feet of the two naughty  stepsisters, too big (and bloody) to fit Cinderella’s tiny shoe, hence an obvious evidence of their wrong claim. (Brothers Grimm's "[[Cinderella|Cinderella and The Little Glass Slipper]]" )
*Elizabeth Bennet’s look at the nude male sculptures in Darcy’s art gallery, cast much too long to conceal her sexual awakening. (Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')
*The proverbial “Qui s’excuse s’accuse” ("[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/qui%20s'excuse%20s'accuse He who excuses himself accuses himself]") referring to an apology offered too early, i.e., untimely and not asked for, and thus revealing a bad conscience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9979">'''Petre Andrei''' (June 29, 1891&amp;ndash;October 4, 1940) was a [[Romania]]n sociologist, philosopher and politician.

==Biography==
===Origins and work===
Born in [[Brăila]] into a family of low-ranking civil servants, Andrei attended [[Nicolae Bălcescu National College|Nicolae Bălcescu High School]] from 1902 to 1910. He then moved to [[Iași]], where he enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of [[Iași University]], graduating in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Petre Andrei (ed. Petru P. Andrei, Cătălin Bordeianu, Doru Tompea), ''Fascismul'', pp. 105-106. Focșani: Editura Neuron, 1995. {{ISBN|978-973-9689-65-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a student, his mentor was [[Ion Petrovici]].&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt; He continued his education in [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], where he audited a seminar on logic and history of philosophy, and in [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]].&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt; Returning home when the war broke out, he volunteered for service, in spite of being exempt due to the fact that his father was deceased. He was assigned to an infantry regiment in March 1915, and from July to September 1916, during which time Romania entered the war, he attended the reserve officers' school in [[Târgoviște]]. He was sent to another regiment, effective November, and distinguished himself in the battles at [[Second Battle of Oituz|Oituz]], [[Slănic-Moldova|Slănic]] and the [[Cașin River (Trotuș)|Cașin valley]]. For his acts of bravery, he was awarded the [[Order of the Star of Romania]], the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]] and War Cross with Bars.&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt;

In 1918, he defended his thesis, ''Filosofia valorii'', at Iași, receiving the title of doctor in philosophy. Initially a high school teacher, he was on the faculty of several Iași institutions: the [[National College (Iași)|National College]], the Military High School and the Orthodox High School for Girls. He was then a substitute professor of history of philosophy in the sociology department of Iași University, becoming a full professor in 1922.&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt; The appointment to this post, left vacant upon the departure of [[Dimitrie Gusti]], prompted a fierce battle within the faculty that drew the attention of the contemporary press. One wing, led by [[Ion Găvănescul]], pushed for Garabet Aslan; another, which Petrovici headed, wanted Andrei. The latter faction was joined by [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] when Petrovici promised to support [[Mihai Ralea]]'s appointment after the latter's return from France; and by the new dean, [[Traian Bratu]], a bitter adversary of Găvănescul and his ally [[Oreste Tafrali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cătălin Botoșineanu, [http://www.historica-cluj.ro/anuare/AnuarHistorica2008/13.pdf "Recrutarea corpului profesoral al universității din Iași la începutul epocii interbelice. Cazul Petre Andrei"], in ''Anuarul Institutului de Istorie «G. Barițiu» din Cluj-Napoca'', tom. XLVII, 2008, pp. 224-225&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 to 1930, Andrei headed the local magazine ''Minerva'', dedicated to cultural synthesis. His sociological ideas, which Andrei promoted both within and outside the department, are encapsulated in a series of studies and articles, among them: ''Sociologia revoluției'', 1921; ''Problema fericirii''; ''Fundamentul etic sociologic'', 1921: ''Fascismul'', 1927; ''Probleme de metode în sociologie'', 1927; ''Probleme de sociologie'', 1927; ''Sociologie generală'', 1936; ''Manual de sociologie'', 1938.&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt; He was among those professors who opposed the university's politicization. In 1924, as a member of the faculty senate, he condemned not only [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]'s assassination of [[Constantin Manciu]], but also [[A. C. Cuza]] for using his department to spread nationalist ideas, calling him the "true moral assassin".&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt;

===Politics===
Attracted by its promise of deepening bourgeois democracy, Andrei joined the new [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ) in 1928, becoming president of its [[Vaslui County]] chapter. He sat in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Assembly of Deputies]] while the PNȚ was in power from 1929 to 1933, making frequent speeches before the body. He spoke memorably of the role of parliament in the nation's political life, and worked to pass modern legislation, particularly in the fields of education and administration. In particular, he pushed for a law late in 1929 that brought about administrative decentralization, commenting that it would allow for a genuine exercise of national sovereignty.&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt; He was undersecretary of state at the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Agriculture and Domains Department]] (1930) and the [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Public Instruction, Religious Affairs and Arts Ministry]] (1932-1933).&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt;

Andrei was conflicted when King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] established an authoritarian [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) regime in 1938. On the one hand, his character and civic impulses recoiled at the idea of dictatorship; nevertheless, he joined forces with what he saw as the only viable means of preserving domestic order, maintaining the country's traditional pro-French foreign policy and crushing the [[Iron Guard]]. Andrei's hesitation can be seen in the diary he kept, where he opines that the law and not political assassination, which he utterly rejected, should decide serious national questions. Under the FRN regime cabinets of [[Miron Cristea]], [[Armand Călinescu]], [[Gheorghe Argeșanu]], [[Constantin Argetoianu]] and [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], he served as Education Minister from December 1938 to July 1940.&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt; His term witnessed the adoption of a law on the organization of professional, lower and middle education; and one on industrial boys' education. In addition, the foundations were laid for a law on higher education.&lt;ref name="ieseni"/&gt;

===Downfall and legacy===
Carol's abdication and the establishment of a [[National Legionary State]] in September 1940 had dramatic consequences for Andrei. The incoming Education Minister, [[Traian Brăileanu]], ordered his dismissal from higher education, while the new dictator [[Ion Antonescu]] had him put under investigation. In early October, after Iron Guard members searched his home and due to be arrested, he committed suicide,&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt; swallowing [[potassium cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stelian Neagoe]], ''Triumful rațiunii împotriva violenței'', p. 510. Iași: Editura Junimea, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; His political testament is contained in two letters: one to his wife, the other to his four sons.&lt;ref name="tompea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Doru Tompea, [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/160/art15-Tompea.php "Petre Andrei: consecințele tragice ale unor concepții și atitudini totalitare"], in ''Sfera Politicii'', nr. 160/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the authorities of the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] arrested his son Petru for having taken part in student anti-communist demonstrations; he was imprisoned from 1949 to 1952. Initially banned, the work of Petre Andrei was censored, with all passages referring to communist concepts, doctrine and practice excised, even from an authoritative edition published in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt; Nevertheless, a rehabilitation of sorts began in 1970, when one of his most famous books, ''Sociologie generală'', appeared at [[Editura Academiei]] in 1970. A further four volumes, under the heading ''Opere sociologice'', came out between 1973 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan Bosomitu, "Notes and Remarks on the (Re) Institutionalization of Sociology in Communist Romania in the 1960s", in Corina Pălășan, Cristian Vasile (eds.), ''History of Communism in Europe'', vol. 2/2011, p. 182. Bucharest: Zeta Books, 2011. {{ISBN|978-606-8266-14-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, a treatise on sociological thought relegated Andrei to a "departmental sociologist", prompting a vigorous response from his son. Later in the decade and into the 1980s, Ovidiu Bădina and [[Romanian Communist Party]] ideologue [[Ștefan Voicu]] engaged in a polemic on the value of Andrei's work.&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt;

This could only be appreciated in full after the [[Romanian Revolution]], when Petru Andrei made it his mission to preserve and publish his father's writings.&lt;ref name="tompea"/&gt; In 1990, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his death, the private [[Petre Andrei University of Iași]] was founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.upa.ro/istoric/ History] at the Petre Andrei University of Iași site&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1991, he was elected a titular post-mortem member of the [[Romanian Academy]].&lt;ref name="ieseni"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ciprian Teodorescu, [http://bjiasi.ro/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ACADEMICIENI-IESENI.pdf ''Academicieni ieșeni''], pp. 9-10, at the Gheorghe Asachi Iași County library site&lt;/ref&gt;

Having held a number of officer posts for the Eastern Region Green Party, at the beginning of 2007 Rupert Read was selected as Eastern Region Green Party's lead candidate for the [[European Parliament]] elections in 2009 and again in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastern.greenparty.org.uk/region/easternregion/euro-elections-2009.html Eastern Green Party website] (Accessed 22 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East of England (European Parliament constituency)|East of England]] is one the Green Party's stronger regions in terms of support, and under the [[proportional representation]] system on which the European Elections operate, the Party was optimistic that he would represent them in the European Parliament. However, he was beaten to the last of the seven seats in the constituency by the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP) in [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|2009]], and similarly in [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014]]. He stood in the [[Norwich North by-election, 2009]], as the Green Party candidate, and returned the biggest by-election vote share in Green History with 9.7% of the vote.

Read stood as MP candidate for [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] in the 2015 general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastcambs.greenparty.org.uk/news/2014/10/13/rupert-read-announced-as-general-election-candidate-for-cambridge/ Read announced as General Election candidate for Cambridge] http://eastcambs.greenparty.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; He came fourth, having received 8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democracy.cambridge.gov.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?ID=149&amp;RPID=42999381|title=Election results for Cambridge Borough, 7 May 2015|date=7 May 2015|publisher=|access-date=8 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928225500/http://democracy.cambridge.gov.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?ID=149&amp;RPID=42999381#|archive-date=28 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Read is co-founder of the Leave our Kids Alone campaign, which seeks a ban on all advertising targeting children under 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://liberalconspiracy.org/2013/04/12/leave-our-kids-alone-the-case-for-banning-advertising-that-is-targeted-at-children/|title=Leave our kids alone – the case for banning ads targeted at children {{!}} Liberal Conspiracy|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guardians for future generations ===
Rupert Read has developed, on the basis of his research in political and environmental philosophy, a radical proposal for institutional reform, to provide a place in the UK's democratic system for a voice for future people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/philosophy/news-and-events/-/asset_publisher/wb9yCV6yd5EC/blog/id/14373419|title=Rupert Read: Creating 'guardians' for  future generations - News and Events - UEA|website=www.uea.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was launched at Parliament on 10 Jan 2012.

===Transphobia controversy===
In January 2015, Read apologised for tweets in which he was interpreted as describing [[trans woman|trans women]] as "a sort of 'opt-in' version of what it is to be a woman",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rupert-read-green-party-candidate-apologises-for-offending-transgender-people-9997956.html|title=Rupert Read: Green party candidate apologises for offending transgender people|date=23 January 2015|accessdate=26 January 2015|publisher=''The Independent''}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he denied he did or ever had believed this and further stated: "I do not and never have believed that trans-women are not real women, or are any less women." He said he did not consider being a trans woman a choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.talkingphilosophy.com/?p=6662#comment-1120793|title=Don't throw the Feminist baby out with the Burchill bathwater|date=24 January 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=''Talking Philosophy (comment)''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he did not stand by everything he had written two years earlier and did not consider being a trans woman a choice. His comments caused concern within the [[LGBTIQ Greens]], who invited him to "engage with LGBTIQ [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]] and listen to our deep concerns over his comments on trans people and of the phenomena that is trans."

Read took up this offer and spent time with trans people in an effort to fully understand their lives.  In his subsequent apology, Read said that "most of the offence caused by my tweets is a result of misunderstandings generated by the fragmented and angry nature of so much debate on Twitter" and reiterated that "it is up to women, not anyone else  – and certainly not me – to decide who gets let into women-only spaces ... All women have a right to be involved in making those decisions." He also said he "reject[s] transphobia completely". In a separate article he stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/01/22/green-candidate-apologises-for-offending-trans-people/|title=Green candidate apologises for offending trans people|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=26 January 2015|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Read made a further apology in the [[The Independent|Independent]] in which he said: that "trans people ... need our active engagement in the issues they face" and referred to some of the difficulties trans people face and his meetings with trans [[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-apologised-for-offending-transgender-people-but-that-wasnt-enough-10023116.html?origin=internalSearch|title=I apologised for offending transgender people but that wasn't enough|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=[[The Independent|Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Tatchell]] and [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]] were among the signatories to a letter to the Observer which criticised the "censorship and silence of individuals", and explicitly mentioned Read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2015/feb/14/letters-censorship?CMP=twt_gu|title=We cannot allow censorship or silencing of individuals|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=[[The Observer|Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Tatchell|Tatchell]] says he received thousands of critical comments in response to this, some of which were hateful or threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peter Tatchell: Twitter mob who vowed to kill me over transgender letter have it all wrong|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/peter-tatchell-twitter-mob-who-vowed-kill-me-over-mary-beard-transgender-letter-have-it-all-wrong-1488351|date=17 February 2015|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=[[International Business Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1087">The '''self-absorption paradox''' describes the contradictory association whereby higher levels of [[self-awareness]] are simultaneously associated with higher levels of [[psychological distress]] and with psychological [[well-being]].

In 1999, Trapnell and Campbell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10074710|year=1999|author1=Trapnell|first1=P. D.|title=Private self-consciousness and the five-factor model of personality: Distinguishing rumination from reflection|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=76|issue=2|pages=284–304|last2=Campbell|first2=J. D.|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.2.284}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the self-absorption paradox in relation to private [[self-consciousness]] or attention to internal aspects of the [[self]]. They concluded that the relationship of self-awareness to psychological distress derived from a ruminative aspect of private self-consciousness, whereas the relationship of self-awareness to psychological well-being was attributed to self-contemplative reflection.

The '''Seoak Seowon''' is a ''[[seowon]]'' located in the neighborhood of Seoak-dong, [[Gyeongju]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]], [[South Korea]]. Seowon was a type of local [[academy]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897). It was established by local [[Confucian]] scholars especially [[Yi Jeong]] (李楨 1578 - 1607) in 1651, the second year of [[Hyojong of Joseon|King Hyojong]]'s reign, to commemorate the virtue and scholarly achievements of scholar [[Seol Chong]], and [[Choe Chi-won]] and General [[Kim Yu-sin]]. The enshrined people played important roles in the unification of [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] into the [[Unified Silla|Silla kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;(2009) [http://eguide.gj.go.kr/detail_view/Detail_view.jsp?cid=8353&amp;tab=1  Seoak Seowon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140310/http://eguide.gj.go.kr/detail_view/Detail_view.jsp?cid=8353&amp;tab=1 |date=2011-07-22 }} Gyeongju U-Tourism Organization&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254158&amp;v=42 서악서원 西岳書院] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610060151/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=254158&amp;v=42 |date=2011-06-10 }} [[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[EncyKorea]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1644">The '''Internationale Hegel-Vereinigung''' ('''International Hegel Association''') is a non-profit organization, founded in 1962. Its mission is to promote the study of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F. Hegel]]'s philosophy on at least two different fronts: (1) Hegel's system and its parts; and (2) Hegel's philosophical beginnings and history as it leads up to modern theory.

To accomplish these tasks the International Hegel Association organizes smaller meetings at regular intervals to discuss different topics of Hegel's philosophy, as well as an International Congress every six years, designing the most comprehensive international participation possible.

The International Hegel Association has more than 250 members worldwide. Since March, 2007, its president has been Professor [[Axel Honneth]] (Frankfurt), with offices at the Philosophical Seminar of the [[University of Heidelberg]].

All who are occupied with Hegel's Philosophy are invited to join, particularly those who seek scientific advancement for and from this study.

The periodical publication of the International Hegel Association appeared until 1980 as a supplement of the ''Hegel Studien'' and after 1980 has been published independently by the Klett Cotta Publishing House, [[Stuttgart]].

'''''The Principles of Exercise Therapy''''' is a 1953 book by M. Dena Gardiner. 

==About the book==
The Principles of Exercise Therapy book is explained in detailed about exercises. Physical training is physical activity that improves physical condition and health. Physical training protects the health of a person and regulates the patient's health. Physical training mechanics plays a major medicine. Walking, running, swimming, ice skating, bicycling, playing, dance, yoga, and physical exercise are all physical exercises. Heart disease, diabetes and obesity can be controlled by exercise. The book also alleges that exercise helps to reduce mental retardation and reduce the risk of mental retardation in the exercise. It is essential to exercise immune organs or adequate vascular organs in a coherent blood circulation.

==Reception==

'''Tommaso Campanella''' [[Ordo Praedicatorum|OP]] ({{IPA-it|tomˈmazo kampaˈnɛlla|lang}}; 5 September 1568 – 21 May 1639), baptized '''Giovanni Domenico Campanella''', was a Dominican friar, [[Italian people|Italian]] [[philosopher]], theologian, [[astrologer]], and poet.

==Biography==
Born in [[Stignano]] (in the county of [[Stilo]]) in the province of [[Reggio di Calabria]] in [[Calabria]], southern [[Italy]], Campanella was a [[child prodigy]]. Son of a poor and illiterate [[Shoemaking|cobbler]], he entered the [[Dominican Order]] before the age of fourteen,&lt;ref name=Ernst&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/campanella/ Ernst, Germana, "Tommaso Campanella", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''] (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  taking the name of fra' Tommaso in honour of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. He studied theology and philosophy with several masters.

Early on, he became disenchanted with the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] orthodoxy and attracted by the [[empiricism]] of [[Bernardino Telesio]] (1509–1588), who taught that knowledge is sensation and that all things in nature possess sensation. Campanella wrote his first work, ''Philosophia sensibus demonstrata'' ("Philosophy demonstrated by the senses"), published in 1592, in defence of Telesio.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1590 he was in [[Naples]] where he was initiated in [[astrology]]; astrological speculations would become a constant feature in his writings. Campanella's [[heterodoxy|heterodox]] views, especially his opposition to the authority of [[Aristotle]], brought him into conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities. Denounced to the [[Inquisition]], he was arrested in Padua in 1594 and cited before the [[Holy Office]] in [[Rome]], he was confined in a [[convent]] until 1597.&lt;ref name=rice&gt;[http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/campanella.html "Tommaso Campanella (1568-1639)", The Galileo Project, Rice University]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his liberation, Campanella returned to Calabria, where he was accused of leading a conspiracy against the [[Spain|Spanish]] rule in his hometown of Stilo. 
Campanella's aim was to establish a society based on the [[common ownership|community of goods]] and wives, for on the basis of the prophecies of [[Joachim of Fiore]] and his own astrological observations, he foresaw the advent of the Age of the Spirit in the year 1600.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giornalecritico.it/archivio/11/GCSI_11_Claverini.pdf Corrado Claverini, Tommaso Campanella e Gioacchino da Fiore. "Riaprire il conflitto" a partire dal pensiero utopico e apocalittico, "Giornale Critico di Storia delle Idee" 11, 2014 (in Italian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Betrayed by two of his fellow conspirators, he was captured and incarcerated in Naples, where he was tortured on the [[Rack (torture)|rack]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Dentice di Accadia, Tommaso Campanella, 1921, pp. 43-44 (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; Even from the confinement of the jail, Campanella managed to influence the intellectual history of the early seventeenth century, by maintaining epistolary contacts with European philosophers and scientists, Neapolitan cultural circles, and Caravaggio's commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Giardino, ''[http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15700593-01600100 The Seven Works of Mercy ]'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, Campanella made a full confession and would have been put to death if he had not feigned madness and set his cell on fire. He was tortured further (a total of seven times) and then, crippled and ill, was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/15516/Tommaso-Campanella.html Tommaso Campanella Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Douglas, The Death of Western Culture&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2013}}

[[File:Campanella - Metaphysica, 1638 - 3891922 301891 1 00009.tif|thumb|''Metaphysica'', 1638]]
Campanella spent twenty-seven years imprisoned in Naples, in various fortresses. 
During his detention, he wrote his most important works: ''The Monarchy of Spain'' (1600), ''Political Aphorisms'' (1601), ''Atheismus triumphatus'' (''[[Atheism Conquered]]'', 1605–1607), ''Quod reminiscetur'' (1606?), ''Metaphysica'' (1609–1623), ''Theologia'' (1613–1624), and his most famous work, ''[[The City of the Sun]]'' (originally written in Italian in 1602; published in Latin in Frankfurt (1623) and later in Paris (1638).

He defended [[Galileo Galilei]] in his first trial with his work ''The Defense of Galileo'' (written in 1616, published in 1622).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IA4_AAAAcAAJ  Apologia pro Galileo''], Published in Latin by Impensis Godefridi Tampachii, Typis Erasmi Kemfferi in Frankfort, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; During the time before his second trial, September 25, 1632, Campanella wrote to Galileo that:&lt;ref&gt;''Memorie y lettera inedita di Galileo Galilei'', Second part, published in Modena, 1821, page 144. Il Padre Tommaso Campanella al Galileo. (Libreria Nelli) Roma 25 Settembre 1632. Con gran disgusto mio ho sentito che si fa Congregazione di Teologi irati, a proibire i Dialoghi di V. S.; e non ci entra persona. che sappia matematica, nè cose recondite. Avverta che mentre V.S. asserisce che fu ben proibita l’opinione del moto della terra, non è obbligata a creder che anche e ragioni de’ contraddicenti sien buone. Questa è regola teologica; e si prova perchè nel Concilio Niceno secondo fu decretato che Angelorum imagines depingi debent, quom‘am vere corporei sunt: il decreto è valido, e non la ragione; giacché tutti i scolastici dicono che gli Angeli sono incorporei a tempo nostro. Ci son altri fondamenti assai. Dubito di violenza di gente che non sa. Il Padre Nostro fa fracassi contra, e dice ex ora Papa: ma tu non è informato, nè può pensare a questo. V. S. per mio‘ avviso faccia scriver dal Gran Duca, che siccome mettono Domenicani e Gesuiti e Teatini e Preti secolari in questa Congregazione contro i vostri libri, ammettano anche il Padre Castelli e me.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;To my great disgust I have heard that wrathful theologians of the Congregation aim to prohibit the Dialogues of Your Excellency, and [that] no one will be present who understands mathematics or recondite things. Be aware that while Your Excellency does state that it was appropriate to prohibit the theory of the earth's motion, you are not obliged to believe that the reasons of those who contradicted you are good. This is a theological rule, and is proved by the second Council of Nicaea which decreed that ''Angelorum imagines depingi debent, quam‘am vere corporei sunt'' (Images of angels must be depicted as they are in the flesh): while the decree is valid, the reasoning behind it is not, since all scholars today say angels are incorporeal. There are many other fundamental reasons. I fear violence from people who do not understand this. Our Pope makes a lot of noise against this and speaks as the Pope, but you haven't heard about that, nor can think about it. In my opinion Your Excellency should write to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, that since they are putting Dominicans, Jesuits, Theatines, and secular priests who are against your books in this council, they should also admit Father Castelli and me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Campanella was finally released from prison in 1626,&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt; through [[Pope Urban VIII]], who personally interceded on his behalf with [[Philip IV of Spain]]. Taken to [[Rome]] and held for a time by the Holy Office, Campanella was restored to full liberty in 1629. He lived for five years in Rome, where he was Urban's advisor in astrological matters.

In 1634, however, a new conspiracy in Calabria, led by one of his followers, threatened fresh troubles. 
With the aid of [[Cardinal Barberini]] and the French Ambassador de Noailles, he fled to [[France]], where he was received at the court of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] with marked favour.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt; Protected by [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and granted a liberal pension by the king, he spent the rest of his days in the convent of Saint-Honoré in [[Paris]]. His last work was a poem celebrating the birth of the future [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (''Ecloga in portentosam Delphini nativitatem'').

Campanella's ''De sensu rerum et magia'' (1620) partly inspired the first fully-fledged [[Novel of circulation|it-narrative]] in English, [[Charles Gildon]]'s ''The Golden Spy'' (1709).&lt;ref&gt;J. Wu, " 'Nobilitas sola est atq; unica Virtus': Spying and the Politics of Virtue in ''The Golden Spy; or, A Political Journal of the British Nights Entertainments'' (1709)", ''Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 40:2 (2017), 237-253 doi: 10.1111/1754-0208.12412&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Fernand Lionel Vianney Décarie''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|OC|GOQ}}, was a Canadian philosopher. He was born November 28, 1917, in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]] and died there on September 6, 2009, of [[pneumonia]].

==Early life==
Vianney Décarie was a descendant of an old [[Quebec]] family.  His grandfather, [[Barthélémy Thélesphore Décarie]], was a major landowner, whose farms stretched through the west end of present-day [[Montreal]] and the village of [[Notre Dame de Grace]].  The [[Décarie Expressway]] bears the family's name.

==Career==
At 17, he won the [[Prix Colin de Rhétorique]] for the best marks in the province among the [[collèges classiques]], the religious-run [[University-preparatory school|preparatory schools]] in Quebec.

By 1950, Décarie earned his [[doctorate]] and, in 1954, he received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]. He studied all of [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s writing on [[Aristotle]] at the [[Widener Library]] of [[Harvard University]].

The provincial government established the [[University of Montreal]]'s [[École normale supérieure]].  In 1961, he was named director.  The school offered a higher standard for teaching both university and high school instructors, and eventually became the university's [[faculty of education]].

His work called for a more robust [[post-secondary]] system: a [[research council]], better [[peer review]] and a body to implement best practices for university administrators; all of which preceded the [[Parent Commission]].

He published ''L'object de la métaphysique selon Aristotle'', one of the most important books on the philosopher.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
He obtained the [[Doctorat d'État]] from [[La Sorbonne]] and was featured in the pages of [[Paris Match]].

He made enemies with his political writing and general exploration.  There was still resistance to open-mindedness among the clergy who ran the university.  A [[Le Devoir]] editorial criticized the university for not recognizing [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s value; after Décarie complained to the rector of the university, Trudeau was hired.

Décarie was an occasional writer for the political magazine [[Cité Libre]].

Décarie also played a role in the early career of [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], whom he hired as a professor in the early 1960s.

International philosophers such as [[Paul Ricoeur]], [[Paul Vignaux]] and [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]] regularly spoke to his students.  He was seen as an [[avant-garde]] Christians in 1960s philosophy..

He retired mandatorily at age 65. but continued to lecture, including at [[McGill University]]. He researched until two years before his death at age 91 when he suffered [[vascular dementia]].

==Awards==

He was awarded the [[Order of Canada]] and the [[Order of Quebec]], of the latter named a Grand Officer, for his work promoting secular education.

==Family==

His widow is [[Thérèse Gouin Décarie]], a pioneering researcher on [[early childhood development]].  His children are Pascale, Dominique, Jean-Claude and Emmanuel.  He went to church every Sunday, but respected his children's religious choices.

His love of language was passionate, and was moved by the construction of ancient Greek words.  That passion for language spilled over into a [[short-wave radio]] obsession, listening to foreign broadcasts.[http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090929.OBDECARIE29ART2148/BDAStory/BDA/deaths]

The whole point of the Wason task is to demonstrate that people make mistakes when thinking about this stuff; several past version of the caption have... made mistakes in thinking about this stuff.--&gt;]]
The '''Wason selection task''' (or '''''four-card problem''''') is a [[logic puzzle]] devised by [[Peter Cathcart Wason]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wason | first1 = P. C. | year = 1968 | title = Reasoning about a rule | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 273–281 | doi=10.1080/14640746808400161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wason | first=P.

C. | authorlink=Peter Cathcart Wason | title=Natural and contrived experience in a reasoning problem | journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | year=1971 | volume=23 | pages= 63–71 | doi=10.1080/00335557143000068 | last2=Shapiro | first2=Diana}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most famous tasks in the study of [[deductive reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Manktelow1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Manktelow|first=K. I.|title=Reasoning and Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XpBCZDcCtIC&amp;pg=PA8|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-708-0|page=8|quote=The Wason selection task has often been claimed to be the single most investigated experimental paradigm in the psychology of reasoning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the puzzle is:

{{quote|You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a number on one side and a colored patch on the other side.  The visible faces of the cards show 3, 8, red and brown.  Which card(s) must you turn over in order to test the truth of the proposition that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is red?}}

A response that identifies a card that need not be inverted, or that fails to identify a card that needs to be inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants).

The test is of special interest because people have a hard time solving it in most scenarios but can usually solve it correctly in certain contexts. In particular, researchers have found that the puzzle is readily solved when the imagined context is policing a social rule.

==Solution==
The correct response is to turn over the 8 and the brown card.

The rule was "''If'' the card shows an even number on one face, ''then'' its opposite face is red." Only a card with both an even number on one face ''and'' something other than red on the other face can invalidate this rule:
* If the 3 card is red (or brown), that doesn't violate the rule. The rule makes no claims about odd numbers.
* If the 8 card is not red, it violates the rule.
* If the red card is odd (or even), that doesn't violate the rule. The red color is not exclusive to even numbers.
* If the brown card is even, it violates the rule.

===Use of logic===
The interpretation of "if" here is that of the [[material conditional]] in [[classical logic]], so this problem can be solved by choosing the cards using [[modus ponens]] (all even cards must be checked to ensure they are red) and [[modus tollens]] (all non-red cards must be checked to ensure they are non-even).

==Explanations of performance on the task==
In Wason's study, not even 10% of subjects found the correct solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. C. |last=Wason |year=1977 |chapter=Self-contradictions |editor-link=Philip Johnson-Laird |editor-first=P. N. |editor-last=Johnson-Laird |editor2-first=P. C. |editor2-last=Wason |title=Thinking: Readings in cognitive science |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521217563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This result was replicated in 1993.&lt;ref name="EvansNewstead1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Jonathan St. B. T.|last2=Newstead|first2=Stephen E.|last3=Byrne|first3=Ruth M. J.|title=Human Reasoning: The Psychology of Deduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFMhZ4dl1KcC|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-86377-313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have argued that participants do not read "if... then..." as the material conditional, since the natural language conditional is not the material conditional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oaksford |first=M. |last2=Chater |first2=N. |year=1994 |title=A rational analysis of the selection task as optimal data selection |journal=[[Psychological Review]] |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=608–631 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.4.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenning |first=K. |last2=van Lambalgen |first2=M. |year=2004 |title=A little logic goes a long way: basing experiment on semantic theory in the cognitive science of conditional reasoning |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=481–530 |doi=10.1016/j.cogsci.2004.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vonSydow2006"/&gt; (See also the [[paradoxes of the material conditional]] for more information.)  However one interesting feature of the task is how participants react when the classical logic solution is explained:
{{quote|A psychologist, not very well disposed toward logic, once confessed to me that despite all problems in short-term inferences like the Wason Card Task, there was also the undeniable fact that he had never met an experimental subject who did not understand the logical solution when it was explained to him, and then agreed that it was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Johan |last=van Benthem |year=2008 |title=Logic and reasoning: do the facts matter? |journal=Studia Logica |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1007/s11225-008-9101-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This latter comment is also controversial, since it does not explain whether the subjects regarded their previous solution incorrect, or whether they regarded the problem sufficiently vague to have two interpretations.

===Policing social rules===
As of 1983, experimenters had identified that success on the Wason selection task was highly content-dependent, but there was no theoretical explanation for which content elicited mostly correct responses and which ones elicited mostly incorrect responses.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt;
[[File:Wason selection task cards - drinking variant.svg|350px|right|thumb|Each card has an age on one side, and a drink on the other. Which card(s) must be turned over to test the idea that if you are drinking alcohol then you must be over 18?]]
[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] (1992) identified that the selection task tends to produce the "correct" response when presented in a context of [[social relation]]s.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt; For example, if the rule used is "If you are drinking alcohol then you must be over 18", and the cards have an age on one side and beverage on the other, e.g., "16", "drinking beer", "25", "drinking coke", most people have no difficulty in selecting the correct cards ("16" and "beer").&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt; In a series of experiments in different contexts, subjects demonstrated consistent superior performance when asked to police a social rule involving a benefit that was only legitimately available to someone who had qualified for that benefit.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt; Cosmides and Tooby argued that experimenters have ruled out alternative explanations, such as that people learn the rules of social exchange through practice and find it easier to apply these familiar rules than less-familiar rules.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt;

According to Cosmides and Tooby, this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that a Wason task proves to be easier if the rule to be tested is one of social exchange (''in order to receive benefit X you need to fulfill condition Y'') and the subject is asked to police the rule, but is more difficult otherwise. They argued that such a distinction, if empirically borne out, would support the contention of evolutionary psychologists that human [[reason]]ing is governed by context-sensitive mechanisms that have evolved, through [[natural selection]], to solve specific problems of social interaction, rather than context-free, general-purpose mechanisms.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cosmides | first=L. | authorlink=Leda Cosmides |last2=Tooby|first2= J.  | editor-last1=Barkow |editor-first1=J.| editor-last2=Cosmides | editor-first2=L. | editor-last3=Tooby|editor-first3= J.  | chapter=Cognitive Adaptions for Social Exchange |title= The adapted mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture| year=1992 | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press |chapterurl=http://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/Cogadapt.pdf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTzuAAAAMAAJ|pp=163–228 |isbn=978-0-19-506023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the module is described as a specialized cheater-detection module.&lt;ref name="cogadapt"/&gt;

=== Evaluation of social relations hypothesis ===
Davies et al. (1995) have argued that Cosmides and Tooby's argument in favor of context-sensitive, domain-specific reasoning mechanisms as opposed to general-purpose reasoning mechanisms is theoretically incoherent and inferentially unjustified.&lt;ref name="DFF"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davies |first1= Paul Sheldon |last2= Fetzer |first2= James H. |last3= Foster |first3= Thomas R. |year= 1995 |title= Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–37 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/BF00851985 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Sydow (2006) has argued that we have to distinguish deontic and descriptive conditionals, but that the logic of testing deontic conditionals is more systematic (cf. Beller, 2001) and depend on one's goals (cf. Sperber &amp; Girotto, 2002).&lt;ref name="vonSydow2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=von Sydow| first=M. | title= Towards a Flexible Bayesian and Deontic Logic of Testing Descriptive and Prescriptive Rules| year=2006| location=Göttingen | publisher=Göttingen University Press |url=https://ediss.uni-goettingen.de/handle/11858/00-1735-0000-0006-AC29-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beller2001"&gt;{{cite book | last=Beller| first=S. | authorlink= |editor-last1=Moore|editor-first1=J.D. | editor-last2=Stenning|editor-first2= K. | chapter=A model theory of deontic reasoning about social norms |title= Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society| year=2001 | location=Mahwah, NJ.| publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum |chapterurl=|url=|pp=63–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sperber |first=D.|last2=Girotto|first2=V.|year=2002 |title=Use or misuse of the selection task? |journal=Cognition |volume=85 |issue= |pages=277–290. |doi= 10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00125-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to [[Satoshi Kanazawa|Kanazawa]] (2010),&lt;ref name="Kanazawa2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanazawa|first1=Satoshi|author-link1=Satoshi Kanazawa|year=May–June 2010|title=Evolutionary Psychology and Intelligence Research|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|volume=65|issue=4|pages=279–289|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|doi=10.1037/a0019378|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/Kanazawa/pdfs/AP2010.pdf|accessdate=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Barry Kaufman|Kaufman]] et al.

==Career==
MacAskill earned his BA in philosophy at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], his [[BPhil]] at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]], and his DPhil in philosophy at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] in 2013 (spending a year as a visiting student at [[Princeton University]]), supervised by [[John Broome (philosopher)|John Broome]] and [[Krister Bykvist]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He then took up a junior research fellowship at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New People|url=http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/magazine/Oxford%20Philosophy%207.pdf|work=Oxford Philosophy Magazine|date=2015|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; before taking an associate professorship at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Members: The Senior Common Room 2015–16|url=https://www.lincoln.ox.ac.uk/uploads/files/Web%20version.pdf|work=Lincoln College Record 2015–16|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacAskill’s research has two main focuses. The first addresses the issue of how one ought to make decisions under normative uncertainty; in addition to a DPhil on the topic,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=MacAskill|first=William|title=Normative Uncertainty|date=2014|degree=DPhil|publisher=University of Oxford|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MACNU|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has published on this issue in Ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=|title=The infectiousness of nihilism|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/52622510/MacAskill_-_The_infectiousness_of_nihilism.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1536537295&amp;Signature=LTrVdvhl8ROWQFVtnjse3GITTw8%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Infectiousness_of_Nihilism.pdf|journal=Ethics|volume=123(3)|pages=508-520|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mind,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2016|title=Normative Uncertainty as a Voting Problem|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzv169|journal=Mind|language=en|volume=125|issue=500|pages=967–1004|doi=10.1093/mind/fzv169|issn=0026-4423|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Journal of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2016|title=Smokers, Psychos, and Decision-Theoretic Uncertainty|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/jphil/content/jphil_2016_0113_0009_0425_0445|journal=Journal of Philosophy|volume=113|issue=9|pages=425–445|doi=10.5840/jphil2016113929|issn=0022-362X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Doing Good Better and Effective Altruism ==
MacAskill’s second research focus is on [[effective altruism]]. His book on the topic, ''[[Doing Good Better]],'' was published in 2015, and reviewed favorably in [[London Review of Books|The London Review of Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n18/amia-srinivasan/stop-the-robot-apocalypse|title=Stop the Robot Apocalypse|last=Srinivasan|first=Amia|date=2015-09-24|work=London Review of Books|access-date=2018-09-09|pages=3–6|issn=0260-9592}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Guardian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/doing-good-better-william-macaskill-review|title=Doing Good Better by William MacAskill review – if you read this book, you'll change the charities you donate to|last=Shariatmadari|first=David|date=2015-08-20|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/effective-altruism-where-charity-and-rationality-meet.html|title=Effective Altruism: Where Charity and Rationality Meet|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In it, he argues that many of the ways people think about doing good achieve very little, but that by applying data and [[Science|scientific reasoning]] to the normally sentimental world of doing good, opportunities to have a huge positive impact can be found. 

In the book MacAskill makes controversial claims such as the fact that [[fair trade]] does very little to help the [[Subsistence agriculture|poorest farmers]], that boycotting sweatshops might make things worse for the [[Extreme poverty|global poor]] and that people who pursue high-income careers such as plastic surgeons or wall street bankers could do more good than charity workers. 

MacAskill's argument that young idealists should work for Wall Street has been the subject of a ''New York Times'' op-ed by [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=opinion|title = The Way to Produce a Person|last = Brooks|first = David|accessdate = 2013-10-16|publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that, while effective altruists may start [[earning to give]] in order to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic.  In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves "into a machine for the redistribution of wealth."

== Talks and Media Appearances ==
In 2016, MacAskill appeared on the podcast “[[Sam Harris#Waking Up podcast|Waking Up]]” with Sam Harris,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://samharris.org/podcasts/being-good-and-doing-good/|title=Waking Up Podcast #44 — Being Good and Doing Good {{!}} Sam Harris|work=Sam Harris|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the “[[Tim Ferriss#The Tim Ferriss Show|Tim Ferriss Show]]” with Tim Ferriss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tim Ferriss|title=Will MacAskill Interview (Full Episode) {{!}} The Tim Ferriss Show (Podcast)|date=2016-01-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIdxzkOqK_o|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018, MacAskill gave a [[Ted Talk|TED talk]] on effective altruism at the TED conference in Vancouver, the talk was released on the 12th of September, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MacAskill|first=Will|title=How can we do the most good for the world?|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/will_macaskill_how_can_we_do_the_most_good_for_the_world|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal Life ==
MacAskill (born Crouch) is also known for having argued that men should consider changing their last names when they get married; he and his fiancée changed their name to "MacAskill", her maternal grandmother's maiden name.&lt;ref name=atlantic1/&gt;

He lives in Oxford.

[[File:Yrjö Reenpää.jpg|thumb|Finnish physiologist and philosopher Yrjö Reenpää in 1960s]]
'''Yrjö Reenpää''' (Renqvist until 1935; 18. July 1894&amp;nbsp;– 18. December 1976, [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]) was a Finnish physiologist and philosopher and professor of [[physiology]] in [[University of Helsinki]]. He developed general sensory physiology on the bases of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[epistemology]], [[psycho-physics]] and [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]].

== Life ==

Yrjö Reenpää’s father Alvar Renqvist was owner and director of a publishing house, professor, and parliamentarian. Having graduated from the high school in 1912 Yrjö Reenpää started to study medicine in [[University of Helsinki]]. Very early he was involved in research work focused on [[physiology]] under the supervision of [[Robert Tigersted]]t, the first professor of physiology in [[University of Helsinki]]. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the physiology of taste with the title Über den Geschmack in 1918. After having served in the medical staff of the Finnish Armed Forces during the war, he returned to the Department of Physiology in University of Helsinki to continue research in sensory physiology. In line with other scientists in the first half of the 20th century, he paid several visits to physiology departments in German universities establishing lifelong contacts to sensory physiologists like [[Max von Frey]], [[Johannes von Kries]] and [Viktor von Weizsäcker] among others. After [Robert Tigerstedt]’s successor his son Carl Tigerstedt’s death in 1927 Reenpää was nominated to the chair of physiology, the position he held until his retirement in 1962.

== General sensory physiology ==

Having started with experimental research on sensory physiology in the fields of taste, tactile sense, muscular sense and the sense of movement, he proceeded to deal with the principal topic of general sensory physiology that of [[psycho-physics]]. Mapping the relations of measured sensation magnitudes to stimulus parameters revealed to him the structure of the phenomenal perceptual manifold and its metrics. He outlined in an axiomatic form the [[psycho-physical]] relation fitting with [[Kantian epistemology]] and with [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] as presented in the first half of the century by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] among others. Applying psycho-physical methods he and his collaborators, R. M. Bergström, later his successor, Alvar Wilska, and Eeva Jalavisto among others, obtained experimental evidence of the structures of perceptual manifolds in various sensory modalities.  After his retirement he extended the philosophical considerations to include the psycho-physiological issues of mind-matter relation and discussed psycho-physiological parallelism in cases relating perceptions to evoked response data particularly in audition in the studies by Wolf Dieter Keidel and his collaborators in the [[University of Erlangen]], where Reenpää had a visiting professorship.

== Philosophy ==

On the bases of the studies in sensory and observational physiology Reenpää conceived that sensory perceptions constitute the fundamental knowledge base also to the natural sciences. According to him, concepts can be traced back to phenomenal observations in line with the [Kantian tables of judgment and categories]. Concepts arise from the noumenal contents of observations by extracting them out of their temporal frame of the act of perception, as purely timeless entities. The [psycho-physical] relation can according to Reenpää be regarded as an issue of simultaneous isomorphism based on conceptual correspondence rather than possessing a causal relation.

== Cultural activity ==

In addition to his scientific activities Yrjö Reenpää was among others the president of the Finnish Medical Society (Duodecim) in 1933-1936, president of the Nordic Society of Physiology in 1936-1939, chairman of the [[Finnish Academy of Science and Letters]] (1942-1943). He was also nominated as the member of [[Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities]] (1939). He was one of the founding members of the Finnish Cultural Foundation and had a position as its first chairman (1937-1953). The Foundation nominated the annual series of lectures for invited outstanding foreign scientists, as Yrjö Reenpää Memorial Lecture since 1979.
