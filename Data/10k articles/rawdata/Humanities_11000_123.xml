'''''Anti-Monopoly''''' is a [[board game]] made by [[San Francisco State University]] Professor [[Ralph Anspach]], in response to ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''.

== Background and history ==
Anspach created ''Anti-Monopoly'' in part as a response to the lessons taught by the mainstream game, which he believed created the impression that [[monopoly|monopolies]] were something desirable.  His intent was to demonstrate how harmful monopolies could be to a free-enterprise system, and how [[antitrust]] laws work to curtail them in the real world.

The game was originally to be produced in 1973 as ''Bust the Trust'', but the title was changed to ''Anti-Monopoly''. It has seen multiple printings and revisions since 1973. In 1984, a new version appeared as ''Anti-Monopoly II''; this version was updated and re-released in 2005 without the numerical designation. The game is currently still in print, and is produced and distributed worldwide by University Games.

==Gameplay==
The original ''Anti-Monopoly'' game begins with the board in a monopolised state, effectively the result of a completed ''Monopoly'' game.  Instead of real estate and public utilities, properties in ''Anti-Monopoly'' are individual businesses that have been brought under single ownership.  Players take the role of federal case workers bringing indictments against each monopolised business in an attempt to return the state of the board to a [[free market]] system.

In ''Anti-Monopoly II'' individual players choose to play either by monopolist or competitor rules at the beginning of the game. This version plays more like the actual ''Monopoly'' game in that it is based on the buying and selling of real estate. Among other differences, competitors charge lower rents and can improve any property they own at any time, while monopolists must own at least two properties in a group before building houses on them and charge much higher rents.

==Trademark lawsuit==
{{See also|History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly#Anti-Monopoly.2C_Inc._vs._General_Mills_Fun_Group.2C_Inc._court_case_1976.E2.80.931985|label 1=History of the board game Monopoly (''Anti-Monopoly, Inc. vs. General Mills Fun Group'')}}
In 1974, Parker Brothers sued Anspach over the use of the "''Monopoly''" name, claiming trademark infringement.  While preparing his legal defense, Anspach became aware of ''Monopoly''{{'}}s history prior to [[Charles Darrow]]'s sale of the game to Parker in 1935, and how it had evolved from [[Elizabeth Magie]]'s original ''[[The Landlord's Game|Landlord's Game]]'' into the version Darrow appropriated.  Anspach based his defense on the grounds that the game itself existed in effectively the [[public domain]] before Parker purchased it, and therefore Parker's trademark claim on it should be nullified.  The case dragged on for ten years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antimonopoly.com/ ''Anti-Monopoly'' official website]&lt;/ref&gt; with numerous appeals and overturned judicial verdicts, until Anspach and Parker ultimately reached a settlement, permitting him to continue using the name ''Anti-Monopoly'' and distributing the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How a Fight Over a Board Game Monopolised an Economist's Life |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |first=Mary |last=Pilon |authorlink=Mary Pilon |date=October 20, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125599860004295449?mod=rss_US_News |accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time during the dispute, the game was marketed as simply "Anti."

*  ''Syndrome'', a similar game in that it inverts the objective of ''Monopoly'' but with the aim of giving away money and property, was described by [[science fiction]] author [[Philip K. Dick]] in his short story "[[War Game (short story)|War Game]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=War Game |journal=''Galaxy'' |date=December 1959 |page=100 |url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1959-12/Galaxy_1959_12#page/n99/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selchow and Righter]] published the game as ''Go for Broke'' in 1965.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

* In [[Germany]], where the original game was and is very popular, two more versions of ''Anti-Monopoly'' were created and popular in the late 1970s and 1980s: ''Provopoli - Wem gehört die Stadt''  ("To whom the city belongs"), where [[squatters]] take over parts of the town, and ''Ökopoli'' ("Ecopoly") where the objective is to take over the town from polluters.

Sacchi's lasting influence was in requesting [[playwright]] [[Carlo Goldoni]] to lay a dramatic structure to his improvised routines, with the resulting plays ''[[Harlequin|Truffaldino]]'s 32 Mishaps'' (1738–40), ''[[Harlequin|Truffaldino]]'s Son Lost and Found'' (1746), and the masterpiece ''[[A Servant of Two Masters]]'' (1745–53) being the best permanent record of what was an impromptu and momentary art form. Sacchi toured throughout [[Europe]] with his own [[Commedia dell'arte|Commedia]] troupe from 1738 to 1753, and both [[David Garrick]] and [[Casanova]] spoke highly of his talents.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

===State government===
[[George Ariyoshi]], who served as the Governor of Hawaii from 1974 to 1986, was the first American of Asian descent to be elected governor of a state of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Japanese American history: an A-to-Z reference from 1868 to the present |last=Niiya |first=Brian |authorlink= |author2=Japanese American National Museum |year=1993 |publisher=VNR AG |location= |isbn=978-0-8160-2680-7 |page=21  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=George%20Ariyoshi%20First%20Asian%20American%20governor&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=George%20Ariyoshi%20First%20Asian%20American%20governor&amp;f=false |accessdate= 22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continues to hold the record as the longest-serving state governor in Hawaii.

[[David Ige]], current governor of Hawaii since December 1, 2014, is of Japanese-American descent, like Ariyoshi, and is additionally the first person of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawan]] descent to hold office in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://governor.hawaii.gov/governors-bio/|title=David Y.

'''Bang for the buck''' is an [[idiom]] meaning the worth of one's money or exertion. The phrase originated from the slang usage of the words "bang" which means "excitement" and "buck" which means "money".&lt;ref name="Heacock19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Heacock|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of the term include "bang for '''your''' buck," "bang for '''one's''' buck," "'''more''' bang for the buck," "'''bigger''' bang for the buck," and mixings of these. "More bang for the buck" was preceded by "more bounce to the ounce", an advertising slogan used in 1950 to market the carbonated soft drink [[Pepsi]].

The phrase "bigger bang for the buck" was notably used by U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of Defense]], [[Charles Erwin Wilson]], in 1954. He used it to describe the [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy of depending on nuclear weapons, rather than a large regular army, to keep the Soviet Union in check. Today, the phrase is used to mean a greater worth for the money used.

==History and usage==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | align = right| width = 33% | quote =[Bang for the (or one's) buck], which means 'value for one's money', was originally a political one. Its first use was quite literal: With bang referring to 'firepower' or 'weaponry', it really did mean 'bombs for one's money'. The alliteration of bang and buck helps to make the phrase memorable.| source = [[Random House]], December 19, 1997''&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"/&gt;}}

[[William Safire]] discussed "bang for the buck" in his 1968 book, ''New Language of Politics''. Safire stated that U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson]] used the phrase in 1954 to summarize the [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy.&lt;ref name="RandomHouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19971219 |title=The Mavens' Word of the Day: bang for the buck |date=1997-12-19 |publisher=[[Random House]] |accessdate=2010-12-07 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uoIXvAv3?url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19971219 |archivedate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayerxxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mayer|2010|p=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Look, a 1950s national security policy during the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], was called "more bang for the buck"&lt;ref name="Pavelec325"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavelec|2009|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "bigger bang for the buck".&lt;ref name="Safire51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Safire|2008|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; "More bang for the buck" was also used in the late 1960s by the U.S. military to refer to how it wanted to receive more combat power from the armaments it possessed.&lt;ref name="Feldman199"&gt;{{Harvnb|Feldman|1989|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, instead of supporting a large regular army, increasingly depended on nuclear weapons to hold the Soviet Union in check.&lt;ref name="Kort39"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kort|2001|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bigger bang for the buck" is similar to the phrase "more bounce to the ounce", an advertising catchphrase used in 1950 by [[PepsiCo]] to market its soft drink product [[Pepsi]].&lt;ref name="Ammer34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ammer|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pepsi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Case Study – Pepsico: Cola gets a pep talk |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/consumer-products/food-beverage-products-nonalcoholics/11972274-1.html |newspaper=[[LexisNexis]] |date=2007-04-16 |accessdate=2010-12-08 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5upn3ljVa?url=http://www.allbusiness.com/consumer-products/food-beverage-products-nonalcoholics/11972274-1.html |archivedate=2010-12-08 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the phrase is used to mean "a better value for the money spent".&lt;ref name="Powers135"&gt;{{Harvnb|Powers|2010|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2001, author Matthew L. Stone wrote that the phrase "has been overused almost to the point of becoming meaningless".&lt;ref name="Stone54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2001|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2010 book ''The Trouble with Thinking'', Lauren Powers wrote that whenever she hears the [[cliché]] "bigger bang for the buck", she becomes "distracted" by the phrase's history and cannot continue paying attention to the speaker's words.&lt;ref name="Powers135"/&gt;

It is the third title from The Behemoth following ''[[Alien Hominid]]'' and ''[[Castle Crashers]]''. The game was released on [[Xbox Live Arcade]] on April 3, 2013, and later temporarily made free via [[Games with Gold]] on July 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mggAckod0k0  BattleBlock Theater on XBLA was released on April 3, 2013] via The Behemoth on [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
In ''BattleBlock Theater'', players control a prisoner as they are forced to play through games devised by Hatty Hattington. Controls are simple, with the game largely consisting of running, jumping and punching. Levels are made up of various types of blocks, such as collapsing blocks, sticky walls, bouncy volcanic rocks and deadly spikes, and also feature hazards such as water and deadly creatures.

The main mode in the game is Adventure Mode, which can be played solo or co-operatively with a second player. This mode can be played either in normal mode (with checkpoints) or insane mode (no checkpoints, meaning if the player dies, they have to restart the level). During co-operative play, players are able to work together to overcome obstacles, which includes throwing them across gaps, using their heads as platforms and helping each other up ledges, although there is just as much opportunity of partner sabotage. Adventure mode consists of various worlds each with a set of levels. In order to progress to the next world, players need to collect gems which can also be used to unlock new customizable parts and complete a 'Boss Level' (timed level). Players can also collect balls of yarn which they can use to bribe cat guards and unlock new weapons, such as frisbees and vacuum cleaners. Collecting all gems and the yarn with a time good enough to get the clock stamp will get the player an A++ in the level and two extra gems.

In some levels, players can also have a chance to get a golden hat, which pops up in a random location at a random time, and are each worth ten extra gems. However, when the player dies, the golden hat they are carrying will stay at the point they had died (or be destroyed, depending on where it lands) until the player picks it up again.

Arena mode is a competitive mode for up to four players, which is played in teams of 2. There are several match types including:
* Soul Snatcher:  Steal enemy soul and run away.  Capture and hold the enemy's souls to gain points.  Kill or step on a carrier to release their souls to roam the level.
* Muckle:  Beat and kill the enemy team to earn the players' team points.
* Challenge:  Score the best time on a given level.
* King Of The Hill:  Stand on the crown blocks to gain the player's team points.
* Color The World:  Color more blocks than the other team.
* Grab The Gold:  Grab more gold from the golden whale than the other team and deposit it in the flying safe to score points for the player's team
* Ball Game:  Get the ball in the basket.
* Capture The Horse:  Ride the opposing team's horse to the team's stables to gain points for the player's team.

Along with a Time Attack mode, the game also features a Level Editor, which allows players to create their own stages for any game type. These levels can be assembled into a playlist, consisting of various Adventure and Arena levels, and uploaded to the community for others to download. There is also additional content unlocked for players who also own ''[[Castle Crashers]]'' and ''[[Alien Hominid|Alien Hominid HD]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted August 31, 2012 by danp |url=http://devblog.thebehemoth.com/2012/08/31/level-lobby-ft-level-editor/ |title=Level Lobby ft.

==Story==
Almost all of the game's cut-scenes are done in a stick puppet style. The game begins with the narrator (voiced by [[Will Stamper]]) telling the adventures of the hundreds of friends aboard the S.S. Friendship, as well as Hatty Hattington, who is known as "best friend to one and all". After encountering a heavy storm, the S.S. Friendship becomes shipwrecked on a mysterious, seemingly abandoned island, and the crew itself vanishes. Upon waking up from the wreck, the player character seeks shelter from the storm in a dilapidated theater.

Upon coming to, it is revealed that the entire crew of the S.S. Friendship is being held prisoner by cats, with Hatty as their apparent new leader. The player is then released from their cell and forced into deadly games by the feline wardens. The cats, who force their prisoners into deadly theater performances, watch with amusement as the player fights for their survival. As the player completes challenges, they find gems which are spent on unlocking fellow crew members to play as in these theater performances. Appearing to be possessed by the hat's unknown powers, Hatty begins working for the cats and against the player.

As the player progresses, the narrator reveals more about the theater. Hundreds of years before the player shipwrecked on the island, Purrham Furbottom, a theatrical aficionado, sought to build the world's greatest theater. The opening night saw the most jaw-dropping feats and thrills the likes of which were never seen before, making the theater an overnight success. However, Furbottom did not allow intermissions in the theater, and after an untold amount of time watching the show, he died after "pooping himself to death on the way to the bathroom." Since then, his top hat has been passed down to various others, who were each revered by the cats as their leader, and who each met with grim fates of their own. The hat, the narrator theorizes, is haunted by the grief and sorrow of each of its past wearers, and Hatty is its current victim, having sunk into a depression while being surrounded by the many gems the player has accrued, without doing anything to help the state of the theater.

Eventually, the cats grow tired of Hatty's inaction, and begin rioting, striking, and more, while the player's challenges grow increasingly difficult. As the theater deteriorates further, the narrator provides encouragement to the player and continues to shed light on the cats' mental state, which grows more unstable as time progresses. The narrator also instructs the player to enter The Vault, which houses Hatty and all the gems the player has spent, before the cats kill Hatty and the rest of the crew, starting the madness over again.

After completing the final set of challenges inside the Vault, the player breaks into Hatty's throne room. Hatty does not budge, so the player carries him out of the crumbling theater as the crew of the S.S. Friendship orchestrates a mass breakout. Everyone manages to make it back to the boat amidst the chaos, escaping the island and the cats that reside there. As the player celebrates with hot cocoa, he tries to cheer up Hatty, who the narrator says that he would not move, blink, respond to hugs, and talk. He also asks "Where has he gone to?", meaning that Hatty may have died. The narrator sings a sad song as the credits roll, before quickly recovering and singing a more happy, upbeat song, rocking the boat and flinging Hatty into the sea, where he sinks to the bottom. The hat lands on his head and begins glowing green as opposed to its usual red, and shoots a beam skyward, where it sends the boat flying and continues into space, where it vaporizes ''[[Alien Hominid]]'' from the game of the same name and a bear that appeared during the narrator's upbeat song, foreshadowing the events of ''[[Pit People]]''. The narrator claims to understand what just happened but does not explain, sending the game back to the title screen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34926">The '''Bimini Road''', sometimes called the '''Bimini Wall''', is an underwater rock formation near North [[Bimini]] island in the [[Bahamas]].  The Road consists of a {{convert|0.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long northeast-southwest linear feature composed of roughly rectangular to subrectangular [[limestone]] blocks. Various claims have been made for this feature being either a wall, road, pier, breakwater, or other man-made structure. However, credible evidence or arguments are lacking for such an origin.&lt;ref name="Shinn2009a"/&gt;

==History==

[[File:Bimini island.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite picture of North Bimini Island]]
On September 2, 1968, while diving in three [[fathom]]s ({{convert|5.5|m|ft|disp=or|lk=out|abbr=off}}) of water off the northwest coast of North Bimini [[island]], Joseph Manson Valentine, [[Jacques Mayol]] and Robert Angove encountered an extensive "pavement" of what later was found to be noticeably rounded stones of varying size and thickness.&lt;ref name="Valentine1969"&gt;Valentine, J. M., 1969, ''Archaeological enigmas of Florida and the Western Bahamas.'' Muse News (Miami Museum of Science). v. 1, pp. 26-29,41-47 (1969, June).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine1973"&gt;Valentine, J. M., 1973, ''Culture pattern seen.'' Muse News (Miami Museum of Science). v. 4, pp. 314-315, 331-334 (April 1973)&lt;/ref&gt; This stone pavement was found to form a northeast-southwest linear feature, which is most commonly known as either the "Bimini Road" or "Bimini Wall". After Valentine, the Bimini Road has been visited and examined by geologists, avocational archaeologists, professional archaeologists, anthropologists, marine engineers, innumerable divers, and many other people. In addition to the Bimini Road, investigators have found two additional "pavement-like" linear features that lie parallel to and shoreward of the Bimini Wall.&lt;ref name="Valentine1976"&gt;Valentine, J.M., 1976, ''Underwater Archeology in the Bahamas.'' Explorers Journal. v. 54, no. 4, pp. 176-183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"&gt;Gifford, J.A., and M.M. Ball, 1980, ''Investigation of submerged beachrock deposits off Bimini.'' National Geographic Society Research Reports. v. 12, pp. 21–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
The Bimini Wall and two linear features lying shoreward of it are composed of flat-lying, tabular, and rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. Descriptions of the Bimini Road found in various books and articles greatly exaggerate the regularity and rectangularity of the blocks composing these features.&lt;ref name="McKusick1979a"&gt;McKusick, M., 1979, ''The Bimini underwater discoveries.'' Explorer Journal. v. 58, no. 1, pp. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bimini Road, the largest of three linear features, is {{convert|0.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, a northeast/southwest-trending feature with a pronounced hook at its southwest end. It consists of stone blocks measuring as much as {{convert|3|-|4|m|abbr=on|0}} in horizontal dimensions, with the average size being {{convert|2|-|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}. The larger blocks show complementary edges, which are lacking in the smaller blocks. The two narrower and shorter, approximately {{convert|50|and|60|m|abbr=on|-1}}-long linear features lying shoreward of the Bimini Road consist of smaller tabular stone blocks that are only {{convert|1|-|2|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in maximum horizontal breadth. Having rounded corners, the blocks composing these pavements resemble giant loaves of bread. The blocks consist of [[limestone]] composed of carbonate-cemented shell hash that is called "[[beachrock]]". Beachrock is native to the Bahamas. The highly rounded nature of the blocks forming the Bimini Road indicates that a significant thickness of their original surface has been removed by biological, physical, and chemical processes. Given the degree that these blocks have been eroded, it is highly implausible that any original surface features, including any tool marks and inscriptions, would have survived this degree of erosion.&lt;ref name="Shinn2009a"&gt;Shinn, E. A., 2009, ''The mystique of beachrock.'' in Perspectives in Carbonate Geology: A Tribute to the Career of Robert Nathan Ginsburg, P. K. Swart, G. Eberli, and J. A. McKenzie, eds., pp. 19-28. International Association of Sedimentologists Special Publication no. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"/&gt;

After a very detailed examination of the Bimini Road and the other linear features, Gifford and Ball made the following observations.&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"/&gt;

{{quote|
1. The three features are unconnected at the southwest end; scattered blocks are present there but do not form a well-defined linear feature connecting the seaward, middle, and shoreward features.&lt;br/&gt;
2. No evidence exists anywhere over the three features of two courses of blocks, or even a single block set squarely atop another.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Not enough blocks lie in the vicinity of the three features to have formed a now-destroyed second course of rocks.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Bedrock closely underlies the entire area of the three features (fig. 5), eliminating the possibility of excavations or channels between them.&lt;br/&gt;
5. Indications are that the blocks of the inner and middle features have always rested on a layer of loose sand. No evidence was found of the blocks being cut into or founded on the underlying bedrock surface.&lt;br/&gt;
6. In areas of the seaward feature where blocks rest directly on the bedrock surface, no evidence was found of regular or symmetrical supports beneath any of the blocks.&lt;br/&gt;
7. We saw no evidence on any of the blocks of regular or repeated patterns of grooves or depressions that might be interpreted as tool marks.&lt;br/&gt;
8. The inner and middle features are continuous only over a distance of about {{convert|50|m|abbr=off}}. Though the seaward feature extends several hundred metres farther to the northeast, it too is not well founded or continuous enough to have served as some kind of thoroughfare.|J.A. Gifford and M.M. Ball, 1980}}

As noted below, these observations are disputed by other investigators. For  example, some investigators state that where [[sand]] had washed away between the seams, another course of blocks can be seen along with small blocks underlying these blocks. However, detailed evidence that clearly documents the alleged presence of a continuous second layer (course) of stones beneath the stones forming the currently exposed "pavement" has not yet been published in a reputable, scientific venue with the detail that is needed for critical evaluation. Pictures posted on various Web pages of stones alleged to be artificial "wedge stones" and "prop stones" fail as convincing evidence for a second course of stones because they are typically smaller in size, do not form a continuous course, and too infrequently lie directly beneath the blocks that form the surface of the Bimini Road. This is not what would be expected of an actual underlying course of man-made masonry.

David Zink&lt;ref name="Zink1978a"&gt;Zink, David, 1978, ''The Stones of Atlantis.'' Prentice Hall Trade. {{ISBN|0-13-846923-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:

{{quote|Most of the blocks were now clearly resting on either the underlying bedrock or on smaller stones on the sea floor.|David Zink}}

This led him to conclude:

{{quote|...this fact had an important archaeological consequence: it meant that the idea (held by some Atlantologists) that the blocks now visible were only the top of a more complex structure was likely incorrect.}}

In addition, early studies of the Bimini Road, i.e. Gifford and Ball&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"/&gt; and David Zink,&lt;ref name="Zink1978a"/&gt; report taking numerous samples and cores for examination. It is also safe to presume that a certain number of the innumerable visitors to the Bimini Road have chipped off pieces of it. Scientific sampling and souvenir hunting would have left behind modern "tool marks" on the various blocks composing the Bimini Road for later investigators to find.

==Age of the Bimini Road==
Attempts have been made to determine the age of this feature using different techniques. These include direct [[radiocarbon dating]] of the stones composing the Bimini Road and [[Uranium-thorium dating]] of the marine limestone on which the Bimini Road lies.

In 1978, the radiocarbon laboratory operated by the Department of Geology at the University of Miami dated samples from a core collected by E. A. Shinn in 1977 from the Bimini Road. In 1979, Calvert and others&lt;ref name="CalvertOther1979"&gt;Calvert, P.M., D.S. Introne, J.J. Stipp, 1979, ''University of Miami radiocarbon dates XIV. Radiocarbon.'' v. 21, no. 1, pp. 107-112.&lt;/ref&gt; reported dates of 2780±70 {{chem|14|C}} yr BP (UM-1359),&lt;ref&gt;''(UM-XXXX)'' refers to University of Miami radiocarbon sample no. ''XXXX''. See Calvert et al. (1979) for the details about specific sample&lt;/ref&gt; 3500±80 {{chem|14|C}} yr BP (UM-1360), and 3350±90 {{chem|14|C}} yr BP (UM-1361) from whole-rock samples; a date of 3510±70 {{chem|14|C}} yr BP (UM-1362), from shells extracted from the beachrock core; and dates of 2770±80 {{chem|14|C}} yr BP (UM-1364) and 2840±70 {{chem|14|C}} yr BP (UM-1365) from carbonate cementing the beachrock core. These dates are temporally consistent in that the shells composing the beachrock core from the Bimini Road dated older than the cement holding them together as beachrock. These dates can be interpreted as indicating that the shells composing the Bimini Road are, uncorrected for temporal and environmental variations in radiocarbon, about 3,500 years old. Because of time-averaging and other taphonomic factors, a random collection of shells likely would yield a radiocarbon date that is a few hundred years earlier than when the final accumulation of shells, which were cemented to form beachrock, actually occurred.&lt;ref name="KidwellOther1979"&gt;Kidwell, S.M., M.M.R. Best, and D.S. Kaufman, 2005, ''Taphonomic trade-offs in tropical marine death assemblages: Differential time averaging, shell loss, and probable bias in siliciclastic vs. carbonate facies.'' Geology. September 2005; v. 33; no. 9; p. 729-732.&lt;/ref&gt; The radiocarbon dates from the cement demonstrate that the beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed about 2,800 radiocarbon years ago by the cementation of pre-existing sediments that accumulated about 1,300 years earlier. Compared to the dates from the shells and the cement, it appears that the whole-rock dates reflect samples containing varying proportions of shell and cement without any significant contamination by younger radiocarbon. Both these dates and interpretation are consistent with the detailed research by Davaud and Strasser&lt;ref name="DavaudOther1984"&gt;Davaud, E., and A. Strasser, 1984, ''Progradation, cimentation, érosion: évolution sédimentaire et diagénétique récente d'un littoral carbonate (Bimini, Bahamas).'' (Translated title: ''Progradation, Cementation, Erosion; Recent Diagenetic and Sedimentary Evolution in a Carbonate Coastal Environment, Bimini, Bahamas.'') Eclogae Geologicae Helvetiae. v. 77, no.3, p. 449-468.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StrasserOther1984"&gt;Strasser, A., and E. Davaud, 1986, ''Formation of Holocene limestone sequences by progradation, cementation, and erosion; two examples from the Bahamas.'' Journal of Sedimentary Research. v. 56, no. 3, pp. 422-428.&lt;/ref&gt; that concluded that the layer of beachrock composing the Bimini Road formed beneath the surface of North Bimini Island and was only exposed by coastal erosion about 1,900 to 2,000 years ago.

Proponents of the Bimini Road being a manmade feature argue that these radiocarbon dates are invalid because they were obtained entirely from whole-rock samples and subject to contamination from younger carbon. The background data reported by Calvert and others&lt;ref name="CalvertOther1979"/&gt; concerning the radiocarbon dates from the Bimini Road demonstrate that not all of these dates come entirely from whole-rock samples. That the dates from the shells and the clearly younger cement holding them together as beachrock are temporally consistent argues against any signification alteration of their radiocarbon content. In addition, other studies using radiocarbon dating to study sea level and the age of sediment and beachrock within the Bahamas have not reported any significant problems with contamination by younger radiocarbon.&lt;ref name="BourrouilhLeJan2007"&gt;Bourrouilh-Le Jan, F.G., 2007, ''Very high energy sedimentation (supratidal hurricane deposits) and Mid-Holocene highstand on carbonate platforms, Andros, Bahamas: An alternative view.'' Sedimentary Geology. vol. 199, no. 1-2, pp. 29-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In their detailed research, Davaud and Strasser&lt;ref name="DavaudOther1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StrasserOther1984"/&gt; accepted the radiocarbon dates obtained from the beachrock composing the Bimini Road from the radiocarbon laboratory at the University of Miami as valid indicators of its age.

Gifford and Ball&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"/&gt; attempted to establish a minimum age using uranium-thorium dating for the Bimini Road by dating a whole-rock sample of the marine limestone (biopelsparite)&lt;ref name="DavaudOther1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="biopelsparite"&gt;A biopelsparite is a limestone with a ratio of fossils and fossil fragments to pellets between 3:1 and 1:3 and lacking a mud matrix. If it consists largely of fossils and fossil fragments and lacks a mud matrix, a limestone is called a "biosparite".&lt;/ref&gt; that underlies the beachrock that composes the Bimini Road. They described this sample as being "Whole rock marine limestone under beachrock off Paradise Point, North Bimini; some recrystallisation." This sample yielded a uranium-thorium date of 14,992±258 BP (7132-19/2). Supporters&lt;ref name="Little2004a"&gt;Little, G., 2004, [http://www.mysterious-america.net/biminibeachrock.html ''More Adventures With Bimini Beachrock: Remarkable Blunders in a Purported Scholarly Report Debunking the Bimini Stones.''] Alternative Perceptions Magazine. no. 86 (December 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; of the idea that the Bimini Road is a man-made structure frequently cite this date in support of it being artificial.

The uranium-thorium date published by Gifford and Ball&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"/&gt; is regarded as an invalid and meaningless date for two reasons. First, the sample being partially recrystallised means that this limestone was not a closed system as required for a meaningful uranium-thorium date. As a result, this specific date is only an apparent date that completely lacks any scientific value for interpreting the age of marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road. Currently, specific species of corals and mollusks that can be demonstrated to lack any recrystallisation using petrographic and X-ray diffraction techniques are the preferred samples for dating. Any limestone sample that shows the least amount of recrystallisation is now regarded as incapable of yielding a scientifically valid date and not even worth an attempt at dating.&lt;ref name="Ku1976"&gt;Ku, T.L., 1976, ''The Uranium-Series Methods of Age Determination.'' Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences. v. 4, pp. 347-379.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwarcz1997"&gt;Schwarcz, H.P., 1997, ''Chapter 6: Uranium series dating'' in  R.E. Taylor and J.M. Aitken, eds., pp. 159-182. Chronometric Dating in Archaeology. Advances in Archaeological and Museum Science. v. 2. Plenum Press, New York, 395 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-306-45715-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it is well documented that about 15,000 calendar years ago, sea level in this region was between {{convert|95|and|100|m|abbr=off}} below present [[sea level]].&lt;ref name="BalsillieOthers2004"&gt;Balsillie, J.H., and J.F. Donoghue, 2004, ''High resolution sea-level history for the Gulf of Mexico since the last glacial maximum.'' Report of Investigation no. 103. Florida Geological Survey, Tallahassee, Florida. 65 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlanchonOthers1995"&gt;Blanchon, P., and J. Shaw, 1995, ''Reef drowning during the last deglaciation: Evidence for catastrophic sea-level rise and ice-sheet collapse.'' Geology. v. 23, no. 1, pp. 4–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbanks1989"&gt;Fairbanks, R.G., 1989, ''A 17,000-year glacio-eustatic sea-level record: influence of glacial melting rates on the Younger Dryas event and deep ocean circulation.'' Nature. v. 342, no. 6250, pp. 637–642.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the location from where Gifford and Ball collected the sample of limestone was between {{convert|90|and|95|m|abbr=off}} (295 and 312 feet) above sea level at the time indicated by the uranium-thorium date of 14,992±258 BP (7132-19/2). Therefore, it is physically impossible for the marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road to have accumulated around 15,000 BP. Thus, this uranium-thorium date is a meaningless, invalid date lacking any scientific significance. Because this date clearly lacks any scientific meaning, geologists and archaeologists rarely mention it in their discussions of the Bimini Road. The marine limestone underlying the Bimini Road dates to the [[Sangamonian Stage]], the last [[interglacial]], when sea level was last high enough for the marine sediments, now lithified into limestone, to have accumulated.&lt;ref name="CarewaOthers1995"&gt;Carewa, J.L., and J.E.

Kaufman, 2000, ''Whole-Rock Aminostratigraphy and Quaternary Sea-Level History of the Bahamas.'' Quaternary Research. v. 54, no. 2, pp. 163–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological explanation==
The consensus among geologists and archaeologists is that the Bimini Road is a natural feature composed of [[beachrock]] that orthogonal and other joints have broken up into rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks. The geologists and anthropologists who have personally studied the Bimini Road include Eugene Shinn&lt;ref name="Shinn2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinn2004"&gt;Shinn, E.A., 2004, [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/geologists_adventures_with_bimini_beachrock ''A Geologist's Adventures with Bimini Beachrock and Atlantis True Believers''] Skeptical Inquirer, v. 28, no. 1, pp. 38–44.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]]; Marshall McKusick.&lt;ref name="McKusick1979a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McKusickandShinn1980"&gt;McKusick, M., and E.A. Shinn, 1980, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v287/n5777/abs/287011a0.html ''Bahamian Atlantis reconsidered.''] Nature. v. 287, no. 5777, pp. 11 - 12.&lt;/ref&gt; an Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[University of Iowa]]; W. Harrison&lt;ref name="Harrison1971"&gt;Harrison, W., 1971, [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v230/n5292/abs/230287a0.html ''Atlantis undiscovered: Bimini, Bahamas.''] Nature. v. 287, no. 5777, pp. 11 - 12.&lt;/ref&gt; of Environmental Research Associates, Virginia, Beach Virginia; Mahlon M. Ball and J. A. Gifford&lt;ref name="GiffordBall1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford1973"&gt;Gifford, J.A., 1973, ''The Bimini 'cyclopean complex.'' International Journal of Nautical Archaeology and Underwater Exploration. v. 2, no. 1, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], University of Miami; and Eric Davaud&lt;ref name="DavaudOther1984"/&gt; and A. Strasser&lt;ref name="StrasserOther1984"/&gt; of the Department of Geology and Paleontology, [[University of Geneva]], Geneva, Switzerland. After either inspecting or studying the Bimini Road, they all concluded that it consists of naturally jointed beachrock. John A. Gifford, a professional geologist, spent a significant time studying the geology of the Bimini Islands for his University of Miami Master's thesis&lt;ref name="Gifford(1973a)"&gt;Gifford, J.A., 1973, ''A description of the geology of the Bimini Islands, Bahamas.'' Unpublished Master's thesis, University of Miami, Miami, Florida. 88 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; about the geology of the Bimini Islands. Calvert and others&lt;ref name="CalvertOther1979"/&gt; identified the samples that they dated from the Bimini Wall as being natural beachrock.

Detailed studies by E. Davaud and A. Strasser&lt;ref name="DavaudOther1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StrasserOther1984"/&gt; of Holocene limestones currently exposed on North Bimini and Joulter Cays (Bahamas) reveal the sequence of events likely responsible for creating beachrock pavements like the Bimini Road. First, a complete beach sequence of shallow subtidal, intertidal, and supratidal carbonate sediments accumulated as the shoreline of North Bimini built seaward during part of the Holocene. Once the deposition of these sediments built the North Bimini's shoreline seaward, freshwater cementation of the carbonate occurred at some depth, possibly even a metre or so below sea level, beneath the island's surface. This cementation created a band consisting of a thick primary layer of semilithified sediments and thinner discontinuous lenses and layers of similar semilithified sediments beneath it. Later, when erosion of the island's shoreline occurred, the band of semilithifed sediment was exposed within the intertidal zone and the semilithified sediments were cemented into beachrock. As the sediments underlying the eroding shoreline was eroded down to Pleistocene limestone, the beachrock broke into flat-lying, tabular, and rectangular, subrectangular, polygonal, and irregular blocks as observed for modern beaches within the Bahamas by E. Davaud and A. Strasser.&lt;ref name="DavaudOther1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StrasserOther1984"/&gt; Thinner layers of beachrock underlying the primary bed of beachrock were also broken up as the loose sediments enclosing them and the thicker primary bed were eroded. As the loose sediment was scoured out from under the blocks and other pieces of beachrock by so-called "scour and settling processes", they dropped downward for several meters until they rested directly on the erosion-resistant Pleistocene limestone as an erosional lag.&lt;ref name="McNinchOthers2001"&gt;McNinch, J.E., J.T.Wells, T.G. Drake, 2001, ''The fate of artifacts in an energetic, shallow-water environment: scour and burial at the wreck site of'' Queen Anne's Revenge. Southeastern Geology. v. 40, no. 1, pp. 19-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNinchOthers2006"&gt;McNinch, J.E., and J.T. Wells, 2006, ''Predicting the Fate of Artefacts in Energetic, Shallow Marine Environments: an Approach to Site Management.'' The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology. v. 35, no. 2, pp. 290–309.&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Shinn&lt;ref name="Shinn2009a"/&gt; discusses a similar, but not identical, process by which the Bimini Road could have been created.

The downward movement of large, solid objects by scour and settling processes has been documented by Jesse E. McNinch, John T. Wells, and other researchers.&lt;ref name="McNinchOthers2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNinchOthers2006"/&gt; They concluded that large, heavy objects could sink into the sea bottom by several meters without significant lateral movement as the result of scour and settling processes if an erosion-resistant layer of sediment was not encountered. In case of the beachrock blocks composing the Bimini Road and other pieces underlying it, the erosion-resistant layer that limited how far they were dropped downward by scour and settling processes is the Pleistocene limestone on which they now rest.

Finally, pieces of thinner layers or lenses of beachrock underlying the primary bed that was broken up and dropped downward to create the Bimini Road would be trapped beneath the blocks as they also were broken up and dropped by erosion. The trapping of these fragments of beachrock beneath the blocks composing the Bimini Road, as erosion removed loose sediments and dropped them on the surface of the Pleistocene limestone, would have created the so-called "prop" and "wedge" rocks and blocks alleged to be a "second course" of "masonry". Presuming that the blocks of beachrock forming the Bimini Road originally formed at some unknown depth below sea level and have been dropped by erosion by several metres, dating the age of the Bimini Road by its relation to past sea level would be a useless technique that would produce misleading results.

Natural pavements composed of stone blocks, which often are far more rectangular and consistent in size than the blocks composing the Bimini Road, created by orthogonal and other jointing within sedimentary rocks, including beachrock, are quite common and found throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Irna2006"&gt;Irna, 2006, [http://irna.lautre.net/Tout-ce-que-la-nature-ne-peut-pas,43.html ''Tout ce que la nature ne peut pas faire, II : pavements et dallages''], [http://www.irna.lautre.net/ Le site d'Irna]&lt;/ref&gt; They include a popular tourist attraction, the [[Tessellated pavement]] of [[Eaglehawk Neck, Tasmania]];&lt;ref name="Nature Conservation Branch2003"&gt;Nature Conservation Branch, 2003, [http://www.parks.tas.gov.au/file.aspx?id=7038 ''Geodiversity: Tasman Peninsula Landforms explained.''] Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania, Hobart, New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; jointed bedrock that has been completely misidentified as a man-made "Phoenician Fortress and Furnace" in [[Oklahoma]]; a "tiled pavement" reported from [[Battlement Mesa]] in western [[Colorado]];&lt;ref name="Harmon2005"&gt;Harmon, Gray, 2005, [http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/content/news/stories/2005/08/15/8_15_1A_tiled_floor_natural_WWW.html ''Ancient floor a work of nature, not nurture.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422160200/http://www.gjsentinel.com/news/content/news/stories/2005/08/15/8_15_1A_tiled_floor_natural_WWW.html |date=April 22, 2009 }} Grand Junction Sentinel, (August 15, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the tessellated pavement of the Bouddi Peninsula near [[Sydney]], [[Australia]];&lt;ref name="KillcareWagstaffeTrustInc2000"&gt;Killcare Wagstaffe Trust Inc., 2000, [http://www.adderley.net.au/geology/exhibition/04/04_03_09.html ''Tesselated Pavement on the Terrigal Formation.(Bouddi Peninsula)''] [http://www.adderley.net.au/geology/exhibition/toc.html Down to Earth - Geology Exhibition], Killcare Wagstaffe Trust Inc., Sydney, New south Wales, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arches National Park]] in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="GoogleEarth2008"&gt;Google Earth, 2008, [http://irna.lautre.net/IMG/jpg/JointedBedrockUtah2.jpg ''Tout ce que la nature ne peut pas faire, II : pavements et dallages''], [http://www.irna.lautre.net/ Le site d'Irna]&lt;/ref&gt; Natural beachrock pavements that are identical to the Bimini Road have been found eroding out of the east shore of Loggerhead Key of [[Dry Tortugas]] and submerged beneath {{convert|90|m|abbr=off}} of water at [[Pulley Ridge]] off the southwest coast of [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Shinn2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JarretOthers2005"&gt;Jarrett, B.D., A.C.

==Claims of a human origin==
Although it is generally considered to be a naturally occurring [[geological]] feature, as a result of the unusual arrangement and shape of the stones some believe that the formation is the remains of an ancient road, wall, or some other deliberately constructed feature.&lt;ref name="Little2007a"&gt;Little, G., 2007a, [http://www.mysterious-america.net/bermudatriangle0.html ''The ARE's Search For Atlantis—2007 Summary: Part One of Three.''] Alternative Perceptions Magazine. no. 114 (July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Little2007b"&gt;Little, G., 2007b, [http://www.mysterious-america.net/bimini2007.html ''The ARE's Search For Atlantis—2007 Summary: Part Two of Three: Discoveries at Bimini: Columns, Marble Building Ruins, and Possible Building Foundations in 100-Feet of Water.''] Alternative Perceptions Magazine. no. 115 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Little2007c"&gt;Little, G., 2007c, [http://www.mysterious-america.net/atlantisandros20.html A.R.E.'s Search For Atlantis Project——2007 Summary——Part 3 of 3: Explorations at Andros Discover Underwater Stone Wall——Origin &amp; Purpose of Wall is Unknown.] Alternative Perceptions Magazine. no. 116 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, articles&lt;ref name="Marx1969"&gt;Marx, R.

Marx]], a professional diver and visitor to the Bimini Road, argued that the Bimini Road is an artificial structure. In a 1971 Argosy article,&lt;ref name="Marx1971"/&gt; Robert Marx reported that Carl H. Holm, who was President (not "head geologist" as reported by Marx) of Global Oceanic, once a manager for North American Rockwell, a ship designer; and retired naval officer,&lt;ref name="Anonymous1971"&gt;Anonymous, 1971, ''Editorial advisor to Ocean Industry Carl H. Holm dies.'' Ocean Industry. v. 6, no. 6., p. 19 (June 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; stated that there was "little doubt" that the massive stone blocks were cut by people. The same article noted that he was part of an expedition sponsored by North American Rockwell that included [[Edgar Mitchell]], the astronaut, as leader; Dimitri Rebikoff; and "a number of psychics from the [[Edgar Cayce]] Foundation."&lt;ref name="Marx1971"/&gt;

Others who consider the Bimini undersea formation to be man-made, as opposed to natural beachrock, are Joseph Manson Valentine, zoologist;&lt;ref name="Valentine1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine1973"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine1976"/&gt; [[Charles Berlitz]], linguist;&lt;ref&gt;Berlitz, Charles, 1984, ''Atlantis: the Eighth Continent.''

However, multiple layers of block can result naturally from systematic fracturing of sedimentary rock where multiple layers of sedimentary rock lie on top of each, as can be observed in the case of the tessellated pavement of Tasmania exposed at [[Eaglehawk Neck, Tasmania|Eaglehawk Neck]] on the Tasman Peninsula.&lt;ref name="SLTa1"&gt;Anonymous, 2009, [http://catalogue.statelibrary.tas.gov.au/item/?q=Eaglehawk+Neck+tesselated+pavements+collection+of+postcards&amp;i=1&amp;id=708012 ''Eaglehawk Neck tesselated pavements: collection of postcards.''], no. 2, State Library of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Menzies, half of the fleet, under the command of admiral Zhou Wen, was caught in a hurricane near Bimini and built the Bimini Road from beach rock and the ships' ballast as a slipway to haul damaged junks ashore for refitting and repairs of damage caused by the hurricane.

===Sci Fi Channel presentation===
[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi]]'s ''Quest for [[Atlantis]]: Startling New Secrets''&lt;ref name="ScifiChannel2006a"&gt;Scifi Channel, 2006, [http://www.scifi.com/questforatlantis/ ''Quest for Atlantis''] aired July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; followed several different groups researching possible locations for the legendary Atlantis, one of which focused on the Bimini Road. Greg Little led a team of researchers on a dive to recover objects at Bimini Bay. Little and his team reported the discovery of an entire second layer of square-cut rocks with similar dimensions beneath the stones of the Bimini Road.&lt;ref name="Little2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Little2007b"/&gt; However, they have yet to formally publish in any detail the evidence and observations that demonstrate the presence of this underlying layer and the square-cut nature of its blocks. As a result, its existence remains unproven. Little believes that his discovery suggests that the Bimini Road may actually be one part of an entire wall or water [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]. He has also published an informal critique&lt;ref name="Little2004a"/&gt; of Shinn's&lt;ref name="Shinn2004"/&gt; ''Skeptical Inquirer'' article. The Bimini Road was also discussed in season 1, episode 10 of the TV series ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search Of]]'', as well as season 4, episode 22 of the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] channel's TV series ''[[Ancient Aliens]]''.

'''''Buddhist Studies Review''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox]] on behalf of the [[UK Association for Buddhist Studies]]. It was founded in 1983 by [[Russell Webb (academic)|Russell Webb]] and [[Sara Boin-Webb]]. The UK Association for Buddhist Studies was established in 1996 and took over publication of ''Buddhist Studies Review'' two years later. The journal publishes articles on any aspect of [[Buddhism]]. It covers the different cultural areas where Buddhism exists or has existed (in Central, East, South, and Southeast [[Asia]]), historical and contemporary aspects (including developments in "Western" Buddhism), theoretical, practical and methodological issues, textual, linguistic, archaeological and art-historical studies, and different disciplinary approaches to the subject (e.g. [[archaeology]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[Asian studies]], [[comparative religion]], [[law]], [[oriental studies]], [[philosophy]], [[philology]], [[psychology]], [[religious studies]], and [[theology]]).

[[File:1916_Marcel_S%C5%82odki_Cabaret-Voltaire.jpg|thumb|Poster for the opening of the Cabaret Voltaire on 1916-02-05, lithograph by Marcel Slodki.]]
'''Cabaret Voltaire''' was the name of an artistic nightclub in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. It was founded by [[Hugo Ball]], with his companion [[Emmy Hennings]], in the back room of Holländische Meierei, Spiegelgasse 1, on February 5, 1916, as a [[cabaret]] for artistic and political purposes. Other founding members were [[Marcel Janco]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Tristan Tzara]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]] and [[Jean Arp]]. Events at the cabaret proved pivotal in the founding of the anarchic art movement known as [[Dada]].
It closed in the summer of 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160719-cabaret-voltaire-a-night-out-at-historys-wildest-nightclub|title=Cabaret Voltaire: A night out at history's wildest nightclub|last=Sooke|first=Alastair|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hugo Ball Cabaret Voltaire.jpg|thumb|[[Hugo Ball]] performing at Cabaret Voltaire in 1916|246x246px]]
Switzerland was a [[neutral country]] during [[World War I]] and among the many refugees coming to Zürich were artists from all over Europe. Ball and Hennings approached Ephraim Jan, patron of the ''Holländische Meierei'' at Spiegelgasse 1, which had already hosted Zürich's first literary cabaret, the ''Pantagruel'' in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Huonker | first=Gustav | title=Literaturszene Zürich: Menschen, Geschichten und Bilder 1914 bis 1945 | publisher=Unionsverlag | year=1986 | location=Zürich | pages=12 | isbn=3-293-00095-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan permitted them to use the back room for events. The press release on 2 February 1916 announcing the opening of the club reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Cabaret Voltaire. Under this name a group of young artists and writers has formed with the object of becoming a center for artistic entertainment. In principle, the Cabaret will be run by artists, permanent guests, who, following their daily reunions, will give musical or literary performances. Young Zürich artists, of all tendencies, are invited to join us with suggestions and proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dada-companion.com/cabaret/ Cabaret Voltaire], Dada Companion, quoting Hugo Ball, ''La fuite hors du temps'' ([1946], 1993) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cabaret featured [[spoken word]], dance and music. The soirees were often raucous events with artists experimenting with new forms of performance, such as [[sound poetry]] and simultaneous poetry. Mirroring the maelstrom of World War I raging around it, the art it exhibited was often chaotic and brutal. On at least one occasion, the audience attacked the cabaret's stage. Though the cabaret was to be the birthplace of the Dadaist movement, it featured artists from every sector of the avant-garde, including Futurism's [[Marinetti]]. The cabaret exhibited radically experimental artists, many of whom went on to change the face of their artistic disciplines; featured artists included [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], and [[Max Ernst]].

On July 28, 1916, Ball read out the ''[[Dada Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dada Manifesto (1916, Hugo Ball)|''Dada Manifesto'']]&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Ball had also published a journal with the same name. It featured work from artists such as the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and had a cover designed by Arp.

The cabaret closed down in the summer of 1916.

While the Dada movement was just beginning, by 1917 the excitement generated by the cabaret Voltaire had fizzled out and the artists moved on to other places in Zürich such as the Galerie Dada at Bahnhofstrasse 19, then later Paris and Berlin.

In recent years, the building which had housed Cabaret Voltaire in 1916 fell into disrepair, and in the winter of 2001/2002 a group of artists describing themselves as neo-Dadaists, organised by [[Mark Divo]], illegally occupied the building to protest its planned closure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/2523-a-work-in-process.html 2002 occupation by neo-Dadaists]&lt;/ref&gt; They declared that it was a signal for a new generation of artists to align themselves with a revival of [[Dada]].

Over a period of three months there were a number of performances, parties, poetry evenings and film nights. Among the participating artists were [[Ingo Giezendanner]], [[Lennie Lee]], [[Leumund Cult]], Mickry3, xeno volcano, elektra sturmschnell, Aiana Calugar, and Dan Jones. The building was decorated on the outside as well as the inside. Thousands of people from around Zürich took part in the experiment. On April 2, 2002 police evicted the occupants.

A new cabaret has since opened in the building, with an extensive programme of events such as, ''Hugo Ball: Fuga saeculi,'' in 2008, curated by [[Bazon Brock]] and included a performance of Gabriella Daris' corporeal poem ''LopLop: WORD or WOman biRD'' (an homage to [[Max Ernst]]'s namesake collage from 1921)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.criticalcostume.com/docs/Critical_Costume_2015_New_Costume_Practi.pdf|title=Critical Costume: New Costume Practices and Performances|last=|first=|publisher=Aalto University publications series|year=2015|isbn=978-952-60-6131-3|location=Helsinki|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wernernekes.de/00_cms/cms/front_content.php?idart=500|title=Woman Bird|website=wernernekes.de|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a film projection by [[Werner Nekes]]'','' and the Summer 2008 exhibition ''Dreamachine: David Woodard, Sheela Birnstiel, Christian Kracht.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabaretvoltaire.ch/de/haus/archiv/archiveintrag/dreamachine-david-woodard-sheila-birnstiel-christian-kracht-2008.html ''Dreamachine: David Woodard, Sheela Birnstiel, Christian Kracht''], May 2 - August 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paunić, N., [http://www.widewalls.ch/cabaret-voltaire-zurich-seeking-13-million-dollars/ Cabaret Voltaire Securing its Future], Widewalls, February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabaretvoltaire.ch/haus.html Current usage of the building] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays The Cabaret Voltaire adopts personalities and celebrates them as Dadaists such as [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Tatsuo Okada]] or [[Mikhail Bakunin|Mikaijl Bakunin]]. They also sponsored the restoration of Bakunin's grave plate in the Bremgarten cemetery in Berne, adding a portrait by Swiss artist [[Daniel Garbade]] and Bakunin's quote: "By striving to do the impossible, man has always achieved what is possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/diverses/Geburtstagsparty-auf-dem-Friedhof/story/20719536|title=Geburtstagsparty auf dem Friedhof|last=|first=|date=2014-05-30|work=|access-date=2016-11-17|via=Tages Anzeiger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18596">'''Child integration''' is the inclusion of [[children]] in a variety of mature daily activities of families and communities. This contrasts with, for example, [[age segregation]]; separating children into age-defined activities and institutions (e.g., some models of organized schooling). Integrating children in the range of mature family and community activities gives equal value and responsibility to children as contributors and collaborators, and can be a way to help them learn. Children's integration provides a learning environment because children are able to observe and pitch in as they feel they can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paradise|first1=Ruth|last2=Rogoff|first2=Barbara|title=Side by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|volume=37|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, child integration into "[[adult]]" life is not as common as it used to be. However, in other cultures social norms continue to incorporate children into the mature, productive activities of the family and community. In all cultures child integration is present in one way or another. For example,  nearly all children's first language learning seems to be supported through integration with a mature linguistic community. Children usually are not taught in a classroom how to speak, but instead [[Observational learning|learn by observing]] the language and pitching it when they can.

== Examples of children in collaborative communities ==

Children in Indigenous communities participate in mature activities with the guidance from someone who has practice in that activity. When engaged in shared endeavors the guider and the learner both notice and assess how much understanding the learner has in the task and the guider provides support if it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|last3=Arauz|first3=Rebeca|last4=Correa-Chavez|first4=Maricela|last5=Angelillo|first5=Cathy|title=Firsthand learning through intent participation|journal=Analise Psicologia|date=2004|volume=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous cultures emphasize and instill values of being respectful, empathic and cooperative to their children. These values are practiced through tasks like [[co-sleeping]] and group play which helps bring about close connections within the family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maschinot|first1=Beth|title=The changing face of the United States: The influence of culture on early child development.|date=2008|publisher=Zero to Three}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different ways children can be integrated into society. One example, child care educators in certain Native communities, like the [[First Nations]] in Canada have taught children traditional language, where then the children have the responsibility to spread that language knowledge by teaching their parents and other family members, thus ingratiating them into society with responsibility to carry on the language legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Jessica|last2=Simpkins|first2=Maureen|year=2004|title=The community within the Child: Integration of Indigenous Knowledge into First Nations Childcare Process and Practice|journal=The American Indian Quarterly|volume=28|page=480|doi=10.1353/aiq.2004.0091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chippewa]] people have several different methods of teaching, such as lecturing and counseling, and integrating children into adult and community life. Overall, the children do the same tasks as their mothers and fathers just on a smaller scale. For example, a young girl might learn to make nets like her mother and uses the same knots her mother uses but makes smaller nets than her mother. Throughout the years she will slowly make bigger and bigger nets and perfect the skill that her mother and her mother's mother before her had. These skills may be learned by observation and sometimes if a specific person in the community is very skillful at something, the adults might recommend the child go find that person and learn from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hilger|first1=Sister, M.I.|title=Chippewa child life and its cultural background|journal=Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology|date=1951|issue=Bulletin 146|pages=55–60, 114–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community endeavors ===
The integration of children into community and family endeavors in Indigenous American Communities begins as early as infancy. Among the [[Mayan peoples]] of the Yucatan peninsula, children are allowed to roam freely  allowing them ample opportunity to become acquainted with the mundane activities of the family. In the Mexican indigenous community of the Mazahua, children will coordinate their activities with those of their parents in a manner that allows them to cooperate in familial endeavors and may at times be granted a leading position in the endeavor. Children are considered to be valuable and responsible contributors of the community. The process of child integration into mature activities begins in infancy and continuous throughout time; between ages 3 and 4 the child will already be participating in some of the family's day to day activities, by ages 5 and 7 that child will already be cooperating in most of the endeavors that adults engage in and will have also earned several important responsibilities which can range from performing certain household tasks to providing childcare for younger siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|last3=Mejia Arauz|first3=Rebeca|last4=Correa-Chavez|first4=Maricela|last5=Angelillo|first5=Cathy|title=First Hand Learning Through Intent Participation|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2003|volume=54|issue=1|pages=175–203|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118|pmid=12499516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural practice of integrating children in the mature activities of the family and community is common in many [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]]. Many integrate children into "adult" activities, work life, and other cultural practices at a very young age. Among the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] people of the Andes, families accept the child as a part of an integral process towards a collective wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  Two-year-olds in the Chillihuani community frequently get their own food and drink, and those of herding families participate in herding and caring for the animals.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect: Child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press p. 43, 48&lt;/ref&gt; In this community, work and play are not two separable things (i.e., one for adult and one for children). The children enjoy having real responsibilities and find pride in being able to contribute to their society.

Similarly, some [[Chippewa]] communities of Washington also commonly integrate children in the mature activities of the community. Children are expected to observe and work with their parent to be able to [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|develop skills]] for that line of work. Young girls assist their mothers with beadwork, household chores, chopping wood, etc., and boys are expected to work on canoe-making with the men and are given arrows to learn hunting skills at 5 or 6 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Hilger, M. I. (1951). Chippewa child life and its cultural background. Washington: U.S. G.P.O.)p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily household activities provide the child the ability to learn cultural practices such as different food dishes, hygiene, and parenting skills, as well as the social values and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Zelizer, Viviana. 2005. Pricing the Priceless Child: The Changing Social Value of Children. New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaskins, Suzanne &amp; Ruth Paradise. 2010. Learning through Observation in Daily Life. In: David Lancy, John Bock &amp; Suzanne Gaskins (eds.), The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood. Lanham: Altamira Press, pp109.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for children in Indigenous American communities to learn through trial and error instead of explicit instruction. This is due to the cultural understanding of "echando a perder se enesena la gente" (throwing to lose, teaches people) which promotes optimism and growth of the child in the community, allowing the youth to feel comfortable making mistakes as long as they keep working towards their goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urrieta | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = Familia and Comunidad-Based Saberes: Learning in an Indigenous Heritage Community | url = | journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 320–335 | doi = 10.1111/aeq.12028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in the town of [[Tepoztlan]] are encouraged to participate in community activities. The people there believe that everyone can contribute something to community endeavors. Young children are encouraged to participate by being brought to various meetings and activities by their mothers, so as they grow older, they request to be admitted into the group on their own will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Percy-Smith|first1=Barry|last2=Thomas|first2=Nigel|title=A handbook of children and young people's  participation: Perspectives from theory and practice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-87107-3|pages=141–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political movements and civic life ===
Some Indigenous American communities can incorporate young children into the political activities of the community. Political violence and displacement within the community of San Agustin Loxicha, [[Oaxaca]] created an important aspect of child participation in the community's struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Anne-Marie | year = 2007 | title = The Children of Loxicha, Mexico: Exploring Ideas of Childhood and the Rules of Participation | url = | journal = Children, Youth and Environments | volume = 17 | issue = 2| page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this community, it is common for young children to take part in marches or sit-ins, hunger strikes, school life, child play, and accept the political part of their lives instead of seeing it as a hardship or something to be pitied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Anne-Marie | year = 2007 | title = The Children of Loxicha, Mexico: Exploring Ideas of Childhood and the Rules of Participation | url = | journal = Children, Youth and Environments | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 43–44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Nahua indigenous town of Tepoztlan located near Mexico City, children, adolescents, and older members of the community were involved in a 5-year long political movement against the construction of a golf course in their town. During assemblies children participated by aiding in the preparation of food and drinks for the crowd, while adolescents brought in groups of peers to further political involvement in the community. During marches and protest children and adolescents were active members of the civic movement. Any repression that the group suffered on behalf of the authorities was not seen as something negative in the experience of the youth, but was instead something that would further motivate their desire to be politically active. Through their integration into the political structure of the civil movement, the child's/adolescent's understanding of the issue expanded to such a degree that they would not only have physical presence in the group but would also be capable of offering new perspectives and potential solutions to the issue at hand. It is important to note that none of the children and adolescents involved were forced to do so. If a child showed an interest in the political movement they were encouraged by the adults to become participants but ultimately the choice was always left to them. Once a child decided to become involved the parents and other adults respected the pace and rhythm of that involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corona Caraveo|first1=Yolanda|title=Todos Como Uno: la participación infantil en comunidades de tradicion indigena|journal=III Conferencia de la Red Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Childwatch International|date=2006|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language brokering ===
In some immigrant communities, children link their family and friends to the environment around them by translating and paraphrasing words, phrases or occurring situations.&lt;ref&gt;Orellana, Marjorie, F. &amp; Reynolds, Jennifer &amp; Meza Marie (January/February/March 2003) "In other words: Translating or para-phrasing as a family literacy practice in immigrant households", Reading Research Quarterly 38, 12-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is known as [[Generation Gap|language brokering]] and is used by children in immigrant communities to integrate themselves into family endeavors and into [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Elaine (2010) "Language brokering: Practicing active citizenship", mediazioni 10, http://mediazioni.sitlec.unibo.it, ISSN 1974-4382&lt;/ref&gt; The child's contribution by language brokering integrates them into many environments, such as the doctor's office, at parent-teachers' conferences, banks, housing offices, and various sorts of negotiation activities. Subsequently, children who engage in language brokering are more likely to also be representatives of their community when transitioning into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Elaine (2010) "Language brokering: Practicing active citizenship", mediazioni 10, http://mediazioni.sitlec.unibo.it, ISSN 1974-4382&lt;/ref&gt; Child integration has become very important to form linkages between new immigrant communities and the predominant culture and new forms of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic systems]].

With the increased interaction in larger societies children in Indigenous Mayan communities who are bilingual help monolingual parents as interpreters. For example, the children will translate for parents when selling products in the barrios of Cancun, where the primary language is Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaskins|first1=Suzanne|title=From corn to cash: Change and continuity within Mayan families|journal=Ethos|date=2003|volume=31|issue=2|page=248|doi=10.1525/eth.2003.31.2.248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Productive endeavors ===
In some indigenous communities, children are often integrated as active participants into family and community work.  [[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]] is often a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non-exploitative motivations for children's engagement in work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=
Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|year=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some families, young children contribute to the family's finances by taking a job in a factory or a store under the supervision of a formal adult figure, while some join the family business under the oversight of their parents and older siblings. When children join the family business they tend to gain knowledge of a trade such as accounting, public relations and how to be able to time manage. Some children not only obtain an economic boost for the family as a whole, but also learn autonomy and [[Prosocial behavior|altruism]] with regards to having their own earned income to support the family and also to spend for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Salazar, M. (1991). Young workers in Latin America: protection or self-determination?. Child Welfare, 70269-283.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's motivation as integrated contributors ==
Children in Indigenous American communities pitch in to community endeavors because they experience their contribution having a tangible effect on their community. The children often contribute without being told and children get to learn how to do the activity as they contribute. However, children aren't just born with this way of learning by observation; they have been given the opportunity by being encouraged to attend, observing, and participating in mature activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppens |title=Benefits and processes of expanding repertoires|journal=Human Development|date=June 2014|volume=57|issue=2–3|pages=150–161|doi=10.1159/000356770|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In indigenous communities, children's and adult's interests in participation must be viewed as equal, not just the adults forcing their views onto the children. Children are seen as a part of community just as much as adults. In many cultures, children are expected to take on tasks that are important to community. Children are also seen as integral members of the community, rather than separate from adults. Some cultures even give children control over specific goods, such as livestock or [[arable land]] and the expectations that come with this may also be seen as forms of participation. These ideas of children actively participating in their communities and influencing the society opens up opportunities for the participation of children &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Percy-Smith|first1=Barry|last2=Thomas|first2=Nigel|title=A handbook of children and young people's  participation: Perspectives from theory and practice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-87107-3|pages=141–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of age segregation in the West ==
Segregating children by age was not always the norm in the United States. A century and a half ago, children in the US had access to a wide range of adult activities and were integrated into multiple aspects of family functioning and survival. The change from this integration into segregation was a product of [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]], Western formal schooling, [[child labor]] laws, social services agencies, and the rise of disciplines such as Psychology and Education. A combination of the above caused a shift from family working as a unit to separation of economic activities and services such as childcare emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Glida | first2 = M. | last3 = Chavajay | first3 = P. | year = 2010 | title = Children's Integration in Communities and Segregation From People of Differing Ages | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 431–440 | doi=10.1177/1745691610375558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christmas]] is a Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ held annually on 25 December.  Its celebration has come under both [[secular]] and [[religious]] attack since its earliest days.

In the 17th century, the [[Puritans]] had laws forbidding the celebration of Christmas, unlike the [[Catholic Church]] or the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]], the latter from which they separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lowe |first1= Scott C. |title= Christmas |year= 2011 |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn= 1444341456 |quote= On the mainland, seventeenth-century Puritan New England had laws forbidding the observance of Christmas.

In white-knuckled terror behind closed doors. Anti-clericalism reached its apex on 10 November 1793, when a Fête de la Raison was held in honor of the Cult of Reason. Churches across France were renamed "Temples of Reason" and the Notre Dame was "de-baptized" for the occasion. The Commune spared no expense: "The first festival of reason, which took place in Notre Dame, featured a fabricated mountain, with a temple of philosophy at its summit and a script borrowed from an opera libretto. At the sound of Marie-Joseph Chénier‘s Hymne à la Liberté, two rows of young women, dressed in white, descended the mountain, crossing each other before the ‘altar of reason’ before ascending once more to greet the goddess of Liberty." As you can probably gather from the above description, 1793 was not a great time to celebrate Christmas in the capital.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101103908/http://historybuff.com/christmas-renamed-dog-day-french-revolution/|archive-date=1 November 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the 20th century, Christmas celebrations were prohibited under the doctrine of [[state atheism]] in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Connelly2000"&gt;{{cite book |last= Connelly |first= Mark |title= Christmas at the Movies: Images of Christmas in American, British and European Cinema |year= 2000 |publisher= I.B.Tauris |isbn= 9781860643972 |page= 186 |quote= A chapter on representations of ''Christmas'' in Soviet cinema could, in fact be the shortest in this collection: suffice it to say that there were, at least officially, no Christmas celebrations in the atheist socialist state after its foundation in 1917.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-07/news/mn-5892_1_russian-christmas-traditions |title= A Russian Christmas—Better Late Than Never :  Soviet Union: Orthodox Church Celebration Is the First Under Communists.

The Christian [[Council of Tours]] of 567 established [[Advent]] as the season of preparation for Christmas, as well as the season of [[Christmastide]], declaring "the [[Twelve Days of Christmas|twelve days]] between Christmas and Epiphany to be one unified festal cycle", thus giving significance to both December 25 and January 6, a solution that would "coordinate the solar Julian calendar with the lunar calendars of its provinces in the east".&lt;ref name="2008Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Bruce David|title=Christmas: A Candid History|date=1 October 2008|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520258020|page=27|quote=In 567 the Council of Tours proclaimed that the entire period between Christmas and Epiphany should be considered part of the celebration, creating what became known as the twelve days of Christmas, or what the English called Christmastide.

If Christmas Day is the first of the twelve days, then Twelfth Night would be on January 5, the eve of Epiphany. If December 26, the day after Christmas, is the first day, then Twelfth Night falls on January 6, the evening of Epiphany itself. After Christmas and Epiphany were in place, on December 25 and January 6, with the twelve days of Christmas in between, Christians gradually added a period called Advent, as a time of spiritual preparation leading up to Christmas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hynes1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hynes|first=Mary Ellen|title=Companion to the Calendar|year=1993|publisher=Liturgy Training Publications|isbn=9781568540115|page=8|quote=In the year 567 the church council of Tours called the 13 days between December 25 and January 6 a festival season.

While the Romans could roughly match the months in the two systems, the four cardinal points of the solar year--the two equinoxes and solstices--still fell on different dates. By the time of the first century, the calendar date of the winter solstice in Egypt and Palestine was eleven to twelve days later than the date in Rome. As a result the Incarnation came to be celebrated on different days in different parts of the Empire. The Western Church, in its desire to be universal, eventually took them both--one became Christmas, one Epiphany--with a resulting twelve days in between. Over time this hiatus became invested with specific Christian meaning. The Church gradually filled these days with saints, some connected to the birth narratives in Gospels (Holy Innocents' Day, December 28, in honor of the infants slaughtered by Herod; St. John the Evangelist, "the Beloved," December 27; St. Stephen, the first Christian martyr, December 26; the Holy Family, December 31; the Virgin Mary, January 1).

In Christian belief, the teaching that [[God the Son|God]] came into the world in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|form of man]] to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for the [[sin]]s of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas; the exact date of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth is considered a non-issue.&lt;ref name="Joan Chittister, Phyllis Tickle"&gt;{{cite book| title = The Liturgical Year|publisher = [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]|quote=Christmas is not really about the celebration of a birth date at all.

The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus.

During the winter, the burning of logs was a common practice among many cultures across Northern Europe.

===19th century===
With the appearance of the [[Oxford Movement]] in the [[Anglican Church]], a revival in the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with [[Christmastide]]  occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton]] ''Stations of the Sun: The Ritual Year in England''. 1996. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 113. {{ISBN|0-19-285448-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This ushered in "the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival" as well as "special charities for the poor" in addition to "special services and musical events".&lt;ref name="Rowel1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowell|first=Geoffrey|date=December 1993|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=43|issue=12|quote=There is no doubt that A Christmas Carol is first and foremost a story concerned with the Christian gospel of liberation by the grace of God, and with incarnational religion which refuses to drive a wedge between the world of spirit and the world of matter. Both the Christmas dinners and the Christmas dinner-carriers are blessed; the cornucopia of Christmas food and feasting reflects both the goodness of creation and the joy of heaven. It is a significant sign of a shift in theological emphasis in the nineteenth century from a stress on the Atonement to a stress on the Incarnation, a stress which found outward and visible form in the sacramentalism of the Oxford Movement, the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival. ... In the course of the century, under the influence of the Oxford Movement’s concern for the better observance of Christian festivals, Christmas became more and more prominent. By the later part of the century cathedrals provided special services and musical events, and might have revived ancient special charities for the poor – though we must not forget the problems for large: parish-church cathedrals like Manchester, which on one Christmas Day had no less than eighty couples coming to be married (the signing of the registers lasted until four in the afternoon). The popularity of Dickens' A Christmas Carol played a significant part in the changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated. The popularity of his public readings of the story is an indication of how much it resonated with the contemporary mood, and contributed to the increasing place of the Christmas celebration in both secular and religious ways that was firmly established by the end of the nineteenth century.|accessdate=28 December 2016|language=English|url=http://www.historytoday.com/geoffrey-rowell/dickens-and-construction-christmas|title=Dickens and the Construction of Christmas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ronald Hutton]] believes that the current state of observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] revival of the holiday, spearheaded by [[Charles Dickens]], who "linked worship and feasting, within a context of social reconciliation".&lt;ref name="Hutton2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain|date=15 February 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English |isbn=9780191578427|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens was not the first author to celebrate Christmastide in literature, but it was he who superimposed his humanitarian vision of the holiday upon the public, an idea that has been termed as Dickens' "Carol Philosophy".&lt;ref name="Forbes2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Bruce David|title=Christmas: A Candid History|date=1 October 2008|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=9780520258020|page=62|quote=What Dickens ''did'' advocate in his story was "the spirit of Christmas." Sociologist James Barnett has described it as Dickens's "Carol Philosophy," which "combined religious and secular attitudes toward to celebration into a humanitarian pattern. It excoriated individual selfishness and extolled the virtues of brotherhood, kindness, and generosity at Christmas. . . .Dickens preached that at Christmas men should forget self and think of others, especially the poor and the unfortunate." The message was one that both religious and secular people could endorse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Stephen Nissenbaum contends that the modern celebration in the United States was developed in New York State from defunct and imagined Dutch and English traditions in order to refocus the holiday from one where groups of young men went from house to house demanding alcohol and food into one centered on the happiness of children. He notes that there was a deliberate effort to prevent children from becoming greedy in response.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |first= Stephen |last= Nissenbaum |year= 1997 |title= The Battle for Christmas |location= New York |publisher= Vintage Books |page= |isbn= 0-679-74038-4}}{{page needed|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas was not proclaimed a holiday by the [[United States Congress]] until 1870.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Christian writers such as [[C. S. Lewis]] noted what he saw as a distinct split between the religious and commercialized observance of Christmas, the latter of which he deplored.&lt;ref name="LeDonne2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeDonne |first1=Anthony |title=Near Christianity |date=2016 |publisher=Zondervan |isbn=9780310522973 |language=English|quote=C.S. Lewis wrote of his revulsion for the commercialization of "Xmas" in several personal letters. Once, when asked about his view on the holiday, he wrote ... 'One is a religious festival. This is important and obligatory for Christians; but as it can be of no interest to anyone else, I shall naturally say no more of it here. ... But the third thing called Christmas is unfortunately everyone's business. I mean of course the commercial racket'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Xmas and Christmas: A Lost Chapter from Herodotus'', Lewis gives a [[satire]] of the observance of two simultaneous holidays in "Niatirb" ("Britain" spelled backwards) from the supposed view of the [[ancient Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]] (484–425 BC).  One of the holidays, "Exmas", is observed by a flurry of compulsory commercial activity and expensive indulgence in alcoholic beverages. The other, "Crissmas", is observed in Niatirb's temples.  Lewis's narrator asks a [[priest]] why they kept Crissmas on the same day as Exmas. He receives the reply:
{{quote|"It is not lawful, O Stranger, for us to change the date of Crissmas, but would that Zeus would put it into the minds of the Niatirbians to keep Exmas at some other time or not to keep it at all. For Exmas and the Rush distract the minds even of the few from sacred things. And we indeed are glad that men should make merry at Crissmas; but in Exmas there is no merriment left." And when I asked him why they endured the Rush, he replied, "It is, O Stranger, a racket. . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~dunlapg/Xmas_and_Christmas.html |title= Exmas and Christmas: A Lost Chapter from Herodotus |first= C.

The Soviet Union (until 1936), and certain other [[Communist]] regimes, banned overtly religious Christmas observances in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of [[state atheism]].&lt;ref name="Harper1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harper |first1=Timothy |title=Moscow Madness: Crime, Corruption, and One Man's Pursuit of Profit in the New Russia |date=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780070267008 |page=72 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920s USSR, the [[League of Militant Atheists]] encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, such as the Christmas tree, and encouraged them to spit on [[crucifix]]es as protest against this holiday; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.&lt;ref name="Ramet2005"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ramet |first= Sabrina Petra |title= Religious Policy in the Soviet Union |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 9780521022309 |page= 138 |quote= The League sallied forth to save the day from this putative religious revival.

It recommended what Lenin and others earlier had explicitly condemned—carnivals, farces, and games to intimidate and purge the youth of religious belief. It suggested that pupils campaign against customs associated with Christmas (including Christmas trees) and Easter. Some schools, the League approvingly reported, staged an anti-religious day on the 31st of each month. Not teachers but the League's local set the programme for this special occasion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zugger2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Zugger |first= Christopher Lawrence |title= Catholics of the Soviet Empire from Lenin Through Stalin |year= 2001 |publisher= [[Syracuse University Press]] |isbn= 9780815606796 |page= 210 |quote= As observed by Nicholas Brianchaninov, writing in 1929–1930, after the NEP and just as the worst of collectivization was beginning, the Soviets deemed it necessary to drive into the heads of the people the axiom that religion was the synthesis of everything most harmful to humanity.

The young, always eager to be with the latest trend, often responded to such propaganda. In Moscow in 1929 children were brought to spit on the crucifixes at Christmas. Priests in Tiraspol diocese were sometimes betrayed by their own young parishioners, leading to their imprisonment and even death, and tearing their families apart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most customs traditionally associated with Christmas, such as decorated trees, presents, and [[Ded Moroz]] (Father Frost), were later reinstated in Soviet society, but tied to [[New Year's Day]] instead; this tradition remains as of the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lc.org/index.cfm?PID=14100&amp;PRID=1141 |title= Christmas According to Marx and Lenin, by Ronald Reagan |publisher= lc.org |date= 22 December 2011 |accessdate= 31 December 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should, however, be noted that most Russian Christians are of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] community, whose religious festivals (Christmas, Easter etc.) do not necessarily coincide precisely with those of the main western Christian churches (Catholic or Protestant), because of continued connection of the church calendar to the [[Julian calendar]].

Likewise, in [[Nazi Germany]], "because Nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize—or eliminate altogether—the Christian aspects of the holiday" and as a result "propagandists tirelessly promoted numerous Nazified Christmas songs, which replaced Christian themes with the regime's racial ideologies."&lt;ref name="Perry2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=How the Nazis co-opted Christmas: A history of propaganda|last=Perry|first=Joseph|date=24 December 2015|work=The Washington Post|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present-day controversy==
===United States===
The expression "the War on Christmas" has been used in the media to denote Christmas-related controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/12/18/war.on.christmas/index.html |publisher= [[CNN]] |title= Heated Debate Again over 'War on Christmas' Claims |first= Kristi |last= Keck |date= 18 December 2009 |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained notability due in part to its use by [[conservatism|conservative]] commentators such as [[Peter Brimelow]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] beginning in the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1868542,00.html |title= A Brief History of the War on Christmas |work= Time |last= Altman |first= Alex |date= 24 December 2008 |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/06/oreillys-war-on-christmas_n_141896.html |title= O'Reilly's War on Christmas Goes Retail |date= 7 December 2008 |first= Jason |last= Linkins |work= The Huffington Post |accessdate= 21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/religion/post/2008/12/60101216/1 |title= Mandatory 'Merry Christmas' Line May Lose Its Lilt |first= Lynn |last= Grossman |date= 18 December 2008 |work= USA Today |accessdate= 21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim of Brimelow, O'Reilly and others was that any specific mention of the term "Christmas" or its [[religious]] aspects was being increasingly [[censorship|censored]], avoided, or discouraged by a number of advertisers, retailers, government (prominently schools), and other public and secular organizations. In the United States and Canada, where the use of the term "Holidays" is most prevalent, opponents have denounced its usage and avoidance of using the term "Christmas" as being [[political correctness|politically correct]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

[[Jeff Schweitzer]], a commentator for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', addressed the position of commentators such as O'Reilly, stating that "There is no war on Christmas; the idea is absurd at every level. Those who object to being forced to celebrate another's religion are drowning in Christmas in a sea of Christianity dominating all aspects of social life. An 80 percent majority can claim victimhood only with an extraordinary flight from reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-schweitzer/a-war-on-reason-not-on-ch_b_6265932.html |title= A War on Reason, Not on Christmas |first= Jeff |last= Schweitzer |date= 3 December 2014 |work= The Huffington Post |accessdate= 12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heather Long, an American columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'', addressed the "politically correct" question in America over use of the term "holidays", writing, "people who are clearly celebrating Christmas in their homes tend to be conflicted about what to say in the workplace or at school. No one wants to offend anyone or make assumptions about people's religious beliefs, especially at work."&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

[[Christmas Day]] is recognized as an official [[federal holiday]] by the United States government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opm.gov/fedhol/2007.asp |title= 2007 Federal Holidays |publisher= [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] |accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] argues that government-funded displays of Christmas imagery and traditions violate the U.S. Constitution—specifically the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which prohibits the [[Establishment Clause|establishment]] by Congress of a [[State religion|national religion]]; on the other hand the [[Alliance Defending Freedom]], an organization promoting the principle of religious freedom, believes that Christmas displays are consistent with the First Amendment, as well as court rulings that have repeatedly upheld [[accommodationism]].&lt;ref name="Bowler2016"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Gerry |title=Christmas in the Crosshairs: Two Thousand Years of Denouncing and Defending the World's Most Celebrated Holiday |date=2016 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780190499013 |pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate over whether religious displays should be placed within [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], courthouses, and other government buildings has been heated in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Ostling |first= Richard |title=Have Yourself a Merry Little Lawsuit This Season |magazine= [[Buffalo Law Journal]] |date= 1 December 2005 |volume= 77 |issue= 96 |pages= 1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, popular aspects of Christmas, such as [[Christmas tree]]s, lights, and decorating are still prominently showcased, but are associated with unspecified "holidays" rather than with Christmas.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; The controversy also includes objections to policies that prohibit government or schools from forcing unwilling participants to take part in Christmas ceremonies. In other cases, the Christmas tree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= VA Bans Christmas Trees as Holiday Decorations in Public Areas |url= http://wspa.com/2015/11/20/va-bans-christmas-trees-as-holiday-decorations-in-public-areas/ |location= Spartanburg, SC |publisher= [[WSPA-TV]] |accessdate= 14 December 2015 |quote= Christmas trees will not be allowed at the Salem VA Medical Center this holiday season in public areas.

Supreme Court rulings, starting with ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'' in 1984, have permitted religious themes in government-funded Christmas displays that had "legitimate secular purposes". Since these rulings have been splintered and have left governments uncertain of their limits, many such displays have included secular elements such as reindeer, snowmen and elves along with the religious elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://au.org/church-state/december-2007-church-state/featured/is-there-a-%E2%80%98war-on-christmas%E2%80%99 |title= Is There a 'War on Christmas'? |first= Rob |last= Boston |date= December 2007 |publisher= [[Americans United]] |accessdate= 25 December 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150909203239/https://www.au.org/church-state/december-2007-church-state/featured/is-there-a-%E2%80%98war-on-christmas%E2%80%99 |archive-date= 9 September 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recent court cases have brought up additional issues such as the inclusion of [[Christmas carols]] in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] performances, but none of these cases have reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

A controversy regarding these issues arose in 2002, when the New York City public school system banned the display of [[Nativity scene]]s but allowed the display of less overtly religious symbols such as Christmas trees, Hanukkah menorahs, and the Muslim star and crescent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/11/nyregion/lawsuit-attacks-schools-ban-on-nativity-scenes.html |title= Lawsuit Attacks Schools' Ban on Nativity Scenes |first= Daniel |last= Wakin |date= 11 December 2002 |work= The New York Times |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school system successfully defended its policy in ''Skoros v.

====Retailer controversies====
Since at least 2005, religious conservative groups and media in the United States, such as the [[American Family Association]] (AFA) and [[Liberty Counsel]], have called for [[boycott]]s of various prominent secular organizations, particularly retail giants, demanding that they use the term "Christmas" rather, than solely "holiday" in their print, TV, online, and in-store marketing and advertising. This was also seen by some as containing a hidden anti-Jewish message. All of the major retailers named denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Cohen |first= Adam |title= Commercialize Christmas, or Else |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/07/opinion/07iht-edcohen.html?_r=0 |accessdate= 14 November 2012 |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 7 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Popper |first= Nathaniel |title= Boycotts Bloom as Religious Conservatives Wage Battle Over Christmas |url= http://forward.com/articles/1757/boycotts-bloom-as-religious-conservatives-wage-bat/#ixzz2CE0rcvy2 |accessdate= 14 November 2012 |newspaper= [[The Jewish Daily Forward]] |location= New York |date= 16 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Also in 2010, [[Wachovia Bank]] was briefly rumored to have banned Christmas trees from its local branches in favor of poinsettias. In response to complaints, the company affirmed that Christmas trees were permitted to be displayed and decorated by branch employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.christianpost.com/news/bank-allows-christmas-trees-in-branch-offices-47971/ |title= Wachovia Bank Allows Christmas Trees in Branch Offices |last= Samuel |first= Stephanie |newspaper= The Christian Post |date= 7 December 2010 |accessdate= 8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to NetEase, on the Christmas Day of 2014, a "Boycotting Christmas" campaign launched in downtown [[Changsha]], [[Hunan Province]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.163.com/photoview/00AP0001/81581.html#p=AEASMLPC00AP0001 |title= 长沙现大学生着汉服举标语"抵制圣诞节" |trans-title= |work= NetEase |publisher= CFP |date= 25 December 2014 |accessdate= 19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, [[Northwest University (China)|Northwest University]] closed the campus completely on the Christmas Eve, and all of the requests for leave were rejected by the school officials.
* In November 2015, the coffee shop chain [[Starbucks]] introduced Christmas-themed cups colored in solid red and containing no ornamentation besides the Starbucks logo, contrasting previous designs which featured winter-related imagery, and non-religious Christmas symbols such as [[reindeer]] and [[Christmas ornament|ornaments]]. On 5 November, a video was posted on [[Facebook]] by evangelist and self-proclaimed "[[Internet celebrity|social media personality]]" [[Joshua Feuerstein]], in which he accused Starbucks of "hating Jesus" by removing Christmas-oriented imagery from the cup, followed by him "tricking" a barista into writing "Merry Christmas" on the cup, and encouraging others to do the same. The video became a [[viral video]], spurring discussions and commentary: businessman and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 president-candidate]] (later elected) [[Donald Trump]] supported Feuerstein's claim by suggesting a boycott of Starbucks, stating that "If I become president, we're all going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' again."

===Canada===
In 2007, a controversy arose&lt;ref name="NationalPost" /&gt; when a public school in Ottawa, Ontario, planned to have the children in its primary choir sing a version of the song "Silver Bells" with the word "Christmas" replaced by "festive"; the concert also included the songs "Candles of Christmas" and "It's Christmas" with the original lyrics. In 2011, in Embrun, Ontario, near Ottawa, some parents were displeased when a school replaced the Christmas concert it had held in previous years with a craft sale and winter concert scheduled for February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/ontario-school-replaces-christmas-concert-with-non-denominational-february-fest |title= Parents' Anger as Ontario School Replaces Christmas Concert with Non-Denominational February Fest |work= National Post |first= Matthew |last= Pearson |date= 1 December 2011 |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom there have been some controversies, one of the most famous being the temporary promotion of the phrase [[Winterval]] for a whole season of events (including Christmas festivities) by Birmingham City Council in the late 1990s. This remains a controversial example of "Christmas controversy", with critics attacking the use of the word "Winterval" as being ''political correctness gone mad'', accusing council officials of trying to take the Christ out of Christmas.&lt;ref name="BBC Winterval"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/210672.stm |title= Winterval Gets Frosty Reception |date= 9 November 1998 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council responded to the criticism by stating that Christmas-related words and symbols were prominent in its publicity material: ''"...there was a banner saying Merry Christmas across the front of the council house, Christmas lights, Christmas trees in the main civil squares, regular carol-singing sessions by school choirs, and the Lord Mayor sent a Christmas card with a traditional Christmas scene wishing everyone a Merry Christmas"...''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/08/religion.communities |title= The Phoney War on Christmas |work= The Guardian |first= Oliver |last= Burkeman |date= 7 December 2006 |accessdate= 25 December 2012 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009 the city council of Dundee was accused of banning Christmas because it promoted its celebrations as the Winter Night Light festival, initially with no specific references to Christianity. Local church leaders were invited to participate in the event, and they did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= April |last= Mitchinson |url= http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1502592?UserKey= |title= Differences Set Aside for Winter Night Light Festival in Dundee |work= The Press and Journal |location= Aberdeen |date= 29 November 2009 |accessdate= 29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the changing religious landscape of the UK, Christmas cards featuring religious imagery, such as the [[Nativity scene]] or the Virgin and Child, have become less common in major retailers. However, they are still readily available from smaller shops, or those linked to church groups and charities. The [[Church of England]] complained in 2004 when religious images were removed from the annual tradition of special [[postage stamps]] around Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491954/Hark-herald-angels-years-Christmas-stamps.html |location= London |work= The Daily Mail |title= Hark, the Herald Angels Are Back on This Year's Christmas Stamps |date= 6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
The Christian holidays of [[Christmas Day]] and [[Good Friday]] remained in secular [[post-apartheid South Africa]]'s [[public holidays in South Africa|calendar of public holidays]]. The [[Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities]] (CRL Rights Commission), a [[chapter nine institution]] established in 2004, held countrywide consultative public hearings in June and July 2012 to assess the need for a review of public holidays following the receipt of complaints from minority groups about unfair discrimination. The CRL Rights Commission stated that they would submit their recommendations to the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]], the [[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]], various Portfolio Committees and the [[President of South Africa|Office of the Presidency]] by October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRL Rights Commission Continues with the Consultative Community Hearings on the Possible Review of Public Holidays |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=28605&amp;tid=73934 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310081324/http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&amp;sid=28605&amp;tid=73934 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 March 2013 |publisher=info.gov.za |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Fight over Religious Holidays |url= http://www.crlcommission.org.za/fightoverholidays.php |publisher= CRL Rights Commission |accessdate= 2 November 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141018121257/http://www.crlcommission.org.za/fightoverholidays.php |archivedate= 18 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hands off Christmas, Protesters Say |url= http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Hands-off-Christmas-protesters-say-20121110 |publisher= [[News24]] |date= 10 November 2012 |accessdate= 10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRL Rights Commission published its recommendations on 17 April 2013, including the scrapping of some existing public holidays to free up days for some non-Christian religious public holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Recommendations: Public Holidays vs Religious/Cultural Holydays |url= http://www.crlcommission.org.za/icr_docs/public_holidays_recomendations.pdf |publisher= CRL Rights Commission |accessdate= 23 April 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513085841/http://www.crlcommission.org.za/icr_docs/public_holidays_recomendations.pdf |archivedate= 13 May 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;!--Publication date per link to document from home page: "Investigation and Conflict Resolution Reports: The ICR Reports were launched on Wednesday 17 April 2013"--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Public Holidays Scrutinised |type= Video |url= http://www.enca.com/south-africa-life/your-public-holidays-religiuos |accessdate= 30 April 2013 |newspaper= eNCA |date= 29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The common practice of schoolchildren visiting local churches for Christmas services in December is opposed by the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]], the [[Children's Ombudsman]] and by the [[Union of Education Norway|Union of Education]].&lt;ref name=vl/&gt; There have been several local controversies over the issue. The political parties have mostly been in favor of this being decided by the schools themselves, but the government has underlined that schools who participate in Christmas services must offer an alternative for pupils who don’t want to attend and that services must not take place on the day that marks the closing of schools before the Christmas holiday. The [[Solberg's Cabinet]] says in its government declaration that it looks positively upon schools taking part in services in churches before religious holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dagen.no/2013/10/09/meninger/hoyre/kirkeasyl/siv_jensen/172635 |title= Skolegudstjenester og kirkeasyl] |work=Dagen |access-date= 12 December 2013 |language= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 poll by Norstat for ''[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]]'', 68% of Norwegians support having school-arranged Christmas servicess while 14% are opposed. 17% do not hold any opinion on the issue.&lt;ref name=vl&gt;{{cite news |first1= Turid |last1= Sylte |first2= Eirik |last2= Omvik |last-author-amp= yes |date= 12 December 2013 |url= http://www.vl.no/samfunn/7-av-10-vil-ha-skolegudstjenester/ |title= 7 av 10 vil ha skolegudstjenester |trans-title= 7 out of 10 will have school worship |work= [[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]] |access-date= 12 December 2013 |language= no |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20131212125639/http://www.vl.no/samfunn/7-av-10-vil-ha-skolegudstjenester/ |archivedate= 12 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
A school law in 2011, which explicitly stated that public schools should be non-confessional, led to debate over what this meant for the tradition that schools gather in churches in December to celebrate Advent, [[Saint Lucy's Day|Lucia]] or Christmas. 80,000 Swedes signed a 2012 protest letter (''Adventsuppropet'') initiated by the newspaper ''[[Dagen (Swedish newspaper)|Dagen]]'' to Minister for Education [[Jan Björklund]], in which they demanded that school visits to churches should still be allowed to include religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.kyrkanstidning.se/inrikes/upprop-skolavslutningar-overlamnat-till-utbildningsministern |title= Upprop för skolavslutningar överlämnat till utbildningsministern |work= Kyrkans Tidning |access-date= 12 December 2013 |language= sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister clarified that church visits before Christmas might include singing of Christmas hymns and a priest talking about the Christmas gospel while on the other side common prayers and reading a [[Confession of Faith]] would violate the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.folkpartiet.se/jan-bjorklund/nyhetsbrev/?nid=215623 |title= Ja till skolavslutning i kyrkan |work= Folkpartiet.se |date= 27 November 2012 |access-date= 12 December 2013 |language= sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Sveriges Radio]] reported that about one in six schools had changed the way they mark Christmas traditions as a result of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3993&amp;artikel=5372806 |title= Var sjätte skola har bytt jultraditioner efter ny lag |publisher= Sveriges Radio |date= 7 December 2012 |access-date= 12 December 2013 |language= sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction to such renamings has been mixed.

One of the most prominent Christmas tree controversies came in 2005, when the city of Boston labeled their official decorated tree as a holiday tree, and the subsequent response from the Nova Scotian tree farmer who donated the tree was that he would rather have put the tree in a wood chipper than have it named a "holiday" tree.&lt;ref name="USAToday" /&gt;

In 2009 in West Jerusalem, the Lobby for Jewish Values, with support of the Jerusalem [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Rabbinate]], handed out fliers condemning Christmas and called for a boycott of "restaurants and hotels that sell or put up Christmas trees and other 'foolish' Christian symbols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/rabbis-versus-christmas-religious-rivalry-in-jerusalem-benefits-no-one-1.1917 |title= Rabbis Versus Christmas: Religious Rivalry in Jerusalem Benefits No One |work= Haaretz |date= 17 December 2009 |first= Morten |last= Berthelsen |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brussels Christmas tree]] in the Belgian capital sparked controversy in December 2012, as it was part of renaming the Christmas Market as "Winter Pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/brussels-modern-art-christmas-tree-triggers-outcry-tensions-petition/article6408631/ |location= Toronto |work= The Globe and Mail |title= Brussels' Modern-Art Christmas 'Tree' Triggers Outcry, Tensions, Petition |date= 26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local opposition saw it as appeasement of the Muslim minority in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20302574 |publisher= BBC News |title= Abstract Christmas Tree Sparks Protests in Brussels |date= 1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resurgence of "Christmas tree"====
Efforts have also been made to rename official public holiday trees back to Christmas trees. In 2002, a bill was introduced in the California Senate to rename the State Holiday Tree the California State Christmas Tree;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sfatheists.blogspot.com/2002/06/letter-to-committee-on-governmental.html |title= Letter to the Committee on Governmental Organization RE: SB 1577 Redesignation of State Holiday Tree as a Christmas Tree |publisher= sfatheists.blogspot.com |date= 18 June 2002 |first= Dave |last= Kong |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}{{self-published source|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while this measure did not pass, at the official lighting of the tree on 4 December 2007, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] referred to the tree as a Christmas tree in his remarks and in the press release his office issued after the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=8222 |title= Governor and First Lady Celebrate 76th Annual Christmas Tree Lighting |publisher= Office of the Governor of California |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger had previously ended the secular practice of calling it a "holiday tree" in 2004 during the 73rd annual lighting. The name change was in honor of the late Senator William "Pete" Knight. Schwarzenegger said at Knight's funeral that he would change the name back to Christmas tree. Knight had lobbied unsuccessfully to change the name after Governor Davis decided to call it a holiday tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Governor Plugs Christmas Back into State Tree-Lighting Ceremony |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yatAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_CAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6917,3847433&amp;dq=schwarzenegger+holiday-tree&amp;hl=en |accessdate= 26 December 2012 |newspaper= Lodl News Sentinel |date= 3 December 2004 |page= 5 |agency= [[Associated Press]] |via= [[Google News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michigan Senate had a debate in 2005 over whether the decorated tree in front of the Michigan Capitol would continue to be called a holiday tree (as it had been since the early 1990s) or named a Christmas tree. The question was revisited in 2006, when the bipartisan Michigan Capitol Committee voted unanimously to use the term Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mich.

===Rejection among certain groups===
====Atheism====
Under the [[state atheism]] of the former Eastern Bloc, Christmas was banned, along with other Christian holidays.&lt;ref name="Luzer2013"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Luzer |first1=Daniel |title=What a Real War on Christmas Looks Like |url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/whats-real-war-christmas-look-like-70524 |publisher=[[Pacific Standard]] |date=26 November 2013|quote=In 1925, Christmas was effectively banned under the officially atheist Soviets, and was not to return to Russian lands until 1992. ... The state prohibited people from selling Christmas trees. There were even festivals, organized by the League of Militant Atheists, specifically to denigrate religious holidays. Their carnivals were inspired by similar events staged by activists after the French Revolution. From 1923 to 1924 and then again from 1929 to 1930 the "Komsomol Christmases" and Easters were basically holiday celebrations of atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[League of Militant Atheists]] organized alternate festivals "specifically to denigrate religious holidays" in the USSR.&lt;ref name="Luzer2013"/&gt; In the United States, some atheists may choose to celebrate Christmas fully, while others celebrate only portions of the holiday, and others reject it completely.&lt;ref name="Cline2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cline |first1=Austin |title=Should Atheists Ignore Christmas or Celebrate It? |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/should-atheists-ignore-christmas-or-celebrate-249570 |website=ThoughtCo |publisher=[[Dotdash]]|date=15 July 2018|quote=There is a debate among atheists about whether they should celebrate Christmas or not. Some do so because they aren’t "out" as atheists. Some do so in order not to rock the boat among religious family members.

Others argue that it should be replaced by a more secular holiday, and still others suggest that all such holidays should be ignored by atheists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some atheist groups who oppose the celebration of Christmas have established alternate celebrations to the Christian observance of Christmas, such as [[HumanLight]].&lt;ref name="Cline2018"/&gt;

====Islam====
The celebration of Christmas has occasionally been criticized in countries which are predominantly [[Muslim]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Turkey has adopted a secular version of Christmas and a Santa Claus figure named ''Noel Baba'' (from the French [[Père Noël]]).

Some Churches, sects, and communities of the [[Restoration Movement]] reject the observance of Christmas for theological reasons; these include [[Jehovah's Witnesses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/why-not-celebrate-christmas/.htm |title=Jehovah's Witness on Christmas |publisher= www.jw.org |accessdate= 1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Armstrongism|Armstrongites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3___tE12R0&lt;/ref&gt; the [[True Jesus Church]], [[General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh-Day)|Church of God (7th-Day)]], the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], the [[Christian Congregation in Brazil]], the [[Christian Congregation in the United States]], the [[Churches of Christ]], as well as certain [[Reformed churches|reformed]] and [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] churches of various persuasions, including some [[Independent Baptists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcfl.com/articles/becker2.htm|title=The Truth about Christmas|first=Greg|last=Wilson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness Pentecostals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prime.org/|title=Jesus Name Apostolic Holiness Church - Oneness Pentecostal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tjc.org/showArticle.aspx?aid=7219 |title= Is Christmas Biblical? |publisher= tjc.org |accessdate= 1 January 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130722145542/http://www.tjc.org/showArticle.aspx?aid=7219 |archive-date= 22 July 2013 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.churchofgod-7thday.org/FAQs.html |title= Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) |publisher= churchofgod-7thday.org |accessdate= 1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iglesianicristowebsite.com/Pages/7-faq-answers.html |title= All About Iglesia ni Cristo: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher= iglesianicristowebsite.com |accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.christianchronicle.org/article/christ-in-christmas-churches-of-christ-and-the-holiday-season?A=SearchResult&amp;SearchID=4375144&amp;ObjectID=4364696&amp;ObjectType=35|title= 'Christ' in Christmas?: Churches of Christ and the Holiday Season |work= [[Christian Chronicle]] |accessdate= 22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Xmas==
The December 1957 ''News and Views'' published by the [[Church League of America]], a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/guides/conservative.html |title= Subject Guide to Conservative and Libertarian Materials, in Manuscript Collections |publisher= University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the use of [[Xmas]] in an article titled "X=The Unknown Quantity". The claims were picked up later by [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a "blasphemous omission of the name of Christ" and that "'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity."  Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of "world Jewry", had "outlawed the name of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Morris Kominsky |last= Kominsky |first= Morris |year= 1970 |title= The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars |pages= 137–138 |isbn= 0-8283-1288-5}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a well documented history of use of ''Χ'' (actually a [[Chi (letter)|chi]]) as an abbreviation for "Christ" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ancient-symbols.com/christian_symbols.html |title= Christian Symbols and Their Descriptions |publisher= Ancient-symbols.com |date= |accessdate= 8 December 2008}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/xmas.htm |publisher= tlc.howstuffworks.com |title= Why Is There a Controversy Surrounding the Word 'Xmas'? |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19566">The '''conservation and restoration of performance art''' is the process of documenting, collecting, and prolonging the life of [[Performance Art]]. Performance Art often features a live presentation initially documented by an artist, cultural institution, or host location. This genre of art can take place in a wide range of mediums, and is usually based on four core elements: Time, Space, the Performer's body, and the relationship between viewers and performer. These variables determine how it can be collected and conserved within museums or cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MoMA Learning- Performance Into Art|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/conceptual-art/performance-into-art|website=www.moma.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of performance art==
[[Performance art]] activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in Asia and Latin America. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Term: Performance Art|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/performance-art|website=www.tate.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century performance art originated from early avant-garde genres such as [[Futurism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. The choreographed movements combined elements of traditional theater performances and styles of political rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance Art|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-performance-art.htm|website=www.theartstory.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the post-war performance art movement can be credited to composer [[John Cage]] and dancer [[Merce Cunningham]] at North Carolina's [[Black Mountain College]]. Cage's teaching in New York shaped the work of artists such as [[George Brecht]], [[Yoko Ono]], and [[Allan Kaprow]], who formed part of the impetus behind the Fluxus movement and the creation of "happenings," which were then preceded by [[Abstract expressionism]] and Action painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Abigail|title=A Brief History of "Happenings" in 1960s New York|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-what-were-1960s-happenings-and-why-do-they-matter|website=www.artsy.net|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s the [[List of performance artists]] has continued to increase, and the styles of the genre are never confined.

==Artistic intent ==
In experiencing painting, film, literature, theatre, dance, music, and other arts, is it useful to consider the artist’s intent, including evidence from previous work, external statements, and historical and personal contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costa Rodrigues|first1=Marta Filipa|title=The Challenges of the Ephemeral: Conserving Performance Art|url=https://www.academia.edu/16325064/The_Challenges_of_the_Ephemeral_Conserving_Performance_Art|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Art and nature, non-aesthetic intent, the artist's testimony, historical context, situational approaches, intent for audiences, and textual intent are factors that take part in what or how the artist allows their work to be represented. The [[Artist's statement]] is another form in determining the conditions of their performance. These preferences include how the work can be documented, collected, and preserved.

==Ethical concerns==
Performance art is often undefined in its boundaries, so this may raise concern for where and how it is exhibited. Additional concerns are raised in [https://www.academia.edu/8925656/Performance_Art_Pornography_and_the_Mis-Spectator_The_Ethics_of_Documenting_Participatory_Performance participatory performances]. There are several Codes of Ethics for professionals working in conservation and preservation-related fields. The main conservation Code of Ethics is the [[American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]] (AIC) Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. However, many of the professional organizations have their own codes, such as the [http://archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics Society of American Archivists Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics].

==Conserving performance==
Performance art contains a [http://www.theartstory.org/movement-performance-art.htm history] of disregarding a standard definition or description, which presents a series of questions and discussions to qualify its conservation. Conserving and preserving Performance art was originally questioned if it was possible and for what reasons should it be collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rockwell|first1=John|title=Reverberations; Preserve Performance Art? Can You Preserve the Wind?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/movies/reverberations-preserve-performance-art-can-you-preserve-the-wind.html?_r=0|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A broad discussion of what context the live works could be preserved has been presented by David Smith of [[Asia Art Archive]] and Athena Christa Holbrook from [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts or Contexts|url=http://www.voca.network/blog/2016/08/01/concepts-or-contexts/|website=Voices in Contemporary Art|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discuss the legitimacy of how a performance can be conserved and the resulting value of the work after by the artist, collection, and for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts or Contexts|url=http://www.voca.network/blog/2016/08/01/concepts-or-contexts/|website=www.voca.network|accessdate=17 April 2017|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural institutions===
With input from artists, art educators and historians, conservators, and curators, a wider perspective is being generated for cultural institutions to develop new techniques in conserving and restoring live, time based works through workshops like [http://www.2ndpublic.org/news/2016/04/collecting-and-conserving-performance-art The International Symposium "Collecting and Conserving Performance Art"], held in Wolfsburg,Germany.
Cultural institutions like [[Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Tate Modern]] have continued to develop conservation techniques on media-specific preservation needs, like securing equipment, updating exhibition-mode technology, and developing ways to re-create duration-based presentations. Their [http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/107264 lists and policies] establish a consistent method of collecting and preserving Performance Art by examining the license to "re-perform" the work, existing practices used to bring live works into a collection, and looking at past participants and producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection/Departments|url=https://www.moma.org/explore/collection/departments/|website=www.moma.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The artist===
The artists/creators of the performance are the original source for the intentions for conserving the work. The artist's intent can determine how or to what degree the live work can be preserved. Popular performance artist [[Marina Abramović]] has spent much of her career recreating new versions of past performances by either replicating the physical actions or by selecting a reoccurring location, theme, or medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marina Abramovic Institute|url=http://oma.eu/projects/marina-abramovic-institute|website=www.oma.eu|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also spent time as an educator in Performance Art so that her similar methods and styles are repeated. Marina has used several resources in copyrighting her work to ensure it's authenticity and the work can be preserved in its current state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=https://mai.art/|website=www.mia.art|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Performance scripts have also been used to preserve a live performance. With these written instructions or steps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fluxus Performance Workbook|url=http://www.deluxxe.com/beat/fluxusworkbook.pdf|publisher=Performance Research 2002|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original live work can be re-performed or accurately represented keeping the artist's intentions true to the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Action Script: Symposium on Performance Art Practice and Documentation in Asia|url=http://www.aaa.org.hk/Programme/Details/29|website=www.aaa.org|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although curators and art critics have questioned if these scripts are sufficient materials for preserving and collecting the work; this method can be argued with similar conservation methods used in theater and performing arts.

==Conservation and restoration treatment methods==
[http://www.complex.com/style/2013/04/the-25-best-performance-art-pieces-of-all-time/ Performance art that includes video], film, slide, audio, or computer technologies often falls under the [[conservation and restoration of time-based media art]] because they have duration as a dimension and unfold to the viewer over time. Collecting, preserving, and exhibiting these performances raises complex technical and ethical challenges to conservators. Reside from Performance art fall under two main categories for either physical objects, and digital objects or [[New media]] associated with the work. While performances can have either category or combination to document the performance, exhibit, and preserve the existence or transformation of the work; the digital component has become the dominant method of prolonging the existence of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Based Media Art|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenheim.org|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some strategies of overcoming the challenges of collecting live work are addressed in Marta Rodriguez's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rodrigues|first=Marta|title=The Challenges of the Ephemeral: Conserving Performance Art|url=https://www.academia.edu/16325064/The_Challenges_of_the_Ephemeral_Conserving_Performance_Art|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mediums ===
Performance Art can take the form of several mediums with the possibility for combination such as but not limited to:

* [[BioArt]]
* [[Cyberformance]]
* [[Digital art]]
* [[Digital poetry]]
* [[Electronic art]]
* [[Evolutionary art]]
* [[Generative art]]
* [[Information art]]
* [[Interactive art]]
* [[Internet art]]
* [[Kinetic art]]
* [[Light art]]
* [[Motion graphics]]
* [[Net art]]
* [[Photography]]
* [[Sound art]]
* [[Video art]] 
* [[Virtual art]]

These mediums can be the result of documentation for the performance or be directly involved in the art itself. The mediums often determine how the work is collected, conserved, and restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marina Abromovic: What is Performance Art?|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/global-culture/conceptual-performance/v/moma-abramovic-what-is-performance-art|website=www.khanacademy.org|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical objects===
Physical props, tools, clothing, etc. remaining or created as a result of the performance can be a common representation to document and preserve the Performance. [[Collections care]] guides and policies manage best practices for prolonging the life of the work.

====Preventive care and maintenance====
Many works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[visible light]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Natural History Collections Management Policy|url=https://entomology.si.edu/Collections/NMNH_CMP_Sept-18-2006.pdf|website=www.si.edu|accessdate=12 April 2017|pages=23–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other causes of deterioration include:
*[[Pollution]]
*Poor Storage 
*Poor Handling and Use

[[Collections care]] is an essential element of museum policy. It is a "responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. Cultural institutions should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Museum of Natural History Collections Management Policy|url=https://entomology.si.edu/Collections/NMNH_CMP_Sept-18-2006.pdf|website=www.si.edu|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital===
Digital mediums can be used for documentation or be a result of a performance such as digital photography, video, and audio files.  [[Conservation and restoration of new media art]] can establish best practices for individuals, artists, and cultural institutions to prolong the life of the work.

====Digital preservation====
Works of new media art such as [[film]], [[tapes]], [[web browsers]], software [[operating systems]] eventually become obsolete, and [[New Media art]] faces serious issues around the challenge to preserve artwork beyond the time of its contemporary production. The [http://rhizome.org/art/ digital archiving of media] (see the [http://rhizome.org/art/ Rhizome ArtBase], and the Internet Archive), and the use of emulators to prolong the life of work that depend on obsolete software or operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Frank|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html?_r=0|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preventive care and maintenance====
Instability and change are inherent to these artworks, since artist-selected equipment and technologies fail and become obsolete. Many time-based media artworks are ephemeral by nature; rather than being composed of a unique original, they exist only when they are installed, so every iteration can be considered a different representation of the artwork. To preserve the fragile identity of time-based media artworks, conservators must proactively manage the degree of change that may be introduced to each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation- Time Based Media|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenheim.org|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods of preservation====
The [http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/ Variable Media Questionnaire (VMS)] has developed into a significant tool in relation to digital preservation.
*Refreshing- The periodic transfer of an audiovisual or digital file from one cassette or disk to another device of identical format.
*Restoration- The cleaning or repair of an existing artifact or file, especially when the new version supersedes or replaces the original.
*Networked storage- The use of computers linked by a persistent data loop to keep critical files in circulation or as multiple copies cloned on multiple hard drives. 
*Migration- To upgrade its format from an aged medium to a more current one, such as from VHS to DVD, accepting that some changes in quality may occur while still maintaining the integrity of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Depocas|first1=Alain|title=Permanence Through Change: The Variable Media Approach|date=2003|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|location=New York|isbn=0968469329|pages=125–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy assumes that preserving the content or information of an artwork, despite its change in media, trumps concerns over fidelity to the original look and feel.

====Acquisition and storage====
Physical media-equipment, such as DVD players or computers, used in multi-media or digital artworks has proven a short-term strategy, as hardware can quickly become obsolete or outdated. Storage is also notoriously bad at capturing the contextual and live aspects of works such as [[Internet art]], performance art and [[live electronic music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collecting and Conserving Performance Art|url=http://www.restauratoren.de/termine-details/2021-collecting-and-conserving-performance-art.html|website=Verband der Restauratoren|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/107264 What to consider when collecting Performance Art]

====Causes of deterioration====
For the residue and documentation of performance art, new media preservationists work to integrate new preservation strategies with existing documentation techniques and [[metadata]] standards. This effort is made in order to remain compatible with previous frameworks and models on how to archive, store and maintain variable media objects in a standardized repository utilizing a systematized vocabulary, such as the [[Open Archival Information System]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation- Time Based Media|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenheim.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[Digital preservation]] and [[Web archiving]] offers special challenges and opportunities. Where scientific data and legal records may be easily migrated from one platform to another without losing their essential function, artworks are often sensitive to the look and feel of the media in which they are embedded. On the other hand, artists who are invited to help imagine a long-term plan for their work often respond with creative solutions. [[Emulator|Emulation]] and Reinterpretation are additional approaches for prolonging the life of digital objects and documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation- Time Based Media; Managing Inherent Change|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/conservation/time-based-media|website=www.guggenhiem.org|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pest management ===
For physical objects and props relating to a performance piece, conservators must follow proper pest management standards. [[Integrated Pest Management]] policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Policies and checklists specific to [[museum integrated pest management]], for example from the [[National Park Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest Management Manual- Museum Pests|url=https://nature.nps.gov/biology/ipm/manual/museum.cfm|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Smithsonian Institution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest Management Check List|url=https://www.si.edu/mci/downloads/articles/pests9.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss best practices, to include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition and storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas.

A '''flat grave''' is a [[burial]] in a simple oval or rectangular pit. The pit is filled with earth, but the grave is not marked above the surface by any means such as a [[tumulus]] or upstanding earthwork.&lt;ref name=darv /&gt; Both intact human bodies (skeletal grave) and cremated remains (urn grave) were buried in the graves.

==History==
This simple method of burial was used often by [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. It was used during the [[Funnelbeaker culture]] and [[Corded Ware culture]]. It was characteristic of the [[Urnfield culture]] which stored cremated remains in [[urn]]s and buried them in flat graves.

Burial customs did not always follow a pattern of continuously increasing sophistication in history. During the early [[La Tène culture]] the deceased were optionally cremated and then interred in tumulus tombs, but this changed during the later period. At that time tumulus tombs became rare and the interment of cremated remains in flat graves was the dominant method of burial again.&lt;ref name=hube /&gt;

'''Ganj Par''' ({{lang-fa|گنج پر}}) is a [[Lower Paleolithic]] site located in the [[Gilan]] province in northern [[Iran]].

Located on an old western terrace of the [[Sefīd-Rūd]] River, the site was discovered by a team of archaeologists from the Center for Paleolithic Research of the [[National Museum of Iran]] in 2002.
The Lower Paleolithic cave site of [[Darband Cave]] is located at east of Ganj Par.

About 150 stone artifacts&amp;nbsp;—[[handaxe]]s, [[cleaver]]s, a pick, choppers, and smaller [[Lithic flake|flake]] tools&amp;nbsp;— made of [[limestone]], [[igneous rock]]s, and [[sandstone]] have been found at the site.  There are some similarities between this [[Acheulian]] stone tools with those found in [[Caucasus]] region. Discovery of Ganj Par thus indicates that [[Iran]] is part of the Acheulian territory.

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990). ''Globalization, Knowledge and Society'' London: Sage. {{ISBN|9780803983236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlbrowKing1990"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin |last1=Albrow|first2=Elizabeth |last2=King|title=Globalization, knowledge, and society: readings from International sociology|url={{google books|id=lfe1AAAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|year=1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-8323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALso, with the expansions of global markets liberalize the economic

Though many scholars place the [[History of globalization|origins of globalization]] in [[modernity|modern times]], others trace its history long before the [[Europe]]an [[Age of Discovery]] and voyages to the [[New World]], some even to the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GL-H-10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Globalization and Global History |page=127 |url=http://58.192.114.227/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20110522/20110522005012939.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=O'Rourke, Kevin|last2=G.|first2=Williamson, Jeffrey|date=1 April 2002|title=When did globalisation begin?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/6/1/23/540507|journal=European Review of Economic History|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023|issn=1361-4916|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

[http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2000/041200to.htm 12 April 2000: IMF Publications.]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, environmental challenges such as [[global warming]], cross-boundary [[water pollution|water,]] [[air pollution]], and [[overfishing|over-fishing]] of the ocean are linked with globalization.&lt;ref name="Bridges2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridges|first=G.|title=Grounding Globalization: The Prospects and Perils of Linking Economic Processes of Globalization to Environmental Outcomes|journal=Economic Geography|year=2002|volume=78|pages=361–86|doi=10.2307/4140814|issue=3|ref=harv|jstor=4140814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalizing processes affect and are affected by [[business]] and [[Employment|work]] organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the [[natural environment]].

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001). "Globalization, the reformist Left and the Anti-Globalization 'Movement.'" [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/dn/vol7/takis_globalisation.htm ''Democracy &amp; Nature: The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', 7:(2) (July 2001).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]]. more apparently, before the phase of Globalization, United States of America was a dominant country which held the essential economic power in world export.

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B.

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives."

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century . Oxford University Press: 17 September 1992&lt;/ref&gt; His view suggested that globalization would lead to a world where people from all countries will become more integrated and aware of common interests and shared humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Roger.

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

(2011). Social movements (Rev. ed.). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The diverse subgroups that make up this movement include some of the following: trade unionists, environmentalists, anarchists, land rights and indigenous rights activists, organizations promoting human rights and sustainable development, opponents of privatization, and [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] campaigners.&lt;ref name="stwr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stwr.org/the-un-people-politics/the-anti-globalization-movement-defined.htm|title=The Anti-Globalization Movement Defined Share The World's Resources|last=Engler|first=M.|date=30 May 2007|accessdate=14 March 2013}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}l&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===

{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Greek Alphabet}}

[[Greek orthography]] has used a variety of [[diacritic]]s starting in the [[Hellenistic period]]. The more complex '''polytonic orthography''' ({{lang-el|πολυτονικό σύστημα γραφής|translit=politonikó sístima grafís}}) notates [[Ancient Greek phonology]]. The simpler '''monotonic orthography''' ({{lang-el|μονοτονικό σύστημα γραφής|translit=monotonikó sístima grafís|label=none}}), introduced in 1982, corresponds to [[Modern Greek phonology]], and requires only two diacritics.

Polytonic orthography (from {{transl|el|polys}} ({{wikt-lang|el|πολύς}}) "much, many" and {{transl|el|tonos}} ({{wikt-lang|el|τόνος}}) "accent") is the standard system for [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Medieval Greek]]. The [[acute accent]] (&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;´&lt;/span&gt;), the [[circumflex]] (&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;ˆ&lt;/span&gt;), and the [[grave accent]] (&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;) indicate different kinds of [[pitch accent]]. The [[rough breathing]] (&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;῾&lt;/span&gt;) indicates the presence of the {{IPA|/h/}} sound before a letter, while the [[smooth breathing]] (&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;᾿&lt;/span&gt;) indicates the absence of {{IPA|/h/}}.

Since in Modern Greek the pitch accent has been replaced by a [[stress (linguistics)|dynamic accent (stress)]], and {{IPA|/h/}} was lost, most polytonic diacritics have no phonetic significance, and merely reveal the underlying Ancient Greek [[etymology]].

Monotonic orthography (from {{transl|el|monos}} ({{wikt-lang|el|μόνος}}) "single" and {{transl|el|tonos}} ({{lang|el|τόνος}}) "accent") is the standard system for [[Modern Greek]]. It retains two diacritics: a single accent or ''tonos''
(&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;΄&lt;/span&gt;) that indicates [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], and the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (&lt;span style="font-size: larger; line-height: 90%; font-weight:normal;"&gt;¨&lt;/span&gt;), which usually indicates a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] but occasionally indicates a [[diphthong]]: compare modern Greek {{wikt-lang|el|παϊδάκι|παϊδάκια}} ({{IPA|/pajˈðaca/}}, "lamb chops"), with a diphthong, and {{wikt-lang|el|παιδάκι|παιδάκια}} ({{IPA|/peˈðaca/}}, "little children") with a [[monophthong|simple vowel]]. A ''tonos'' and a ''diaeresis'' can be combined on a single vowel to indicate a stressed vowel after a hiatus, as in the verb {{lang|el|ταΐζω}} ({{IPA|/taˈizo/}}, "to feed").

Although it is not a diacritic, the [[hypodiastole]] ([[comma]]) has in a similar way the function of a sound-changing diacritic in a handful of Greek words, principally distinguishing {{wikt-lang|el|ό,τι}} ({{transl|el|ó,ti}}, "whatever") from {{wikt-lang|el|ότι}} ({{transl|el|óti}}, "that").&lt;ref name="nicky"&gt;Nicolas, Nick.

==History==
[[File:Codex Sinaiticus-small.jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|The [[Lord's Prayer]] in a 4th-century [[uncial]] manuscript ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'', before the adoption of [[Lower case|minuscule]] polytonic. Note spelling errors: elth''a''tō ē basil''i''a (ΕΛΘΑΤΩΗΒΑΣΙΛΙΑ) instead of elth''e''tō ē basil''ei''a (ΕΛΘΕΤΩ Η ΒΑΣΙΛΕΙΑ).]]
The original [[Greek alphabet]] did not have diacritics. The Greek alphabet is attested since the 8th century BC, and until 403 BC, variations of the Greek alphabet—which exclusively used what is now known as [[Letter case|capitals]]—were used in different cities and areas. From 403 on, the Athenians decided to employ a version of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] alphabet. With the spread of [[Koine Greek]], a continuation of the [[Attic Greek|Attic]] dialect, the Ionic alphabet superseded the other alphabets, known as [[wikt:epichoric|epichoric]], with varying degrees of speed. The Ionian alphabet, however, also only consisted of capitals.

===Introduction of breathings===
[[File:Byzantinischer Maler um 1020 003.jpg|upright=1.59|thumb|An example of polytonic text with [[Ekphonetic notation|ekphonetic neumes]] in [[rubric|red ink]] from a [[Byzantine illuminated manuscript|Byzantine manuscript]], of 1020 AD, displaying the beginning of the [[Gospel of Luke]] (1:3–6)]]
The [[Rough breathing|rough]] and [[Smooth breathing|smooth breathings]] were introduced in classical times in order to represent the presence or absence of an {{IPA|[[/h/]]}} in [[Attic Greek]], which had adopted a form of the alphabet in which the letter Η ([[eta]]) was no longer available for this purpose as it was used to represent the [[long vowel]] {{IPA|/ɛː/}}.

===Introduction of accents===
During the Hellenistic period (3rd century BC), [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] introduced the breathings—marks of aspiration (the aspiration however being already noted on certain inscriptions, not by means of diacritics but by regular letters or modified letters)—and the accents, of which the use started to spread, to become standard in the Middle Ages. It was not until the 2nd century AD that [[Accent mark|accents]] and breathings appeared sporadically in [[papyrus|papyri]]. The need for the diacritics arose from the gradual divergence between spelling and pronunciation.

===Uncial script===
{{Main|Uncial script}}
The [[Uncial script|majuscule]], i.e., a system where text is written entirely in [[capital letters]], was used until the 8th century, when the [[Lower case|minuscule]] polytonic supplanted it.

===Grave accent rule&lt;!--Linked from 'Bareia'. 'Grave accent rule' redirects here.--&gt;===
By the [[Byzantine period]], the modern rule which turns an [[acute accent]] (''oxeia'') on the last syllable into a [[grave accent]] (''bareia'')—except before a punctuation sign or an [[enclitic]]—had been firmly established. Certain authors have argued that the grave originally denoted the absence of accent; the modern rule is, in their view, a purely [[Orthography|orthographic]] convention. Originally, certain [[proclitic]] words lost their accent before another word and received the grave, and later this was generalized to all words in the orthography. Others—drawing on, for instance, evidence from [[ancient Greek music]]—consider that the grave was "linguistically real" and expressed a word-final modification of the acute pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Probert |first=Philomen |year=2006 |title=Ancient Greek accentuation |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=  9780199279609 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Devine |first=Andrew M. |first2=Laurence D. |last2=Stephens |year=1994 |title=The prosody of Greek speech |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-508546-9 |page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Allen |first=William S. |year=1987 |title=Vox graeca |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=124–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress accent===
In the later development of the language, the ancient [[Pitch accent (intonation)|pitch accent]] was replaced by an intensity or [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] accent, making the three types of accent identical, and the {{IPA|/h/}} sound became silent.

===Simplification===
At the beginning of the 20th century (official since the 1960s), the grave was replaced by the acute, and the [[iota subscript]] and the breathings on the rho were abolished, except in printed texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Συγχρονισμένο ορθογραφικό λεξικό της νεοελληνικής (Contemporary Orthographic Dictionary of Modern Greek)|year=1976|publisher=Κέντρον Εκπαιδευτικών Μελετών και Επιμορφώσεως|author1=Alkis K. Tropaiatis|author2=Telis Peklaris|author3=Philippos D. Kolovos|page=11|language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek [[typewriters]] from that era did not have keys for the grave accent or the iota subscript, and these diacritics were also not taught in primary schools where instruction was in [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]].

===Official adoption of monotonic system===
Following the official adoption of the [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]] form of the language, the monotonic orthography was imposed by law in 1982. The latter uses only the acute accent (or sometimes a [[vertical bar]], intentionally distinct from any of the traditional accents) and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] and omits the breathings. This simplification has been criticized on the grounds that polytonic orthography provides a cultural link to the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polytoniko.gr|title=Καλῶς ὁρίσατε στὸν ἱστοχῶρο τῆς Κίνησης Πολιτῶν γιὰ τὴν Ἐπαναφορὰ τοῦ Πολυτονικοῦ Συστήματος|first=Γιάννης|last=Χαραλάμπους|website=www.polytoniko.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern use of polytonic system===
Some individuals, institutions, and publishers continue to prefer the polytonic system (with or without grave accent), though an official reintroduction of the polytonic system does not seem probable. The [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox]] church, the daily newspaper ''[[Estia]],'' as well as books written in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' continue to use the polytonic orthography. Though the polytonic system was not used in Classical Greece, these critics argue that modern Greek, as a continuation of [[medieval Greek|Byzantine]] and post-medieval Greek, should continue their writing conventions.

Some textbooks of Ancient Greek for foreigners have retained the breathings, but dropped all the accents in order to simplify the task for the learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Betts |first=G. |title=Teach Yourself New Testament Greek |publisher=Teach Yourself Books |location=London |year=2004 |ISBN=0-340-87084-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Polytonic Greek uses many different diacritics in several categories. At the time of Ancient Greek, each of these marked a significant distinction in pronunciation.

Monotonic orthography for Modern Greek uses only two diacritics, the ''tonos'' and ''diaeresis'' (sometimes used in combination) that have significance in pronunciation. Initial {{IPA|/h/}} is no longer pronounced, and so the rough and smooth breathings are no longer necessary. The unique pitch patterns of the three accents have disappeared, and only a [[stress (linguistics)|stress accent]] remains. The iota subscript was a diacritic invented to mark an [[etymology|etymological]] vowel that was no longer pronounced, so it was dispensed with as well.

{{See also|Ancient Greek accent}}
The accents ({{lang-grc|τόνοι|tónoi}}, singular: {{lang-grc|τόνος|tónos|label=none}}) are placed on an accented vowel or on the last of the two vowels of a diphthong (ά, but αί) and indicated [[pitch accent|pitch]] patterns in Ancient Greek. The precise nature of the patterns is not certain, but the general nature of each is known.

The '''[[acute accent]]''' ({{lang-grc|ὀξεῖα|oxeîa|sharp|label=none}} or "high")—'{{lang|grc|ά}}'—marked high pitch on a short vowel or rising pitch on a long vowel.

The acute is also used on the first of two (or occasionally three) successive vowels in Modern Greek to indicate that they are pronounced together as a stressed diphthong.

The '''[[grave accent]]''' ({{lang-grc|βαρεῖα|bareîa|heavy|label=none}} or "low", modern ''varia'')—'{{lang|grc|ὰ}}'—marked normal or low pitch.

The grave was originally written on all unaccented syllables,&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Weir Smyth|Smyth]], par. 155&lt;/ref&gt; but now only replaces the acute at the end of a word if another accented word follows immediately without [[punctuation]].

The '''[[circumflex]]''' ({{lang-grc|περισπωμένη|perispōménē|twisted around|label=none}})—'{{lang|grc|ᾶ}}'—marked high and falling pitch within one syllable. In distinction to the angled Latin circumflex, the Greek circumflex is printed in the form of either a [[tilde]] or an [[inverted breve]]. It was also known as {{lang|grc|ὀξύβαρυς}} ''oxýbarys'' "high-low" or "acute-grave", and its original form (like a caret: '''^''' ) was from a combining of the acute and grave diacritics. Because of its compound nature, it only appeared on long vowels or diphthongs.

===Breathings===

|-
| Rough || Smooth
|-
| [[File:Greek asper acute.svg|50px]]
| [[File:Greek lenis circumflex breve.svg|50px]]
|-
| colspan="2" | Combined with accents
|}
The breathings were written over a vowel or ''r''.

The '''[[rough breathing]]''' ({{lang-grc|δασὺ πνεῦμα|dasù pneûma|link=no}}; [[Latin]] {{lang|la|spiritus asper}})—'{{lang|grc|ἁ}}'—indicates a voiceless glottal fricative ({{IPA|/h/}}) before the vowel in Ancient Greek. In Greek grammar, this is known as aspiration. This is different from [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] in [[phonetics]], which applies to consonants, not vowels.
* [[rho (letter)|Rho]] (Ρρ) at the beginning of a word always takes rough breathing, probably marking [[voice (phonetics)|unvoiced]] pronunciation. In Latin, this was [[romanization of Greek|transcribed]] as ''[[list of Latin digraphs#R|rh]]''.
* [[Upsilon]] (Υυ) at the beginning of a word always takes rough breathing. Thus, words from Greek begin with ''hy-'', never with ''y-''.

The '''[[smooth breathing]]''' ({{lang-grc|ψιλὸν πνεῦμα|psilòn pneûma|label=none}}; Latin {{lang|la|spiritus lenis}})—'{{lang|grc|ἀ}}'—marked the absence of {{IPA|/h/}}.

A double rho in the middle of a word was originally written with smooth breathing on the first rho and rough breathing on the second one (διάῤῥοια). In Latin, this was transcribed as ''rrh'' (''diarrhoea'' or ''diarrhea'').

===Coronis===
[[File:Greek coronis crasis.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.54|Coronis, marking crasis in the word {{lang|grc|2=κἀγώ = καὶ ἐγώ}}]]
The '''[[coronis (diacritic)|coronis]]''' ({{lang-grc|κορωνίς|korōnís|curved|label=none}}) marks a vowel contracted by [[crasis]]. It was formerly an apostrophe placed after the contracted vowel, but is now placed over the vowel and is identical to the smooth breathing. Unlike the smooth breathing, it often occurs inside a word.

===Subscript===
{| class="wikitable" style="float:right;clear:right;"

| [[File:Greek iota placement 01.svg|80px]]

|}
The '''[[iota subscript]]''' ({{lang-grc|ὑπογεγραμμένη|hypogegramménē|written under|label=none}})—'{{lang|grc|ᾳ}}'—is placed under the long vowels [[alpha|ᾱ]], [[eta|η]], and [[omega|ω]] to mark the ancient long diphthongs '''ᾱι''', '''ηι''', and '''ωι''', in which the ι is no longer pronounced.

===Adscript===
Next to a capital, the iota subscript is usually written as a lower-case letter ('''Αι'''), in which case it is called '''[[iota adscript]]''' ({{lang-grc|προσγεγραμμένη|prosgegramménē|written next to|label=none}}).

===Diaeresis===
[[File:Greek diacritic non-diphthong capitals.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.54|Diaeresis, used to distinguish the word ΑΫΛΟΣ ({{lang|grc|ἄϋλος}}, 'immaterial') from the word ΑΥΛΟΣ ({{lang|grc|αὐλός}} 'flute')
]]
In Ancient Greek, the '''[[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]''' ({{lang-el|διαίρεσις|link=no}} or {{lang-el|διαλυτικά|dialytiká|distinguishing|label=none}})—'{{lang|grc|ϊ}}'—appears on the letters {{lang|grc|'''[[iota|ι]]'''}} and {{lang|grc|'''[[upsilon|υ]]'''}} to show that a pair of vowel letters is pronounced separately, rather than as a [[diphthong]].

In Modern Greek, the diaeresis usually indicates that two successive vowels are pronounced separately (as in {{lang|grc|κοροϊδεύω}} {{IPA|/ko.ro.iˈðe.vo/}}, "I trick, mock"), but occasionally, it marks vowels that are pronounced together as an unstressed diphthong rather than as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] (as in {{lang|grc|μποϊκοτάρω}} {{IPA|/boj.koˈtar.o/}}, "I boycott"). The distinction between two separate vowels and an unstressed diphthong is not always clear, although two separate vowels are far more common.

The diaeresis can be combined with the acute, grave and circumflex but never with breathings, since the letter with the diaeresis cannot be the first vowel of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=Evelyn|last2=Mansfield|first2=E. D.|year=1977|title=A Primer of Greek Grammar|location=London|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=0-7156-1258-1|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Modern Greek, the combination of the acute and diaeresis indicates a stressed vowel after a hiatus.

===Vowel length===
In textbooks and dictionaries of Ancient Greek, the '''[[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]'''—'{{lang|grc|ᾱ}}'—and '''[[breve]]'''—'{{lang|grc|ᾰ}}'—are often used over {{lang|grc|'''[[alpha|α]]'''}}, {{lang|grc|'''[[iota|ι]]'''}}, and {{lang|grc|'''[[upsilon|υ]]'''}} to indicate that they are long or short, respectively.

===Caron===
In some modern non-standard orthographies of Greek dialects, such as [[Cypriot Greek]] and [[Griko dialect|Griko]], a [[caron]] (ˇ) may be used on some consonants to show a palatalized pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex2012/pp262-266%20Themistocleus,%20Katsoyannou,%20Armosti%20and%20Christodoulou.pdf|title=Cypriot Greek Lexicography: A Reverse Dictionary of Cypriot Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/griko.htm|title=Griko alphabets, pronunciation and language|website=www.omniglot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not encoded as precombined characters in Unicode, so they are typed by adding the {{unichar|030C|COMBINING CARON|html=|cwith=◌}} to the Greek letter. Latin diacritics on Greek letters may not be supported by many fonts, and as a fall-back a caron may be replaced by an iota ⟨ι⟩ following the consonant.

Examples of Greek letters with a combining caron and their pronunciation: '''ζ̌''' /ʒ/, '''κ̌''' /c/ or /t͡ʃ/, '''λ̌''' /ʎ/, '''ν̌''' /ɲ/, '''ξ̌''' /kʃ/, '''π̌''' /pʲ/, '''σ̌''' '''ς̌''' /ʃ/, '''τ̌''' /c/, '''τζ̌''' /t͡ʃ/ or /d͡ʒ/, '''τσ̌''' '''τς̌''' /t͡ʃ/ or /t͡ʃː/, '''ψ̌''' /pʃ/.

==Position in letters==
The diacritics are written above lower-case letters and at the upper left of capital letters. In the case of a [[diphthong]] or a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]], the second vowel takes the diacritics. A breathing diacritic is written to the left of an acute or grave accent but below a circumflex. Accents are written above a diaeresis or between its two dots. When a word is written entirely in capital letters, diacritics are far less used; the word&amp;nbsp; {{lang|grc|Ἢ}} (or), is an exception to this rule because of the need to distinguish it from the nominative feminine article {{lang|grc|Η}}. Diacritics can be found above capital letters in medieval texts. The diaeresis is always written.

και μη εισενέγκης ημάς εις πειρασμόν, αλλά ρύσαι ημάς από του πονηρού.
Αμήν.

==Computer encoding==
There have been problems in representing polytonic Greek on computers, and in displaying polytonic Greek on computer screens and printouts, but these have largely been overcome by the advent of [[Unicode]] and appropriate [[font]]s.

=== Unicode ===
While the ''tónos'' of monotonic orthography looks similar to the ''oxeîa'' of polytonic orthography in most fonts, Unicode has historically separate symbols for letters with these diacritics. For example, the monotonic "Greek small letter alpha with ''tónos''" is at U+03AC, while the polytonic "Greek small letter alpha with ''oxeîa''" is at U+1F71. The monotonic and polytonic accent however have been ''[[de jure]]'' equivalent since 1986, and accordingly the ''oxeîa'' diacritic in Unicode decomposes canonically to the monotonic ''tónos''—both are underlyingly treated as equivalent to the multiscript acute accent, U+0301, since letters with ''oxia'' decompose to letters with ''tonos'', which decompose in turn to base letter plus multiscript acute accent. For example:
U+1F71 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA&lt;br /&gt;
➔ U+03AC GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS&lt;br /&gt;
➔ U+03B1 GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA, U+0301 COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT.

Below are the accented characters provided in Unicode. In the uppercase letters, the iota adscript may appear as subscript depending on font.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">[[File:Hamburger Druckschrift ab 2011.jpg|thumb|Hamburg's block letters]]

'''Grundschrift''' (''base [[font]]'', literally ''ground script'') is a simplified form of [[handwriting]] adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools, and it is currently endorsed by the German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian - [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

If nationally adopted, it would replace the three different German [[cursive]]s currently being taught in schools: the [[:de:Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift]] (introduced in 1953), the [[:de:Schulausgangsschrift|Schulausgangsschrift]] (1968), and the [[:de:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift]] (1969), providing a standardized system of handwriting in German school systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de Grundschrift - Schreibschrift: Verlust oder Gewinn?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grundschrift letters are written separately as [[block letters]] as opposed to cursive script, in which letters are conjoined together in a flowing motion.

== Reception ==
One of the most important critics of the Grundschrift is Ute Andresen. The former president of the German Society for Reading and Writing (1999 to 2002) argues that "children can not teach themselves to write."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reform-der-lehrplaene-die-schreibschrift-stirbt-aus-12932933.html - Schreibschrift stirbt aus]&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the basic inscription would mean abolishing cursive handwriting. This is "putting a cultural technique at risk, the ability to write a common readable font ". Andresen contradicts in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] interview the statement of the Grundschulverband that the Grundschrift is a connected spelling. "That's wrong. The basic inscription is a modular font, which means the letters are juxtaposed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://handschriftlich.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/kinder-konnen-sich-das-schreiben-nicht-selbst-beibringen/ - Kinder können sich das Schreiben nicht selbst beibringen]&lt;/ref&gt; Andresen is et al. supported by the writer Cornelia Funke. "To master a non-cursive handwriting does not suffice as a script, in my opinion. It does not flow like cursive and is therefore much slower. A flowing script, on the other hand, promotes the flow of thought - and at the same time is so individual that one is completely at one's own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/cornelia-funke-die-handschrift-soll-gedanken-fliegen-lassen-12933060.html - Die Handschrift soll Gedanken fliegen lassen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles for the taz, Andresen already pointed out that learning a bound script is a fundamental learning process for every child.  Failing to learn a script increases the risk of bad education. In this way, it occupies the position of Wilhelm Topsch against the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}}. The Oldenburger education scientist has proven in 1996 that there were no other scientific reports for the introduction of these in the 1970s than those of their inventor Heinrich Grünewald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/zurueck-zur-guten-handschrift/ - Zurück zur guten Handschrift]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/gutachter-lobbyisten-und-autoren/ - Gutachter, Lobbyisten und Autoren]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Topsch: Das Ende einer Legende.

'''Gurtam''' ([[belarusian language|belarusian]] “''гуртам''” — together) is a Belarusian [[software]] development company and a [[service provider]] in real time [[GPS monitoring]], [[vehicle telematics]] and fleet management solutions. Company's main products are:
* '''Wialon''' — a multifunctional system developed to monitor stationary and mobile objects. The platform is based on [[GLONASS]]/GPS [[satellite navigation]] systems, [[GSM]] cellular communications ([[GPRS]]/[[SMS]]), [[Inmarsat]], [[Iridium]], [[Thuraya]], [[Orbcomm]] and [[Globalstar]] satellite communications.
* '''flespi'''  — a back-end platform for unified interactions between telematics devices and business apps via REST API.

As of April 2018 more than 1 500 000 objects&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://gurtam.com/en/blog/mirovoj-rekord-wialon-podklucen-1-500-000-j-obekt]&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide were monitored by Wialon. The business network of the company involves over 950 fleet tracking service providers in more than 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gurtam.com/en/about Gurtam for together]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the annual telematics market research by Omnicomm, Gurtam's market share in satellite monitoring solutions for CIS countries is 36%. 

==Operations==
The company develops several directions:

*Software for GPS/GLONASS tracking and fleet management
*Gurtam Maps [[geographic information system]]
*GPS/GLONASS hardware integration with Wialon system (currently 1200+ types of equipment)

*Task-specific solutions for company's clients
*Customized Wialon-based apps

The most popular Gurtam services are Wialon Hosting (SaaS) and Wialon Local (server-based solution). 
The company has also developed GPS-Trace — a free service for personal tracking. It’s particularly used to monitor the location of employees, relatives and domestic animals.

Gurtam constantly participates in industrial expos and events worldwide including [[CeBIT]], [[Mobile World Congress|GSMA Mobile World Congress]], Securex South Africa&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.securex.co.za/ Securex South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt;, Expo Seguridad Mexico&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exposeguridadmexico.com/ Expo Seguridad Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;, [[CTIA (organization)|CTIA]], [[GITEX]], Telematics Conference SE Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telematics-conference.com/ Telematics Conference SE Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

Since 2017 Gurtam is focused on the active development and the implementation of the back-end product flespi  — PaaS solution offered for managing telematics data. By the moment flespi was released no other counterparts existed.

      <comment>/* Dryden in 1670 */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">[[Image:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]], who formulated and wrote the heroic drama in the 1670s.]]
'''Heroic drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era in [[England]], distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Waith, ''Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England'', London, Routledge, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Canfield, ''Heroes and States: On the Ideology of Restoration Tragedy'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Emperour]]'' ([[1665 in literature|1665]]) and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery| Roger Boyle's]] ''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' ([[1667 in literature|1667]]) were key developments.

==Dryden in 1670==
The term "heroic drama" was invented by Dryden for his play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' ([[1670 in literature|1670]]).  For the ''Preface'' to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of ''[[epic poetry]]'' for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays.  Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.

First, the play should be composed in [[heroic verse]] (closed couplets in iambic pentameter).  Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters.  Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like [[Achilles]], dominating even when wrong.  ''The Conquest of Granada'' followed all of these rules.  The story was that of the national foundation of [[Spain]] (and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.

Dryden's ''Conquest of Granada'' is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called ''All for Love'', 1678) of Shakespeare's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (''The Rival Queens'') and Thomas Otway, whose ''Venice Preserved'' is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's ''The Rehearsal'' and Henry Fielding's ''The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great''

==Other dramatists==
"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits."&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, ''English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1642&amp;ndash;1780'', New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration plays by Sir [[William Davenant]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[Nathaniel Lee]], [[John Crowne]], [[Elkanah Settle]], and [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]], and later works by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and [[Joseph Addison]], have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Nettleton, pp. 24-9; Waith, pp. 235-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heroic drama in literary criticism==
Today, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from [[Classical literature|Classical]] critics.  There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from [[France]] (particularly those of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]) did not match English theatrical history or practice.  The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from [[Thomas Rymer]], who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage.  [[Aristotle]] had only spoken of [[satire]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[tragedy]], and [[Horace]] also wrote only of [[comedy]], tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature.  He was attempting his own neo-classicism.  The [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had divided Shakespeare's plays into "history," "tragedy," and "comedy," but these terms were stretched.  Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. 

==Satirical response==
[[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and others satirized heroic drama in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''.  The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward.  Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.

Buckingham's criticism of Dryden in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'' is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's ''personal'' interest in creating a "pure" drama.  The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.

Rye Neck School District |vol=73 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=454 |pinpoint= |court=2d. Cir. |date=1996 |url=https://openjurist.org/73/f3d/454 |accessdate=2017-09-26 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] case involving the petitioner, a boy named Daniel Immediato and his parents, Eugene and Diane Immediato, against the respondent, [[Rye Neck High School|Rye Neck School District]] in the village of [[Mamaroneck (village), New York|Mamaroneck, New York]]. The court held that the school district did not violate Immediato's rights by requiring him to perform [[community service]].

== Background ==
Daniel Immediato felt that the school district's policy of establishing mandatory [[community service]] was in violation of his [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights. The school district required that 40 hours of community service be completed to graduate with no exceptions. Regulations on what could be done for community service were fairly lax, as all work for non-profit organizations with the exception of religious organizations that did no charitable work was accepted as community service. As part of a mandatory senior-year course, students had to complete a form about what community service they did and how it benefited them, and afterwards discuss it with the class. Certain goals had to be reached by certain periods of the senior year.

== Complaint ==
Immediato brought forth the following charges: "Specifically, they assert that the program: (1) imposes involuntary servitude upon Daniel, in violation of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]; (2) infringes on Daniel's parents' [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] right to direct his upbringing and education; (3) infringes on Daniel's personal liberty, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (4) violates Daniel's right to privacy, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment."&lt;ref name="COA"/&gt;

== Result ==
The school district denied that any violation was made and argued that the court should abstain because of the ruling of ''[[Burford v. Sun Oil Co.]]'' (that federal court should not hear any case involving complicated state laws that deal with policy issues)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Burford v. Sun Oil Co. |vol=319 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=315 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1943 |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/319/315/case.html |accessdate=2017-09-26 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The court decided against this ''Burford'' [[abstention]] but found that none of the charges were true. Immediato proceeded to appeal using the same charges. Immediato's arguments were found to be invalid, and the court stuck with their ruling that the school district did not violate any of Daniel or his parents' [[Constitutional]] rights in imposing community service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2775">The '''Indian Institute Library''' is a dependent library of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and part of the [[University of Oxford]] in [[Oxford]], England. Opened in 1886, the library specialises in the history and culture of [[South Asia]], [[Tibet]] and the [[Himalayas]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodleian Library: Department of Oriental Collections: 'Indian Institute Library', http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/oriental/iil.htm, accessed 2007-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indian Institute]] and its library were originally based in the building now occupied by the History Faculty Library, on the corner of [[Holywell Street|Holywell]] and [[Catte Street]]. (The History Faculty moved to a location on [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]] in 2007, although the History Faculty Library remained in the old Indian Institute building) Traces of the building's original function are still visible, including the gilded [[weathervane]] which depicts an elephant with a [[howdah]].

In 1968, the library was relocated to a newly constructed 'penthouse' on the roof of the New [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] building. The move was not without controversy, since the original building had been constructed with the express intention of providing a permanent home to the institute.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University History Faculty, 'History of the faculty building', http://163.1.10.19/resources/building.htm, accessed 2007-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The library remains on the top floor of the Bodleian, which results in the strange situation of a lending library being based within a reference library. The library's collection is of international importance and includes over 100,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford: South Asian Studies, http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/postgraduate/caz/sout.shtml, accessed 2007-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 60% of these are catalogued on [[Oxford Libraries Information System|OLIS]], the [[Online Public Access Catalogue|Oxford University library catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Library Services: Library Guide, 'Indian Institute Library', http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/libraries/guides/IND.html, accessed 2007-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone wishing to use the library must either be a student at the [[University of Oxford]], or obtain a reader's card from the [[Bodleian Library]]. The library's reading room was closed on September 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/finding-resources/rooms/iirr&lt;/ref&gt; To access the books, readers have to request their delivery to other reading rooms of the Bodleian library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">'''Inflicted insight''' is a possible consequence for subjects participating in certain kinds of research.  It occurs when the subject is given insight into his or her flaws through his or her participation in an experiment, often unexpectedly or causing emotional pain.  It is especially likely in social and psychological research and especially when that research involves deception of the subject by the researcher.&lt;ref name="levine225"&gt;{{cite book| last = Levine| first = Robert| title = Ethics and regulation of clinical research| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NmkWW05RBOcC&amp;pg=PA218| accessdate = 2009-12-28| year = 1988| publisher = Yale University Press| isbn = 0-300-04288-4| page = 225 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Milgram experiment]] is a well-known example of an experiment with a very high potential for inflicted insight.  Through their participation in the experiment, many subjects realized that they were capable of committing acts of extreme violence on other human beings.  After having this realization, many subjects experienced prolonged symptoms of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Levine| first = Robert| title = Ethics and regulation of clinical research| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NmkWW05RBOcC&amp;pg=PA218| accessdate = 2009-12-28| year = 1988| publisher = Yale University Press| isbn = 0-300-04288-4| page = 218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
(However, 84 percent of former participants surveyed later said they were "glad" or "very glad" to have participated.)&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, Stanley. (1974), "The Perils of Obedience." Harper's Magazine. Abridged and adapted from Obedience to Authority. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Deceptive [[Debriefing#Psychological research|debriefing]] is one method for avoiding inflicted insight in psychological experiments, although it is considered ethically questionable in and of itself.&lt;ref name=levine225 /&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]]'s guidelines for ethical experimentation strongly discourage experiments where deceptive debriefing is the only alternative to inflicted insight.  However, such experiments may be deemed ethically acceptable if they are counterbalanced by other ethical concerns.&lt;ref name=levine225 /&gt;

{{Democracy}}
{{Politics of the United States}}
'''Jacksonian democracy''' is a 19th-century [[political philosophy]] in the [[United States]] that espoused greater [[democracy]] for the common man as that term was then defined. Originating with the seventh [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Jackson]] and his supporters, it became the nation's dominant political worldview for a generation.

This era, called the Jacksonian Era (or [[Second Party System]]) by [[historians]] and [[political scientists]], lasted roughly from Jackson's 1828 election as president until [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] became the dominant issue in 1854 and the [[American Civil War]] dramatically reshaped American politics. It emerged when the long-dominant [[Democratic-Republican Party]] became factionalized around 1824. Jackson's supporters began to form the modern [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and rivals [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Henry Clay]], created the [[National Republican Party]], which would soon combine with other anti-Jackson elements to form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].

Broadly speaking, the era was characterized by a democratic spirit and built upon Jackson's equal political policy (subsequent to ending what he termed a "monopoly" of government by elites). Even before the Jacksonian era began, [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage]] had been extended to a majority of white male adult citizens, a result the Jacksonians celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], pp. 15, 36. "These figures suggest that by 1820 more than half of adult white males were casting votes, except in those states that still retained property requirements or substantial tax requirements for the franchise – Virginia, Rhode Island (the two states that maintained property restrictions through 1840), and New York as well as Louisiana."&lt;/ref&gt; Jacksonian democracy also promoted the strength of the presidency and executive branch at the expense of Congress, while also seeking to broaden the public's participation in government. The Jacksonians demanded elected (not appointed) judges and rewrote many [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] to reflect the new values. In national terms, they favored geographical expansion, justifying it in terms of [[manifest destiny]]. There was usually a consensus among both Jacksonians and Whigs that battles over slavery should be avoided.

Jackson's expansion of democracy was largely limited to Americans of European descent and voting rights were extended to adult white males only. There was little or no progress (and in some cases, regression) for the rights of  African Americans and Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Warren1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Mark E.|title=Democracy and Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KepLD0MXbhYC&amp;pg=PA166|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521646871|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's biographer [[Robert V. Remini]] argues: 

{{quote|[Jacksonian Democracy] stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable. ... As such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in American history—Populism, Progressivism, the New and Fair Deals, and the programs of the New Frontier and Great Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert V. Remini|title=The Life of Andrew Jackson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkhmdWo95BsC&amp;pg=PA307|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|page=307|isbn=9780062116635}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Philosophy==

===General principles===
William S. Belko in 2015 summarizes "the core concepts underlying Jacksonian Democracy" as:
:equal protection of the laws; an aversion to a moneyed aristocracy, exclusive privileges, and monopolies, and a predilection for the common man; majority rule; and the welfare of the community over the individual.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Belko, "'A Tax On The Many, To Enrich A Few': Jacksonian Democracy Vs. The Protective Tariff." ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'' 37.2 (2015): 277-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], in 1945  argues Jacksonian democracy was built on the following:&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., ''The Age of Jackson'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Universal manhood suffrage|Expanded suffrage]] – The Jacksonians believed that voting rights should be extended to all white men. By the end of the 1820s, attitudes and state laws had shifted in favor of [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal manhood suffrage]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 14. "Property- or tax-based qualifications were most strongly entrenched in the original thirteen states, and dramatic political battles took place at a series of prominent state constitutional conventions held during the late 1810s and 1820s."&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1856 all requirements to own property and nearly all requirements to pay taxes had been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], pp. 16, 35. "By 1840, only three states retained a property qualification, North Carolina (for some state-wide offices only), Rhode Island, and Virginia. In 1856 North Carolina was the last state to end the practice. Tax-paying qualifications were also gone in all but a few states by the Civil War, but they survived into the 20th century in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'' (2nd ed. 2009) p 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Manifest destiny]] – This was the belief that Americans had a destiny to settle the [[American West]] and to expand control from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and that the West should be settled by [[yeoman]] farmers. However, the [[Free Soil]] Jacksonians, notably [[Martin Van Buren]], argued for limitations on slavery in the new areas to enable the [[Poor White|poor white man]] to flourish''—''they split with the main party briefly in 1848. The Whigs generally opposed Manifest Destiny and expansion, saying the nation should build up its cities.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Manifest Destiny'' (Greenwood Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Patronage]] – Also known as the [[spoils system]], patronage was the policy of placing political supporters into appointed offices. Many Jacksonians held the view that rotating political appointees in and out of office was not only the right, but also the duty of winners in political contests. Patronage was theorized to be good because it would encourage political participation by the common man and because it would make a politician more accountable for poor government service by his appointees. Jacksonians also held that long tenure in the civil service was corrupting, so civil servants should be rotated out of office at regular intervals. However, patronage often led to the hiring of incompetent and sometimes corrupt officials due to the emphasis on party loyalty above any other qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ostrogorski, ''Democracy and the Party System in the United States'' (1910)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Strict constructionism]] – Like the [[Jeffersonian Democracy|Jeffersonians]] who strongly believed in the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], Jacksonians initially favored a federal government of limited powers. Jackson said that he would guard against "all encroachments upon the legitimate sphere of State sovereignty". However, he was not a [[states' rights]] extremist''—''indeed, the [[Nullification Crisis]] would find Jackson fighting against what he perceived as state encroachments on the proper sphere of federal influence. This position was one basis for the Jacksonians' opposition to the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. As the Jacksonians consolidated power, they more often advocated expanding federal power, presidential power in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Forrest McDonald, ''States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776–1876'' (2002) pp 97-120&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' – Complementing a strict construction of the Constitution, the Jacksonians generally favored a hands-off approach to the economy as opposed to the Whig program sponsoring modernization, railroads, banking and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;William Trimble, "The social philosophy of the Loco-Foco democracy." ''American Journal of Sociology'' 26.6 (1921): 705-715. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2764332 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Hartz, ''Economic Policy and Democratic Thought: Pennsylvania, 1776–1860'' (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; The chief spokesman amongst ''laissez-faire'' advocates was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]] of the [[Locofocos]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, "William Leggett, Spokesman of Jacksonian Democracy." ''Political Science Quarterly'' 58.4 (1943): 581-594. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2144949 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. White, "William Leggett: Jacksonian editorialist as classical liberal political economist." ''History of Political Economy'' 18.2 (1986): 307-324.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Banking in the Jacksonian Era|Opposition to banking]] – In particular, the Jacksonians opposed government-granted monopolies to banks, especially the national bank, a central bank known as the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Jackson said: "The bank is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!" and he did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Melvin I. Urofsky|title=The American Presidents: Critical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBa6WQ5XCowC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=106|isbn=9780203008805}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs, who strongly supported the Bank, were led by [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], the bank chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Bray Hammond, ''Banks and Politics in America, From the Revolution to the Civil War'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson himself was opposed to all banks because he believed they were devices to cheat common people''—''he and many followers believed that only gold and silver should be used to back currency, rather than the integrity of a bank.

===Election by the "common man"===
[[File:Andrew Jackson.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Andrew Jackson]] by [[Thomas Sully]] in 1824]]
An important movement in the period from 1800 to 1830—before the Jacksonians were organized—was the expansion of the right to vote toward including all men.&lt;ref&gt;Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'' (2009) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt; Older states with property restrictions dropped them, namely all but [[Rhode Island]], [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]] by the mid 1820s. No new states had property qualifications although three had adopted tax-paying qualifications—[[Ohio]], [[Louisiana]] and [[Mississippi]], of which only in Louisiana were these significant and long lasting.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The process was peaceful and widely supported, except in the state of Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, the [[Dorr Rebellion]] of the 1840s demonstrated that the demand for equal suffrage was broad and strong, although the subsequent reform included a significant property requirement for anyone resident but born outside of the United States. However, free black men lost voting rights in several states during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-90499-1|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that a man was now legally allowed to vote did not necessarily mean he routinely voted. He had to be pulled to the polls, which became the most important role of the local parties. They systematically sought out potential voters and brought them to the polls. Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of adult male population in the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;William G. Shade, "The Second Party System". in Paul Kleppner, et al. ''Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983) pp 77-111&lt;/ref&gt; Tax-paying qualifications remained in only five states by 1860 – Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEngerman2005|Engerman]], p. 35. Table 1&lt;/ref&gt;

One innovative strategy for increasing voter participation and input was developed outside the Jacksonian camp. Prior to the [[United States presidential election, 1832|presidential election of 1832]], the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] conducted the nation's first [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating convention]]. Held in Baltimore, Maryland, September 26–28, 1831, it transformed the process by which political parties select their presidential and vice-presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;William Preston Vaughn, ''The Anti-Masonic Party in the United States: 1826–1843'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factions===
[[File:1832bank1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] cartoon from 1833 shows Jackson destroying the Bank with his "Order for the Removal", to the annoyance of Bank President [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], shown as the Devil himself. Numerous politicians and editors who were given favorable loans from the Bank run for cover as the financial temple crashes down. A famous fictional character [[Major Jack Downing]] (right) cheers: "Hurrah! Gineral!"]]
The period from 1824 to 1832 was politically chaotic. The [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[First Party System]] were dead and with no effective opposition, the old [[Democratic-Republican Party]] withered away. Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines. Political coalitions formed and dissolved and politicians moved in and out of alliances.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. McCormick, ''The Second American Party System: Party Formation in the Jacksonian Era'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most former Republicans supported [[Andrew Jackson|Jackson]], while others such as [[Henry Clay]] opposed him. Most former Federalists, such as [[Daniel Webster]], opposed Jackson, although some like [[James Buchanan]] supported him. In 1828, [[John Quincy Adams]] pulled together a network of factions called the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], but he was defeated by Jackson. By the late 1830s, the Jacksonian Democrats and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] politically battled it out nationally and in every state.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Holt, ''Political Parties and American Political Development: From the Age of Jackson to the Age of Lincoln'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formed the Democratic Party==

===Jacksonian democracy===
[[File:The modern balaam and his ass.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|1837 cartoon plays on "Jackson" and "jackass", showing the Democratic Party as a donkey, which remains its cartoon symbol into the 21st century]]
The spirit of Jacksonian democracy animated the party from the early 1830s to the 1850s, shaping the era, with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] the main opposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Benson]] in 1957 dated the era from 1827 to 1853, with 1854 as the start of a new era. {{cite book|author=Lee Benson|title=The Concept of Jacksonian Democracy: New York as a Test Case|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xk59BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|year=2015|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The new [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] became a coalition of poor farmers, city-dwelling laborers and [[Irish Catholic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The new party was pulled together by [[Martin Van Buren]] in 1828 as Jackson crusaded against the corruption of President [[John Quincy Adams]]. The new party (which did not get the name Democrats until 1834) swept to a landslide. As Mary Beth Norton explains regarding 1828:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcaiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA348|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=348|display-authors=etal|isbn=9781285974675}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The platforms, speeches and editorials were founded upon a broad consensus among Democrats. As Norton et al. explain:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed a central government as the enemy of individual liberty and they believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual—the artisan and the ordinary farmer—by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States, Volume I: To 1877|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fPPVID_ilN0C&amp;pg=PA327|year=2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=327|display-authors=etal|isbn=0618947167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson vetoed more legislation than all previous presidents combined. The long-term effect was to create the modern strong presidency.&lt;ref&gt;John Yoo, "Andrew Jackson and Presidential Power." ''Charleston Law Review'' 2 (2007): 521+ [http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1686&amp;context=facpubs online].&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. However, Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform and the establishment of a public education system. For instance, they believed that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools.

Jackson looked at the Indian question in terms of military and legal policy, not as a problem due to their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Francis Paul |last=Prucha |title=Andrew Jackson's Indian policy: a reassessment |journal=[[Journal of American History]] |year=1969 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=527–539 |jstor=1904204 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, Jackson adopted and treated as his own son a three-year-old Indian orphan—seeing in him a fellow orphan that was "so much like myself I feel an unusual sympathy for him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Paul Rogin|title=Fathers and Children: Andrew Jackson and the Subjugation of the American Indian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-I4DTLVXhAEC&amp;pg=PA189|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=189|isbn=9781412823470}}&lt;/ref&gt; In legal terms, when it became a matter of state sovereignty versus tribal sovereignty he went with the states and moved the Indians to fresh lands with no white rivals in what became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].

Among the leading followers was [[Stephen A. Douglas]], senator from Illinois, who was the key player in the passage of the compromise of 1850, and was a leading contender for the 1852 Democratic presidential nomination.  According to his biographer Robert W. Johanssen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Douglas was preeminently a Jacksonian, and his adherence to the tenants of what became known as Jacksonian democracy grew as his own career developed. ... Popular rule, or what he called would later call popular sovereignty, lay at the base of his political structure. Like most Jacksonians, Douglas believed that the people spoke through the majority, that the majority will was the expression of the popular will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Walter Johannsen|title=Stephen A. Douglas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCzhaQTh5SEC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1973|publisher=University of Illinois Press|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Reforms===
Jackson fulfilled his promise of broadening the influence of the citizenry in government, although not without vehement controversy over his methods.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Cole, ''The Presidency of Andrew Jackson'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacksonian policies included ending the bank of the United States, expanding westward and [[Indian removal|removing]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] from the Southeast. Jackson was denounced as a tyrant by opponents on both ends of the political spectrum such as [[Henry Clay]] and [[John C. Calhoun]]. This led to the rise of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].

Jackson created a [[spoils system]] to clear out elected officials in government of an opposing party and replace them with his supporters as a reward for their electioneering. With Congress controlled by his enemies, Jackson relied heavily on the power of the veto to block their moves.

One of the most important of these was the [[Maysville Road veto]] in 1830. A part of Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], the bill would have allowed for federal funding of a project to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River, the entirety of which would be in the state of Kentucky, Clay's home state. His primary objection was based on the local nature of the project. He argued it was not the federal government's job to fund projects of such a local nature and or those lacking a connection to the nation as a whole. The debates in Congress reflected two competing visions of federalism. The Jacksonians saw the union strictly as the cooperative aggregation of the individual states, while the Whigs saw the entire nation as a distinct entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Naomi |last=Wulf |title='The Greatest General Good': Road Construction, National Interest, and Federal Funding in Jacksonian America |journal=European Contributions to American Studies |year=2001 |volume=47 |pages=53–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Lane argues "securing national debt freedom was a core element of Jacksonian democracy." Paying off the national debt was a high priority which would make a reality of the Jeffersonian vision of America truly free from rich bankers, self-sufficient in world affairs, virtuous at home, and administered by a small government not prone to financial corruption or payoffs.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Lane, "The elimination of the national debt in 1835 and the meaning of Jacksonian democracy." ''Essays in Economic &amp; Business History'' 25 (2012) pp. 67-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

What became of  Jacksonian Democracy, according to [[Sean Wilentz]] was diffusion. Many ex-Jacksonians turned their crusade against the Money Power into one against the Slave Power and became Republicans.  He points to the struggle over the [[Wilmot Proviso]] of 1846, the [[Free Soil Party]] revolt of 1848, and the mass defections from the Democrats in 1854 over the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]].  Others Jacksonian leaders such as Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] endorsed slavery through the 1857 Dred Scott decision.  Southern Jacksonians overwhelmingly endorsed secession in 1861, apart from a few opponents led by [[Andrew Johnson]]. In the North, Jacksonians Stephen A. Douglas and the [[War Democrat]]s fiercely opposed secession, while  Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan and the [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] did not.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Wilentz, "Politics, Irony, and the Rise of American Democracy." ''Journal of The Historical Society'' 6.4 (2006): 537-553, at p. 538, summarizing his book ''The rise of American democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln''  (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacksonian Presidents==
In addition to Jackson, his second Vice President and one of the key organizational leaders of the Jacksonian Democratic Party, [[Martin Van Buren]], served as President. Van Buren was defeated in the next election by [[William Henry Harrison]]. Harrison died just 30 days into his term and his Vice President [[John Tyler]] quickly reached accommodation with the Jacksonians. Tyler was then succeeded by [[James K. Polk]], a Jacksonian who won the [[United States presidential election, 1844|election of 1844]] with Jackson's endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/polk-life-in-brief |title=James K. Polk: Life in Brief |publisher=''Miller Center'' |access-date=June 16, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613200716/http://millercenter.org/president/biography/polk-life-in-brief |archivedate=June 13, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franklin Pierce]] had been a supporter of Jackson as well. [[James Buchanan]] served in Jackson's administration as Minister to Russia and as Polk's Secretary of State, but he did not pursue Jacksonian policies. Finally, [[Andrew Johnson]], who had been a strong supporter of Jackson, became President following the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, but by then Jacksonian democracy had been pushed off the stage of American politics.

President [[Donald Trump]] has also been characterized as a Jacksonian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-01-20/jacksonian-revolt&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, he had the portrait of Andrew Jackson moved into the Oval Office and has criticized the movement to replace Jackson's portrait on the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|$20 bill]] with that of [[Harriet Tubman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-jackson-leadership-2017-5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9537">{{about|the certification process for employment-based visas for permanent residency|the corresponding process for the [[H-1B visa]] and similar visas|Labor Condition Application}}

'''Labor certification''' (not to be confused with the [[H-1B visa#Labor Condition Application|Labor Condition Application]] - LCA) is a [[United States of America]] immigration process step. Its stated goal is to "[[protectionism|protect]] U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers".&lt;ref name=USCIS-FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Entrepreneurs and the Employment-Based Second Preference Immigrant Visa Category |url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=93da6b814ba81310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD |work=Employment-Based Second Preference Immigrant Visa Category |publisher=[[USCIS]] |accessdate=27 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AECma7EU?url=http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=93da6b814ba81310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD |archivedate=27 August 2012 |date=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several options available to US employers who wish to hire foreign, non-immigrant workers on a temporary but long-term basis:  [[H-1B visa]]s, [[L-1 visa]]s, [[TN status]] and other options.  These temporary options are often sufficient to meet the needs of employer and employee.  When a US employer wishes to hire the services of the [[foreign worker]] on a permanent basis, however, a complex sponsorship process for the [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] begins, a process that can take years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://immigrationroad.com/green-card-tracker.php|title=Green Card Tracker Based on USCIS and DOS Data}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally (although not always) the first step in that process is labor certification.  Labor certification is a process of proving that there are no qualified US workers for the position being offered.  If there are qualified US workers - in fact, even generally speaking if there are even ''minimally qualified'' US workers - then the foreign worker cannot be offered the position on a permanent basis.  This does not necessarily mean that the foreign worker will be immediately replaced by a qualified US worker, though.  The foreign worker can still serve out the remainder of their existing US temporary visa, and may well be able to re-apply for labor certification and be approved.  But it does create a substantial inconvenience for the US employer who wishes to hire a foreign worker, which does provide some protection to US workers, although the process is controversial.

==Reduction in recruitment==
The original labor certification process, used exclusively up until about 1998, involved a lengthy interview process, whereby instructions were provided after filing the case as to how the employer was to go about recruiting for the position.  After complying with those instructions, the employer needed to persuasively argue why any US applicants for the position were unqualified - otherwise the position would be denied.  Beginning in 1998, a more streamlined approach called ''Reduction in Recruitment'' (RIR) was introduced.  Under RIR, the sequence of events was reversed: the employer first did the recruiting, and then filed the case with evidence that no minimally qualified US workers could be found.

RIR tended to speed processing times up somewhat, so that labor certification times which were previously measured in years began to be measured in months.  Both regular and RIR labor certification involved filing first with the Department of Labor for the individual state where the job was located (the individual state presumably being most familiar with local labor market conditions) and then, if approved at the state level, the case was then transferred to the federal Department of Labor for final approval.

==Program electronic review management==
In March 2005 a completely electronic labor certification system, '''[[PERM, labor certification|PERM]]''' (Program Electronic Review Management) came into use.  PERM is intended to reduce labor certification times to under 60 days.  However, PERM may be creating as many backlogs as it is intended to solve.  Because of congressionally mandated annual quotas, there may not be enough visas available to grant [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green cards]] to everyone who is approved by PERM, which may have played a role in the retrogression of [[priority date]]s on September 13, 2005.

The standards used in making labor certification determinations under the PERM system will be based on:

1) whether there are not sufficient United States workers who are able, willing, qualified and available; 
2) whether the employment of the alien will have an adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of United States workers similarly employed; and
3) whether the employer has met the procedural requirements of the regulations.

The employer has the option of filing an PERM application electronically (using web-based forms and instructions) or by mail. However, the Department of Labor recommends that employers file electronically. Not only is electronic filing faster, but it will also ensure the employer has provided all required information, as an electronic application can not be submitted if the required fields are not completed. Employers will not be permitted to submit PERM applications by FAX.

The employer must recruit under the standards for professional occupations, if the occupation involved is on the list of occupations, published in the PERM regulation, for which a bachelors or higher degree is a customary requirement.

For all other occupations not normally requiring a bachelor's or higher degree, employers can simply recruit under the requirements for nonprofessional occupations. Although the occupation involved in a labor certification application may be a nonprofessional occupation, the regulations do not prohibit employers from conducting more recruitment than is specified for such occupations. Therefore, if the employer is uncertain whether an occupation is considered professional or not, the employer is advised to conduct recruitment for a professional occupation.

==Controversy==
As with many immigration procedures, labor certification tends to be controversial.  Its backers argue that it is a rigorous procedure for determining that only foreign workers who truly have skills needed by the US labor market and not readily available locally are hired.  Its critics, however, say that US employers will first hire a foreigner on a long-term temporary visa, and then try to tailor the job description so that that foreigner is the only person who could possibly be hired - thus gaming the labor certification process to guarantee a favorable outcome.  However, the job requirements, as described by the petitioning employer in the labor certification application, must represent the employer’s actual minimum requirements for the job opportunity.  Those job requirements described on a labor certification application are reviewed and evaluated closely by the Department of Labor in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations that sets forth the standards for determining the appropriate requirements for a job opportunity.  Ultimately, the employer must prove that they have not hired workers with less training or experience for jobs substantially comparable to that involved in the job opportunity.

==Differences with labor condition application==

{{further|Labor Condition Application}}

Labor certification should not be confused with the [[Labor Condition Application]], the corresponding process for temporary work visas. The differences are presented in table form below:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Attribute !! Labor Condition Application !! Labor certification
|-
| Type of visa || Temporary work visa: H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 || Employment-based visa (such as [[EB-2 visa]], or [[EB-3 visa]]) that provides a path to permanent residency (a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|Green Card]])
|-
| Typical time for approval || Less than a week || 6-24 months
|-
| Burden of proof || The employer needs to demonstrate that the worker is being paid at least the prevailing wage for that region and occupation, and comparable to native workers in the firm, and that employing the worker will not adversely affect current workers. The employer does ''not'' need to demonstrate that there is no qualified native U.S. worker for the job. || The employer needs to demonstrate that there is no qualified U.S. worker willing to do the job at a comparable wage, and needs to have made a good-faith effort to recruit a native U.S. worker.

'''"Makes the Whole World Kin"''' is a [[short story]] written by [[O. Henry]] (a [[pen name]] for William Sydney Porter), allegedly at [[Pete's Tavern]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frommers.com/destinations/newyorkcity/N24455.html&lt;/ref&gt; on Irving Place in [[New York City]].

==Plot==
The story starts with a young thief walking through a neighbourhood,  scouting for his next house. The thief is described as an ordinary man, with no extreme tendencies.

{{quote|The burglar wore a blue sweater. The police would have been baffled had they
attempted to classify him. They have not yet heard of the respectable,
unassuming burglar who is neither above nor below his station. He wore no masks, dark
lanterns, or gum shoes.
This burglar of the third class began to prowl. He carried a 88-calibre revolver in his pocket,
and he chewed peppermint gum thoughtfully.}}&lt;ref name=ShortStoryText&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Once he finds a respectable house, the thief climbs inside through an open window. Once inside, he scouts for valuable items. He discovers, to his amazement, that a light had been left on inside one of the bedrooms. As he walks inside, he finds an old man lying in bed, asleep. The thief wakes the man and instructs  him to raise his hands.  The old man can only lift one arm and proceeds to inform the thief that he suffers from [[rheumatism]]. The thief, shocked at what he hears, lowers the gun and tells his victim that he as well, suffers from the disease. They proceed to exchange words of comfort about the haunting [[pain]], and the young thief asks for tips to dull the [[swelling (medical)|swelling]]s. Though both are filled with hope, the old man warns the thief that the pain only gets worse and he must find a way to cope with it, in his later years. The old man, suggests that he have a [[drink]].&lt;ref name=ShortStoryText/&gt;

The young thief invites the old man for a drink at the local pub. He helps the old man get dressed and the two make their way for the bar. Outside the house, the old man realises that he has no money with him - the thief, kindly, offers to pay for the drinks.&lt;ref name=ShortStoryText/&gt;

==Adaptations==


===1962===
In 1962, [[Leonid Gaidai]] made a feature-length film [[Strictly Business (1962 film)|Strictly Business]], made up of three short stories based on O. Henry. The second segment was "Makes the Whole World Kin".&lt;ref name="ru.wikipedia.org"&gt;[[:ru:Деловые люди]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0056982|Delovye lyudi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film starred [[Yuri Nikulin]] as the young thief, and [[Rostislav Plyatt]] as the old man.&lt;ref name="ru.wikipedia.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ru.wikipedia.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0631994|Yuri Nikulin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0687735|Rostislav Plyatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of the film is shot in black and white and set during the early 1900s. The film uses the full dialogue from the original short story. Gaidai specifically chose actors with a more comedic background to [[satirize]] the pain that the thief and the old man have in common.

===2009===
In 2009, [[Sanzhar Sultanov]] adapted the screenplay into a modern-day version of Makes the Whole World Kin.&lt;ref name=ImdbSanzharSultanov&gt;{{IMDb name|3343487|Sanzhar Sultanov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ReversonFullStory&gt;
{{cite news
| url=http://reverson.ca/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1245150780&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=1&amp;_id=singlenews&amp;lang=en
| title=Full Story: Makes the Whole World Kin
| publisher=[[Reverson]]
| date=
| author=
| accessdate=2009-10-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film starred [[Paul Calderón]] as the old man and [[Alex Mills]] as the young thief.&lt;ref name="ImdbSanzharSultanov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ReversonFullStory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|3359558|Alex Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of the film is shot in color and set in modern-day times. Sultanov adapted the screenplay, making the dialogue more fitting to today's speech. Sultanov chose actors with a dramatic, [[method acting]] approach to display the truthful effect of [[rheumatic]] pain.

==Shakespeare==
In [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', Act III, Scene iii - Ulysses, speaking to Achilles says that ''"One Touch of Nature Makes the Whole World Kin"''.&lt;ref name=ShakespeareQuote&gt;
{{cite web
| url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/path/v04n06p176_one-touch-of-nature.htm
| title=One Touch of Nature Makes the Whole World Kin
| publisher=[[Theosophical University Press Online]]
| date=
| author=
| accessdate=2009-10-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this quote, Nature is defined as:

{{quote|conformity to that which is natural, as distinguished from that which is artificial, or forced, or remote from actual experience.
However, many critics argue that this conformity is one of "common failing" and uneasy love of novelty which all men share.}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/On/One+Touch+of+Nature+Makes+the+whole+World+Kin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this has become a famous speech of Ulysses and often quoted, it is a curious fact, and one on the whole redounding to the credit of humanity, that the line is never quoted in the sense in which Ulysses uses it.&lt;ref name=ShakespeareQuote/&gt;

{{quote|He is speaking of the readiness of mankind to forget past benefits, and to prize the glitter of a specious present rather than the true gold of that which has gone by. "The present eye praises the present object," says the wise old Greek, and there is one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin, that is, men's fondness for praising that which is new, though it be gilded dust, rather than that which is ancient, though it be gold that is somewhat dusty. "Then marvel not," he says to Achilles, "that all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax."

Curiously enough, the line is always quoted as exemplifying the sympathy that, once awakened, makes men feel their close relationship to each other. (1) "Nature" is taken as meaning fellow-feeling, one touch of which makes us all brothers. This unconscious misinterpretation, or rather misapplication, of the great poet's words shows us how innate the conviction is of the fact of our universal brotherhood.}}&lt;ref name=ShakespeareQuote/&gt;

The effects of '''[[malaria]]''' in the '''Caribbean''' represent an important chapter of the history of the region, due to its effects on the [[colonization]] of the islands and the corresponding impact on [[society]] and [[Economic system|economy]].

During the early exploration of the Caribbean islands, there was no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] of the local nativa population against diseases which were brought by [[European ethnic groups|European]] and African [[immigrants]]. Although the Caribbean today is considered “a tropical paradise”, the islands contributed a perfect level of [[moisture]] and [[heat]] to facilitate the spread of [[virus|viral]] and [[bacterium|bacterial]] organisms that led to the death of a large number of people. Because of the rare contact between races in the 15th century complete immunities were unable to be developed and those that were still caused some to be at least mildly affected by the disease. 

For example, before this time of [[exploration]] and travel, the Caribbean natives of the islands had never been exposed to [[malaria]]. Therefore, when the Europeans and African [[slaves]] began to inhabit the islands, the natives were greatly affected by it and died in astonishing numbers. Due to their genetics, the African slaves had somewhat of an advantage over the white, wealthy settlers: partial immunity was present to falciparum malaria. This malaria affected children and immigrants on some islands but not all. One contracts this disease by being bitten by an [[Anopheles]] [[mosquito]] which can be found on Africa and the Americas. Falciparum malaria sickens the human by attacking the human’s red blood cells and the parasite remains within the victim’s body for life which allows the cycle to continue. This malaria affected predominantly the adult European voyagers rather than predominantly the African slaves. 

The Caribbean countries whose inhabitants were the most affected were the [[Greater Antilles]] islands and other humid islands like [[Martinique]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Because Anopheles mosquitoes thrive mostly in areas of humidity and water, the disease was not found on islands such as the [[Bahamas]] and [[Antigua]]. Serving as somewhat of an enemy on the islands, malaria continued to attack the white settlers and prevent them from reaching their ultimate goals of exploration and wealth. The [[Creole peoples|Creole]]s felt, in this way, that diseases such as malaria were prevention tools from their territories being invaded by Europeans.

He has taught at the University of Illinois and the University of Oregon and lectured at several universities.

The focus of Falcoff's work is [[Latin America]] and related [[foreign relations of the United States|US policies]]. He has authored numerous publication on subjects ranging from the causes of the [[Juan Perón]] period of [[Argentina|Argentine]] politics to the controversial US handover of the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Panama]]. Many of his books are published in conjunction with AEI; the latest of these is ''Cuba the Morning After: Confronting Castro's Legacy'', which attempts to challenge common assumptions pertaining to [[Cuba-United States relations]] and the impact on Cuba of [[Fidel Castro]]'s eventual demise.

In a 2003 article for ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', Falcoff defended former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (who served as the head of the 1983 commission on Central America which Falcoff consulted) against claims, most notably made by [[Christopher Hitchens]] in ''[[The Trial of Henry Kissinger]]'', that Kissinger, as the US Secretary of State, was the chief architect for the [[Chilean coup of 1973]], and subsequent atrocities committed by the forces of [[President of Chile|President]] [[Augusto Pinochet]].

Falcoff's articles have appeared in a number of influential [[newspaper]]s and [[academic journal]]s, such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. He is currently Resident Scholar Emeritus of AEI.

'''''Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives''''' is an academic anthology edited by the American [[religious studies]] scholar Michael F. Strmiska which was published by [[ABC-CLIO]] in 2005. Containing eight separate papers produced by various scholars working in the field of [[Pagan studies]], the book examines different forms of [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] as practiced in Europe and North America. ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures'' was published as a part of ABC-CLIO's series of books entitled 'Religion in Contemporary Cultures', in which other volumes were dedicated to religious movements like [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]].

Edited by Strmiska, then a lecturer at [[Central Connecticut State University]] in [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Connecticut]], the volume contained contributions from scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds, some of whom were practicing Pagans themselves. In her paper, the American folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]] discussed "ethnic ambivalence" amongst the [[Italian American]] community in regards to the relationship between [[Stregheria]] and [[Wicca]], whilst the Irish folklorist Jenny Butler dealt with the place of contemporary [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]] in Ireland. In a paper co-written by Strmiska and Icelandic anthropologist Baldur A. Sigurvinsson, the religion of [[Asatru]] in both [[Iceland]] and the United States was compared, which is followed by a piece by British anthropologist Jenny Blain looking at the way in which British Heathens viewed sacred sites. The sixth paper, written by environmental studies scholar Adrian Ivakhiv, looked at Paganism in [[Ukraine]], whilst the seventh, co-written once more by Strmiska, this time with humanities scholar Vilius Rudra Dundzila, looked at [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]] in both [[Lithuania]] and the U.S. The final paper, produced by military veteran Stephanie Urquhart, looked at the acceptance of Pagans in the U.S. military.

Academic reviews were largely positive, praising the various papers for expanding the knowledge of Pagan studies by focusing on less well known religions like Romuva and Asatru rather than Wicca, the dominant Pagan faith to which the majority of literature in the field of Pagan studies had been devoted up until that point.

==Background==
Michael Strmiska had gained an MA in the Religions of India from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] before going on to gain a PhD in Religious Studies from [[Boston University]]. Proceeding to teach Comparative Religion and World History, he worked at universities in Lithuania, the United States and Japan, and at the time of ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures''' publication was lecturing in World History at [[Central Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Str(ed)05|Strmiska (ed.) 2005]]. p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strmiska decided to allow the contributing authors to choose whether they would use the term "Pagan" or "Neopagan" in reference to the contemporary religious movements, arguing that they should do so according to which term "is best suited to their topics."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Strmiska's "Comparative Perspectives"===
In his opening chapter, which shares its name with the book, Michael Strmiska discusses the significance of Paganism to the contemporary world, although notes that this volume deals specifically with the movement in Europe and North America, "in the belief that this regional focus provides a coherent frame of discussion with a number of intriguing commonalities and contrasts without degenerating into a global encyclopaedia."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that earlier studies of Pagan studies had focused primarily on the religion of Wicca and on the Pagan movement in the U.S. and U.K., Strmiska explained that in this volume, he had widened the geographical scope by focusing on forms of Paganism other than Wicca and on the movement in other parts of Europe and North America, such as in Canada, Ireland and Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeding to look at the various definitions of the terms "Pagan" and "Neopagan", Strmiska discusses why some contemporary westerners choose to adopt such terms when they have a pejorative meaning in western culture, concluding that not only was it an "appealing marker" in expressing their non-Christian beliefs, but that it also served to give them a sense of connection to ancient pre-Christian peoples and as "a deliberate act of defiance" against a Christian-dominated culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Str05|Strmiska 2005]]. pp. 4-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magliocco's "Italian American Stregheria and Wicca"===
The second paper in the volume was provided by the American folklorist [[Sabina Magliocco]], who had studied the Pagan community in the U.S. for a number of years, resulting in the publication of two books, ''Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: Making Things Work'' (2002) and ''[[Witching Culture|Witching Culture: Folklore and Neo-paganism in America]]'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mag02|Maglicco 2002]] and [[#Mag04|Magliocco 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's "Druidry in Contemporary Ireland"===
[[Image:Druids, in the early morning glow of the sun.jpg|thumb|250px|A group of Druids, members of the new religious movement which Jenny Butler studied.]]
In the book's third paper, the Irish folklorist [http://www.drjennybutler.com Jenny Butler], who was then studying for a PhD on Paganism in Ireland at the Department of Folklore and Ethnology at [[University College Cork]] and now based at the [http://www.ucc.ie/en/religion// UCC's Department of Study of Religions],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Str(ed)05|Strmiska (ed.) 2005]]. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the role of contemporary Druidry in the country.

==Reception and recognition==

===Academic reviews===
In a highly positive review published in ''[[The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies]]'', the religious studies scholar Nikki Bado-Fralick of [[Iowa State University]] described ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures'' as an "engaging and insightful look into several under-reported forms of European and North American Contemporary Paganism". Considering it to be "extremely well written, accessible, and organized", Bado-Fralick felt that the work made "a delightful addition to the growing body of first-rate scholarship on Contemporary Paganism." Praising the use of maps in the book, she felt however that "I found myself wishing for more detailed maps when authors referred to groups from specific counties or regional areas." Ultimately, Bado-Fralick considered the work to be "securely placed to become a mainstay of the Pagan scholar's bookshelf."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bad06|Bado-Fralick 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthology was also reviewed by Robert Ellwood of the [[University of Southern California]] for the ''[[Nova Religio]]'' journal, who considered it notable that it focused primarily on non-Wiccan variants of Paganism. Considering the work to be a "substantial contribution" to contemporary religious studies, he notes that the price of the volume will put many individuals off of purchasing it, but that he hoped most major libraries would acquire a copy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ell07|Ellwood 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was acquired by the Urartian King [[Ishpuinis of Urartu|Ishpuini]] ca. 800 BC (see the [[Kelashin Stele]]). The city's tutelary deity was [[Khaldi (god)|&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;Ḫaldi]].
The name Musasir in Akkadian means ''exit of the serpent''.

The city's location is not known with certainty, although there are a number of hypotheses, all in the general area of {{Coord|36|N|46|E|}}, in the [[Zagros]] south of [[Lake Urmia]]. [[François Thureau-Dangin]] tentatively located it at [[Mudjesir]], 10&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Topzawa]]. Reza Heidari, an archaeologist of the  "Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization" of Iran's [[West Azarbaijan Province]] claims  [[Rabat Tepe]] near [[Sardasht, West Azerbaijan|Sardasht]], [[Iran]] as the location of  Muṣaṣir.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeologynews.org/link.asp?ID=46900 Archaeologynews.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104247/http://www.archaeologynews.org/link.asp?ID=46900 |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple==
The '''Musasir temple''', built in 825 BC, was an important temple in Musasir, the holy city of [[Urartu]].  The Temple at Musasir appears in an [[Assyria]]n bas-relief which adorned the palace of [[Sargon II|King Sargon II]] at [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]], to commemorate his victory over "the seven kings of Urartu" in 714 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Garbis Armen 1992|page=16-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1802 - 1870) During the early 1850s, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Assyria]]n Excavation Fund entered the field under [[William Kennett Loftus]] and many antiquities and accurate drawings of wall sculptures were apportioned between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] Museum and the Louvre. However, a convoy of antiquities was attacked by [[Arab]] robbers while being shipped down the [[Tigris River]], and today lies buried somewhere in the bed of that river. That particular bas-relief was copied at its original location in the palace onto a drawing by Eugene Flandin(2) as Botta's chief artist.&lt;ref name="ByMark"&gt;Paul-Emile Botta's Excavations of 1843 By Mark A. Kalustian&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of Assyrian campaigns, the northern Araratian regions were governed by [[Sarduri II|Sarduri]]-and later by his son [[Rusa I|Rusa]] ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հրաչյա ''Hrachya'', according to [[Moses of Chorene|Movses Khorenatsi]]) with the capital at [[Tushpa]] ([[Classical Armenian]]: Տոսպ ''Tosp'') located near the great city and the capital of the mighty Kingdom of Urartu, [[Van, Turkey|Van]] (Biaina) on the eastern shore of [[Lake Van]]. Sarduri placed [[Urzana]] as the governor of the spiritual center of Urartu, the Temple of [[Khaldi (god)|Khaldi]] -- Musasir Ardini.&lt;ref name="ByMark" /&gt;

== Potential locations ==
*[[Altintepe]]: Since 1959, the Historical Society and the Department of Antiquities have conducted excavations in the Yerznka area, west of Karin. Here at Altintepe was revealed an [[Urartu|Urartian]] temple and other monuments. Only the foundations of the temple are in view. Obviously this is not the temple of Musasir as it is located far away from the concerned area.&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Review. June 1980, pp. 214-215 with illustration.

==Detention without trial: Section 1021==
The detention sections of the NDAA begin by "affirm[ing]" that the authority of the President under the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), a joint resolution passed in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], includes the power to detain, via the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], any person, including a [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizen]],&lt;ref name=csmonitor1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|title=Three myths about the detention bill|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/|publisher=[[Salon (website)]]|accessdate=16 November 2012|date=16 December 2012|quote=Section 1021, authorizes indefinite detention for the broad definition of "covered persons" […]. And that section does provide that "Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States." So that section contains a disclaimer regarding an intention to expand detention powers for U.S. citizens, but does so only for the powers vested by that specific section. More important, the exclusion appears to extend only to U.S. citizens "captured or arrested in the United States" — meaning that the powers of indefinite detention vested by that section apply to U.S. citizens captured anywhere abroad (there is some grammatical vagueness on this point, but at the very least, there is a viable argument that the detention power in this section applies to U.S. citizens captured abroad).}}&lt;/ref&gt; "who was part of or substantially supported [[al-Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]], or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners", and anyone who commits a "belligerent act" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, "without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the [AUMF]". The text authorizes trial by [[military tribunal]], or "transfer to the custody or control of the person's country of origin", or transfer to "any other foreign country, or any other foreign entity".&lt;ref&gt;112th Congress, 1st Session, H1540CR.HSE: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012."] pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing previous conflicts with the [[Obama Administration]] regarding the wording of the Senate text, the Senate–House compromise text, in sub-section 1021(d), also affirms that nothing in the Act "is intended to limit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force". The final version of the bill also provides, in sub-section(e), that "Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States". As reflected in Senate debate over the bill, there is a great deal of controversy over the status of existing law.&lt;ref name="Savage"/&gt;

An amendment to the Act that would have replaced current text with a requirement for executive clarification of detention authorities was rejected by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/national-security/senate-poised-pass-indefinite-detention-without-charge-or-trial "Senate Poised to Pass Indefinite Detention Without Charge or Trial"], ''[[American Civil Liberties Union]]'', December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Senator [[Carl Levin]], "the language which precluded the application of section 1031 to American Citizens was in the bill that we originally approved in the Armed Services Committee and the Administration asked us to remove the language which says that U.S. citizens and lawful residents would not be subject to this section".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/302754-1 Senate Session – C-SPAN Video Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Senator refers to section 1021 as "1031" because it was section 1031 at the time of his speaking.

==Requirement for military custody: Section 1022==
[[File:Camp x-ray detainees.jpg|left|thumb|Detainees upon arrival at [[Camp X-Ray (Guantanamo)|Camp X-Ray]], January 2002. In May 2006, the UN Committee against Torture condemned prisoners' treatment at Guantánamo Bay, noting that indefinite detention constitutes per se a violation of the UN Convention Against Torture.]]
All persons arrested and detained according to the provisions of section 1021, including those detained on U.S. soil, whether detained indefinitely or not, are required to be held by the [[United States Armed Forces]]. The law affords the option to have U.S. citizens detained by the armed forces but this requirement does not extend to them, as with foreign persons. Lawful resident aliens may or may not be required to be detained by the Armed Forces, "on the basis of conduct taking place within the United States".&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, Chris, "Military given go-ahead to detain US terrorist suspects without trial," ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 December 2011: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/americans-face-guantanamo-detention-obama?newsfeed=true].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Glenn, "Obama to sign indefinite detention bill into law," ''[[Salon.com]]'', 14 December 2011: [http://www.salon.com/2011/12/15/obama_to_sign_indefinite_detention_bill_into_law/].&lt;/ref&gt;

During debate on the senate floor, Levin stated that "Administration officials reviewed the draft language for this provision and recommended additional changes. We were able to accommodate those recommendations, except for the Administration request that the provision apply only to detainees captured overseas and there's a good reason for that. Even here, the difference is modest, because the provision already excludes all U.S. citizens. It also excludes lawful residents of United States, except to extent permitted by the constitution. The only covered persons left are those who are illegally in this country or on a tourist visa or other short-term basis. Contrary to some press statements, the detainee provisions in our bill do not include new authority for the permanent detention of suspected terrorists. Rather, the bill uses language provided by the Administration to codify existing authority that has been upheld in federal courts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/302754-1|title=Senate Session Nov. 17, 2011|publisher=C-Span|accessdate=16 June 2012|date=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions from the White House and Senate leading to the vote==
The White House threatened to veto the Senate version of the Act,&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"/&gt; arguing in an executive statement on November 17, 2011, that while "the authorities granted by the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], including the detention authority...are essential to our ability to protect the American people...(and) Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, the Administration does not believe codification is necessary and poses some risk".

The statement furthermore objected to the mandate for "military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects", which it called inconsistent with "the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets".&lt;ref name="whitehouse1"/&gt; The White House may now waive the requirement for military custody for some detainees following a review by appointed officials including the [[U.S. Attorney General|Attorney General]], the secretaries of state, defense and homeland security, the chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence.&lt;ref name="NYT28Feb"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/us/politics/obama-issues-waivers-on-military-trials-for-foreign-qaeda-suspects.html|title= Obama Issues Waivers on Military Custody for Terror Suspects|date=February 28, 2012 |work= New York Times |accessdate=March 18, 2012 |first=Charlie|last=Savage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During debate within the Senate and before the Act's passage, Senator [[Mark Udall]] introduced an amendment interpreted by the [[ACLU]]&lt;ref name="NDAA" /&gt; and some news sources&lt;ref name="denverpost1" /&gt; as an effort to limit military detention of American citizens indefinitely and without trial. The amendment proposed to strike the section "Detainee Matters" from the bill, and replace section 1021 (then titled 1031) with a provision requiring the Administration to clarify the Executive's authority to detain suspects on the basis of the 2001 [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-11-17/pdf/CREC-2011-11-17-pt1-PgS7716.pdf#page=13 Udall Amendment Text for SA 1107].&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was rejected by a vote of 60–38 (with 2 abstaining).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00210 U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 112th Congress – 1st Session]&lt;/ref&gt; Udall subsequently voted for the Act in the [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] that passed it, and though he remained "extremely troubled" by the detainee provisions, he promised to "push Congress to conduct the maximum amount of oversight possible".&lt;ref name="denverpost1"&gt;[http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2011/12/15/beltway-blog-despite-concerns-udall-gives-nod-to-defense-authorization-bill/50286/ "Despite concerns, Udall gives nod to Defense Authorization bill."] ''[[Denver Post]]'', December 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Signing Statement]], President Obama explained: "I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad, crucial services for service members and their families, and vital national security programs that must be renewed...I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=98513&amp;st=&amp;st1=#axzz1iE5qy7a3 |title=Barack Obama: Statement on Signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Americans have sought resistance of the NDAA through successful resolution campaigns in various states and municipalities. The states of Rhode Island and Michigan, the Colorado counties of Wade, El Paso, and Fremont, as well as the municipalities of Northampton, MA. and Fairfax, CA, have all passed resolutions rejecting the indefinite detention provisions of the NDAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NDAA: Liberty Preservation Act Tracking|url=http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/nullification/ndaa/|publisher=Tenth Amendment Center|accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bill of Rights Defense Committee]] has launched a [http://constitutioncampaign.org/campaigns/dueprocess/ national campaign] to mobilize individuals at the grassroots level to pass local and state resolutions voicing opposition to the NDAA.

Attorneys Carl J. Mayer and Bruce I. Afran filed a complaint January 13, 2012, in the Southern U.S. District Court in New York City on the behalf of [[Chris Hedges]] against Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta to challenge the legality of the Authorization for Use of Military Force as embedded in the latest version of the National Defense Authorization Act, signed by the president December 31.&lt;ref name="Hedges20120116"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hedges|first=Chris|title=Why I'm Suing Barack Obama|url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2012/01/16|publisher=Common Dreams|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Col.

===Views of the Obama Administration===
On December 31, 2011, and after signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 into law, President Obama issued a statement on it addressing "certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of terrorism suspects". In the statement the President maintains that "the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the 2001 AUMF". The statement also maintains that the "Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens", and that it "will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law". Referring to the applicability of civilian versus military detention, the statement argued that "the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa'ida poses is to remain relentlessly practical, guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each system. Otherwise, investigations could be compromised, our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized, and intelligence could be lost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=98513&amp;st=&amp;st1=#axzz1iE5qy7a3|title=Barack Obama: Statement on Signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|publisher=John T. Woolley and Gerhard Peters, The American Presidency Project [online]|date=December 31, 2011|accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 2012, the Administration represented by [[Jeh Charles Johnson]], [[General Counsel of the Department of Defense|General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Defense]] defined the term "associated forces". Johnson stated in a speech at [[Yale Law School]]:

{{quote|An "associated force," as we interpret the phrase, has two characteristics to it: (1) an organized, armed group that has entered the fight alongside al Qaeda, and (2) is a co-belligerent with al Qaeda in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. In other words, the group must not only be aligned with al Qaeda. It must have also entered the fight against the United States or its coalition partners. Thus, an "associated force" is not any terrorist group in the world that merely embraces the al Qaeda ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Jeh Charles|title=Jeh Johnson’s Speech on "National Security Law, Lawyers and Lawyering in the Obama Administration" – Dean’s Lecture at Yale Law School on February 22, 2012|url=http://www.cfr.org/national-security-and-defense/jeh-johnsons-speech-national-security-law-lawyers-lawyering-obama-administration/p27448|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=16 November 2012|date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 28, 2012, the administration announced that it would waive the requirement for military detention in "any case in which officials [believe] that placing a detainee in military custody could impede [[counterterrorism]] cooperation with the detainee's home government or interfere with efforts to secure the person's cooperation or confession".&lt;ref name="NYT28Feb" /&gt; Application of military custody to any suspect is determined by a national security team including the attorney general, the secretaries of state, defense, and homeland security, the chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and the [[Director of National Intelligence]].&lt;ref name="NYT28Feb" /&gt;

On September 12, 2012, U.S. District Judge [[Katherine B. Forrest]] issued an injunction against the indefinite detention provisions of the NDAA (section 1021(b)(2)) on the grounds of unconstitutionality; however, this injunction was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit the following day and was later reversed.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20120913"&gt;{{cite news|last=Van Voris|first=Bob|title=U.S. Appeals Order Blocking U.S. Military Detention Law|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/u-s-appeals-order-blocking-u-s-military-detention-law.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=14 September 2012|date=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters20120914"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz|first=Basil|title=REFILE-U.S. calls ruling on military detention law harmful|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/usa-security-lawsuit-idINL1E8KEEOP20120914?irpc=932|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=16 September 2012|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Administration explained on November 6, 2012, the terms "substantially supported" and "associated forces" in its opening brief before the U.S. Second Court of Appeals in ''[[Hedges v. Obama]]''.&lt;ref name="HVOBrief20121106"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/sites/govit/hedges.pdf|title=United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Case: 12-3644 Document: 69 11/06/2012 761770 Brief for the Appellants|first=|date=6 November 2012|website=|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2012|author1=Preet Bharara|author2=Benjamin H. Torrance|author3=Christopher B. Harwood|author4=Jeh Charles Johnson|author5=Stuart F. Delery|author6=Beth S. Brinkmann|author7=Robert M. Loeb|author8=August E. Flentje}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the term "substantially supported" the Obama administration stated:

{{quote|The term "substantial support" covers support that, in analogous circumstances in a traditional international armed conflict, is sufficient to justify detention. The term thus encompasses individuals who, even if not considered part of the irregular enemy forces at issue in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|the current conflict]], bear sufficiently close ties to those forces and provide them support that warrants their detention in prosecution of the conflict. See, e.g., [[Third Geneva Convention|Geneva Convention III]], Art. 4.A(4) (encompassing detention of individuals who "accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany"); Int'l Comm. Of the Red Cross Commentary on Third Geneva Convention 64 (Pictet, ed. 1960) (Art. 4(a)(4) intended to encompass certain "classes of persons who were more or less part of the armed force" while not members thereof); ''see also, e.g., Gov't Br. in Al Bihani v. Obama'', No. 99-5051, 2009 WL 2957826, at 41–42 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 15, 2009) (explaining that petitioner "was unequivocally part of" an enemy force, but even if he "was not part of enemy forces, he accompanied those forces on the battlefield and performed services (e.g. cooking, guard duty)" for them that justified military detention). Under those principles, the term "substantially support" cannot give rise to any reasonable fear that it will be applied to the types of independent journalism or advocacy at issue here. See March 2009 Mem. at 2 ("substantially support" does not include those who provide "unwitting or insignificant support" to al-Qaeda); ''cf. Bensayah'', 610 F.3d at 722, 725 ("purely independent conduct of a freelancer is not enough"). [...] the "substantial support" prong addresses actions like "plan[ning]  to take up arms against the United States" on behalf of al-Qaeda and  "facilitat[ing] the travel of unnamed others to do the same." Page 35-37, 61 in&lt;ref name="HVOBrief20121106" /&gt;}}

And with respect to the term "associated forces", the Administration cited the above-mentioned Jeh Johnson's remarks on February 22, 2012:

{{quote|That term [associated forces] is well understood to cover cobelligerent groups that fight together with al-Qaeda or Taliban forces in the armed conflict against the United States or its coalition partners. [...] after carefully considering how traditional law-of-war concepts apply in [[War on Terror|this armed conflict against non-state armed groups]], the government has made clear that an "'associated force' . . . has two characteristics": (1) an organized, armed group that has entered the fight alongside al Qaeda, [that] (2) is a co-belligerent with al Qaeda in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.&lt;ref name="HVOBrief20121106" /&gt;}}

The Administration summarized later in its brief that:

{{quote|an associated force is an "organized, armed group that has entered the fight alongside al Qaeda" or the Taliban and is "a cobelligerent with al Qaeda [or the Taliban] in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners." Page 60-61 in&lt;ref name="HVOBrief20121106" /&gt;}}

===Legal arguments that the legislation does not allow the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens===
''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' wrote that the Act "is the first concrete gesture Congress has made towards turning the homeland into the battlefield", arguing that "codifying indefinite detention on American soil is a very dangerous step". The magazine has nevertheless contested claims by ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'' that the Act "allows the military to indefinitely detain without trial American terrorism suspects arrested on U.S. soil who could then be shipped to [[Guantánamo Bay]]", writing that "they're simply wrong...It allows people who think the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks gives the president the authority to detain U.S. citizens without charge or trial to say that, but it also allows people who can read the Constitution of the United States to argue something else".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/12/defense-bill-passed-so-what-does-it-do-ndaa|title=The Defense Bill Passed. So What Does It Do?|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal commentator Joanne Mariner has noted in ''Verdict'' that the scope of existing detention power under the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|AUMF]] is "subject to vociferous debate and continuing litigation".&lt;ref name="NDAAexplained"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/01/02/the-ndaa-explained |title=The NDAA Explained |work=Verdict |date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed the  [[September 11 attacks]], the AUMF was interpreted to allow the indefinite detention of both citizens and non-citizens arrested far from any traditional battlefield, including in the United States.
{{Citation needed|reason=where's the source for that statement?|date=October 2016}}

Other legal commentators argue that the NDAA does not permit truly "indefinite" detention, given that the period of detention is limited by the duration of the armed conflict. In making this claim, they emphasize the difference between (1)&amp;nbsp;detention pursuant to the "[[laws of war]]" and (2)&amp;nbsp;detention pursuant to domestic criminal law authorities.&lt;ref name="rivkin"&gt;[http://justourfreedom.wordpress.com/2011/11/02/bill%E2%80%99s-detainee-provisions-reaffirm-the-law-of-war/   "Rivkin &amp; Casey, Bill's detainee provisions reaffirm the laws of war."]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David B. Rivkin]] and Lee Casey, for example, argue that detention under the AUMF is authorized under the laws of war and is not indefinite because the authority to detain ends with the cessation of hostilities. They argue that the NDAA invokes "existing Supreme Court precedent...that clearly permits the military detention (and even trial) of citizens who have themselves engaged in hostile acts or have supported such acts to the extent that they are properly classified as 'combatants' or 'belligerents'". This reflects the fact that, in their view, the United States is, pursuant to the AUMF, at war with al-Qaeda, and detention of enemy combatants in accordance with the laws of war is authorized. In their view, this does not preclude trial in civilian courts, but it does not require that the detainee be charged and tried. If the detainee is an enemy combatant who has not violated the laws of war, he is not chargeable with any triable offense. Commentators who share this view emphasize the need not to blur the distinction between domestic criminal law and the laws of war.&lt;ref name=rivkin/&gt;&lt;ref name="ICRC-210705"&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] official statement: ''[http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/terrorism-ihl-210705 The relevance of IHL in the context of terrorism]'', 21 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal arguments that the legislation allows indefinite detention===
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] has stated that "While President Obama issued a signing statement saying he had 'serious reservations' about the provisions, the statement only applies to how his administration would use the authorities granted by the NDAA", and, despite claims to the contrary, "The statute contains a sweeping worldwide indefinite detention provision...[without] temporal or geographic limitations, and can be used by this and future presidents to militarily detain people captured far from any battlefield". The ACLU also maintains that "the breadth of the NDAA's detention authority violates international law because it is not limited to people captured in the context of an actual armed conflict as required by the laws of war".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.aclu.org/national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law President Obama Signs Indefinite Detention Bill Into Law]", [[ACLU]], 31 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed legislative reforms===
Following the passage of the NDAA, various proposals have been offered to clarify the detainee provisions. One example, [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.112hr3676 H.R. 3676], sponsored by U.S. Representative [[Jeff Landry]] of [[Louisiana]], would amend the NDAA "to specify that no U.S. citizen may be detained against his or her will without all the rights of [[due process]]".&lt;ref name="Summary"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:H.R.3676:@@@D&amp;amp;summ2=m&amp;amp; Library of Congress: Thomas].&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar bills in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] have been introduced by Representatives [[John Garamendi]] of [[California]] and [[Chris Gibson (New York politician)|Chris Gibson]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].

The [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013|Feinstein-Lee Amendment]] that would have explicitly barred the military from holding American citizens and permanent residents in indefinite detention without trial as terrorism suspects was dropped on December 18, 2012, during the merging of the House and Senate versions of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Zachary|title=NDAA's indefinite detention without trial returns|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/12/19/ndaas_indefinite_detention_without_trial_returns/|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Congressional Negotiators Drop Ban on Indefinite Detention of Citizens, Aides Say|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/19/us/politics/congressional-committee-is-said-to-drop-ban-on-indefinite-detention-of-citizens.html?_r=0|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Michael|title=Lawyers Fighting NDAA Indefinite Detention Slam Congress' Latest Decision|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lawyers-mad-about-feinstein-amendment-2012-12|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=20 December 2012|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal challenges to indefinite detention==
===''Hedges v. Obama''===
{{Main|Hedges v. Obama}}

A lawsuit was filed January 13, 2012, against the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] and Members of the U.S. Congress by a group including former ''New York Times'' reporter [[Christopher Hedges]] challenging the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20120913" /&gt; The plaintiffs contend that Section 1021(b)(2) of the law allows the detention of citizens and permanent residents taken into custody in the United States on "suspicion of providing substantial support" to groups engaged in hostilities against the United States such as al-Qaeda and the Taliban.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg20120913" /&gt;

In May 2012, a federal court in New York issued a preliminary injunction which temporarily blocked the indefinite detention powers of NDAA Section 1021(b)(2) on the grounds of unconstitutionality.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|title=Military Detention Law Blocked By New York Judge|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-16/military-detention-law-blocked-by-new-york-judge.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=29 May 2012|author1=Bob Van Voris  |author2=Patricia Hurtado |lastauthoramp=yes |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2012, federal prosecutors representing President Obama and Defense Secretary [[Leon Panetta]] filed a notice of appeal with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], hoping to eliminate the ban.&lt;ref name="RT20120807"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama fights ban on indefinite detention of Americans|url=http://rt.com/usa/news/obama-indefinite-detention-forrest-070/|publisher=RT News|accessdate=23 August 2012|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indefinite Detention Ruling Appealed By Federal Prosecutors|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/indefinite-detention-ruling_n_1749566.html#slide=more228606|work=Reuters|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=23 August 2012|date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day arguments from both sides were heard by U.S. District Judge  [[Katherine B.

==Sanctions targeting the Iranian Central Bank==
{{Main|U.S. sanctions against Iran}}
As part of the ongoing dispute over [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian uranium enrichment]], section 1245 of the NDAA imposes unilateral sanctions against the [[Central Bank]] of Iran, effectively blocking Iranian oil exports to countries which do business with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE7BU09420111231?sp=true|title=U.S. steps up sanctions as Iran floats nuclear talks|publisher=Reuters Canada|author1=MacInnis, Laura  |author2=Parisa Hafezi |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-iran-central-bank"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204720204577132923798499772|title=U.S. Targets Iran's Central Bank|publisher=Wall Street Journal |author1=Lee, Carol E.  |author2=Keith Johnson |lastauthoramp=yes |date=4 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new sanctions impose penalties against entities—including corporations and foreign central banks—which engage in transactions with the Iranian central bank. Sanctions on transactions unrelated to petroleum take effect 60 days after the bill is signed into law, while sanctions on transactions related to petroleum take effect a minimum of six months after the bill's signing.&lt;ref name="wsj-iran-central-bank"/&gt; The bill grants the U.S. President authority to grant waivers in cases in which petroleum purchasers are unable, due to supply or cost, to significantly reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, or in which American national security is threatened by implementation of the sanctions.&lt;ref name="wsj-iran-central-bank"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters-india"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/01/01/iran-usa-obama-idINDEE80001720120101?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=globalCoverage2|title=U.S. imposes sanctions on banks dealing with Iran|publisher=Reuters India|author=MacInnis, Laura|date=1 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the signing into law of the NDAA, the [[Iranian rial]] fell significantly against the U.S. dollar, reaching a record low two days after the bill's enactment, a change widely attributed to the expected impact of the new sanctions on the Iranian economy.&lt;ref name="LATimes-sanctions-toll"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-obama-20120110,0,134568.story|title=Sanctions begin taking a bigger toll on Iran|publisher=Los Angeles Times|author1=Richter, Paul  |author2=Ramin Mostaghim |lastauthoramp=yes |date=9 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-Iran-currency"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203513604577140642815644090 |title=Sanctions on Iran Whipsaw Currency |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114233910/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203513604577140642815644090.html |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Iran-currency"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-obama-20120110,0,134568.story|title=As Further Sanctions Loom, Plunge in Currency's Value Unsettles Iran|publisher=New York Times|author=Gladstone, Rick|date=20 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CSMonitor-Iran-currency"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2012/0102/Iran-currency-plummets-A-sign-US-sanctions-are-taking-hold|title=Iran currency plummets: A sign US sanctions are taking hold?|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|author=LaFranchi, Howard|date=2 January 2012|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials within the Iranian government have threatened to close the [[Strait of Hormuz]], an important passageway for Middle East oil exports, should the United States press forward with the new sanctions as planned.&lt;ref name="WSJ-Iran-currency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-Hormuz"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/world/middleeast/iran-threatens-to-block-oil-route-if-embargo-is-imposed.html?pagewanted=all|title=Iran Threatens to Block Oil Shipments, as U.S. Prepares Sanctions|author1=Sanger, David E.  |author2=Annie Lowrey |lastauthoramp=yes |date=27 December 2011|accessdate=2012-01-11|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Br-rj-pt-brasao.gif|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of Paraty]]
=== Flag ===
The flag of Paraty was adopted on August 12, 1967. The overall colors of the flag represent the following traits: gold signifies strength, silver represents innocence, red is bravery, blue serenity, and green is the color of abundance.

Red, white, and blue are the three colors that have traditionally been used to decorate the historic houses of the city. The colors are displayed in three vertical stripes, with a coat of arms on the center. The large white star on the red stripe symbolizes the first district, and on the blue stripe two small stars represent the second and third districts. The three stars are placed in a triangular form, in homage to the strong presence of [[Freemasonry]] in the architecture of the city.The crown represents the royal traditions that discobvered the country and founded the independent country. The real reasons for green is the Portuguese house of Braganca and yellow because of the Austrian house of Habsburg, (Dom Pedro I and Dona Leopoldina)

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms shown on the flag was adopted on November 30, 1960. The four quarters of the coat of arms symbolize the following:

# The first green-colored quarter on the upper left-hand side with a feathered headdress above two crossed arrows, represents the original inhabitants of the region, the [[Guarani people|Guaianás]] tribe.
# The second quarter in red with a white oval seal with the royal Portuguese coat of arms surrounded by the word "Remédios," a seal which was used in colonial times to authenticate official documents; Our Lady of Remedies has been patron saint of the town since 1646.
# The third quarter, which is white, blue and yellow is an outline of the city and the bay with a superimposed silver fish that is perhaps a reference to [[Tupi language family|Tupi language]]  origin of the city name.
# Finally the fourth quarter of blue shows the corner of a colonial house and a [[wrought-iron]] rail which is representative of the colonial-style houses that exemplify Paraty.

The flora which supports the red scroll are a branch of [[coffee]] tree and a stalk of [[sugarcane]]. The scroll itself bears the inscription “1660 Paraty 1844” These are the dates that Paraty initially achieved status as a town and then later city status. Above the shield is a crown consisting of five towers, with the center tower emblazoned with a red shield bearing a gold fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes Our Lady of Remedies, the patron saint of the city.

== History ==
The village of Paraty was founded in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.unicamp.br/cans2013/venue.php|title=CANS 2013 – Paraty, Brazil|work=unicamp.br|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was established formally as a town by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonizers in 1667, in a region populated by the Guaianás Indians.

The Guaianás people who lived where the city now stands called the entire area “Paraty”. In the Tupi language “Paraty” means “river of fish”. Even today the Brazilian Mullet (''[[Mugil]] brasiliensis'') still come back to spawn in the rivers that spill into the Bay of Paraty. When the region was colonized by the Portuguese, they adopted the Guaianás name for their new town.

=== The Gold Trail ===
After the discovery of the world's richest gold mines in 1696 in the mountains of [[Minas Gerais]], Paraty became an export port for gold to Rio de Janeiro and from there on to [[Portugal]]. The ensuing gold rush led to the construction of the "Caminho do Ouro" or "Gold Trail", a 1200 kilometer road, paved in steep areas with large stones, which connected Paraty to [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]] via [[Ouro Preto]] and [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|Tiradentes]]. Not only was it used to transport gold to Paraty, but it was also used to convey supplies, miners and African slaves by mule train over the mountains to and from the gold mining areas. Two substantial sections of the Caminho do Ouro have been excavated near Paraty and are now a popular tourist destination for hiking.

The Gold Trail fell into disuse because of attacks on the gold laden ships bound for Rio de Janeiro by pirates who frequented the islands and coves of the Bay of Angra dos Reis. Eventually a safer overland route from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro was created because of these pirate raids. Finally, the gold itself began to run out in the late 18th century, and Paraty declined.

The Gold Trail was submitted for inclusion on the [[World Heritage List]] in August 2004.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Economic revival ===
The city's economic activity revived as a port for a new boom, the coffee trade of the [[Paraiba do Sul River]] Valley in the early 19th century, until a railway along the valley created cheaper transport to the port of Rio de Janeiro. Another smaller revival came late in the 19th century with the production of [[cachaça]], which is a sugarcane-derived spirit best known today as the basis for Brazil's most famous drink, the [[caipirinha]]. The name "Paraty" in that period became synonymous with cachaça.
Since then, Paraty has been out of the mainstream, which is why it did not change for centuries, until a paved road was built from Rio de Janeiro to [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], near São Paulo, in the 1970s. The city then began a new cycle of activity, which transformed a small, almost abandoned town living on very limited economic activity, mainly [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]] ([[banana]]s, [[manioc]], [[sugarcane]]) into a tourism destination.

== Architecture ==
Paraty is known for the [[cobblestone]]-paved streets throughout the Historic Center District. No cars or trucks are allowed in this part of town, only foot traffic or bicycles. Motor vehicles are only allowed in the Historic District on Wednesdays for deliveries. Horses and carts are a very common sight in Paraty and are frequently used all around the city.

Paraty has been able to maintain many of its historic buildings. Much of the architecture of the city has not changed for 250 years or more.

=== Churches ===
There are four important historic [[baroque]] churches in Paraty:

==== Capela de Santa Rita (Chapel of Saint Rita) ====
Capela de Santa Rita is the oldest church in Paraty. It was completed in 1722. This was the church of the white elite and freeman, former slaves. It is currently home to the Museum of Sacred Art.

==== Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Rosário e São Benedito (Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and Saint Benedict) ====
This church was built and used by Paraty’s African slaves. It dates back to the year 1725. The church has a much simpler, more rustic style than the other three churches in Paraty. Every year in the first week of December the festivities of São Benedito are held in this church.

==== Capela de Nossa Senhora das Dores (Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows) ====
This chapel dates back to 1800. It was used mostly by the rich women of society. Construction was overseen by the presiding priest, Father Antonio Xavier da Silva Braga. The building was later renovated in 1901. The image of Nossa Senhora da Piedade was stolen from this chapel. It was finally recovered in the 1990s, and now can be seen at the Museum of Sacred Art in the Capela de Santa Rita.

==== Igreja Matriz Nossa Senhora do Remédios (First Church of Our Lady of the Remedies) ====
Igreja Matriz Nossa Senhora do Remédios is the largest church in Paraty. It takes up over an entire city block. Its construction began in 1646 when a woman named Maria Jácome de Melo donated the land for the construction of the village of Paraty, however she demanded two conditions: The first was the building of a chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora dos Remédios and the second was that no one would harm the Indians that lived in the area at that time. The church was completed in 1873.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Capela da Generosa (Chapel of the Generous Woman) ====
Additionally there is a very small chapel called Capela da Generosa which according to legend, was constructed in 1901 by the order of a generous female patron, in memory of Teodoro. Teodoro supposedly drowned in the river Perequê-Açu when he tried to fish on Good Friday, a day on which according to tradition it was not recommended to fish.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Capela Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Chapel of Our Lady of the Conception) ====
There are also historical churches in two nearby small villages, Paraty Mirim and Penha.

Paraty-Mirim (Little Paraty) is the site of first chapel built by settlers in the region around Paraty (1686). At the time of its construction Paraty-Mirim an important commercial center and thriving village. Today however, all that remains there are the church itself and a scattering private homes. Although in recent years the tourist trade has grown there due to the pristine beaches in the area and Paraty-Mirim now has a few small inns, a couple of restaurant/bars and offers boat tours.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Penha (Church of Our Lady of the Rock) ====
This church is unique in that it was built on top of a huge boulder in the small hamlet of Penha, just outside Paraty. The church is located directly across from the Tourist Information Center at the trail-head of the Caminho do Ouro.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Forts ===
There are two [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[forts]] in Paraty:

==== Forte Defensor ====
Forte Defensor was built in 1703 and outfitted with six cannons for the protection of the city’s important commercial warehouses. With the aforementioned economic decline of the region, it was in ruins until 1822, when it was reconstructed and dedicated to Emperor [[Dom Pedro I]]. Some historians believe that it was at the fort that the first nucleus of the town began, in that the area around the fort is still referred to as the "Old Village."

Ruins of the old, rock defensive walls together with the cannons can still be seen today. It is also home to a Powder House for storing explosives – one of the few still existing in Brazil. Forte Defensor is one of seven fortifications that were built around the harbor of Paraty, two of them being in the city. All of the others that were constructed outside the city are now only ruins.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Forte Patitiba [Cadeia Antiga] ====
What is left of this fort, also known as Cadeia Antiga (the Old Jail) is a smallish structure which for a while was also used as a prison. It is found in the plaza of Santa Rita, next to the church of same name. Constructed in the beginning of the 18th century, the building was part of a larger Forte Patitiba, the other blockhouse built in the city for defense of the harbor. In the 19th century it was decommissioned and today it houses the local Public Library.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Paraty_Biblioteca.jpg|Forte Patitiba
&lt;/gallery&gt;

There are also many colorful, colonial houses (refurbished in most cases), many of which have been transformed into shops, pousadas (Brazilian bed and breakfasts), restaurants and bars.

==== Flooded Streets ====
Once a month when there is a [[Full moon|Full Moon]] and the tide is high, seawater rises from its normal levels, and pours into the Historic Center District through special openings in the [[seawall]]s that separate the city from the harbor. The streets are only flooded for a short time, until the tide recedes. The water is usually only six to ten inches deep and a few merchants near the seawall put out small bridges to span the flooded streets for the benefit of pedestrians.

It contains part of the [[Tamoios Ecological Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|language=Portuguese |title=Unidade de Conservação: Estação Ecológica de Tamoios|publisher=MMA: Ministério do Meio Ambiente |url=http://sistemas.mma.gov.br/cnuc/index.php?ido=relatorioparametrizado.exibeRelatorio&amp;relatorioPadrao=true&amp;idUc=63|accessdate=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture and tourism ==
There are many musical and cultural events, the most prominent of which is the FLIP – Festa Literaria Internacional de Paraty ([[International Literary Festival of Paraty]]). The town is also known for its local festivals on Catholic holy dates, such as the Feast of the Holy Ghost.

The ''Casa da Cultura Paraty'' (House of Culture) occupies an historic 18th century house originally built in 1754 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/paraty/0256010029.html |title=Attractions in Paraty at Frommer's |publisher=Frommers.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opened to the public in 2004 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-southeast/paraty/sights/470156 |title=Sights and attractions, experience Casa da Cultura in Paraty – Lonely Planet Travel Information |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds a permanent exhibition on local history and culture. In the Salon of Indigenous Culture, visitors can see the [[sawdust carpet|“carpets” made of colored sawdust and flower petals]] used during the festival of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in June. The largest is almost {{convert|92|sqft|m2}}. The “carpet” is protected by glass so that visitors walk on it as they enter.

Paraty played the part of the Bahian town of [[Ilhéus]] in the 1983 [[Bruno Barreto]] film ''[[Gabriela, Cravo e Canela (film)|Gabriela, Cravo e Canela]]'', starring [[Sônia Braga]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085575/|title=Gabriela (1983)|author=metrobiz|date=6 October 1983|work=IMDb|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paraty was also the set for Isle Esme (the place of Edward and Bella's honeymoon) in the movie ''[[The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1|The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/mat/2010/11/14/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-voltam-para-os-eua-apos-filmagens-de-amanhecer-no-brasil-923023152.asp|title=Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart return to the USA after filming "Breaking Dawn" in Brazil|language=Portuguese|accessdate=November 24, 2010|date=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transportation ==

[[Paraty Airport|Paraty airport]] can be reached from [[Rio de Janeiro]] or [[São Paulo]] by chartered helicopter or small commercial and private aircraft because presently it has no scheduled flights.

Another possibility of transport is to arrive by sea by way of a sailboat or cruise ship from Rio de Janeiro, [[Angra dos Reis]] and Ilha Grande.

Paraty is connected by road to Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo (via road BR-101). Air-conditioned buses leave to go back and forth from Rio to Paraty and Paraty to Rio.

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
[[File:DonaldsonvillePeepShow1938.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938]]

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W.

Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2720">'''Pornography in the [[Middle East]]''' has been somewhat minimally documented and researched by scholars. 

Though broadcast of and internet access to pornography is restricted&lt;ref name="saudi1"&gt;Gardner, Frank (10 May 2000).

In [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], Saudi Arabia, the [[United Arab Emirates]] and almost all other countries in the Middle East, pornography is illegal{{fact|date=September 2018}}. However, due to widespread Internet access (in particular, downloading programs) and the existence of a large-scale [[black market]] in [[Western world|Western]] films, pornography is called "super film."  In Iran, a law was passed in mid-2007 by parliament but still required approval of the [[Guardian Council]], producers of pornographic films face execution if found guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/death-penalty-for-porn-in-iran/ | title=Death Penalty For Porn In Iran?|publisher=Cbsnews.com|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography is readily available for users in a handful of Middle Eastern nations, such as [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], Lebanon and [[Israel]]; and the production of pornography is also legal within Turkey, Azerbaijan and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceza-bb.adalet.gov.tr/mevzuat/5237.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.travel-images.com/az-sex.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/pornography/&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, a Lebanese-Syrian gang involved in promoting pornographic movies was arrested by the Lebanese general security forces, according to Lebanon's National News Agency.  The group sold the films on DVDs to minors in various regions in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local-News/2011/Sep-28/149923-authorities-arrest-syrian-lebanese-porn-gang.ashx|title=Authorities arrest Syrian-Lebanese porn gang|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''postglossators''' or '''commentators''' formed a European legal school which arose in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] and [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] in the fourteenth century. They form the highest point of development of [[medieval Roman law]].

The school of the ''[[glossator]]s'' in [[Bologna]] lost its vitality, resulting in the rise of a new school of legal thought in the 14th century, centred on [[Orléans]] in France. [[Bartolus]] was the most famous of the commentators. Rather than simply seeking to explain the law, the commentators were more concerned with the potential for practical application of the law. Politically at this time, the idea of the [[Spirit of One]] – one church and one empire, was popular in Europe. [[Roman law]] thus appealed as bringing the potential for one law in addition. Roman law was written and certain as well as being generally consistent and complete. The educated liked its roots and saw the potential for application.

The commentators faced head on the conflict of law with custom as they saw the potential for practical application of the Roman law. They were opportunistic and as [[Italy in the Middle Ages|medieval Italy]] flourished, there were many opportunities to be the mediator between the developing political, scientific and economic spheres. Thus many of their ideas were based on practical morality, bold construction of the law and clever interpretations. For example, feudal law, which violated the absoluteness of dominium, was harmonised with Roman law by drawing links with the long lease, which gave rise to a vindicatio directa. The commentators argued that the vindicata directa was evidence of another type of ownership and that feudal ownership could fall within this category. This made Roman law more flexible, although was clearly a move away from the texts, and thus made it of greater practical use to rulers who were seeking a rational and coherent law.

The Commentators went beyond the [[glossators]], who had treated each text separately. The commentators instead wrote prose commentaries on the texts (rather like lectures,) working through, book by book, through the Digest. Rather than simply taking individual Roman law texts at face value, making it useful for practical application involved considering the rationale and principles behind the law. Certain areas were thus not considered at all, for example, Bartolus makes no attempt to consider culpa. However, this general approach produced a far more sophisticated law and enabled harmonisation between Roman law and local law. For example, Roman law said that a will was valid if you had 5 witnesses and that Roman law superseded customary law, whilst Venice law only required 3 witnesses. Bartolus’ approach was to consider why Roman law superseded custom. He concluded that this was because custom was presumed bad. However, in certain circumstances, custom would be allowed by the Emperor, where the law was considered good. Since the [[Venice]] law had come into practice after the Emperor, the Emperor had not considered if it were good law. However, it clearly was and therefore it should be allowed to continue. The Commentators also harmonised canon law with Roman law to some extent. Canonists argued that bare agreement could give rise to an action (but they only had jurisdiction where that agreement was made by oath.) The Commentators said that the canon law was simply a form of clothing which could make a bare pact enforceable.

The extraction of general principles allowed Roman law to be used in situations which were unfamiliar to the Romans, it provided a coherent and convenient set of rules, which could then be used to interpret local customs, which were given primacy but very narrowly interpreted. The impact of the commentators was thus substantial. Their commentaries were found throughout Europe, in fact it was said that if one was not a Bartolist (a commentator), one could not be a lawyer at all.

'''Qesem cave''' is a [[Lower Paleolithic]] [[archeological site]] 12&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Tel Aviv]] in [[Israel]]. Early humans were occupying the site by 400,000 until c. 200,000 years ago.

The cave attracted considerable attention in December 2010 when reports suggested Israeli and Spanish archaeologists had found the earliest evidence yet of modern humans. Science bloggers pointed out that the media coverage had inaccurately reflected the scientific report.&lt;ref name=Spat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watzman|first=Haim|title=Human remains spark spat|journal=Nature|date=31 December 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.700|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101231/full/news.2010.700.html|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective large-game hunting was regularly done followed by butchery of desired carcass parts for transport back to a residence for food sharing and [[Cooking#History|cooking]].

==Description==
[[File:מערת קסם 1.jpg|thumb|250px|Qesem cave excavations, 2012]]
The cave exists in [[Turonian]] limestone in the western mountain ridge of Israel between the [[Samaria|Samaria Hill]]s and the [[Israeli coastal plain]].&lt;ref name="Barkai"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barkai R, Gopher A, Lauritzen SE, Frumkin A |title=Uranium series dates from Qesem Cave, Israel, and the end of the Lower Palaeolithic |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6943 |pages=977–9 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12827199 |doi=10.1038/nature01718 |url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/nature_Qesem_2003-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gopher"&gt;Gopher A, Barkai R, Shimelmitz R, Khalaily M, Lemorini C, Heshkovitz I, et al., (2005).

Journal of The Israel Prehistoric Society, 35:69-92&lt;/ref&gt; It is 90m above sea level.

Deposits at the site are {{convert|7.5|m|abbr=on}} deep, and are divided into two layers: the upper is about {{convert|4.5|m|abbr=on}} thick, and the lower {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}}. The upper forms a step on the lower one. The deposits contain [[stone tool]]s and animal remains from the [[Acheulo-Yabrudian complex]]. This a period that follows after the [[Acheulian]] but before the [[Mousterian]]. No traces of Mousterian occupation have been found.&lt;ref name="Barkai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gopher"/&gt;

The cave was found in October 2000 when road construction destroyed its ceiling. This led to two rescue excavations in 2001.

==Artifacts==
Qesem Cave stone tools are made of [[Flint tool|ﬂint]]. They are mainly [[Blade (archaeology)|blade]]s end [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, and naturally backed knives. There are also [[Flake tool|flake]]s and [[hammerstone]]s. Some of the [[Stratification (archeology)|horizon]]s contain many blades and related blade-tools but they are absent in others. However thick side-scrapers are found throughout them. [[Acheulian]] type hand-axes are found at the top and at the bottom of the archeological sequence. All stages of [[Lithic reduction|stone tool manufacture]] have been found. Many of the cores have sufficient of the surface [[Cortex (archaeology)|cortex]]  to allow reconstruction of the original stone’s shape.&lt;ref name="Gopher"/&gt;

Using the concentration of [[cosmic ray spallation|cosmic ray]] created [[Beryllium-10]] it has been argued that the flint used at Qesem Cave was surface-collected or only dug from shallow quarries. This is in contrast to flint of the same period from [[Tabun Cave]] nearby that originated two or more metres below the surface, probably after being mined.&lt;ref name="Verri"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Verri G, Barkai R, Bordeanu C, etal |title=Flint mining in prehistory recorded by in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=21 |pages=7880–4 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15148365 |pmc=419525 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0402302101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fire ==

The Qesem Cave contains one of the [[Control of fire by early humans|earliest examples of regular use of fire]] in the [[Middle Pleistocene]]. Large quantities of burnt bone, defined by a combination of microscopic and macroscopic criteria, and moderately heated soil lumps suggest butchering and prey-defleshing occurred near fireplaces.

10-36% of identified bone specimens show signs of burning and on unidentified bone ones it could be up to 84%. Such heat reached 500 degrees C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Karkanas P, Shahack-Gross R, Ayalon A, etal |title=Evidence for habitual use of fire at the end of the Lower Paleolithic: site-formation processes at Qesem Cave, Israel |journal=J. Hum. Evol. |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=197–212 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17572475 |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.04.002 |url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/arch_files/info/ran_barkai/HabitualUseofFireJHE2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 300,000-year-old [[hearth]] was unearthed in a central part of the cave.  Layers of ash was discovered in the pit, and burnt animal bones and flint tools used for carving meat were found near the hearth, suggesting it was used repeatedly and was a focal point for the people living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gannon|first=Megan|title=Ancient Hearth Found In Israel Dates Back 300,000 Years, Scientists Say|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/28/ancient-hearth-israel-human-ancestors-campfire_n_4681260.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunted prey==

Bones from 4,740 prey animals have been identified. These are mostly large mammals such as  [[fallow deer]] (73–76% of identified specimens),  [[aurochs]], [[horse]], [[Sus (genus)|wild pig]], [[wild goat]],  [[roe deer]], [[wild ass (disambiguation)|wild ass]] and [[red deer]]. [[Tortoise]] and a rare [[rhinoceros]]  remains have also been found but no [[gazelle]] bones.&lt;ref name="Stinera"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stiner MC, Barkai R, Gopher A |title=Cooperative hunting and meat sharing 400–200 kya at Qesem Cave, Israel |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=106 |issue= 32|pages=13207–12 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19666542 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900564106 |pmc=2726383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These animal bones show marks of butchery, marrow extraction and burning from fire.  Analysis of the orientation and anatomical placements of the cut marks suggest meat and connective tissue were cut off in a planned manner from the bone.&lt;ref name="Stinera"/&gt;

Deer remains are limited to limb bones and head parts without remains of vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, or feet suggesting that butchery was selective in regard to the body parts that had been carried to the cave following initial butchery of the animal carcasses elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Stinera"/&gt;

Moreover, the presence of fetal bones and the absence of deer antlers implies that much of the hunting took place in late winter through early summer. At that time the need for additional fat in the diet would have made those animals particularly important prey. The excavators described this as “prime-age-focused harvesting, a uniquely human predator–prey relationship”.&lt;ref name="Stinera"/&gt;

==Quotations==
;Importance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rich Acheulo-Yabrudian deposits at Qesem Cave offer a rare opportunity to study human adaptation and evolution in the Pleistocene. Because the dates indicate that human activity occurred mostly before 382 kyr, and because the site is located within the ‘out-of-Africa’ corridor, the information obtained by a study of Qesem Cave is likely to contribute substantially to our understanding of the origins and dispersal of modern humans.
&lt;br&gt;Ran Barkai Co-Director of Excavation and colleagues of the Qesem Cave Project in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;ref name="Barkai"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Who lived there?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Levantine Acheulian assemblages predating the Acheulo-Yabrudian were probably made by Homo erectus (sensu lato), whereas Mousterian industries postdating the Acheulo-Yabrudian were made by both anatomically modern humans and Homo neanderthalensis. It would be interesting to learn who was the maker of the unique Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages. If human remains are recovered, Qesem might hold a key to the understanding of evolution and dispersal of modern humans.
&lt;br&gt;Ran Barkai Co-Director of Excavation and colleagues of the Qesem Cave Project [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]&lt;ref name="Barkai"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Evidence of human food sharing
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These hominins hunted cooperatively, and consumption of the highest quality parts of large prey was delayed until the food could be moved to the cave and processed with the aid of blade cutting tools and fire. Delayed consumption of high-quality body parts implies that the meat was shared with other members of the group. ...  Although not the earliest record of fire as technology in the Levant, Qesem Cave preserves contextual information about cooking and marrow extraction during the late Lower Paleolithic.
&lt;br&gt;Mary Stiner and colleagues of the Qesem Cave Project in [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;ref name="Stinera"/&gt;

'''''Quest for Fire''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La Guerre du feu'''}}) is a 1981 [[Cinema of France|France]]-[[Cinema of Canada|Canada]] [[science fantasy]] [[adventure film]] directed by [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]], written by [[Gérard Brach]] and starring [[Everett McGill]], [[Ron Perlman]], [[Nameer El-Kadi]] and [[Rae Dawn Chong]]. It is a [[film adaptation]] of the [[1911 in literature|1911]] Belgian novel ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H. Rosny]]. The story is set in [[Paleolithic Europe]] (80,000 years ago), with its plot surrounding the struggle for [[control of fire by early humans]]. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Makeup]].

==Plot==
The Ulam are a tribe of cavemen&lt;!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--&gt; who possess fire in the form of a carefully guarded small flame which they use to start larger bonfires. Driven out of their home after a bloody battle with the ape-like Wagabu, the Ulam are horrified when their fire is accidentally extinguished in a marsh. Because the tribe does not know how to create fire themselves, the tribal elder decides to send three men, Naoh, Amoukar, and Gaw, on a quest to find fire. 

The trio encounter several dangers on their trek, including an encounter with the Kzamm, a tribe of more primitive-looking&lt;!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--&gt; cannibals. The Kzamm have fire, and Naoh, Amoukar and Gaw determine to steal it. Gaw and Amoukar lure most of the Kzamm away from their encampment. Naoh kills the remaining warriors, but not before being bitten on the genitals by one, which causes him agony. The three Ulam take the Kzamm fire and prepare to head home.

A young woman named Ika, who had been a captive of the Kzamm, follows them. She makes a primitive [[poultice]] to help Naoh recover from his injury. Later, Amoukar attempts to rape Ika.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Peter |title=Tommy Chong's Daughter, Rae Dawn, Launches a Fiery Quest for Her Own Career |journal=People |date=May 31, 1982 |url=https://people.com/archive/tommy-chongs-daughter-rae-dawn-launches-a-fiery-quest-for-her-own-career-vol-17-no-21/ |accessdate=1 December 2018 |quote=The rape scene with actor Everett McGill left her “scratched, bruised and crying. They shot it nine times. I counted.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; She hides near Naoh, who then mounts her himself in front of the other two males.

Ika soon recognizes that she is near her home and tries to persuade the Ulams to go with her. When they refuse, they go their separate ways, all the while calling out to them. Eventually Naoh turns around, followed by the reluctant Gaw and Amoukar. After Naoh leaves the others to scout a village, he is trapped in quicksand, nearly sinking to his death, but is discovered and captured by the Ivaka — Ika's tribe. At first, Naoh is subjected to several forms of humiliation by the Ivaka. He is forced to mate with the high-status women of the tribe, who are large and big-breasted. The petite Ika is excluded by her tribe, and when she attempts to lie near him later that night, she is chased away. The Ivaka show Naoh their advanced technology of [[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-making]].

Gaw and Amoukar find Naoh among the Ivaka. They try to rescue him but Naoh seems unwilling to leave. At night, Ika helps them knock Naoh unconscious and escape the camp. The next day, Naoh washes off the Ivaka body paint. He tries to mount Ika again, but she teaches him the more intimate [[missionary position]]. Before they can reach their home, the three are beset by rivals from the Ulam tribe, but defeat them using the Ivakan [[atlatl]]s, which are superior to Ulam weapons. 

Finally rejoining the Ulam tribe, the group present the fire to the delight of all. But during the ensuing celebration, the fire is again accidentally extinguished. Naoh tries to create a new fire as he'd seen in the Ivaka camp, but after several failed attempts, Ika takes over. Once the spark is lit, the tribe is overjoyed.

Months later, Naoh and Ika prepare to have a child.

==Production==
===Writing and characterization===
Special language forms were created by novelist [[Anthony Burgess]], while patterns of movement and gesture were developed by anthropologist [[Desmond Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quest for Fire (1981) / Quest for Accuracy |url=http://www.moviejourneys.com/quest-for-fire-1981-quest-for-accuracy/ |website=www.moviejourneys.com |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more advanced language of the Ivaka was largely that of the Cree/Inuit native people of northern Canada, which caused some amusement among those in this group who saw the film, since the words have little to do with the plot.&lt;ref&gt;This is according to Annaud's commentary on the DVD. Annaud also comments that his film was popular in Greenland where Inuit is also spoken.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ulam are portrayed as stereotypical [[cavemen]]&lt;!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--&gt;, in an intermediate stage of development compared to the ape-like&lt;!-- source must be provided for specific terms such as neanderthal etc--&gt; ''Wagabu'', on one hand, and the culturally more advanced ''Ivaka'' on the other. The Ulam and Ivaka are depicted as light pigmented, the Kzamm as [[red-haired]]. The Ivaka are depicted as using [[body art|body ornamentation]] ([[jewelry]], [[body paint]], [[mask]]s, [[headgear]]), fully developed [[origin of language|language]] and simple technology such as [[gourd]]s as vessels and the [[atlatl]]. 

===Filming===
The movie was filmed on location in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and [[Tsavo National Park (disambiguation)|Tsavo National Park]] and [[Lake Magadi]] in [[Kenya]]. The opening sequence was filmed at [[MacMillan_Provincial_Park|Cathedral Grove]] on [[Vancouver Island]], BC (forest scenery) whereas the cave home was filmed at Greig's Caves on the [[Bruce Peninsula]] along the [[Niagara Escarpment]] near [[Lion's Head, Ontario]].

[[Michael D. Moore]] was the associate producer in charge of action and animal scenes.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''Quest for Fire'' holds a score of 84% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 19 reviews for an average rating of 7.2/10, the critical consensus stating "Its characters can't do much more than grunt, but that doesn't keep ''Quest for Fire'' from offering a deeply resonant -- and surprisingly funny -- look at the beginning of the human race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quest_for_fire/ |title=Quest for Fire (1981) - Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that he saw it as a "borderline comedy" in the opening scenes, "But then these characters and their quest began to grow on me, and by the time the movie was over I cared very much about how their lives would turn out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/quest-for-fire-1981 |title=Quest For Fire |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |accessdate=November 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' awarded three stars out of four, stating that "you may be tempted, as I was, to shout wisecracks at the screen. But then the basic appeal of the story begins to work, and every so often we find ourselves asking ourselves, 'I wonder if that's the way it did happen?' And when that happens, 'Quest for Fire' has you hooked."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (March 5, 1982). "'Quest' fires imagination in eternal search for our origin". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film was "more than just a hugely entertaining science lesson, although it certainly is that. It's also a touching, funny and suspenseful drama about prehumans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maslin |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Maslin |date=February 12, 1982 |title=Screen: 'Quest for Fire,' A Prehistoric Odyssey |url= |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=C4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Benson]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that she did not know how historically accurate the movie was, "But this is film making, not carbon dating, and it seems that every piece of magic and the skill of every craft has been used to free our imagination, to let it soar with the film to see what life ''may'' have been like 80,000 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Benson|Benson, Sheila]] (February 11, 1982). "Evolution of the Seeker in an Uncertain World". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part VI, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote, "It's almost impossible to guess what the tone of this ape-man love story (based on a French novel, by J. H. Rosny, Sr.) is intended to be. Are we meant to laugh at the gaminess? At the men's werewolf foreheads? (Thick hair sprouts about an inch above their eyebrows.) The director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, seems to be willing for us to laugh but not sure about how to tell us when."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kael |first=Pauline |authorlink=Pauline Kael |date=March 8, 1982 |title=The Current Cinema |url= |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific response===
In an essay for the journal ''[[American Anthropologist]]'', [[Brown University]] linguistics professor [[Philip Lieberman]] described as "absurd" the mixture of different levels of advancement among different tribes living in close proximity. Lieberman pointed out that it "would be most unlikely 80,000 years ago" for humans to still be exhibiting apelike characteristics, at the same time noting that the Ivaka tribe was depicted as having "a village culture that would have been likely 10,000 years ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Lieberman |date=December 1982 |title=Film Reviews: Quest for Fire |url= |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |page=991-992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for six [[César Award]]s in 1981, including Best Original Screenplay or Adaptation for Gérard Brach, Best Music Written for a Movie for Philippe Sarde, Best Cinematography for Claude Agostini, and Best Sets for Brian Morris, winning those for Best Film and Best Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AlloCine|title=Prix et nominations pour La guerre du feu|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm-738/palmares/|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 it won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]].

===''Saints Row'' (2006)===
{{Main|Saints Row (video game)}}
''Saints Row'' is the first installment in the series, having begun development in mid-2003 as a [[PlayStation 2]] title under the name ''Bling Bling''.&lt;ref name= "sr dev 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/717127p1.html |title=Saints Row Developer Diary #2 |last=Lawrance |first=Alan |date=7 July 2006 |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was announced at E3 2005 for the [[Xbox 360]]. As the first sandbox style video game to be released for the Xbox 360, ''Saints Row'' was widely anticipated; its pre-beta demo build set records after being downloaded nearly 400,000 times within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/xbox360/action/saintsrow/news.html?sid=6156122&amp;mode=all |title=Saints Row demo sets record |last=Surette |first=Tim |date=21 August 2006 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had sales in excess of 500,000 during its September 2006 release month, and was critically acclaimed.

The game is set in the fictional city Stilwater, which is located in the state of [[Michigan]]. The player character is inducted into the 3rd Street Saints gang after they save their life, and assists the Saints in eliminating three rival gangs that control the city. After the gangs have been eliminated, police chief Monroe kidnaps the Saints founder Julius Little and offers the player to exchange the gang leader's freedom for mayor Marshall Winslow's life. After Winslow is assassinated, Monroe is murdered by the Saints, and Julius is freed. The other Saints members look towards the player character, considering them their new leader. The new mayor Richard Hughes invites the player character aboard his private yacht and Julius betrays the player by blowing the yacht up and killing everyone but the protagonist on board. The game was renowned for being the first seventh-generation sandbox game, and introduced features which have since become staples to the genre. It introduces [[online multiplayer]], an in-game mobile phone, [[GPS navigation device|GPS navigation]], and elaborate character and vehicle customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/649/649707p1.html |title=Saints Row Hands-On |last=Onyett |first=Chales |date=9 September 2005 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/705/705933p1.html |title=E3 2006: Saints Row Hands-On |last=Miller |first=Johnathan |date=9 May 2006 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saints Row 2'' (2008)===
{{Main|Saints Row 2}}
''Saints Row 2'' began development in mid-2006, a few months before the Xbox 360 release of ''Saints Row''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/368501/feeding-your-id-in-saints-row-2 | title= Feeding your ID in Saints' Row 2 |last=Wilson |first=Mark |date=17 March 2008 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=17 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a [[PlayStation 3]] port of ''Saints Row'' was in development, it was cancelled when ''Saints Row 2'' was confirmed in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/saints-row-ps3-canned-sequel-confirmed |title=Saints Row PS3 Canned, Sequel Confirmed |publisher=[[Next Generation Magazine]] |first=Kris |last=Graft |date=10 May 2007 |accessdate=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Microsoft Windows]] port, announced in June 2008, was released in early 2009. Three downloadable content packs were developed and launched in mid-2009 (for console only), including [[Saints Row 2: Ultor Exposed|Ultor Exposed]] and [[Saints Row 2: Corporate Warfare|Corporate Warfare]].

''Saints Row 2'' is set years after ''Saints Row''; having survived the yacht explosion, the player character awakens from coma in a prison hospital and, after escaping, saves Johnny Gat from execution. Together with the newcomers Carlos, Shaundi, and Pierce, they begin to revive the 3rd Street Saints, gradually reclaiming Stilwater from the three gangs that had taken control of the city in the meantime (The Sons of Samedi, The Ronin, and The Brotherhood). The Ultor Corporation, responsible for the redevelopment of the Saint's Row district, eventually recognizes the Saints as a threat and attempts to extinguish them, but the player character assassinates Ultor's CEO Dane Vogel, severely weakening the company. The ending sees the Saints run Stilwater once more. The game builds upon the fundamentals of ''Saints Row'' by improving the respect system, adding more varied activities, increasing the extent to which the player can customize their character, gang, and vehicles, and adding a number of new vehicle models. It expands the Stilwater setting and adds new gameplay features and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/895/895367p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 UK Hands-on |last=Robinson |first =Martin |date=31 July 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saints Row: The Third'' (2011)===
{{Main|Saints Row: The Third}}
''Saints Row: The Third'' was announced in March 2011. It was released in North America on 15 November 2011, in Europe on 18 November 2011, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2011/03/03/thq-formally-announces-saints-row-the-third/ | title = THQ formally announces Saints Row: The Third | first = Johnny | last = Cullen | date = 3 March 2011 | accessdate = 2 March 2011 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game began early development at Volition in September 2008, a month before ''Saints Row 2'' was due to release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://play.tm/interview/21547/dan-sutton-on-saints-row-2/ |title=Dan Sutton on Saints Row 2 |last=Guttridge |first=Luke |date=25 September 2008 |publisher= Play.tm|accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player controls the leader of the 3rd Street Saints, who have grown from their humble roots as a street gang into a worldwide crime group. The story centers around the conflict between the Saints and the Syndicate, a rival crime group who seek to take advantage of the Saints' influence. Though the first two ''Saints Row'' games were set in the fictional city of Stilwater, ''Saints Row: The Third'' is set in a new city named Steelport. Steelport is run by three gangs, much like Stilwater was in ''Saints Row'' and ''Saints Row 2'', yet these gangs—Morning Star, the Deckers and the Luchadores—are all under the control of the Syndicate. Later on in the game, a division of the military known as S.T.A.G. is called to Steelport by authorities in an attempt to eradicate all of the gangs in the city.&lt;ref name= "GI Reveal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archivce/2011/03/02/april-cover-saints-third789.aspx | title=April Cover Reveal - Saints Row: The Third | last=Ryckert | first=Dan | date=2 March 2011 | publisher=[[Game Informer]] | accessdate=2 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Saints Row IV'' (2013)===
{{Main|Saints Row IV}}
''Saints Row IV'' was unveiled in March 2012 and released in North America on 20 August 2013 and worldwide shortly after on 23 August. The game is set five years after the events of ''Saints Row: The Third''. After the Saints stop a terrorist attack by Cyrus Temple on the United States, the Saints leader has been elected President. Soon after, an alien invasion occurs and the earth is overrun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Nye Griffiths|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2013/03/15/saints-row-4-august-launch-announced/|title=Saints Row 4: August Launch Announced|publisher=Forbes|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the game is set in a simulation of Steelport created by the aliens to break the Saints' wills. In this simulation, the Saints must fight against the enemy for justice of their past and their own worst fears.

== Future ==
A new game was confirmed after [[THQ Nordic]] bought the owners of Saints Row; [[Deep Silver Volition]] and [[Koch Media]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Gameplay==
The ''Saints Row'' series is part of a genre known as [[open world|sandbox games]]. The series combines elements of action, adventure and vehicular gameplay. The player can freely roam the virtual world on foot or by use of vehicles and make use of an array of weapon and mêlée based combat. Illegal activity such as assaulting NPC civilians and police officers will instigate a proactive and potentially lethal response from authoritative figures. In the instance of death or arrest, the player will respawn at a nearby hospital or police station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/617/617784p1.html |title=E3 2005: Saints Row First Look |last=Perry |first=Douglas |date=20 May 2005 |publisher= IGN |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emphasis is put on [[urban warfare]]; the player character is affiliated with a [[hip-hop]] cultured street gang known as the 3rd Street Saints. Game missions are structurally divided into separate [[story arc|mission arcs]]. These mission arcs do not intertwine but can be played through altogether at once or separately by the player. Missions are unlocked by accruing respect points; respect is game currency earned by playing non-story mini-games known as activities and diversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/368501/feeding-your-id-in-saints-row-2 |title=Feeding your ID in Saints Row 2 |last=Wilson |first=Mark |date=17 March 2008 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customization also constitutes a large portion of gameplay. The player has the ability to customize their character's appearance and clothing, can take certain vehicles to [[chop shop]]s for modification and in ''Saints Row 2'' is able to decorate the interior of in-game safehouses and refine the behaviour of the Third Street Saints gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/856/856491p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 First Look |last=Ahearn |first=Nate |date=23 March 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=23 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
===Stilwater===
The setting of both ''Saints Row'' and ''Saints Row 2'' is the [[fictional location|fictional city]] of Stilwater, located in the midwestern state of [[Michigan]], [[United States|USA]]. Stilwater is primarily based on the real-world American cities [[Chicago]] and [[Detroit]]. During the early development process of ''Saints Row'', the city was designed before the script was assembled and was more than four times the size of its final revision but was cropped to a smaller revision because development resources could not support a city of that size but the red light district is largely based on Harlem including Raykins hotel as The cotton club.&lt;ref name= "sr dev 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/715237p1.html |title=Saints Row Developer Diary #1 |last=Stockman |first=Christopher |date=27 June 2006 |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its development phase the city went through consistent expansion and cropping; examples such as the shopping mall and trailer park districts in ''Saints Row 2''{{'}}s city revision were originally included in early designs of ''Saints Row''{{'}}s city revision.&lt;ref name= "sr dev 1"/&gt; A design challenge was creating the city without load-screen interferences and as such the engine was designed to stream around the player's location in individual chunks of the city.&lt;ref name= "sr dev 2"/&gt; The city was designed to feel diverse and have a variance of districts; ''Saints Row'' product art director Matt Flegel commented that "We wanted the city to cover all styles, from the towering sky scrapers of downtown to the gritty industrial feel of the factory district. We want the player to ''feel'' the changes between the districts, rather than just noticing the visual difference."&lt;ref name= "sr dev 5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row/723425p1.html |title=Saints Row Developer Diary #5 |last=Flegel |first=Matt |date=4 August 2006 |publisher=GameSpy |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The districts were also designed to feel relevant to the gangs that controlled them.&lt;ref name= "sr dev 5"/&gt;

The Stilwater of ''Saints Row 2'' is significantly different from its original rendition; the city is 45% bigger than its older counterpart.&lt;ref name= "ign details"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/863/863027p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 Details |last=Ahearn |first=Nate |date=28 March 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the city from ''Saints Row'' is redeveloped in ''Saints Row 2'', albeit becoming more "alive" and full of depth.&lt;ref name= swdev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.saintsrow.com/blogs/?p=245 |title=Developer Blog - "Creating the Dynamic City of Stilwater" |date=7 October 2008 |last=Claflin |first=Chris |publisher=Saints Row Community |accessdate=7 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saints Row 2'' lead producer Greg Donovan said that "Stilwater in ''Saints Row 2'' is very different from ''Saints Row''. In fact, every detail has been touched to some degree or another. [...] I think that what will end up happening is that people who played ''Saints Row'' or are fans of the franchise are going to have a great time exploring the city and looking for new things. [Also], people that are new to ''Saints Row 2'' are just going to be presented with a huge, very dispersive and very different looking environment, it's very well polished and detailed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/882586/saints-row-2/videos/saints2.html |title=Saints Row 2 Xbox 360 Interview |author= IGN Xbox 360 |date=5 April 2008 |publisher= IGN |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no in-game load screens in ''Saints Row 2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.game-over.com/reviews/ps3/Saints_Row_2.html |title= Saints Row 2 Review |last= Garbutt |first=Russell |date=27 October 2008 |publisher=GameOver Online |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notable feat as the game allows for seamless [[Cooperative gameplay|co-operative play]]. There are over 130 interiors within the city, including over ninety different shops.&lt;ref name= "tera preview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/895/895228p1.html |title= Saints Row 2 and Tera Patrick Preview |last= Ahearn |first=Nate |date=30 July 2008 |publisher= IGN |accessdate=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is more dynamic and lifelike in ''Saints Row 2'', as the [[artificial intelligence]] is smarter i.e. civilians will interact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.saintsrow.com/blogs/?p=176 |title=Developer Blog - "Creating Life in a Sandbox" |last=Helvig |first=Chris |date=9 September 2008 |publisher=Saints Row Community |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, certain elements of ''Saints Row 2'''s environment are destructible as the game shares some technology with the Volition-developed ''[[Red Faction: Guerilla]]'' game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/895/895367p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 UK Hands-on |last=Robinson |first=Martin |date=31 July 2008 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its environment also features numerous landmarks and [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]]; one such feature won "Top Easter Egg of 2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/news.php?id=1043 |title=Top 5 Easter Eggs of 2008 |last=Webb |first=Dan |date=18 December 2008 |publisher=Xbox360 Achievements.org |accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steelport===
The game ''[[Saints Row: The Third]]'' is set in the sister city of Steelport, a city that flourished in the 1800s and has since succumbed to economic failure. Steelport's districts are almost distinctly the same, and the city size is smaller than Stilwater but has larger buildings. Steelport's most memorable feature is the large statue on Magarac Island, south-east of downtown Steelport. The statue is that of steel worker [[Joe Magarac]] and is a parody of the real-life [[Statue of Liberty]]. The overall design and look of Steelport can be changed via progressing through the story. At certain points the player is allowed to choose whether to do one thing over the other, which will change how Steelport's skyline appears. Some of these choices include deciding whether to keep or blow up the Syndicate Tower. A large military ship named the Thermopylae will be located south-east of Steelport after completing the first STAG mission, "Gang Bang".

''[[Saints Row IV]]'' is once again set in Steelport, however the city is set in a simulation under control of Zinyak, the game's main villain. Zinyak has changed Steelport to fit his likeness removing all signs of the Saints from the city and replacing them with images of himself, and alien technology can be seen heavily throughout the city. Many missions in ''Saints Row IV'' take place in locations other than the main sandbox of Steelport. The city of Stilwater (the setting of ''Saints Row'' and ''Saints Row 2'') returns for one mission of the game, two missions take place in the 1950s version of Steelport, while [[Washington, D.C.]] is featured in the game's introduction.

==Cancelled games==
A spin-off titled ''Saints Row: Undercover'' was being developed by [[Savage Entertainment]] for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] in 2009 but was cancelled for unknown reasons. On 22 January 2016, Volition found a prototype of the game in a PSP development kit and released it as a free download on Unseen64.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/cancelled-saints-row-game-gets-released-for-free-1755919227|title=Cancelled Saints Row Game Gets Released For Free|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=29 January 2016|website=Kotaku|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/saintsrowundercover/|title=Saints Row: Undercover - Download the Playable PSP Prototype - Unseen64|website=Unseen64: Beta, Cancelled &amp; Unseen Videogames!|language=en-US|access-date=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Volition|title=Inside Volition: Saints Row Undercover|date=22 January 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8O2cLAiWIE|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saints Row: Money Shot'' was to be a spin-off of the main series, originally developed for Xbox Live Arcade.{{ref|'''Industrygamers''': [https://web.archive.org/web/20110919061604/http://www.industrygamers.com/news/thq-aiming-for-core-games-metacritic-above-85/2/]}} The game would be available for the [[Xbox 360]] as an [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game and for the [[PlayStation 3]] as a [[PlayStation Network]] game featuring 3D graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saints Row: Drive-by Listed As Canceled for PSN and XBL|url=http://thegamershub.net/2011/05/saints-row-drive-by-listed-as-canceled-for-psn-and-xbl/|work=gamershub|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.saintsrow.com/blog-post/new-information-saints-row-3ds |title=New Information on Saints Row 3DS |last=Goldberg |first=J "V-Singular" |date=1 July 2010 |publisher=Saints Row Community |accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game would have been tied to ''Saints Row: The Third'', as part of the marketing campaign for the game. Playing ''Saints Row: Money Shot'' would have unlocked exclusive content for use in ''Saints Row: The Third'', and vice versa.

Other cancelled games include a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title first announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3 2010]] called ''Saints Row: Drive By'', and a [[Kinect]]/[[PlayStation Move]] fighting game for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] called ''Saints Row: The Cooler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.industrygamers.com/news/nintendo-really-wanted-saints-row-on-3ds-reveals-thq/ | title= Nintendo 'Really Wanted' Saints Row on 3DS, reveals THQ | last= Brightman | first = james | date= 29 June 2010 | publisher= Industry Gamers | accessdate= 30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/10/13/saints-row-cooler-cancelled-xbox-360-ps3/|title=Saints Row: The Cooler [Cancelled - Xbox 360, PS3] - Unseen64|date=13 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Saints Row'' shared universe==
The events of ''Saints Row'' take place in a [[shared universe]] alongside Volition's ''[[Red Faction]]'' series  and ''[[Agents of Mayhem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/volitions-all-new-agents-of-mayhem-is-saints-row-ish|title=Volition's All-New Agents of Mayhem is Saints Row-ish|website=USgamer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Red Faction''===
{{Main|Red Faction}}
The connections between ''Saints Row'' and Volition's ''[[Red Faction]]'' series begin as early as the series' first installment in 2001, ''[[Red Faction (video game)|Red Faction]]''. The first Red Faction takes place in 2075 and continues the story of The Ultor Corporation, who have begun mining operations on Mars due to Earth's rapidly depleting resources. This storyline is heavily referenced in ''[[Saints Row 2]]'' (and its DLC). Despite potential licensing conflicts after [[Nordic Games]] purchased the rights to the ''Red Faction'' series in 2013, references to the events of ''Red Faction'' continued to make appearances in the ''Saints Row'' series. On 14 February 2018, Nordic (now known as [[THQ Nordic]]) acquired Koch Media, effectively reuniting the ''Red Faction'' and ''Saints Row'' IPs under the same publishing umbrella for the first time since THQ's bankruptcy and acquisition by Nordic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/14/thq-nordic-buys-saints-row-metro-dead-island-owner-koch-media|title=THQ Nordic Buys Saints Row, Metro, Dead Island Owner, Koch Media|first=Shabana|last=Arif|date=14 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ''Saints Row'' and ''Saints Row 2'' received positive reviews for their Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports. However, the mobile phone ports of both games as well as the Windows port of ''Saints Row 2'' received a more mixed response. Additionally, the downloadable content packs for ''Saints Row 2'' received mostly average reviews.

The Xbox 360 port of ''Saints Row'' received generally positive reviews and scores. It received an 82.20% and 81/100 from review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. [[IGN]] reviewer Douglass Perry awarded the game an 8.5/10, praising the presentation and gameplay while pointing out technical shortcomings as well as the often forced humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/728/728829p1.html | title= Saints Row Review |last=Perry |first=Douglass |date=28 August 2006 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpot]] reviewer Greg Kasavin awarded the game an 8.3/10, giving credit to the driving, the action, the presentation and the story. However, he criticized the lack of polish and lack of variety in mission design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamespot.com/xbox360/action/saintsrow/review.html |title=Saints Row Review for Xbox 360 |last=Kasavin |first=Greg |date=30 August 2008 |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hailed as "the best reason to own a 360 this side of ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion|Oblivion]]''" and a "must buy" by [[GamePro]] reviewer Vicious Sid, who awarded it five stars out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/79588/saints-row/ |title=Saints Row Review |author="Vicious Sid" |date=28 August 2006 |publisher=[[GamePro]] |accessdate=19 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011110605/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/79588/saints-row/|archivedate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports of ''Saints Row 2'' received positive reviews. It received an 83.37% and 82.99% from GameRankings respectively, and 82/100 and 81/100 from Metacritic respectively. [[GameSpy]] reviewer Gerald Villoria awarded the game four and a half stars out of five and said that "''Saints Row 2'' offers up a shooting and driving experience that is plenty of fun [...] It's self-consciously funny in its irreverence, and its low-brow humor will definitely appeal to much of its audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/saints-row-2/920069p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 Review |last=Villoria |first=Gerald |date=14 October 2008 |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN reviewer Nate Ahearn awarded ''Saints Row 2'' an 8.2/10, praising the gameplay but criticizing the lack of polish and the weak artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/918/918374p1.html |title=Saints Row 2 Review |last=Ahearn |first=Nate |date=9 October 2008 |publisher= IGN |accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the PC port of ''Saints Row 2'' received a much less positive response. It received an aggregated score of 70.68% and 72/100 from GameRankings and Metacritic.

Dan Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wrote that ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' was a boon for the ''Saints Row'' series since it allowed the latter to be "gleeful silly sandbox games" as the former series took a more serious turn.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer review"/&gt;

===Sales===
''Saints Row 2'' shipped over two million units for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 during October 2008, the month of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://kotaku.com/5077878/saints-row-2-two-million-served-well-shipped | title= Saints Row 2: Two Million Served (Well, Shipped) | last= Plunkett | first = Luke | date= 5 November 2008 | publisher= Kotaku | accessdate= 24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2011, THQ CEO Brian Farrell announced that ''Saints Row: The Third'' was already the most pre-ordered title in series history. In fact, the game had four times the number of pre-orders Saints Row 2 had two weeks before its launch. THQ estimated the game would ship over 3 million units before the publisher's fiscal year ends in March 2012. By comparison, Saints Row 2 launched in October 2008 and sold 2.6 million by the end of the fiscal year. On 25 January 2012, THQ announced that The Third had shipped 3.8 million units globally and are expecting to ship between five and six million units lifetime on the title.

To date, the series has roughly sold over 13 million units, including over three million for ''Saints Row 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/saintsrow2/news.html?sid=6275972 |title=Saints Row, Warhammer 40K series sales top 6 million |date=15 September 2010 |author=Thorsen, Tor |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tash Rabat''' is a well-preserved 15th century stone [[caravanserai]] in [[At-Bashi District|At Bashy district]], [[Naryn Province]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] located at an altitude of 3,200 meters.

== Geography ==
Tash Rabat is located somewhat east of the main north-south highway. To the south is Lake [[Chatyr-Kul]] and [[Torugart Pass]].  To the north is [[Koshoy Korgon]], a ruined fortress of uncertain date.  The area is a center for hiking and horse-trekking.  The caretakers of Tash Rabat offer lodging, consisting of 5 or 6 [[yurt]]s.{{fact|date=February 2017}}

== Research ==
As early as 1888, Russian doctor and traveler Nicolay Lvovich Zeland suggested that it was originally a [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] or [[Buddhist]] [[monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Записки Западно-Сибирского отдела Императорского Русского Географического Общества.

Travel notes. |first=Nicolay |last=Zeland|publisher=Imperial Russian Geographical Society |language=Russian |location=Omsk|year=1888|isbn=  |pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research undertaken at the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s by the Institute of History of the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences]] concluded that Tash Rabat was originally built as a Nestorian monastery in the 10th century, although no Christians artifacts were found during excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Khudyakov| first =Ju.| date =| script-title=ru:Таш Рабат - Караван-сарай или замок|trans-title=Tash Rabat - caravanserai or temple.| url =http://ras.ru/FStorage/Download.aspx?id=c7ada38e-692c-436b-8e83-b0bad1c2f759| language =Russian | journal = Priroda | location = | year =2009|issue=6|page=55| publisher= Russian Academy of Sciences| accessdate = 2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The structure consists of 31 rooms, including chambers in the central hall. The rooms are dome-shaped; transition from a quadrangular frame to a dome is done using a [[squinch]]. Tash Rabat is completely made of crushed stone on clay mortar with [[gypsum mortar]] sealing joints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=ru:Иссык-Куль.Нарын:Энциклопедия |trans-title=Encyclopedia of Issyk-Kul and Naryn Oblasts |first= |last=|publisher=Chief Editorial Board of Kyrgyz Soviet Encyclopedia |language=Russian |location=Bishkek |year=1991 |isbn= 5-89750-009-6 |pages=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Part One===

[[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]] ([[Tommy Knight]]) is struggling to adjust to life without [[Maria Jackson]] ([[Yasmin Paige]]), she having moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] with her father. Meanwhile, the Chandras move into the Jacksons' old house on Bannerman Road and [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]) starts an investigation into disappearing children in the area. Sarah Jane makes Luke and Clyde promise her that they will not reveal her alien investigating secrets to the newcomers to Bannerman Road.

[[Clyde Langer]] ([[Daniel Anthony (actor)|Daniel Anthony]]) and Luke meet new girl Rani Chandra at school. After Clyde sees a clown in school prior to the sudden disappearance of a child, Rani reveals she is being stalked by a clown that no one else can see. With Clyde having got into trouble with the new Headteacher, Rani's father, Luke arranges to keep an eye on Rani in his place and goes round to her house to help her unpack. Sarah Jane and Clyde link the disappearances of the children to the Museum of the Circus, Clyde and two of the missing children having received tickets for it. Rani, who wants to become a journalist, begins her own investigation and makes the same connection to the Museum having found a ticket in a school book belonging to one of the missing children and having a ticket herself.

Sarah Jane and Clyde explore the Museum of the Circus and encounter Elijah Spellman ([[Bradley Walsh]]). Soon they are joined by Rani and Luke and Spellman sets his robotic [[clown]]s on the group. Sarah Jane halts the clowns with her [[Sonic screwdriver#Related devices|sonic lipstick]], and Luke theorises that Spellman is an alien. As Sarah Jane, Luke, Clyde and Rani attempt to escape the building, Spellman reveals himself to have been the legendary [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper of Hamelin]] and now Odd Bob the Clown seeking to feed off their fear.&lt;ref name="The Day of the Clown Part One"&gt;{{cite serial | title = The Day of the Clown | episode = Part One | series = [[The Sarah Jane Adventures]] | credits = Writer [[Phil Ford (writer)|Phil Ford]], Director [[Michael Kerrigan]], Producer Matthew Bouch | network = [[BBC]] | station = [[CBBC Channel]] | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part Two===

Sarah Jane and the rest escape through the back door. Then Sarah Jane tells Luke about why she's scared of clowns saying that a clown toy in her room apparently came to life when she was young.  The next morning, Rani looks out of her bedroom window and sees Odd Bob's balloon in her garden. When she gets to the school she tells Luke and Clyde, then a load of balloons fall down from the sky, all the school children pick them up (apart from Luke, Clyde and Rani) and fall under the spell from Odd Bob, behaving much like the Pied Piper story. But Mr. Smith uses the cellular phone system to interfere with Odd Bob's control and the children are released. Then Odd Bob suddenly kidnaps Luke, and Sarah Jane must face her fears to save Luke. Then Clyde uses his funny jokes to dissipate their fear. Odd Bob requires fear to exist, and without it, he is forced to return to the meteorite he used to come to Earth. Sarah Jane puts the meteorite into a box from which nothing can escape, not even thoughts. In the end, Clyde says how the universe is always full of surprises after everyone gets invited to the Chandra's for dinner.

===Critical reception===
Writing for ''[[Dreamwatch]]'', Matt McAllister asserts that there may not be "quite enough here to sustain a double-episode worth" but observes that there are "memorable scenes, including an ingenious final showdown." He states that Walsh is "appropriately sinister...as Odd Bob the Clown" and describes Rani as "likeable", noting that having her father as the new Headteacher is "a nice little twist". McAllister thinks that the story "owes a big debt to [[Stephen King]]’s ''[[It (novel)|It]]''" ([[1986 in literature|1986]]) and that it has shades of ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[From Out of the Rain]]" and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Greatest Show in the Galaxy]]''. In conclusion, McAllister notes that "[t]his may not be earth-shattering kids’ TV, but it’s good creepy fun nonetheless."&lt;ref name="Dreamwatch"&gt;{{cite web

"'''The ''Mary Gloster'''''" is a poem by British writer [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1865-1936). It is dated 1894, but seems to have been first published in his 1896 collection ''[[The Seven Seas (poetry collection)|The Seven Seas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_gloster1.htm |title=The Mary Gloster |website=[[Kipling Society]] |date=21 May 2003 |first=George |last=Engle |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a deathbed monologue by a wealthy shipowner and shipbuilder, Sir Anthony Gloster, addressed to his only surviving child, his son Dick or Dickie, who does not speak.

==The poem==

The old man speaks urgently to his son, who has spent his money and broken his heart. He knows that he will die tonight, even if his doctor says that he is good for another fortnight. The monologue does not follow an orderly narrative sequence. Increasingly towards the end, the old man repeats himself, and digresses.

He was a ship's [[Sea captain|master]] at 22, and married (to Mary) at 23. Now, 50 years later, he has made a million (£ sterling, {{as of|2017|lc=yes}} equivalent to about £120M), has 10,000 on his payroll, has 40 freighters at sea, is a "baronite" (i.e. [[baronet]]),&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Baronetcies are inherited. When Sir Anthony dies, "Dickie" will become "Sir Richard Gloster" and his wife will become "Lady Gloster".&lt;/ref&gt; has dined with royalty, and the press have called him "not the least of our merchant-princes". He took on jobs which others rejected as too dangerous and, urged on by Mary, saved up enough to buy a half-share in a ship, and then to buy their own ship, the ''Mary Gloster'', the first in his freighter line. Mary died on her, and was buried at sea in the [[Macassar Straits]]. He afterwards took to drink; but Mary told him to stop,&lt;!--This is not an error. That's what the poem says, and the meaning is obvious.--&gt; and he devoted himself to work.

In London, using his savings, he formed a partnership with a man named M'Cullough and set up a ship-repair foundry. It was successful, and they moved to the [[Clydeside|Clyde]] to build ships. Business prospered, the freighter line grew, and he was always one step ahead of his competitors. M'Cullough died; he took advantage of what he found in M'Cullough's private papers, and made his fortune.

His son, nearer 40 than 30, has disappointed him. He was educated at "Harrer" (i.e. [[Harrow School]]) and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], is only interested in arts and society, and is married to a woman who Sir Anthony describes in unflattering terms both physically and personally. Their marriage is childless; whereas Mary was continually pregnant, even though only Dickie survived. Sir Anthony calls his son "weak, and a liar, and idle, and mean as a [[Stoker (occupation)|collier]]'s whelp nosing for scraps in the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]]". He is leaving Dickie £300,000 ({{as of|2017|lc=yes}}, equivalent to about £37M) in his [[Will and testament|will]]{{snd}}but only the interest from it, the money is tied up in a [[Trust law|trust]] which specifies that it will revert to the business if Dickie dies childless. The wife with her sham tears will hate that. Sir Amthony justifies his affairs with paid women after Mary's death.

Dickie goes to depart, but his father stops him. If Dickie does what he will now be asked to do, he will get £5,000 ({{as of|2017|lc=yes}}, equivalent to about £600,000), in cash. Sir Anthony does not want to be buried in the vault he had bought in [[Woking]] at a time when he had hoped to establish a family line. His will may be challenged on the grounds that he was not of sound mind when he made it; only Dickie can defend it. He wants to be buried at sea, in the Macassar Straits, at the same location as Mary. Dickie is to ask the company for the loan of ''Mary Gloster'' for a cruise. He is to write to McAndrew, who is Sir Anthony's oldest friend, who works for him, who knew Mary, and who knows his wishes; the company will grant McAndrew leave of absence if Dickie says that this concerns Sir Anthony's business. (Sir Anthony had, after his first [[stroke]], set up arrangements with McAndrew.) The ''Mary Gloster'' is to steam to the Macassar Straits, to a place which Sir Anthony has just described and which McAndrew also knows, with the ship in ballast and Sir Anthony's body in the deck cabin. Once the body is over the side, McAndrew will give Dickie the money and land him at [[Makassar|Macassar]]; then (in an act which Mary would have called wasteful), take ''Mary Gloster'' out to sea, and [[Scuttling|scuttle]] her.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The poem does not say and Kipling never seems to have said where ''Mary Gloster'' is to be scuttled. Any source which says that she was to be scuttled at the site of the double sea-burial may be inferring something into the poem which is not there.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Never seen death yet, Dickie? ... Well, now is your time to learn!}}

==Analysis and reception==
The poem consists of 186 lines, in [[rhyming couplet]]s, typically with six stresses per line. The metre is in large part an irregular mixture of [[iamb (poetry)|iamb]]uses (.-) and [[anapaest]]s (..-).

American-born British poet [[T. S. Eliot]] included the poem in his 1941 collection ''[[A Choice of Kipling's Verse]]''. He thought that it belonged with another dramatic monologue, "[[McAndrew's Hymn]]" (1893). He saw both as owing something of a debt to [[Robert Browning]], and as being "metrically and intrinsically ballads". He shared the popular verdict that "McAndrew's Hymn" is the more memorable, but did not find it easy to say why. He found both poems equally successful. The greater memorability may be because there is "greater poetry in the subject matter. It is McAndrew who creates the poetry of Steam [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Choice of Kipling's Verse |first=T. S. |last=Eliot |authorlink=T. S. Eliot |pages=13-14 |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |origyear=1941 |year=1963 |isbn=0-571-05444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]], writing in 1947, considered "The ''Mary Gloster''" to be the more successful of the two.&lt;ref name="Critical comments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_mcandrew_crits.htm |title="McAndrew's Hymn"{{snd}}Some critical comments |first=Alastair |last=Wilson |others=(Signed as A.J.W.W.) |website=[[Kipling Society]] |date=3 March 2003 |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, one writer has seen parallels between "The ''Mary Gloster''" and [[Algernon Swinburne|Swinburne]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IDmwCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=mary+gloster+kipling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C3yhvyuEEE&amp;sig=Mxzp5wTfoU3Hl9tHA2ClAdIdATk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix09Lvk7_XAhUrIcAKHUPFBrEQ6AEIhwEwEw#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20gloster%20kipling&amp;f=false |title=Kipling’s Myths of Love and Death |first=Nora |last=Crook |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |date=1989 |page=156 |isbn=978-1349204403 |accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently still, David Gilmour (2003) has also seen similarities to Browning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VaYNtTI9oIQC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=mcandrew%27s+hymn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EyAZB1HJS3&amp;sig=hlSuDAc_5tcDaTwjMUfxxDANpQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5y8vkj4DXAhWK0RoKHZXLAW4Q6AEIbDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=mcandrew%27s%20hymn&amp;f=false |title=The Long Recessional: The Imperial Life of Rudyard Kipling |first=David |last=Gilmour |page=87 |publisher=[[Pimlico (publishing imprint)|Pimlico]] |date=6 February 2003 |isbn=978-0712665186 |accessdate=28 October 2017 |quote=[T]he two great Browning monologues that Browning did not write{{snd}}'McAndrew's Hymn' and 'The Mary Gloster'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McAndrew's Hymn" mentions a time when one McAndrew was "Third on the ''Mary Gloster''". "The ''Mary Gloster''" involves a McAndrew who is "Chief of the Maori Line", a "stiff-necked Glasgow beggar", who has prayed for the protagonist's soul, who is incapable of lying or stealing, and who will command the ''Mary Gloster'' on its final voyage. The descriptions of the two men are not inconsistent. Internal dating evidence in the two poems (insofar as that can be trusted in works of the imagination) is also not inconsistent.

Alexander Powell]] wrote, 'Our course took us within sight of "the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank," where, as you may remember, Sir Anthony Gloster, of Kipling's ballad of The Mary Gloster, was buried beside his wife'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/wherestrangetrai00poweiala#page/126/mode/1up |page=126 |chapter=VI: In Bugi Land |title=Where the Strange Trails Go Down |first=E.

"'''The Snowman'''" is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a snowman who falls in love with a stove.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP378"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen as ''Sneemanden'' on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1861.&lt;ref name="HCACenter"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nye Eventyr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager describes the tale as a lyrical and poignant complement to Andersen's "[[The Fir-Tree]]" of December 1844.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP378&amp;ndash;379"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=378&amp;ndash;379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wullschlager believes "The Snowman" was the product in part of Andersen’s "pining and discontent over" [[Harald Scharff]], a handsome young dancer at the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP373,379"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=373,379}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wullschlager, the two men entered a relationship in the early 1860s that brought the poet "some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness."&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP387&amp;ndash;389"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=387&amp;ndash;389}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only homosexual affair during Andersen's life that brought him happiness.&lt;ref name="Andersen, H. C.P435"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, H.C.|2005|p=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
"The Snowman" begins with its eponymous hero standing in the garden of a manor house watching the sun set and the moon rise. He is only a day old, and quite naïve and inexperienced. His sole companion is a watchdog who warns him that the sun will make him run into the ditch. The dog senses a change in the weather, enters his kennel and goes to sleep.

At dawn, the land is covered in frosty whiteness when a young couple enter the garden to admire the scene and the Snowman. When they leave, the dog tells the Snowman the couple are sweethearts who will someday move into "the same kennel and share their bones". He then recounts happier days when he slept under the stove in the housekeeper's room as a pampered pet. The Snowman can see the stove through a window in the house and believes it is female. He falls in love. The Snowman longs to be in the room with the stove, but the dog warns him he would melt.

All day the Snowman gazes upon the stove, and, at twilight, the stove glows. When the door of the room is opened, the flames leap out of the stove and glow upon the snowman's face and chest. He is delighted. In the morning, the window is covered with frost and the Snowman cannot see the stove. He is stove-sick and cannot enjoy the frosty weather. The dog warns the snowman of an imminent change in the weather. A thaw descends, and, one morning, the Snowman collapses. The dog finds a stove poker used to build the Snowman within his remains, and then understands why the Snowman longed for the stove: "That's what moved inside him... Now he is over that, too!" The girls in the house sing a springtime carol and the snowman is forgotten.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP378" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersenHC2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, H.C.|2005|pp=325&amp;ndash;329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Scholars have noted Andersen was attracted to both men and women during his middle years. Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager observes,  "Andersen's diaries leave no doubt that he was attracted to both sexes; that at times he longed for a physical relationship with a woman and that other times he was involved in physical liaisons with men."&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP392"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andersen biographer [[Alison Prince]] comments, "It is obvious that Andersen struggled throughout his life with a painful sense of greatness and of being different from others. This was partly due to the suppressed homosexuality which set him apart in loneliness and forced him to take refuge in the safer and more conventional image of the talented and hypersensitive poet..."&lt;ref name="PrinceP13&amp;ndash;14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|1998|pp=13&amp;ndash;14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both believe "The Snowman" has its source and inspiration in Andersen's relationship with a young male ballet dancer associated with the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.

=== Andersen and Harald Scharff ===
[[File:HaraldScharff1860.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Scharff as Gennaro in [[August Bournonville|Bournonville]]'s ballet ''[[Napoli (ballet)|Napoli]]'', 1860]]

In 1857 in Paris, he made the acquaintance of fellow Dane Harald Scharff, a handsome and highly regarded young ballet dancer with Copenhagen's Royal Theatre. Andersen was returning to Copenhagen via Paris following a visit to [[Charles Dickens]] in England, and Scharff was on holiday with his Copenhagen housemate, the actor Lauritz Eckardt. Andersen and Scharff toured [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] together.&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensP474"&gt;{{Harvnb| Andersen, Jens|2005|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP373"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Three years passed before Andersen again met the pair quite by accident in [[Bavaria]] in July 1860; the three men enjoyed a week together in [[Munich]] and its environs. It is probable that Andersen fell in love with Scharff at this time.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP373" /&gt;  According to his diary, Andersen did not "feel at all well" when the two young men left Munich on 9&amp;nbsp;July 1860 for [[Salzburg, Austria|Salzburg]].&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP374"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The day after their departure, Andersen (who usually thought of himself as ugly) had his photograph taken by [[Franz Hanfstaengl]] and wrote: “I’ve never seen such a lovely yet life-like portrait of myself. I was completely surprised, astonished, that the sunlight could make such a beautiful figure of my face.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP373&amp;ndash;376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=374&amp;ndash;376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the departure of Scharff and Eckardt for Salzburg, Andersen traveled to Switzerland but grew despondent and then depressed. In November, he returned to Copenhagen and spent [[Christmas]] at Basnæs, the estate of an aristocratic patron and friend on the coast of [[Zealand]]. His spirits lifted with the holiday festivities and "The Snowman” was composed on [[New Year’s Eve]] 1860.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP377&amp;ndash;378"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=377&amp;ndash;378}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published with several other new tales by Andersen two months later on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1861 in ''New Fairy Tales and Stories. Second Series. First Collection. 1861.'' by the Copenhagen publisher C. A. Reitzel.&lt;ref name="HCACenter" /&gt;

[[File:Basnaes.jpg|thumb|Basnæs, the estate where Andersen wrote "The Snowman"]]

Andersen's relationship with Scharff continued to develop and early in 1862 the two entered a relationship that brought Andersen "joy, some kind of sexual fulfillment and a temporary end to loneliness."&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP387&amp;ndash;389"/&gt;    Andersen referred to this time in his life as his "erotic period", but he was not discreet in his conduct with Scharff and displayed his feelings much too openly. Onlookers regarded the relationship as improper and ridiculous.&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensPP475&amp;ndash;476"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, Jens|2005|pp=475&amp;ndash;476}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The affair came to an end late in 1863 as Scharff gradually withdrew to focus on his friendship with Eckardt who had married an actress.&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensP477"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, Jens|2005|p=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP272,291"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=373,391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Andersen noted in his diary 13&amp;nbsp;November 1863: "Scharff has not visited me in eight days; with him it is over."  Andersen took the end of the affair calmly and the two former lovers thereafter met in overlapping social circles without bitterness. Andersen tried several times to lure Scharff into another intimate relationship but without success.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP392&amp;ndash;393"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|pp=392&amp;ndash;393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;While on holiday, for example, Andersen and Scharff were forced to spend the night in Helsingør. Andersen reserved a double room for them both but Scharff insisted upon having his own.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Andersen continued to follow Scharff's career with interest but in 1871 an injury during rehearsal forced Scharff permanently from the ballet stage. Scharff tried acting without success, married a ballerina in 1874, and died in the St. Hans insane asylum in 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, JensPP477&amp;ndash;479"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen, Jens|2005|pp=477&amp;ndash;479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commentaries ===
Andersen retained story ideas in his mind sometimes for years before coalescing with an event or mood in his life, and telling stories such as “The Snowman” was a compulsion with him. The tale has been described as poignant and lyrical, and as a self-mocking autobiographical revelation in which Andersen expressed his conviction that love is a burning, unreciprocated pain, and that he would end his life partnerless and alone. The light-hearted Snowman is a complement to Andersen’s tragic Fir Tree and, in telling the tale, Andersen returns “to his earlier, tragicomic mode of sketching the fleeting autobiography of an everyday object which seems to have caught his eye at random and yet whose life story has an uncanny appropriateness to its physical form.”&lt;ref name="WullschlagerPP378&amp;ndash;379" /&gt;

[[File:Hca ill 0094.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration c. 1870 from "The Snowman": "He had been born amid the triumphant shouts of the boys, and welcomed by the jingling of sleigh bells and the cracking of whips from the passing sleighs." ("The Snowman". H.C. Andersen, translated by [[Jean Hersholt]], 1949)]]

Andersen referred to "The Snowman" as a simple fairy tale, but the story may be viewed as a [[metaphor]] for life. The Snowman remains frozen to the ground, questioning fate, existence, and all that he sees and experiences. In this respect, the Snowman shares a common bond with [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]]&amp;mdash;both grope for what is hidden, for the real behind the surface. But there the similarities end. Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and Alsion Prince argue that Andersen's tales are expressions of his homosexuality, and Graham Robb author of ''Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century'' calls his work an "[[Aesop]] of 19th-century homosexuality".&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP392" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PrinceP13&amp;ndash;14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EcksteinP62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eckstein|2007|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference.  "The Snowman" is a tale about misguided love, about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove, and is Andersen's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong type&amp;ndash;with the stove representing the danger in this "wrong" relationship. Andersen spent a lifetime seeking validation by women and experienced only the pain of unreciprocated love. His diaries reveal Andersen resorted to [[masturbation]] as a sexual outlet, and one critic notes that "[Andersen] so fabulously struck out with the ladies that it seems he simply expanded his dating pool to men to hedge his bets."&lt;ref name="EcksteinPP62&amp;ndash;64"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eckstein|2007|pp=61&amp;ndash;63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen biographer Alison Prince believes the tale to be a [[parable]] representing the different kinds of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned old dog tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into "the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones". The Snowman has a different idea of love, being enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains "a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Prince|1998|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''William Lynch speech''' is an address purportedly delivered by a certain '''William Lynch''' (or '''Willie Lynch''') to an audience on the bank of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] in [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]] in 1712 regarding control of [[slavery|slaves]] within the colony.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite web | last= Taylor|first=Anne Cleëster| url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/narrate.htm |title=The Slave Consultant's Narrative: The life of an Urban Myth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808080232/http://www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/narrate.htm |archivedate=2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter purports to be a verbatim account of a short speech given by a slave owner, in which he tells other slave masters that he has discovered the "secret" to controlling black slaves by [[divide and rule|setting them against one another]]. The document has been in print since at least 1970, but first gained widespread notice in the 1990s, when it appeared on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"&gt;Rosenzweig, p. 558.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has often been promoted as an authentic account of slavery during the 18th century, though its inaccuracies and anachronisms have led historians to conclude that it is a hoax.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/htmls/news/jimcrow/question/may04.htm |title=Is Willie Lynch's Letter Real? |accessdate=27 December 2012 |last=Cobb |first=W. Jelani |coauthors= |date= |year=2004 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The reputed author, William Lynch, identifies himself as the master of a "modest plantation" in the [[British West Indies]] who has been summoned to the [[Virginia Colony]] by local slaveowners to advise them on problems they have been having in managing their slaves.

He briefly notes that their current violent method of handling unruly slaves – [[lynching]], though the term is not used – is inefficient and counterproductive. Instead, he suggests that they adopt his method, which consists of exploiting differences such as age and skin color in order to pit slaves against each other. This method, he assures his hosts, will "control the slaves for at least 300 hundred{{sic}} years."&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Some online versions of the text attach introductions, such as a foreword attributed to [[Frederick Douglass]], or citations falsely giving Lynch's name as the source of the word "[[wikt:lynch|lynching]]".&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;

The text of the speech has been published since at least 1970.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt; It appeared on the internet as early as 1993, when a reference librarian at the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis]] posted the document on the library's [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher server]].&lt;ref name=taylor1995&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/winbail.htm |accessdate= June 21, 2008 |last=Taylor |first=Anne Cleëster |title=Email to Samuel Winslow and Lee Bailey about researching The Narrative. |work=The Slave Consultant's Narrative: The life of an Urban Myth? |publisher=University of Missouri-St. Louis, Thomas Jefferson Library Reference Department |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808191222/www.umsl.edu/services/library/blackstudies/winbail.htm |archivedate=2007-08-08|quote=The publisher who gave me this wanted to remain anonymous on the gopher version because he couldn't trace it, either, and until now I've honored his wishes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The librarian later revealed that she had obtained the document from the publisher of a local annual business directory, ''The St. Louis Black Pages''&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20070808191222/http://www.umsl.edu:80/services/library/blackstudies/winbail.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in which the narrative had recently appeared.&lt;ref name=taylor1995 /&gt; 

Though eventually convinced the document was a forgery, the librarian elected to leave it on the Gopher server, as she believed that "even as an inauthentic document, it says something about the former and current state of African America", but added a warning about its provenance.&lt;ref name=taylor1995 /&gt;

The text contains numerous anachronisms, including words and phrases such as "refueling" and "fool proof" which were not in use until the early 20th century,&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt; while historian [[Roy Rosenzweig]] noted the divisions emphasized in the text – skin color, age, and gender – are distinctly 20th-century in nature, making little sense in an 18th-century context.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;

As such, historians such as Rosenzweig and [[William Jelani Cobb]] of [[Spelman College]] regard the William Lynch speech as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Rosenzwieg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;
