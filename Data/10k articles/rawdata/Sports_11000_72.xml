The '''1945 Amateur World Series''' was the eighth edition of the tournament, later known as the [[Baseball World Cup]]. It was contested by six different teams playing ten games each from October 27 through November 18 in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].

Both [[Cuban national baseball team|Cuba]] and [[Mexican national baseball team| Mexico]] [[boycott]]ed the Series in protest of the events of the [[1944 Amateur World Series|previous edition]], when controversy surrounded the tournament regarding umpiring decisions, which had led to forfeits of games and general ill-will. 

The host Venezuelan team finished undefeated with a perfect 10–0 record, winning its second consecutive gold medal and third overall.

[[Colombia national baseball team|Colombia]] finished in second place with a 7–3 record and won silver for its first medal in series history, while [[Panama national baseball team|Panama]] went 6–4 for a bronze medal. It was also the first medal for the Panamanians in the tournament. 

[[Nicaragua national baseball team|Nicaragua]], a former silver medalist both in [[1939 Amateur World Series|1939]] and [[1940 Amateur World Series|1940]], placed fourth at 5–5. The [[Costa Rica national baseball team|Costa Rica]] and [[El Salvador national baseball team|El Salvador]] teams debuted in the Series and shared last place with a 1–9 mark.

[[Héctor Benítez]] of Venezuela earned [[Most Valuable Player]] honors after leading the hitter in batting average (.526), hits (20), RBI (16) and runs scored (16). Teammate [[Luis Zuloaga]] was the top pitcher with a 4–0 record, while setting a Series record with seven consecutive wins. Other statistical leaders for Venezuela were [[Ramón Fernández (baseball)|Ramón Fernández]], with 21 hits, and [[Luis Romero Petit]], who stole nine bases.   

Another well observed performance came from Panamanian catcher [[León Kellman]], who was the only player to hit two home runs in the Series. Previously, in [[1941 Amateur World Series|1941]], Kellman was the only player to homer in the Series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">'''Beach Basketball''' is a modified version of [[basketball]], played on [[beach]]es. It was invented in the United States by Philip Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachbasketball.com/ World Beach Basketball site]&lt;/ref&gt;

== USA ==
Beach basketball is played in a [[circle|circular]] court with no [[Backboard (basketball)|backboard]] on the goal and no out-of-bounds rule, with the ball movement to be done via passes or 2½ steps, as [[Dribbling#Basketball|dribbling]] is next to impossible on sand.
Beach basketball has become a very popular,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} widespread{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} competitive sport. Fifteen Annual World Championships have been organized.

== Germany ==
In Germany beach basketball, or "Beachbasketball" as it is written in [[German language|German]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Beachbasketball|Wikipedia: Beachbasketball german site]]&lt;/ref&gt; is played in a way that is similar to basketball. The beach court is smaller than a standard [[basketball court]] and without lines. Over the year, several tournaments are held, ending in the German [[Final (competition)|championship]] which is organized by the German basketball federation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basketball-bund.de/basketball-bund/de/events_und_projekte/beachbasketball/19128.html German Basketball Federation: Beachbasketball] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308071718/http://www.basketball-bund.de/basketball-bund/de/events_und_projekte/beachbasketball/19128.html |date=March 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this tournaments various beach basketball [[team]]s play against each other.

=== Rules&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachbasketball.de German beach basketball rules]&lt;/ref&gt; ===
* A beach basketball team has three players plus a maximum of two players to change.
* The court consists of a sand surface in the range of about 12–15 m, and two opposing basketball baskets and backboard, which are situated on the short sides of the pitch. Basically, there are no out lines.
* A game lasts ten minutes, divided into two halves to five minutes. At halftime, the sides are changed.
* In a tournament team mentioned first at the beginning of the first half is in the possession of the ball. The second mentioned team has the ball in the second halftime.
* If the ball falls in the sand, the player first touches the ball may take the ball and continue unhindered.
* In an indecisive outcome of the game there will be a shoot-out. Each player has a free throw.

'''''Bicycling''''' is a cycling brand published by [[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] in [[Emmaus, Pennsylvania]].  ''Bicycling'' claims to be the world’s largest cycling magazine.
__TOC__

==Origin==

''Bicycling'' started in 1961 as ''Northern California Cycling Association Newsletter'', a 4-page mimeographed newsletter (8 ½ x 14) started by Peter Hoffman. It covered the local bicycle scene and grew quickly as Vol. 1 No. 6 took on a 5 ½ x8 ½ offset printing format in December, 1961. The name was changed to ''American Cycling Newsletter'' with Vol. 3 No. 1 in March, 1964 issue. The name was changed again with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1965 to ''American Cycling''. The size was changed to a larger format with Vol. 5 No. 1 in March, 1966 to 8 ½ x 11. Peter Hoffman sold the magazine to Leete publications in August 1968 but stayed on as an editor until late 1969. The last ''American Cycling'' titled magazine was the Nov. 1968 issue, Vol. 7 No. 8.  The name was changed to ''Bicycling!'' with the Dec 1968 Issue Vol 7 No 9. For three months following the name change, "American Cycling" was included on the cover in small print under the ''Bicycling!'' masthead. ''NCCA Newsletter'' and ''American Cycling'' were published 10 times a year, March though December; however, in 1968 -the first year under Leete- there were only 9 issues. Leete skipped the October issue and called it November both to make it more current, and because they were behind in production as they worked on the design change to ''Bicycling!''.  After 1968 the magazine went to publishing 12 issues a year.  In April 1973 the magazine was acquired by Capital Management Publications.  In early December 1977, a team was sent from Rodale to California to meet with the owner and iron out a deal.&lt;ref&gt;Our Roots Grow Deep: The Story of Rodale, Daniel Gross, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodale acquired ''Bicycling!'' and published their first issue in February, 1978.  In 1980, Rodale purchased a smaller magazine, ''Bike World'', and merged it into ''Bicycling!''. In 1982 Rodale bought ''American Cyclist'' and incorporated it into ''Bicycling''. Pricing of the magazine changed over the years as follows July 62 to December 64, 25 cents, March 65 to June 67, 35 cents, July 67 to July 68, 45 cents, In August 1968 with the Leete purchase the price went up to 50 cents, and the covers were changed to full color, the previous covers had been in red and black.

Hearst acquired Rodale in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/business/mc-biz-hearst-buys-rodale-20170927-story.html|title=Media giant Hearst will acquire Rodale|last=Wagaman|first=Andrew|date=October 18, 2017|work=[[The Morning Call]]|access-date=2017-10-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/hearst-agrees-to-acquire-rodale-inc-publisher-of-mens-health-and-runners-world-1508361381|title=Hearst Agrees to Acquire Rodale Inc., Publisher of Men’s Health and Runner’s World|last=Trachtenberg|first=Jeffrey A.|date=2017-10-18|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and compilations==
[[BikeTown Africa]] is a project that started in 2006 as a partnership between ''Bicycling'', [[Rodale Press]], [[Bristol Myers Squibb]], and [[Kona Bicycle Company]]. The project donates bicycles to healthcare workers in Africa, particularly those involved in [[HIV/AIDS]] related work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthcornertv.com/?ar=411HealthStory&amp;m=06&amp;y=2007 Bike Town Africa: Health Story], ''[[Health Corner]]'' show 411, April 29, 2007 &amp; June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bicycling'' then documents the impact these bicycles have on the personal and professional lives of the recipients, such as in the May 2010 issue, where [[Dr. Travis]] (of the daytime television talk show ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'') is interviewed about his involvement in BikeTown (among other things).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedoctorstv.com/main/content/Bicycling_Dr_Travis Dr. Travis in ''Bicycling'' Magazine], thedoctorstv.com, retrieved April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue, ''Bicycling'' compiled a list of the 50 most bike-friendly cities in the United States, with [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] as number one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/04/07/2010-04-07_mag_puts_city_in_top_10_for_biker_friendliness.html New York named eighth most bike-friendly city in America ''Bicycling'' magazine], Michael Pantelidis, ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 6 April 2010, retrieved 16 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2017, it announced the release of a signature shoe for [[LaMelo Ball]], called the Melo Ball 1 (MB1), which was scheduled to be available in late 2017. According to Big Baller Brand, the shoe will be exceptionally light upon a request by Ball himself. The MB1 is currently priced at $395.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Calle|first=Franklyn|title=LaMelo Ball Debuts The MB1 By Big Baller Brand|url=http://www.slamonline.com/kicks/lamelo-ball-signature-sneaker-mb1|magazine=[[Slam (magazine)|SLAM Magazine]]|date=August 31, 2017|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gould|first=Andrew|title=Big Baller Brand Unveils MB1 Signature Sneakers for LaMelo Ball|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2730703-big-baller-brand-unveils-mb1-signature-sneakers-for-lamelo-ball|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=August 31, 2017|accessdate=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2017, Big Baller Brand revealed plans to create a signature shoe, known as the Gelo 3, for [[LiAngelo Ball]] after he left [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], following a shoplifting incident in China.&lt;ref name="gelo3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Polacek|first1=Scott|title=LiAngelo Ball to Get Signature 'Gelo 3' Big Baller Brand Shoe After Leaving UCLA|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2747616-liangelo-ball-to-get-signature-gelo-3-big-baller-brand-shoe-after-leaving-ucla|website=''[[Bleacher Report]]''|accessdate=February 12, 2018|date=December 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the MB1, the Gelo 3 is also set at around $395. However, his shoes would later be renamed to the G3 Lux during his playing time in Lithuania.

The company's founder, [[LaVar Ball]], also announced he would have signature shoes of not just his own, but a brand for his wife as well. LaVar's shoes are considered to be named "LaVariccis," while Tina Ball's signature shoes would be named "The Comeback," which was inspired by her recovery from a stroke she had in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://lonzowire.usatoday.com/2018/05/03/lavar-ball-reveals-name-of-tina-balls-future-big-baller-brand-shoe/&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2017, [[LaVar Ball]] announced the creation of the [[Junior Basketball Association]] (JBA), a professional league completely funded by Big Baller Brand that is designed as an alternative to [[college basketball]] for high school graduates.&lt;ref name="jba"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rovell|first1=Darren|title=LaVar Ball plans to start league for high school graduates|url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/21827823/lavar-ball-wants-start-league-high-school-graduates|website=''[[ESPN]]''|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league, which is set to launch in the summer of 2018, is expected to pay players $3,000 to $10,000 per month and include teams from several major American cities.&lt;ref name="jbapatent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Destefano|first1=Mike|title=LaVar Ball Just Took a Big Step Toward Forming His Own Basketball League|url=http://www.complex.com/sports/2018/01/lavar-ball-big-step-forming-own-basketball-league|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ball, players will be required to exclusively wear Big Baller Brand products, with uniforms, shoes, and other apparel provided by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rapaport|first1=Daniel|title=LaVar Ball Wants to Start a League for Players Who Don't Want to Go to College|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2017/12/20/lavar-ball-big-baller-brand-junior-basketball-association-league|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 2018, LaVar's youngest son, [[LaMelo Ball]], was confirmed to be one of the players entering the upstart league, while also being touted as the face of the league by his father.&lt;ref&gt;https://lonzowire.usatoday.com/2018/05/04/lamelo-ball-los-angeles-ballers-jba-league-lavar-ball-big-baller-brand/&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2018, Vytautas, the first professional team of LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball, announced that it would withdraw from the [[Baltic Basketball League]] (BBL) and in its place host five exhibition games to showcase the Ball brothers, called the [[Big Baller Brand Challenge Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rapaport|first1=Daniel|title=Prienu Vytautas to Play in 'Big Baller Brand Challenge Games'|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/05/prienu-vytautas-big-baller-brand-challenge-games-lithuania|website=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games, which took place from January 9 to January 29 and were live streamed through [[Facebook]], featured widespread advertisement of Big Baller Brand, with [[Business Insider]] commenting that the company was "the real star of the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lauletta|first1=Tyler|title=Over 100,000 people watched LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball's Lithuanian debut on Facebook — and they were treated to a huge ad for Big Baller Brand|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lamelo-ball-facebook-lithuania-debut-big-baller-brand-2018-1|website=''[[Business Insider]]''|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the Ball brothers began playing professionally, LaVar Ball heavily invested in Vytautas, helping it pay off its debts and allowing Big Baller Brand to become the team's main sponsor as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Josh|title=LaVar Ball paid 'a lot of money' for Big Baller Brand to sponsor LiAngelo, LaMelo's team|url=http://lonzowire.usatoday.com/2018/02/02/lavar-ball-big-baller-brand-liangelo-lamelo-vytautas/|website=''Lonzo Ball Wire''|accessdate=February 11, 2018|date=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team would also be involved with the [[Big Baller Brand International Tournament]] and a few other exhibition games involving the [[Chinese Basketball Association]]'s [[Guangdong Southern Tigers]] and the [[British Basketball League]]'s [[London Lions (basketball)|London Lions]] during the 2017–18 season, with the Big Baller Brand's founder coaching the team during those events.

On February 15, 2018, Lonzo Ball would release his debut rap album, [[Born 2 Ball]], under the Big Baller Music Group. The label would be a subsidiary of the Big Baller Brand and would be run by a close friend of LaVar's.

A '''bullring''' is an [[arena]] where [[bullfighting]] is performed. Bullrings are often associated with Spain, but they can also be found in neighboring countries and the [[New World]]. Bullrings are often historic and culturally significant centres that bear many structural similarities to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[amphitheatre]].

== Common structure ==
The classic bullring is an enclosed, roughly circular amphitheatre with tiered rows of stands that surround an open central space. The open space forms the arena or ''ruedo'', a field of densely packed crushed rock (''[[albero]]'') that is the stage for the bullfight. Also on the ground level, the central arena is surrounded by a staging area where the bullfighters prepare and take refuge, called the ''callejón'' (alley). The ''callejón'' is separated from the arena by a wall or other structure, usually made of wood and roughly 140&amp;nbsp;cm high. The partition wall has doors for the entrance and exit of the bull (''puerta de los toriles'') and human participants (''puerta de cuadrilla''), although the form, number, and placement of these doors will vary from one bullring to another. 
In regular places, the wall is pushed outwards leaving splits (''burladero'', from burlar: to evade, to dodge) that allow the bullfighters to go in the arena and to take refuge but are too narrow for the bull.
Nevertheless, on rare occasions the bull jumps the wall causing havoc in the corridor.
The walls also have a type of stirrup or foothold that aids in crossing over to the central arena, and sometimes stirrups on the arena side as well; these are used mostly by event staff if they need to intervene quickly in the case of an emergency. 
The arena is surrounded by climbing rows of seats.
The seats are priced differently according to the position of the sun during the show, normally in the afternoon.
The hot ''sol'', "sun", is cheaper than the fresher ''sombra'', "shade".

== Architectural origins ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
Bullrings evolved as specialized sporting arenas hand-in-hand with the sport that demanded them. Many of the ancient Roman amphitheatres had characteristics that can be seen in the bullrings of today (in fact the ring in [[Nîmes]], France, is a Roman artifact, though it is more elliptical than the usual plaza), and the origin of [[bullfighting]] is very closely related to certain Roman traditions; in the formative years of the sport on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], those Roman enclosures were not commonly utilised for bullfighting events. Back when bullfighting festivals were conducted principally on horseback, the spectacle was a more public affair that took place in the city's open [[plaza]] area. It was only later, when bullfights were conducted principally by men on foot, that the public needed a structure to house them appropriately. Not only did the crowd need special seating to view the spectacle, they also needed a structure to contain the general disorder that reigned at festivals during the heyday of such legendary figures as [[Costillares]], [[Pedro Romero]], and [[Pepe-Hillo]]. 

In these early days, the circular form was not to be taken for granted. When [[Maestranza (Seville)|La Maestranza]] bullring in [[Seville]] was authorized for construction in 1730 specifically to house bullfights, the original plans called for a rectangular arena for the first three years, only later to be changed to a circular form that avoided the cornering of the action and put all viewers at the same approximate distance, the same reason for the elliptical form of amphitheatres. Another circular plaza was begun in [[Ronda]] in 1754, and it featured its first bullfights in 1782.

In the change from the 19th to the 20th century, the [[Neo-Mudéjar]] style became in vogue for plazas, involving decoration in visible brickwork.

Since the 1990s, new construction technology allows some rings to be covered permanently or temporarily.

==Alternative uses==
The primary purpose of the ring is bullfighting, but it is usually limited to some festival weeks in the year.
In other times, it may be used as a concert venue as in the ''[[Rock en el ruedo]]'' tour of [[Miguel Ríos]] or the live record ''[[Diamonds &amp; Rust in the Bullring]]'', featuring a [[Joan Baez]] concert in the Bilbao plaza.

Before the diffusion of modern sports premises, bullrings were used in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] for [[Basque Country (greater region)#Traditional Basque sports|traditional sports]] similar to challenges of [[Strength training|resistance running]]. The public made bets on the number of laps the runner could make. No bulls were involved.

After the [[battle of Badajoz (1936)]] of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Badajoz ring was used as a confinement camp for supporters of [[Second Spanish Republic|the republic]] and many thousands were executed there by the Nationalist forces who had just occupied the town.

Most indoor bullrings, especially in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, in addition to being used for concerts, have also been used for indoor sports such as [[basketball]], [[ice hockey]], [[boxing]] and [[lucha libre]].

== Bullrings of the world ==
The most famous bullrings in the world are  [[Las Ventas|Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas]] in [[Madrid]] (Spain), widely regarded as the most prestigious one,  [[La Maestranza]] in [[Seville]] (Spain), and [[Plaza de Toros México]] in Mexico.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

The '''Coogee Surf Life Saving Club''' is a foundation member of the [[surf lifesaving]] movement in [[Australia]]. It was founded in 1907 by a group of concerned locals and has a proud history of no lives being lost whilst its members have patrolled. Coogee SLSC celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2007, the Year of the Lifesaver.

Coogee SLSC has a history, which includes many firsts in the lifesaving movement. These include the first night surf carnival, the first mass rescue, the first [[shark attack]] and the development of the [[resuscitation]] technique. The Coogee SLSC clubhouse sits at the southern end of [[Coogee beach]]. The club's activities are managed and run by volunteers, with the assistance of a variety of community concerned sponsors, including Sydney City Renault.

Coogee SLSC has a representative on the [[Wylie's Baths]] Trust and conducts patrols at [[Wylie's Baths]] during summer.

The Club conducts an annual swimming event around [[Wedding Cake Island]] each November.  The event began in 2000 and attracts hundreds of competitors each year and is a prominent event on the Sydney Ocean Swim calendar.

[[Image:Decoys.jpg|thumb|Carved, wooden [[duck decoy (model)|duck decoy]]s]]

A '''decoy''' (derived from the ''duck-coy'', "[[Duck decoy (structure)|duck cage]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=81|year=1855|issue=6|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is usually a person, [[tool|device]], or event meant as a distraction, to hide what an individual or a group might be looking for. Decoys have been used for centuries most notably in game [[hunting]], but also in [[war]]time and in the committing or resolving of [[crime]]s.

[[Image:Decoy_in_action.png|thumb|Illustration demonstrating the use of a dog in a duck decoy tunnel (1886)]]

The term decoy may refer to two distinct devices, both used for hunting wildfowl. One is a long cone-shaped [[wickerwork]] tunnel installed on a small pond to catch wild [[duck]]s. After the ducks settled on the pond, a small, trained dog would herd the birds into the tunnel. The catch was formerly sent to market for food, but now these are used only to catch ducks to be [[Bird ringing|ring]]ed and released: see [[ornithology]]. The word ''decoy'', also originally found in English as "coy", derives from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''de Kooi'' (the cage) and dates back to the early 17th century, when this type of duck trap was introduced to England from the Netherlands. As "decoy" came more commonly to signify a person or a device than a pond with a cage-trap, the latter acquired the [[retronym]] "decoy pool".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The other form of duck decoy, otherwise known as a ''hunting decoy'' or ''wildfowl decoy'', is a life-size model of the creature. The hunter places a number about the hunting area as they will encourage wild birds to land nearby, hopefully within the range of the concealed hunter. Originally carved from wood, they are now made from plastic.

Wildfowl decoys (primarily ducks, geese, shorebirds, and crows, but including some other species) are considered a form of [[folk art]]. Collecting decoys has become a significant hobby both for folk art collectors and hunters. The world record was set in September 2007 when a pintail drake and Canada goose, both by [[A. Elmer Crowell]] sold for 1.13 million apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ducks and Decoys|last=Frangoulis|first=George|publisher=The Farmstead Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-312-60897-9|location=tuscaloosa, Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military decoy==
[[Image:DummyShermanTank.jpg|thumb|An inflatable [[dummy tank]], modeled after the World War 2, [[M4 Sherman]]]]
{{Main|Military dummy}}
The decoy in war is a low-cost device intended to represent a real item of military equipment. They may be deployed in amongst their real counterparts, to fool enemy forces into attacking them and so protect the real items of equipment by diverting fire away from them.

Alternatively, large numbers of military decoys, or dummys, may be deployed as an aspect of [[Military deception]]. Their purpose is to fool the enemy into believing forces in a particular area are much stronger than they really are. One notable example are [[Quaker Gun]]s.

For a [[defense (military)|defense]] system, decoys and [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] for [[ICBM]]s would mainly work in mid-course: during the boost phase they would be inside the [[rocket]], because separate rockets for each of many decoys would not be practical, while at [[atmospheric reentry]] light decoys and chaff considerably slow down and/or are destroyed in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].

===Bomb decoy===
In [[irregular warfare]], [[improvised explosive device]]s are commonly used as roadside bombs to target military patrols. Some [[Guerrilla warfare|guerillas]] also use imitation IEDs to intimidate civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/four-decoy-ieds-found-port-said-polling-stations|title=Four decoy IEDs found in Port Said polling stations - Egypt Independent|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wardiaries.wikileaks.org/id/10228/|title=DECOY IED FOUND BY 1BCT WEST OF SAMARRA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to waste [[bomb disposal]] resources,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a528332.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or to set up an ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/health/research/28brain.html|title=In Battle, Hunches Prove to Be Valuable|date=28 July 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmcofficer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Improvised-Explosive-Devices.pdf "One enemy TTP is to set decoy IEDs in order to observe the immediate reactions of coalition forces.

=== Sonar decoy ===
{{Main article|Sonar decoy}}

==In biochemistry==
In biochemistry, there are decoy [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], decoy [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] and decoy [[ribonucleic acid|RNA]]. In addition, digital decoys are used in [[protein folding]] simulations.

===Decoy receptor=== &lt;!--Decoy receptor redirects here--&gt;
[[Decoy receptors]], or sink receptors,&lt;ref name=vegf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=eurekah.section.2469|title=Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor|author=Hugo H. Marti|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are receptors that bind a [[ligand]], inhibiting it from binding to its normal receptor. For instance, the receptor [[VEGFR-1]] can prevent [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) from binding to the [[VEGFR-2]]&lt;ref name=vegf/&gt; The [[TNF inhibitor]] [[etanercept]] exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by being a decoy receptor that binds to TNF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zalevsky J, Secher T, Ezhevsky SA |title=Dominant-negative inhibitors of soluble TNF attenuate experimental arthritis without suppressing innate immunity to infection |journal=J. Immunol. |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=1872–83 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17641054 |doi= 10.4049/jimmunol.179.3.1872|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decoy substrate=== &lt;!--Psejjvnudosubstrate redirects here--&gt;
A ''decoy substrate'' or ''pseudosubstrate'' is a protein that has similar structure to the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] of an [[enzyme]], in order to make the enzyme bind to the pseudosubstrate rather than to the real substrate, thus blocking the activity of the enzyme. These proteins are therefore [[enzyme inhibitor]]s.

Examples include [[K3L]] produced by [[vaccinia virus]], which prevents the [[immune system]] from phosphorylating the substrate [[eIF-2]] by having a similar structure to eIF-2. Thus, the vaccinia virus avoids the immune system.

===Digital decoys===
In protein folding simulations, a decoy is a computer-generated protein structure which is designed so to ''compete'' with the real structure of the protein. Decoys are used to test the validity of a protein model; the model is considered correct only if is able to identify the native state configuration of the protein among the decoys.

Decoys are generally used to overcome a main problem in protein folding simulations: the size of the [[Polymer chemistry|conformational space]]. For very detailed protein models, it can be practically impossible to explore all the possible configurations to find the native state.
To deal with this problem, one can make use of decoys. The idea behind this is that it is unnecessary to search blindly through all possible conformations for the native conformation; the search can be limited to a relevant sub-set of structures. To start with, all non-compact configurations can be excluded.
A typical decoy set will include globular conformations of various shapes, some having no secondary structures, some having helices and sheets in different proportions.
The computer model being tested will be used to calculate the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the protein in the decoy configurations. The minimum requirement for the model to be correct is that it identifies the native state as the minimum free energy state (see [[Anfinsen's dogma]]).

==Decoys as folk art==
{{Main|Waterfowl decoy collecting}}
Ever since [[Joel Barber]], the first known decoy collector, started in 1918, decoys have become increasingly viewed as an important form of North American folk art. Barber's book [[Wild Fowl Decoys]], was the first book on decoys as collectible objects. It was followed in 1965 by folk art dealer Adele Earnest's "The Art of the Decoy" and "American Bird Decoys" by collector Wm. J. Mackey.

William J. Mackey made many trips to Chincoteague Island for the great flounder fishing as well as hunting for Chincoteague decoys. On his trips to the island he called Snug Harbor Marina home. He would send out locals to search for great finds of Chincoteague history. Cigar Daisey was one of the local Chincoteaguers that would help Mackey find all the best decoys that made his collection world-famous. Cigar has told many stories of the many truck loads of decoys he rounded up for his good friend.
By that time a milestone in collecting had already occurred with the publication of "Decoy Collectors Guide", a small magazine created by hobbyists Hal &amp; Barbara Sorenson of Burlington, Iowa. The 'Guide' helped foster a sense of community and provided a forum for collectors to share their research.

By the 1970s decoys were becoming big business, at least by previous standards. The death of Wm. F. Mackey brought his decoys to market in a series of auctions in 1973 and 1974, with the star of his collection, a Long-billed Curlew by Wm. 'Bill' Bowman selling for a record US$10,500.

Since the 1960s numerous collectors organizations have been created, specialist books and magazines published, with specialist dealers, and special interest shows around the US and Canada.

The largest collectors organization is the Midwest Decoy Collectors Association (MDCA)which despite its name is the de facto international group. MDCA is a non-profit, [501(c)(3)] organization which sponsors the biggest show of the year. There are numerous state and regional groups as well.

The current world record was set when two decoys (Canada goose and a preening pintail drake) by A. Elmer Crowell of East Harwich, MA were sold for $1.13 million each on September 19, 2007 by Stephen O'Brien Jr. Fine Arts, in what O'Brien describes as "the largest private sale of decoys ever." The decoys were part of a private sale of 31 decoys for $7.5 million. &lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.decoymag.com|title=Joe Engers, Editor of Decoy Magazine|accessdate=2018-08-30 | work=Decoy Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;Joe Engers, Editor of Decoy Magazine, noted that O'Brien is one of the top dealers of decoys in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/09/21/to_tune_of_113m_decoys_are_the_real_thing/|title=To tune of $1.13m, decoys are the real thing|accessdate=2007-09-21 | work=The Boston Globe | date=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other admired makers were the Ward brothers, Lemuel (1896–1984) and Steven, of [[Crisfield]], [[Maryland]]. Their career output is estimated at between 27,000 and 40,000 birds, working and decorative.

One of the most famous decoy makers in recent times is [[Delbert Daisey|Delbert "Cigar" Daisey]] from Chincoteague Va. Cigar decoys are in high demand all over the country. The best decoy he ever made was a pintail that he made for his wife in 1973. This decoy was featured in National Geographic in June 1980 on page 826. This decoy is estimated to be worth between $100,000 - $150,000.

[[Fish decoy]] collecting is also quite popular. Especially ice fishing decoys. See also [[fishing lures]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">'''Economy rate''' (also known as the '''Jade Dernbach-o-meter''') is the average number of runs conceded per over in [[cricket]]. The calculation is (Econ = Runs/Overs bowled). Overs are written as decimals from 0.1 to 0.6, so must be converted into actual decimals (e.g. 0.3 Overs is actually 0.5 as 3 is half of 6) before used in the calculation.

==Overview==
The economy rate is the average number of runs conceded for each over bowled. From the Bowler’s perspective, extras (byes and leg byes) are not counted as runs, hence not added to his tally of runs conceded in an over, but the error balls i.e.  a [[Wide (cricket)|wide]] and [[no-ball]] are counted and added to his over, which is displayed in his bowling figure.&lt;ref name="allthatcricket"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthatcricket.com/?p=1732 |title=Runs per Over (Economy Rate) &amp;#124; All That Cricket|publisher=allthatcricket.com|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy rate is more important in one-day cricket and Twenty20 matches than in Test match cricket. The shorter forms of the game (ODI and T20) demand that bowlers (and fielders) restrict the flow of runs from the opposition to give their team a better chance of finishing the game with more runs on the board. In Tests, however, the priority when in the field is to bowl the opposition out and take all ten wickets in both the innings. A bowler's economy rate is normally calculated from their career record, but one might also calculate it for a specific period of time, such as a calendar year or the duration of a World Cup tournament. In one day matches, a career economy rate of less than five runs per over is good. Conceding too many quick runs in a Test match is sure to get you taken off by your captain and replaced with another bowler, while taking a wicket in limited overs matches invariably slows the run rate. Like many aspects of cricket, economy rate vs bowling average vs bowling strike rate is a matter of finding a good balance. In Twenty20 matches, anything under seven runs per over is considered to be good.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cricket.about.com/od/glossary/fl/Economy-rate.htm |title=Economy rate - Cricket Glossary|publisher=cricket.about.com|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jade Dernbach]] is at the top of the list of players who have the worst economy rates in [[One Day International cricket]] with 6.35 as economy rate.&lt;ref name="sportskeeda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/stat-worst-career-economy-rate-odis |title=Stats: Worst career economy rate in ODIs|publisher=sportskeeda.com|accessdate=2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Men's artistic team all-around''' competition at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] was held at the [[Beijing National Indoor Stadium]] on August 12, 2008.

Teams qualified through the general artistic qualification performances. Each team was composed of six gymnasts. Five of those gymnasts performed on each of the six apparatus, and four of those scores counted towards the team total. The eight teams with the best combined scores in the qualification moved on to the team final.

In the team final, each team selected three gymnasts to compete on each apparatus. All three scores counted for the team score; the three scores on each apparatus were summed to give a final team score.

==Qualified teams==
{{main|Gymnastics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic qualification}}
The eight teams with the highest scores&lt;ref&gt;Scoring in artistic gymnastics is based on two separate scores that are then combined in order to come to the final score.  The A score measures the difficulty of each element (and combinations of elements) within the routine, while the B score evaluates the performance, ie, the "execution, composition and artistry" of the routine. For further information, please see the [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Gymnastics at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic qualification|qualifying]] proceed to the men's artistic team finals.

The '''Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium''' ({{lang-el|Στάδιο Γεώργιος Καραϊσκάκης}} {{IPA-el|staðio karaiˈskakis|}}) is a [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]] in the [[Neo Faliro]] area of [[Piraeus]], near [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is the home ground of the Greek club [[Olympiacos F.C.]] and is named after [[Georgios Karaiskakis]], a military commander of the [[Greek War of Independence]], who was mortally wounded near the area.

==History==
It was used during the [[1896 Summer Olympics]] as the [[Neo Phaliron Velodrome]], where [[France|Frenchman]] [[Paul Masson (cyclist)|Paul Masson]] took the three [[Cycling at the 1896 Summer Olympics|track cycling]] gold medals.

It was renovated during the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadia.gr/karaiskaki/karaiskakiold.html|title=
Velodrome and Karaiskaki Stadium (1895 – 1964 – 2003)|publisher=stadia.gr|accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was completely rebuilt in 2004 into a 32,115 capacity, all seater [[stadium]], ready for the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|football competition]] of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/karaiskaki/|title=Karaiskakis Stadium|publisher=stadiumguide.com|accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819195306/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf |date=19 August 2008 }} Volume 2. p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was totally demolished and built again from the beginning, facing a different direction. This complete reconstruction took a record time of only 14 months, finishing just in time for the Olympic Games.
After the last deal ended in 1998, Olympiacos is using the stadium once again, on a 49-year lease from [[2003-04 in Greek football|2003]] until 2052 and is traditionally identified as the club's true home. In 2002, the president and owner of Olympiacos [[Socratis Kokkalis]], when announced the project to rebuild Karaiskakis, expressed his wish for the new stadium to be also used by Ethnikos F.C., if they wanted, as Karaiskakis is the historic home of both Olympiacos and Ethnikos. Therefore, in the contract signed by the Hellenic Olympic Committee, the owner of the stadium, and Olympiacos, a clause was included, stating that should Ethnikos wish to return to the stadium, they may do so without sharing any significant maintenance or other stadium-related costs, as those are covered by Olympiacos. As of the 2010/11 season though, Ethnikos has not yet opted to do so.

The ticket sales average higher than any team's in recent decades for the [[Super League Greece]] history (rarely have they dropped under the 5,000 mark) and are not expected to drop in the foreseeable future.

Sales for national team matches had also been higher, but this was for the most part due to [[Greece national football team|Greece's]] success in the [[Euro 2004]]. As of 2008 and after Greece's disappointing [[Euro 2008]] performance, the attendance of national team matches dropped drastically, leading the Ministry of Sport to change the venue to [[Heraklion|Heraklion, Crete]].

In June 2005, Karaiskakis stadium hosted a movie theatre (''Ciné Karaiskakis'') with a cinema screen that is 20 m long and 10 m wide, operating daily between 9 and 11 p.m. (6 and 8 p.m. UTC) and later, every weekend. The movie screen featured movies including ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and others. The stadium operated as a movie theatre for the last time on Saturday 13 August 2005.

==The Gate 7 Tragedy==
{{Main article|Karaiskakis Stadium disaster}}
Twenty-one supporters of [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] lost their lives in "Gate 7" (Θύρα 7) of the stadium, after a game between [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] and [[AEK Athens FC]] (that ended 6–0), on 8 February 1981; an incident widely known as the [[Karaiskaki Stadium disaster]]. In memory of this event, at the tribune where Gate 7 is now, twenty-one seats are black colored instead of red, shaping the number "7". A monument on the eastern side of the stadium bears the names of the twenty-one supporters killed on that day in the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympiacos.org/en/stadium-gate-7|title=Karaiskaki Stadium History|publisher=olympiacos.org|accessdate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium features==
[[File:Image Olympiacos Chelsea CL0708 2.jpg|260px|thumb|Olympiacos vs [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] during [[UEFA Champions League 2007-08]]]]

Karaiskakis Stadium is classified as a 4-star football stadium by the [[UEFA]] organisation, allowing it to host the UEFA Europa League Final if chosen. It hosts 40 VIP lounges and suites, that can hold up to 474&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympiacos.org/en/hospitality]&lt;/ref&gt; persons, a press conference hall, that can hold up to 130 seats, 200 seats for press and media coverage, an entire shopping mall, with restaurants, cafés, retail and clothing stores and a gym.

The stadium also hosts [http://www.olympiacos.org/en/olympiacos-museum Olympiacos Museum], dedicated not only to the history of the football club, but to the history of all the departments of the multiple European title-winning multi-sport club [[Olympiacos CFP]]. There are 10 automated ticket selling machines around the stadium enabling reservations through the internet or by phone. There is no extra charge for the parking area, which takes up to 1,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympiacos.org/hospitality]&lt;/ref&gt;  cars. Due to its design, the stadium's tribunes have the ability to empty within 7 minutes. The stadium also has restaurants and stores opened during concerts and games and sometimes open with the daily general timetable of most Greek stores and shops.

The stadium is easily accessed through the [[Athens Mass Transit System]], at the station "Faliro", which is about 15 minutes from Athens city centre, at the "Omonia" square station and also through Athens driving routes, which is 8&amp;nbsp;km, about 15 minutes from downtown [[Athens]].

==Concerts==
[[Rihanna]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Evanescence]], [[50 Cent]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Imiskoumbria]], [[Def Leppard]] and [[Sex Pistols]] have performed at the stadium.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Other names of the stadium==

Although the official name of the stadium is [[Georgios Karaiskakis]], however the stadium is known with other names too 
*'''Naos''': "Temple", by Olympiakos fans or '''Tigani''': "Frying pan"&lt;ref&gt;Frying pan is the home utensil where the anchovies (=γαύροι) are baked, as they are called Olympiakos fans&lt;/ref&gt;, by Greek football fans

The '''Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump''' ({{lang-tr|Kiremitliktepe Kayakla Atlama Kuleleri}}), or officially '''Türk Telekom Ski Jumping Towers''', is a [[ski jumping]] venue located on the Kiremitlik Hill at the base of [[Palandöken Mountain]] just southwest of [[Erzurum]] in eastern [[Turkey]]. Completed in September 2010, the complex consists of a large hill (K-125) and a normal hill (K-95) jumping tower, as well as three additional smaller slopes of K-65, K-40 and K-20 for training purposes and for use by young jumpers.&lt;ref name="sss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/TUR-Turkey/Erzurum/0444-Kiremitliktepe/ |publisher=Ski Jumping Hill Archive |title=Erzurum Kiremitliktepe-TürkTelekom Ski Jumping Towers |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and construction==
The construction of the ski jumping center was part of a project of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the [[Turkey Ski Federation]] that was needed for the realization of the [[2011 Winter Universiade]] in Erzurum. The ski jumping facility was designed in [[modern architecture|modernist style]] by the [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architecture firm Atelje S, partner of the co-contractor MANA Original company from the same country, which won the project's international request for tender along with the Turkish Sarıdağlar construction company in March 2008.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atelje-s.si/en/node/38 |publisher=Atelje S |title=skakalni center turčija |accessdate=2013-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manaoriginal.eu/EE/index.php/novice/turk_telekom_ski_jumping_center_in_erzurum |publisher=MANA Original |title=Turk Telekom Ski Jumping Center in Erzurum |accessdate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130701110839/http://www.manaoriginal.eu/EE/index.php/novice/turk_telekom_ski_jumping_center_in_erzurum |archivedate=2013-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erzurum is located on a high plateau at {{convert|1950|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Height above mean sea level|AMSL]] in [[Eastern Anatolia Region]]. The Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump, situated on the highway {{TUR-D|950}} about {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the city, is at the base of Palandöken Mountain that rise up to {{convert| 	3271|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude.&lt;ref name="sss"/&gt;

The center with five ski jumping slopes covers an area of {{convert|30|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. The two Olympic-size towers has cylindrical structures at the top.

The multi-purpose facility allows organization of ski jumping events at highest level year around. The high-tech ice-ceramic track inruns and plastic matt covered ski-jump landing area enable equal competition conditions in winter season as well as during the rest of the year irrespectively of the weather.&lt;ref name="mo"/&gt; The venue has 10,000 spectator capacity.&lt;ref name="sss"/&gt;

The complex offers accommodation in the hotel near the large hill and in the bungalows on top of the center, and catering in the restaurant atop the main ski jump tower. There is a gym hall for training, and saunas and massage pools for relaxation.&lt;ref name="mo"/&gt; 

Also during the time when no competitions are held, the facility attracts local population and tourists for recreation activities and social events at the hotel restaurant and the restaurant atop the 43m-high tower, which offers a panoramic view of the entire city.&lt;ref name="mo"/&gt;

===Large hill===
The large hill has a [[K-point]] of 125 and a [[hill size]] of 140 with a {{convert|43.47|m|ft|abbr=on}} high jumping tower.

The slope for the landing is 34.57°. The total height is {{convert|136.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sss"/&gt;

Hill record was set with 143.5&amp;nbsp;m by [[Matej Dobovsek]] from Slovenia  at the 2011 Winter Universiade on January 29, 2011.&lt;ref name="sss"/&gt;
 
===Normal hill===
The normal hill's K-point is 95 and hill size 109. It has a jumping tower of {{convert|20.98|m|ft|abbr=on}} height. The inrun is {{convert|88|m|ft|abbr=on}} long at an angle of 35°.

The normal hill has a total height of {{convert|107.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="sss"/&gt;

==Events hosted==
The first international event, which took place at the Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump, was the [[FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup]] on December 18-19, 2010. The next competition was the Winter Universiade held from January 28 to February 3, 2011. The venue hosted again the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup's ski jumping event in December 2011 and [[Nordic combined]] event in January 2012. The [[2012 FIS Junior World Ski Championships]] were held at the ski jumping facility from February 22 to 25.&lt;ref name="sss"/&gt;

==2014 landslide==
On July 15, 2014, there was a huge [[landslide]] on the Kiremitlik Hill with the result that hills were damaged. On investigation it was noted that the construction completely lacked foundations, the ski slopes and seating being laid directly onto bare earth. Due to this accident, the future of the Kiremitliktepe Ski Jump and also of ski jumping in Turkey is doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://skokinews.com/2014/07/15/znacznie-uszkodzona-skocznia-w-tureckim-erzurum/ |publisher=SKOKInews.com |title=Znacznie uszkodzona skocznia w tureckim Erzurum! |date=2014-07-15 |language=Polish |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718011843/http://skokinews.com/2014/07/15/znacznie-uszkodzona-skocznia-w-tureckim-erzurum/ |archivedate=2014-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liechtenstein Olympic Committee''' ({{lang-de|Liechtensteinisches Olympisches Komitee}}) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] representing [[Liechtenstein]]. Before the organisation was renamed in 2013 it was called "Liechtensteinischer Olympischer Sportverband" (LOSV).

== Establishment ==
The motive to establish a National Olympic Committee for Liechtenstein was the wish to participate in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] and [[1936 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games]] in Germany in the year 1936. Through the engagement of Baron Eduard Alexander von Falz-Fein the first NOC of Liechtenstein was founded to meet the formal requirements given by the IOC for the participation in the Olympic Games. This step was successful and for the first time a delegation of two athletes, three shooters and one cyclist was sent to Berlin in the summer to participate in their first Olympic Games for Liechtenstein. In the following Winter Games another delegation with two alpine skiers and one two-man bobsleigh team was sent to represent Liechtenstein. Since then Liechtenstein participated in almost all Winter and Summer Olympic Games.

'''Oracle Arena''' is an [[indoor arena]] located in [[Oakland, California]], United States, and is the home of the [[Golden State Warriors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The arena opened in 1966 and is the oldest arena in the NBA. From its opening until 1996 it was known as the '''Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum Arena'''. After a major renovation completed in 1997, the arena was renamed '''The Arena in Oakland''' until 2005 and '''Oakland Arena''' from 2005 to 2006. It is often referred to as the '''Oakland Coliseum Arena''' as it is located adjacent to the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]]. Oracle Arena seats 19,596 fans for basketball and 17,200 for ice hockey.

==History==

===Home franchises===
The arena has been the home of the [[Golden State Warriors]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basketball.ballparks.com/NBA/GoldenStateWarriors/index.htm|title=Oracle Arena|first=BALLPARKS.com by Munsey and|last=Suppes|website=basketball.ballparks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the [[1971–72 NBA season|1971&amp;ndash;72 season]], except the one-year hiatus while the arena was undergoing renovations. It had been used by the Warriors intermittently as early as [[1966–67 NBA season|1966]]. The [[California Golden Bears]] of the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]] played the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons at the arena while their primary home, Harmon Gym, was being renovated into [[Haas Pavilion]]. For some years before then, the Bears played occasional games against popular non-conference opponents at the arena.

Oracle Arena has been home to Warriors playoff games in 1972, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, 2007, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Golden-State-Warriors/9/Playoff-History|title=Golden State Warriors Playoff History - RealGM|website=basketball.realgm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted the [[2015 NBA Finals|2015]], [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]], [[2017 NBA Finals|2017]], and the [[2018 NBA Finals]], where the Warriors won in 2015, 2017, and 2018. The 2015 victory was the first time since 1975 the Warriors won the title; however, Games 2 and 3 of the [[1975 NBA Finals]] were played in the [[Cow Palace]] as the Coliseum was unavailable. The 2017 victory was the first time that a San Francisco Bay Area team won a title in their home venue since the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1974 World Series]].

The arena's first tenants were the [[San Francisco Seals (ice hockey)|California Seals]] of the [[Western Hockey League (minor pro)|Western Hockey League]], who moved across [[San Francisco Bay|the bay]] from the [[Cow Palace]] in 1966. The owners of the San Francisco Seals had been awarded an expansion franchise in the [[National Hockey League]] on the condition they move out the Cow Palace and into the then-new Oakland Coliseum Arena. The team changed its operating name from San Francisco Seals to California Seals in order to draw fans from both San Francisco and Oakland. The Seals franchise continued to play at the arena after having transferred to the NHL, until the team moved to Cleveland after the [[1975–76 NHL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hockey.ballparks.com/NHL/CaliforniaSeals/index.htm|title=Oakland/Alameda Coliseum|first=BALLPARKS.com by Munsey and|last=Suppes|website=hockey.ballparks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coliseum also hosted the [[American Basketball Association]]'s [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]] (1967–1969), a charter member of the new ABA in 1967. The Oaks signed [[San Francisco Warriors]] star [[Rick Barry]] away from the rival [[National Basketball Association]] in 1968. The team was owned by entertainer [[Pat Boone]] and also had stars [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] and [[Doug Moe]] on its roster. Brown and Barry are in the Basketball Hall of Fame. After a 22–56 record in their first season, the Oaks went 60–18 during the regular season in 1968–69. The Oaks then defeated the [[Denver Rockets]], [[New Orleans Buccaneers]] and finally the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the playoffs to capture the ABA Championship. However, the team was plagued by poor attendance and Boone sold the team following their ABA Championship. They were relocated to Washington and became the [[Washington Caps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Oakland-Oaks.html|title=Remember the ABA: Oakland Oaks|website=www.remembertheaba.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bay Bombers ([[Roller derby|Roller Derby]], 1966–1973) as well as the [[Golden Bay Earthquakes]] of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–92)|original MISL]] during the 1982–83 season and the [[Oakland Skates]], a professional [[roller hockey]] team active from 1993 to 1995, all played there. WWE also holds professional wrestling matches at the arena.

===Renovation===
Over three decades, the arena grew outdated, lacking the luxuries of newer ones. With just over 15,000 seats, it was one of the smallest venues in the league. Rather than building a new arena in Oakland, San Francisco or [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the decision was made to proceed with a US$121 million renovation that involved tearing out much of interior and building a new seating bowl within the existing structure. The original walls, roof and foundation remained intact, similar to the rebuild of [[KeyArena]] in [[Seattle]]. The renovation began in mid-1996 and was completed in time for the Warriors return in the fall of [[1997–98 Golden State Warriors season|1997]] (they played the [[1996–97 Golden State Warriors season|previous season]] at the [[San Jose Arena]], home of the NHL's [[San Jose Sharks|Sharks]]). Included in the renovation was a new center overhead [[LED]] scoreboard and 360-degree fascia display. The new configuration seats 19,596 for [[basketball]] and 17,200 for [[ice hockey]].

===The Oracle===
On October 20, 2006, the Golden State Warriors and [[Oracle Corporation]] announced that the Oakland Arena would be known as The Oracle for a 10-year term. A press conference was held on October 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/Oracle_Formal_Announcement.html|title=Warriors, ORACLE Formally Announce Naming Rights Agreement For ORACLE Arena - Golden State Warriors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The O", as it is referred to, continued to be managed by Oakland–Alameda County Authority (JPA) and SMG. The JPA approved the deal at its November 10 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/Oracle_Naming_Rights_Agreement.html|title=Golden State Warriors, Oracle Reach Arena Naming Rights Agreement - Golden State Warriors|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Arena has, at least since 2013, been one of the loudest arenas in the NBA. It is called "Roaracle" because of the painfully high decibel levels sometimes generated at Warriors games. The Warriors will play their final regular season home game on April 7, 2019 against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] (pending any playoff games if they qualify, which they may), and the team's lease is set to expire by the end of June 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2013/5/21/4351786/hey-roaracle-i-heard-you-are-a-wild-one-said-warriors-jarrett-jack-and-other-veteran-free-agents "Hey Roaracle"], May 21, 2013, Retrieved May 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendance records===
[[Image:GSW Vs Utah.jpg|thumb|250px|A record-breaking crowd watching the Warriors in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.]]
On May 13, 2007, 20,679 fans watched the Warriors lose to the [[Utah Jazz]] 115–101 in Game 4 of the [[2007 NBA Playoffs|Western Conference semifinals]]. This was the highest attendance in the Warriors' 61-year history.

That record lasted until December 14, [[2007–08 NBA season|2007]], when the Warriors hosted the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and packed 20,705 into the Arena to set a new franchise attendance record.

The record was again broken on February 20, 2008, when the arena hosted 20,711 for the Warriors-[[Boston Celtics|Celtics]] game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/02/20/sports/s222359S25.DTL&amp;type=sports | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082307/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2008%2F02%2F20%2Fsports%2Fs222359S25.DTL&amp;type=sports | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2008-12-10 | title=Baron Davis hits last-second jumper in Warriors' 119–117 win over Celtics | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This record was set yet again on April 10, 2008, when Oracle Arena hosted 20,737 fans in a Warriors loss to the [[Denver Nuggets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://bleacherreport.com/articles/440114-next-for-the-warriors-the-oakland-warriors-or-san-francisco-bound|title= Next for the Warriors: The Oakland Warriors? Or San Francisco Bound?|author= Jeff Maus|publisher= [[Bleacher Report]] |date = August 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 2016–17 regular season, Oracle had sold out 230 consecutive home games, a streak that continued throughout the team's playoff run. Oracle drew over 18,000 people per game for 12 straight seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/warriors-230-straight-sellouts-20170412/|title= Warriors Conclude 2016-17 Regular Season with 230 Consecutive Sellouts|author= |publisher= [[www.nba.com/warriors]] |date = April 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grateful Dead===
The [[Grateful Dead]] played more concerts (66) at this venue than at any other,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlists.net/|title=The SetList Program - Grateful Dead Setlists, Listener Experiences, and Statistics|website=www.setlists.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlists.com/deadlists/venues.asp?order=4|title=venues|website=www.deadlists.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their December 16, 1992 concert at the arena was released as ''[[Dick's Picks Volume 27]]'', along with bonus tracks from their December 17, 1992 concert at the arena.

==Future==
Early in 2013, the Warriors announced they would build a new arena in San Francisco and move back to the city.&lt;ref name=Matier2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Matier|first=Phillip|title=Warriors to build new arena, move back to S.F.|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Warriors-to-build-new-arena-move-back-to-S-F-3575560.php|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle (SF Gate)|date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally suggested that the arena would be built on the decaying sites of Piers 30–32 near the foot of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]],&lt;ref name=Matier2013 /&gt; but the plan was met with opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Heather|last=Knight Perrigan|authorlink=|title=Golden State Warriors owners make a risky play|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2012/05/22/MNKD1OLCVJ.DTL|accessdate=May 22, 2012|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the Warriors purchased 12-acres in [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]] as the site for a new 18,000-seat arena planned to open for the 2018&amp;ndash;19 NBA season.&lt;ref name=Cote2014&gt;{{cite news|last=Cote|first=John|title=Warriors shift arena plans to Mission Bay|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Warriors-ditch-Piers-30-32-for-Mission-Bay-arena-5418579.php|accessdate=1 April 2016|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle (SF Gate)|date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new location eliminated the need for voter approval, which would have been required for the original site, though it had been unanimously approved by the San Francisco Supervisors in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.sfgate.com/cityinsider/2012/11/20/board-gives-warriors-arena-initial-green-light/ | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Board gives Warriors' arena initial green light}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of delays due to litigation filed by arena opponents it is now planned to open at the start of the 2019&amp;ndash;20 NBA season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS DELAY OPENING OF SAN FRANCISCO ARENA TO 2019|url=http://abc7news.com/sports/golden-state-warriors-delay-opening-of-sf-arena-to-2019/1160981/|accessdate=1 April 2016|newspaper=ABC 7 News|date=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new arena will be named the [[Chase Center (arena)|Chase Center]].&lt;ref name=Dineen2016&gt;{{cite news|last=Dineen|first=J.K.|title=Warriors arena to be named Chase Center — bank buys naming rights|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Warriors-arena-to-be-named-Chase-Center-bank-6788844.php|accessdate=1 April 2016|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle (SF Gate)|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">The '''Orange Beach Sportsplex''' is a sports complex in [[Orange Beach, Alabama]] that was built in 2001.

The focus of the complex is the 1,500-seat stadium. The stadium has hosted the [[SEC Women's Soccer Tournament]] and has completed negotiations to host the tournament through 2020.&lt;ref name=al1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2015/03/orange_beach_scores_deal_to_ho.html#incart_river_news|title=Orange Beach scores deal to host SEC women's soccer championship through 2020, likely 2025|first=Marc D. |last=Anderson|date=March 23, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|work=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility also hosts the [[NCAA Division II]] men's and women's soccer tournaments. Currently the stadium hosts the [[Alabama Lightning]] of the [[North American Football League]].

Aside from the stadium, the sportsplex is home to [[baseball]], [[softball]], and youth sports leagues.

The city of Orange Beach has announced plans to upgrade lighting on the championship field as part of the tournament contract. &lt;ref name=al1/&gt;

The '''Prix Bertrand du Breuil''' is a [[Conditions races|Group 3]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in [[France]] open to [[thoroughbred]]s aged four years or older. It is run at [[Chantilly Racecourse|Chantilly]] over a distance of 1,600 metres (about 1 mile), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The earliest version of the event was established at Chantilly in 1852. Its prize money was originally provided by the [[Chemin de Fer du Nord]], a railway company in northern France and the race was titled the '''Prix de Chemin du Fer du Nord'''. The first running was a 1,200-metre flat race for two-year-olds, and in the following years it was a 2,400-metre event over [[Hurdling (horse race)|hurdles]]. It reverted to being a flat race in 1856, when it became a 3,200-metre contest for horses aged three or older.

The Chemin de Fer du Nord continued to provide the total prize money until 1910. Thereafter, it contributed a partial amount each year until 1937. The funding discontinued when the regional railways merged to form the [[SNCF]].

The present Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord was created in 1933, when its distance was cut to 1,400 metres. It was cancelled in 1940, and for the next two years it was held at [[Longchamp Racecourse|Longchamp]]. It was run at [[Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse|Maisons-Laffitte]] in 1943, and was cancelled again in 1944. Another spell at Longchamp began in 1945.

The race was extended to 1,700 metres in 1950. It returned to Chantilly and reverted to 1,400 metres in 1955. The minimum age was raised to four in 1967, and the distance was increased to 1,600 metres in 1972.

The event was staged at Maisons-Laffitte in 1997 and 1998, and its current period at Chantilly began in 1999. It is now held on the same day as the [[Prix de Diane]].

In 2013 the race was renamed in memory of Bertrand du Breuil (1926-2011), the last president of the Societe d'Encouragemment, forerunner of [[France Galop]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2211">'''Sport management''' is the field of [[business]] dealing with [[sports]] and [[recreation]]. Some examples of sport managers include the [[front office]] system in [[professional sports]], [[college sports]] managers, recreational sport managers, [[sports marketing]], [[event management]], [[facility management]], sports economics, sport finance, and sports information.

Bachelor's and master's degrees in sport management are offered by many colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://johancruyffinstitute.com/en/sport-management/|title=Sport Management Academic Programs - Johan Cruyff Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Johan Cruyff Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nassm.com/Programs/AcademicPrograms|title=Academic Programs|publisher=North American Society for Sport Management|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of classes outside sport management may be relevant to the field, including; classes in management, marketing, business administration, economics, and accounting. Internships may also open opportunities within the field.

In America, jobs in sport management include working for professional programs like the [[NFL]], [[NBA]], [[MLB]], [[NHL]], [[MLS]], and other professional or non-professional sport leagues in terms of marketing, health, and promotions.

The '''TRX System''', also known as '''Total Resistance exercises''', refers to a specialized form of [[suspension training]] that utilizes equipment developed by former U.S. Navy SEAL [[Randy Hetrick]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=https://www.trxtraining.com/discover/who-we-are|website=TRX|publisher=Fitness Anywhere LLC|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TRX is a form of suspension training that uses body weight exercises to develop strength, balance, flexibility and core stability simultaneously. It requires the use of the TRX Suspension Trainer, a performance training tool that leverages gravity and the user’s body weight to complete the exercises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TRX's designers claim that it draws on research from the military, pro sports, and academic institutions along with experience gathered from the TRX team, who work "with thousands of athletes, coaches, trainers, first responders, subject matter experts, professors, and service members in all branches."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
While deployed in Southeast Asia in 1997, Hetrick was looking for a different method of training than the generic push-ups. He uses familiar products–a jiu-jitsu belt and parachute webbing–to create the first version of the TRE Suspension Trainer.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Story of TRX {{!}} TRX|url = https://www.trxtraining.com/discover/who-we-are/heritage|website = www.trxtraining.com|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, after 14 years as a SEAL Hetrick left the Navy and attended [[Stanford University]] where he earned his MBA. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-Navy SEAL Sells TRX Fitness Gear That ’Enables’ Content Sales|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-03-08/former-navy-seal-sells-trx-fitness-gear-to-enable-content-sales|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the gym regularly with the hopes of bringing his apparatus to a working prototype by gaining the attention of athletes, coaches and trainers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hetrick first established his TRX system at the [http://www.kravmaga-sf.com Krav Maga Fitness Club] on 1455 Bush Street San Francisco with $350,000 from private investors that he met through connections via Stanford and the military.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He began to sell the line of training equipment known today as TRX. Since 2017, the TRX International Day is celebrated on January 25th{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

==Benefits and criticism==

Supporters of TRX Training claim that it can improve mobility and stability, increase metabolic results, build lean muscle, and develop functional strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other advocates of the system say that you can't help but use your core for stabilization.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Suspension Training: How Risky Is It?|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/fashion/01Fitness.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2007-02-01|access-date = 2015-10-26|issn = 0362-4331|first = Nick|last = Burns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hedrick states that, "People who like yoga and Pilates tend to like TRX because there are some crossovers. But it's also great for runners, cyclists, or anyone who is an endurance athlete and wants to have more strength training."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4 Reasons to Try TRX Suspension Training|url = http://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Why-TRX-Good-Workout-21651496|website = POPSUGAR Fitness|accessdate = 2015-10-26|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, some analysts worry that the instability of suspension straps could possibly result in injury, especially for those with a history of joint or back injuries, or inadequate core strength.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fabio Comana, a research scientist at the nonprofit [[American Council on Exercise]], states that suspension training may work for well-conditioned athletes and gym-goers who regularly train their core, however, it is potentially dangerous for those who haven’t built up their core.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Trump National Golf Club Westchester''' is a private [[golf club]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]. Owned by [[Donald Trump]], the 45th [[President of the United States]], the {{convert|140|acre|ha|sing=on}} course has eighteen holes, with a {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} clubhouse. Founded in 1922 as ''Briarcliff Country Club'', it later operated as ''Briar Hills Country Club'' and ''Briar Hall Golf and Country Club'' before Trump's purchase of the property in 1996. Trump renamed the club to match his [[The Trump Organization#Golf courses|other golf properties]], and after its county, [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. He had the clubhouse and course rebuilt for its 2002 reopening; the course was designed by Jim Fazio. Donald Trump served as president over Trump National Golf Club LLC (managing the Westchester club) from August 2000 until January 19, 2017, the day before his inauguration.&lt;ref name="Discl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report|publisher=United States Office of Government Ethics|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3867112-Trump-Financial-Disclosure-2017.html|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Briar Hills pool 2.tif|thumb|Briar Hills pool, c. 1940]]
The club had its origins around 1895, with Briarcliff founder [[Walter W. Law]]'s private nine-hole course on his estate, which became available to [[Briarcliff Lodge]] guests, and was then known as the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year.&lt;ref name="Sale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=84}} The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to Briar Hills Country Club.&lt;ref name="1952history"/&gt;{{rp|page=84}}&lt;ref name="MCMA"/&gt; Briar Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and spaciousness.&lt;ref name="1929club"/&gt; In 1936, [[A. W. Tillinghast]] redesigned the course.&lt;ref name="Till"/&gt; In 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it Briar Hall Golf and Country Club.&lt;ref name="MCMA"/&gt; The 1964 [[Metropolitan Open]] was hosted at Briar Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship.&lt;ref name="MOpen"/&gt; In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.&lt;ref name="MCMA"/&gt;
&lt;!--Briar Hills - A new clubhouse was built, and a new golf course, designed by [[Devereux Emmet]]. For a time, the club utilized a large white house, Elderslie, as its clubhouse.&lt;ref name="Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=80}}--&gt;

Henry Law, a son of village founder Walter W. Law, was among Briar Hill's founders.&lt;ref name="Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=80}} Among the club's directors were Henry Law and his son Theodore Gilman Law;&lt;ref name="Landscape"/&gt;{{rp|page=80}} [[Gene Sarazen]] was the club's golf professional in 1923-24,&lt;ref name="MCMA"/&gt; followed by [[1952 PGA Championship|1952 PGA Champion]] [[Jim Turnesa]].&lt;ref name="Turnesa"/&gt;

===Trump's purchase and redevelopment===
At the time of Briar Hall's 1996 sale, the club had an 18-hole, {{convert|6313|yard|m|0}} golf course and  {{convert|78782|sqft|m2|0}} clubhouse, seven tennis courts, an in-ground swimming pool, pro shop, maintenance building, and pool house.&lt;ref name="Sale"/&gt; Briar Hall had been taken over by the Marine Midland Bank, which then sold the property to Trump.&lt;ref name="Ebsco1"/&gt; Trump bought Briar Hall Country Club for $7.5 million&lt;ref name="Value"/&gt; in the foreclosure in December 1996&lt;ref name="Controversy"/&gt; and ran the club until 1999, until he closed the property to begin its redevelopment.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; The first general manager of the club, Chief Operating Officer [[Carolyn Kepcher]], later became co-host on Trump's television show ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name="Kepcher1"/&gt; She was fired from the show and management position in August 2006.&lt;ref name="Kepcher2"/&gt;

On March 16, 1999, Briarcliff was operating its mayoral election, and incumbent mayor Keith Austin ran unopposed. Write-ins supporting lawyer Richard Mattiaccio prompted a conflict involving hundreds of residents, which led to one arrest. The event took place near the polls at the Village Hall; Mattiaccio had gained supporters by criticizing Austin's weak opposition to Trump's club reconstruction plans. Many residents believed a large project would congest streets with construction vehicles and rip up the landscape.&lt;ref name="Controversy"/&gt; In redesigning the club and its course, Trump hired golf course architect Jim Fazio, brother of [[Tom Fazio]] in the same profession.&lt;ref name="Fazio"/&gt; Around the same time, the workmen resodded a village soccer field and assisted in constructing a new veterans' memorial in Briarcliff.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; He also had the current {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} white clapboard and fieldstone clubhouse&lt;ref name="Rebuild"/&gt; built on the property.&lt;ref name="Value"/&gt; At one time, due to residents' criticism, the clubhouse was reduced to {{convert|35000|sqft|adj=on}}, eliminating guest rooms and special event halls. It was designed by Robert Lamb Hart Planners &amp; Architects, and included three stories with lockers, a 150-seat restaurant, and top-floor lounge.&lt;ref name="Reduce"/&gt;&lt;!--He demolished a {{convert|65000|sqft|adj=on}} clubhouse and replaced it with a {{convert|42000|sqft|adj=on}} one (originally planned at {{convert|81500|sqft|adj=on}})&lt;ref name="Rebuild"/&gt;--&gt; Other difficulties with the club's plans arose; the village planning board recognized villager concerns over golf tournaments, membership requirements, and pesticide use. And at the time of the club's reconstruction, Trump had three other golf clubs planned, including one in Seven Springs, an area within three towns which would require approval from all three, and one in the French Hill section of Yorktown.&lt;ref name="Rebuild"/&gt; Trump later dropped all of the plans, calling Westchester County "the toughest place to build on the planet".&lt;ref name="Rebuild"/&gt;

===Reopening and further events===
The first head golf professional was Frank Graniero.&lt;ref name="Ebsco1"/&gt; The club's first nine holes opened on April 15, 2002, followed by the next nine on June 29, 2002. The club had a total cost of $30 million&lt;ref name="MCMA"/&gt; or $40 million,&lt;ref name="OpenCost"/&gt; and was claimed to be the largest excavation project in Westchester County's history, with about {{convert|3000000|cuyd|adj=on}} of earth moved. The thirteenth hole cost Trump $7 million, surrounded by an artificial {{convert|101|ft|adj=on}} black granite waterfall, which pumps {{convert|5000|usgal|l|-2}} a minute.&lt;ref name="OpenCost"/&gt;&lt;!--$15 million 45,000 square foot clubhouse.&lt;ref name="MCMA"/&gt;--&gt;

In 2003 Trump tried to move the [[Sybase Classic]], a [[LPGA]] tournament, from [[Wykagyl Country Club]] to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump attempted to persuade the mayor to talk to his wife, [[Jean Chatzky]], about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the [[Briarcliff Manor Public Library]]'s then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there.&lt;ref name="LPGA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rojas|first=Marcela|title=Trump to Briarcliff: Don't be 'stupid'|newspaper=The Journal News|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/442536341/665F466BF4C74A8BPQ/19?accountid=40999|date=July 6, 2003|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or [[PGA Tour|PGA]] tournament to the club.&lt;ref name="Tour2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marchant|first=Robert|title=Trump wants golf event in village|newspaper=The Journal News|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/442647322/665F466BF4C74A8BPQ/2?accountid=40999|date=June 18, 2004|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A storm in June 2011 caused public utilities including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, which made the course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though it did not take corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=David McKay|title=Trump at war with Briarcliff Manor|newspaper=The Journal News|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1712761478/665F466BF4C74A8BPQ/13?accountid=40999|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood"/&gt;

When President Obama was in Westchester in 2014, his staff attempted to schedule visits to local golf clubs including Trump National, none of which wanted to close their courses for the president to play. Trump replied to [[NBC 4 New York]]'s report of the news with a widely circulated and publicized tweet—"If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!"&lt;ref name="Obama"/&gt; In 2015, the club sued the town of [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] to lower its worth from $13.5 million to $1.4 million in order to reduce property and school taxes; local residents complained because their own taxes would rise.&lt;ref name="Value"/&gt; In 2016, the club revised its claims to $9 million, closer to the 2014 town estimate of $14.3 million.&lt;ref name="NewValue"/&gt; In June 2017, Trump disclosed a value of the club at over $50 million, with $9.7 million in personal income in 2016.&lt;ref name="Discl"/&gt;

[[Daniel Scavino]], social media director for Trump's presidential campaign began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 2009, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to general manager of the club after Trump's purchase.&lt;ref name="Scav1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scav2"/&gt; In December 2016, he was announced as Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media.&lt;ref name="Scav3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rucker|first1=Philip|last2=Viebeck|first2=Elise|title=Trump hires Conway, Spicer and other loyalists for senior White House jobs|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/9f3c5692-c862-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf|date=December 22, 2016|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's candidacy for the [[2016 United States presidential election]] affected the club; [[Horace Greeley High School]] used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate.&lt;ref name="Prom1"/&gt; The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision.&lt;ref name="Prom2"/&gt; In the following year, it was reported that [[Pleasantville High School (New York)|Pleasantville High School]]'s graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well.&lt;ref name="PHS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pleasantville students debate whether to hold prom at Trump golf course Pleasantville students debate whether to hold prom at Trump golf course|newspaper=News 12|url=http://hudsonvalley.news12.com/pleasantville-students-debate-whether-to-hold-prom-at-trump-golf-course-1.13083417|date=February 8, 2017|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graduating class voted, 97-44, to keep the venue.&lt;ref name="PHS2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Barron|first=Sam|title=Pleasantville Seniors Vote To Keep Prom At Trump National In Briarcliff|newspaper=Briarcliff Daily Voice|url=http://briarcliff.dailyvoice.com/schools/pleasantville-seniors-vote-to-keep-prom-at-trump-national-in-briarcliff/700429/|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican primaries]].&lt;ref name="Speech1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Deb|first=Sopan|title=Trump delivers restrained victory speech with teleprompter|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-delivers-restrained-victory-speech-with-teleprompter/|date=June 8, 2016|accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speech2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Ashley|last2=Maggie|first2=Haberman|title=Donald Trump Softens His Tone, and the G.O.P.

In July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his opponent [[Hillary Clinton]] released a campaign video of one of the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with [[the Trump Organization]], where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed to pay the bill, Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Clinton campaign]] used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses.&lt;ref name="Tesoro1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Susan|title=This Architect Says Trump Almost Destroyed His Business...|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestreptalks/2016/07/13/this-architect-says-trump-almost-destroyed-his-business-but-that-doesnt-mean-they-cant-get-coffee/#8465f9d6d9a8|date=July 13, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tesoro2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Frizell|first=Sam|title=How Hillary Clinton Is Hitting Donald Trump's Business Record on Two Fronts|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://time.com/4397159/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-business-record/|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that a {{convert|6|ft|adj=on|spell=in}} painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation]]. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a charitable purpose, or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President [[Barack Obama]] publicly criticized Trump's purchase.&lt;ref name="Painting"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David A.|title=Trump bought a 6-foot-tall portrait of himself with charity money.

==Current operations==
In 2001, annual membership dues were stated to be $9,000 per member or $12,000 for a family, with an initial deposit of $250,000.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Before the 2008 recession, initiation fees were $100,000 to $150,000. As of late 2015, initiation fees were down to $50,000. Around that time, many new members were reportedly not charged an initiation fee or were no longer required by the club to fully pay it within five years. Annual dues were $19,400 a year.&lt;ref name="2015dues"/&gt;

===Property===
The club is located on about {{convert|140|acre|ha|-1}} adjacent to Briarcliff Manor's central business district&lt;ref name="CBD"/&gt; and in a residential area near [[Pace University]]'s former [[Briarcliff College|Briarcliff campus]]&lt;ref name="NearPace"/&gt; off Pine Road.&lt;ref name="Ebsco1"/&gt; The property contains "The Residences at Trump National Golf Club", a series of sixteen attached townhouses ranging in size from {{convert|3100|-|3,400|sqft}} and which were designed by William Devereaux &amp; Associates.&lt;ref name="NYT1"/&gt; Plans exist for an additional 71 condominiums; the site was approved for 87 home sites in 1987.&lt;ref name="Condos"/&gt; The club also includes a member restaurant, which serves [[Kobe beef]] burgers, tuna flown in daily from Honolulu, and [[Trump Ice]] bottled water.&lt;ref name="Grill"/&gt;

==Notable members==
Current members include former Yankees manager [[Joe Torre]], and actors [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].&lt;ref name="Notable1"/&gt; Around 2003, members included [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Hugh Grant]], [[George Steinbrenner]], and [[Regis Philbin]].&lt;ref name="LPGA"/&gt; Visiting players include [[Ron Howard]], [[Regis Philbin]], and [[Bobby Bonilla]], who came for the course's reopening in 2002, and professional golfer [[Nick Faldo]].&lt;ref name="CoursesLAT"/&gt; Other visitors include [[Michael Jordan]],&lt;ref name="Visitors1"/&gt; former [[New York City mayor]]s [[Michael Bloomberg]] and Rudy Giuliani, and [[Billy Crystal]], who joined Trump and members Bill Clinton and Joe Torre for the 2008 Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation Golf Classic at the club.&lt;ref name="Visitors2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Visitors3"/&gt;&lt;!--[[Tom Brady]]&lt;ref name="Grill"/&gt;--&gt;

Former US President [[Bill Clinton]] has been a member of the club since May 2003. Donald Trump has said that he bought the club partly "because he knew Bill Clinton would need a place to play". Part of the Clintons' gift for Bill's 65th birthday was a round of golf at Trump National with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.&lt;ref name="Digest"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weinman|first=Sam|title=Once upon a time, when Bill Clinton needed a golf haven, he turned to Donald Trump|newspaper=[[Golf Digest]]|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/once-upon-a-time-when-bill-clinton-needed-a-golf-haven-he-turned-to-donald-trump|date=November 4, 2016|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golf club is [[Eric Trump]]'s home course. He raises about $3 million each year in an event there for [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]].

The '''WFCU Centre''' is an arena and entertainment centre in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The WFCU Centre replaced the 84-year-old [[Windsor Arena]] as the primary home of the [[Windsor Spitfires]]. It opened on December 11, 2008, in the east end of the city. The WFCU Centre is owned by the City of Windsor, operated by [[Comcast Spectacor]], and named for [[Windsor Family Credit Union]].

==History==
City council approved the project on October 4, 2006, and the [[groundbreaking]] ceremony took place on January 22, 2007. The WFCU Centre was built at a cost of approximately $71 million by the Windsor, Ontario-based construction company, PCR Contractors. The land was purchased from [[London, Ontario]] developer Farhi Holdings Corporation. The construction of this sports-entertainment centre was decided upon as a part of the city government's overall effort to add excitement to the economy. As part of that effort, Windsor city council committed to building the centre, and agreed to fund most of the cost.

During the initial stages of planning, several other committees and companies proposed building arenas and venues in the area, including a privately owned skating arena, as well as proposed a relocation of the Windsor Raceway Slots to [[Tecumseh, Ontario]], owned by the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]].

In August, 2013 Windsor City Council approved a $6.5 million addition to the WFCU Centre, adding a 25-metre pool in advance of the city hosting the [[2016 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)]] which were held inside the WFCU Centre. The WFCU Centre complies with the [[Ontarians with Disabilities Act]].

==Sports==
[[Image:WFCU 3577-2.jpg|thumb|The exterior of the WFCU Centre]]
The WFCU Centre is home to both the [[Ontario Hockey League]] OHL's [[Windsor Spitfires]] and the [[National Basketball League of Canada]] NBLC's [[Windsor Express]].

The Windsor Spitfires won both the 2009 and 2010 OHL Championship final series on home ice, and the Windsor Express won the 2014 League Championships on home court.

The WFCU Centre has played host to a variety of large-scale events in hockey including the 2012 [[World U-17 Hockey Challenge]], the OHL All Star Game and the [[CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game]]. The WFCU Centre also hosted both the Skate Canada Synchronized Skating Championships and the [[Skate Canada International]] in 2012, the latter being broadcast internationally. The WFCU Centre also played host to the Grey Power [[World Cup of Curling]] in 2010.

The WFCU Centre hosted the [[2017 Memorial Cup]].
