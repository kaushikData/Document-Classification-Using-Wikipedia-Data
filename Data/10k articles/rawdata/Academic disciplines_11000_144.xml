'''Agnostic theism''', '''agnostotheism''' or '''agnostitheism''' is the [[philosophical]] view that encompasses both [[theism]] and [[agnosticism]]. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or gods, but regards the basis of this proposition as ''unknown or inherently unknowable''. The agnostic theist may also or alternatively be agnostic regarding the properties of the god or gods that they believe in.

==Views of agnostic theism==
[[File:Classical definition of Kno.svg|thumb|right|Agnostic theism is belief but without knowledge, as shown in purple and blue (see [[Epistemology]]).]]
There are numerous [[belief]]s that can be included in agnostic theism, such as [[fideism]], the doctrine that knowledge depends on faith or revelation; not all agnostic theists are fideists. Since agnosticism is in the philosophical rather than religious sense a position on knowledge and does not forbid belief in a deity, it is compatible with most theistic positions.

The classical [[Epistemology|philosophical understanding of knowledge]] is that [[knowledge]] is [[justified true belief]]. The founder of [[logotherapy]], [[Viktor Frankl]], may have well exemplified this definition. Seidner expands upon this example and stresses Frankl's characterization of ''unconscious''.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us "A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology"]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}. ''Mater Dei Institute''.&lt;/ref&gt; Agnostic theism could be interpreted as an admission that it is not possible to justify one's belief in a god sufficiently for it to be considered known. This may be because they consider [[faith]] a requirement of their religion, or because of the influence of plausible-seeming scientific or philosophical criticism.

[[Christian agnosticism|Christian Agnostics]] practice a distinct form of agnosticism that applies only to the ''properties'' of God. They hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the [[Christian faith]]. They believe that God exists, that [[Jesus]] has a special relationship with him and is in some way divine, and that God should be worshipped. This belief system has deep roots in Judaism and the early days of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Weatherhead |first=Leslie |title=The Christian Agnostic |date=1972 |publisher=[[Abingdon Press]] |isbn=978-0-687-06977-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Appeal as from an abuse"''' (French ''appel comme d'abus'') is a legal term applied in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], meaning originally a legal appeal as recourse to the civil forum (court) against the usurpation by the ecclesiastical forum of the rights of [[law|civil jurisdiction]]. It could mean (''vice versa'') a recourse to the ecclesiastical forum against the usurpation by the civil forum of the rights of [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction]]. 

Thus defined, the "appeal as from an abuse" had as its object was to safeguard equally the rights both of the State and of the Church. An abuse would be an act on either hand, without due authority, beyond the limits of their respective ordinary and natural jurisdictions. In practice the use of such appeals was important, historically, as a way to undermine the power of church courts.

==Canon law==

The canons&lt;ref&gt;can. "Dilecto", in bk. VI of Decretals, "De sent. excom.", in ch. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; did not exclude a recourse to the civil authority when the acts of an ecclesiastical judge invaded the domain of the civil authority, especially as reciprocity gave the ecclesiastical authority the right to repel with the same weapons any usurpation by the lay judge to the damage of the rights of the Church. Thus also a recourse to the supreme civil ruler was not deemed amiss when an ecclesiastical court undertook a cause belonging to the competency of a higher ecclesiastical court, and the ruler was asked&lt;ref&gt;can. "Placuit" in Decree of Gratian, Pt. II, Q. I, ch. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; merely to forward it to the proper tribunal without, however, claiming to delegate to it any jurisdiction. Perhaps the first formal manifestation of this appeal in the legitimate sense occurred in the fourteenth century.

==History==

Ecclesiastical judges acquired a reputation for learning and equity, and by the good will of the State, not merely ecclesiastical, but many civil cases of the laity were adjudicated by them. in 1329 complaint was brought to King [[Philip VI of France|Philip de Valois]] by the advocate general, Peter de Cugnières, that the civil tribunals were fast lapsing into contempt, and were being abandoned. The purport of the complaint was to restrict the competency of the ecclesiastical tribunals to their own legitimate fields. Bickerings between the two forums were henceforth frequent. Even the Catholic states, after the beginning of the sixteenth century, advanced far in the way of frequent ruptures with the Church.

When the Protestant states had acquired control and supervision over the newly reformed bodies even in their spiritual relations, the Catholic states, particularly France, strove to limit the jurisdiction of the Church as far as they could without casting aside the profession of the Catholic Faith. The [[Pragmatic Sanction]] was a serious aggression by France upon the acknowledged rights of the Church and of the Holy See. It is in France that we find the most flagrant series of encroachments upon Church jurisdiction, through pretence of appeals as from an abuse, gradually tending to the elimination of the ecclesiastical forum. 

During the seventeenth century the French clergy presented frequent memorials against the encroachments made by their kings and parliaments through constant recourse to these "appeals as from an abuse", which resulted in submitting to civil tribunals questions of definitions of faith, the proper administration of the sacraments, and the like. This brought confusion into the regulation of spiritual matters by encouraging ecclesiastics to rebel against their lawful ecclesiastical superiors. The lay tribunals undertook to adjudicate whether the ministers of the sacraments had a right to refuse them to those deemed unworthy, or the right to Christian burial of Catholics dying impenitent or under Church censures; whether interdicts or suspensions were valid; whether monastic professions should be annulled; whether the bishop's permission was necessary for preaching; whether a specified marriage was contrary or not to the Gospel; and also to decide the justice of canonical privations of benefices. Many other subjects intimately connected with the teaching of the Church were brought before lay tribunals, and unappealable decisions rendered in open contradiction to the canons, as can easily be surmised both from the absence of theological knowledge, and from the visible animus shown in decisions that undertook to subject the spiritual power of the Church to the dictates of transient politics. 

Interference was mostly owing to courtier-canonists who flattered the secular rulers by dwelling upon the right of protection over the Church conceded in early days to the Christian Roman Emperors. The Church was recognized as autonomous in all things of the divine law and in matters of ecclesiastical discipline. When rulers like [[Charlemagne]] seemed to take upon themselves undue authority, insisting upon certain canons, the bishops claimed their sole right to govern the Church. Even in mixed assemblies of bishops and nobles and princes, the bishops insisted that the civil power should not encroach upon the rights of the Church, e. g. in the [[Concile of Narbonne (788)|Council of Narbonne]] (788). 

Zaccaria&lt;ref&gt;Dissertaz. 28&lt;/ref&gt; recognized, however, that in his day (the eighteenth century), as well as in former ages, the Catholic rulers of Catholic States, in their quality of protectors of the Church, might receive a recourse from ecclesiastics in ecclesiastical matters, in order that justice might be done them by their ordinary ecclesiastical judges, not as deputies of the civil rulers, but as ordinary judges in their own forum. In her [[concordat]]s with Catholic states the Catholic Church granted to several that the civil cases of clerics, and such as concern the property and temporal rights of churches, as well as benefices and other ecclesiastical foundations, may be brought before the civil courts.

==Modern relationship==

All ecclesiastical causes, and those that concern the Faith, sacraments, morals, sacred functions, and rights connected with the sacred ministry, belong to the ecclesiastical forum, both in regard of persons and of matter.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Concordat with Ecuador in 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, as decreed by the [[Council of Baltimore]] (1837), the church law is that if any ecclesiastical person or member of a religious body, male or female, should cite an ecclesiastic or a religious before a civil court on a question of a purely ecclesiastical nature, he should know that he falls under the censures decreed by canon law. 

The [[Congregation of Propaganda]] in its comment explained that, in mixed cases, where the persons may be ecclesiastical, but the things about which there is question may be temporal or of one's household, this rule cannot be enforced, especially in countries in which the civil government is not in the hands of Catholics, and where, unless recourse is had to the civil courts, there is not the means or the power of enforcing an ecclesiastical decision for the protection or recovery of one's own. A special proviso was made by Propaganda for the United States,&lt;ref&gt;17 August 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; that if a priest should bring a cleric before a civil tribunal on an ecclesiastical or other question without permission from the bishop he could be forced to withdraw the case by the infliction of penalties and censures, yet the bishop must not refuse the permission if the parties have ineffectually attempted a settlement before him. If the bishop is to be cited, the permission of the Holy See is required. 

By a special declaration of Propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;6 September 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric's transfer of a claim to a layman for the purpose of evading the censures is checked by the requirement of the consent of the bishop to such transfer, if made for the purpose of the suit. Justice Redfield&lt;ref&gt;in vol. XV, Am. Law Reg., p. 277, quoted with approval in vol. XCVIII of Penn. Rep., p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; says in reference to the United States generally: "The decision of ecclesiastical courts or officers having, by the rules or laws of the bodies to which they belong, jurisdiction of such questions, or the right to decide them, will be held conclusive in all courts of the civil administration, and no question involved in such decisions will be revised or reviewed in the civil courts, except those pertaining to the jurisdiction of such courts or officers to determine such questions according to the laws or the usage of the bodies they represent." Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;In his lecture on the "Relations of Civil Law to Church Policy" (p. 41).&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of the Church as "an interior organization within a religious society", and adds,&lt;ref&gt;p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it may be safely asserted as a general principle that whenever questions of discipline, of faith, of Church rule, of membership, or of office, have been decided by the Church, in its own modes of decision, civil law tribunals accept these decisions as final and apply them as made."

[[File:Knapofhowarinsun.jpg|thumb|300px|The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]], Orkney, one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe]]
The architecture of Scotland in the prehistoric era includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, before the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in Britain in the first century BCE. [[Stone Age]] settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at [[Knap of Howar]], [[Orkney]] and settlements like [[Skara Brae]]. There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[cairn]]s from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, often linked to timber monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s and [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]]. From the [[Bronze Age]] there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of [[Clava cairn]]s and the first [[hillfort]]s. From the [[Iron Age]] there is evidence of substantial stone [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, which include [[broch]] towers, smaller [[duns]]. There is also evidence of about 1,000 [[List of hill forts in Scotland|hillforts in Scotland]], most located below the Clyde-Forth line.

[[File:MaesHowe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maes Howe]], a [[passage grave]] on Orkney]]
The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at [[South Queensferry]] near the [[Firth of Forth]], dating from the [[Mesolithic]] period, about 8240 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;R. Gray, [http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/bridge-works-uncover-nations-oldest-house.19439382 "Bridge works uncover nation's oldest house"], ''Herald Scotland'', 18 November 2012, retrieved 7 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], dated to about 6000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0500287953}}, pp. 90–1.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the [[Neolithic]] era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later.&lt;ref name=Maxwell2005p19/&gt; Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the [[Northern Isles|Northern]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.&lt;ref name=Pryor2003pp98-104&amp;246-50&gt;F. Pryor, ''Britain BC'' (London: HarperPerennial, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-00-712693-4}}, pp. 98–104 and 246–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone building at [[Knap of Howar]] at [[Papa Westray]], [[Orkney]] is one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE.&lt;ref name=Maxwell2005p19&gt;I. Maxwell, ''A History of Scotland’s Masonry Construction'' in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), {{ISBN|1-904320-02-3}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skara Brae]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.&lt;ref name=Pryor2003pp98-104&amp;246-50/&gt;

There are also large numbers of [[chambered tomb]]s and [[Chambered cairn|cairns]] from this period. Many different types have been identified, but they can be roughly grouped into [[passage grave]]s, [[gallery grave]]s and [[stone cist]]s. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maes Howe]], near Stenness on the mainland of Orkney (dated 3400–3200 BCE) and Monamore, Isle of Arran (dated approximately 3500 BCE) are passage graves, of [[megalith]] construction, built with large stones, many of which weigh several tons.&lt;ref name=Fry&amp;Fry1992p7&gt;F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0710090013}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gallery graves are rectangular gallery-like spaces, where the entrance at one end is the width of the gallery. These were sometimes lined or roofed with slabs and then covered with earth.&lt;ref name=Fry&amp;Fry1992p8&gt;F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0710090013}}, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most impressive surviving monuments of the period are the first sets of standing stones in Scotland, such as those at [[Standing Stones of Stenness|Stenness]] on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BCE, of four stones, the tallest of which is {{convert|16|ft|m|0}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;C.

In contrast to the Highlands and Islands where stone was extensively used, in the south and east the most visible architectural survivals of the Neolithic are mainly earthen [[Tumulus|barrow]]s, the earliest probably dating from the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE. Today these monuments consist of massive mounds of earth or stone, most commonly trapezoidal in plan and often orientated to the east. They are widely distributed in the Lowlands, particularly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Related structures include [[bank barrow]]s, [[cursus monument]]s, [[mortuary enclosure]]s, [[Neolithic long house|timber halls]], and other forms of enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0748623388}}, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Bank barrows are parallel-sided mounds, usually flanked by ditches on either side. Originally believed to be Roman in origin, cursus monuments also consist of long parallel lengths of banks of earth with external ditches, but with an open avenue or enclose between. Both forms are usually associated with burial chambers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Pollard, ''Neolithic Britain'' (Osprey, 2008), {{ISBN|0747803536}}, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of bank barrows in Scotland include from Perthshire the long mound at Auchenlaich and the hybrid bank barrow/cursus monument and at Cleaven Dyke, which stretches for over {{convert|1.5|miles|km|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Maxwell, ''The Cleaven Dyke and Littleour: Monuments in the Neolithic of Tayside'' (Society Antiquaries Scotland, 1998), {{ISBN|090390313X}}, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortuary enclosures are usually sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought by J. G. Scott to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere, although this interpretation is disputed. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under [[long barrow]]s. Key examples include Pitnacree, Perthshire and two closely related sites at Lochhill and Slewcairn, both in [[Kirkcudbright]].&lt;ref&gt;G.

There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows.&lt;ref&gt;G.

Armit, '' Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7524-1932-3}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence of the occupation of [[crannog]]s, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.&lt;ref&gt;N. Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3151-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were [[Revetment|revetted]] around the edges with vertical [[Deep foundation|piles]] and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p340/&gt;

The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into this period. There are approximately fifty [[Clava cairn]]s in Scotland, named after those at Balnuaran of Clava near Inverness. They take two distinct forms, either a circular rubble enclosure known as "ring cairns", or passage graves, with a long entrance, usually in complex astronomical alignments.&lt;ref&gt;C.

The building is circular in outline and all that remains of the structure are the double-skinned walls that rise to two stories in places.|The ruins of [[Dun Carloway]] Iron Age [[broch]]]]
In the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, [[Pierowall]], and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickhimin on Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and [[Crosskirk Broch|Crosskirk]], Caithness.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p325&gt;B.

The most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular [[broch]] towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. They are drystone hollow-walled structures that are unique to Scotland.&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p325/&gt; Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed {{convert|21|ft|m|0}} in height.&lt;ref&gt;I.

An '''Assault Pioneer''' is an [[infantry]] soldier who is responsible for:

* The construction of tools for infantry soldiers to cross natural and man-made obstacles as well as breaching of enemy fortifications;
* Supervising the construction of field defensive works such as bunkers, support weapon firing positions, etc.,;
* The use of demolitions, land mines and booby traps, as well as their [[demining|clearance]]; and
* Performing of all other normal infantry duties as the situation requires

Assault Pioneers are lineal descendents of the [[Pioneer (military)|Pioneer]]s who have formed an essential part of armies since at least the time of the Roman legions. These pioneers were normally employed to march in front of the advancing army, clearing the route as necessary. They could also construct defenses and bivouac facilities. More recently (since the Second World War) assault pioneers have normally formed a [[Platoon]] in infantry battalions, and such platoons can be found in a number of [[British Army]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] infantry units.  In some of these armies, soldiers serving in the Assault Pioneer Platoon can be identified by a specialist skill badge of two crossed felling axes sewn on their uniforms. These felling axes have traditionally been iconic of the pioneer in various armies throughout history.

The wearing of beards by Assault Pioneers has also been a traditional practice at various times in infantry battalions of British and Commonwealth armies, such as those of Australia and Canada. This tradition began in the French Army (possibly in Napoleonic times) and was one of the dress practices adopted by the British after their defeat of Napoleon in 1815 (along with the Foot  Guards bearskin headdress). In the Australian and Canadian armies, on special occasions some battalions may still parade a ceremonial detachment of assault pioneers in historical uniforms wearing leather aprons, gauntlets and gaiters, and carrying the various tools of their trade such as felling axes, crosscut saws, hatchets and billhooks, picks and shovels.

Assault Pioneers do not replace [[combat engineer]]s: the latter have a much greater range of skills, capabilities and resources. Instead, Assault Pioneers are intended to provide the infantry battalion with its own integral ("organic") light engineering support in the same sense as the Mortar Platoon provides the same battalion with its own 'organic' indirect fire support. This organic support permits the infantry battalion to conduct operations effectively without relying on the external support of Combat Engineers who are normally subject to a demanding list of priority tasks across the battlefield. On operations Assault Pioneers often work separately in small detachments providing specialist skills, tools and advice to the infantry companies and platoons with those sub-units providing the bulk of the labour.

The term 'Assault Pioneer' reflects the tradition (arising in the First and Second World Wars) of employing these soldiers in the first wave of assaults on fortified enemy positions, using their skills and equipment to support the attacking force in crossing and breaching the enemy's defenses. While Assault Pioneers normally function in a specialist role, they are infantry soldiers first and are fully capable of engaging in combat as needed.

== British Army ==
During World War II British Army Pioneer Platoons had ten Pioneers plus tradesmen. In 1944 they were renamed Assault Pioneer Platoons and had two Assault Sections plus one Pioneer Section. The five man strong Assault Sections had a jeep and trailer and a 3-ton lorry. The Assault Sections had specialist men and equipment for the disposal of mines and breaching obstacles. The Pioneer Section had eight tradesmen, a [[Stone mason|mason]], a bricklayer and six carpenters. The Pioneer Section was used to turn buildings into accommodation for [[riflemen]]; riflemen were the principal unit in the British and American army.

'''Biantitropical''' (or '''amphitropical''') '''distribution''' refers to the pattern of [[species]] that exist at comparable [[latitude]]s across the [[equator]] but not in the [[tropics]].  For example, a species may be found north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], but not in between.  This usually has to do with the optimal temperature for the species existing at both latitudes.  How the life forms distribute themselves to the opposite hemisphere when they can't normally survive in the middle depends on the species; plants may have their seed spread through wind, animal, or other methods ([[Seed dispersal|dispersal]]) and then germinate upon reaching the appropriate climate, while sea life may be able to travel through the tropical regions in a larval state or by going through deep ocean currents with much colder temperatures than on the surface.

The '''Boltzmann constant''' ({{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{mvar|k}}) is a [[physical constant]] relating the average [[kinetic energy]] of [[particle]]s in a [[ideal gas|gas]] with the [[temperature]] of the gas&lt;ref name=Feynman1Ch39-10&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-201-02115-8 |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_39.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occurs in [[Planck's law]] of [[black-body radiation]] and in [[Boltzmann's entropy formula]].  It was introduced by [[Max Planck]], but named after [[Ludwig Boltzmann]].

It is the [[gas constant]] {{mvar|R}} divided by the [[Avogadro constant]] {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{R}{N_\text{A}} .&lt;/math&gt;

The Boltzmann constant has the [[Dimensional analysis|dimension]] energy divided by temperature, the same as [[entropy]]. 
As of 2017, its value in [[SI units]] is a measured quantity. The recommended value (as of 2015, with [[standard uncertainty]] in parentheses) is   {{val|1.38064852|(79)|e=-23|u=J|up=K}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Current measurements of the Boltzmann constant depend on the definition of the [[kelvin]] in terms of the [[triple point of water]].  In the [[2019_redefinition_of_SI_base_units|redefinition of SI base units]] adopted at the 26th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) on 16 November 2018,&lt;ref name=Minutes2014&gt;{{cite conference

==Bridge from macroscopic to microscopic physics==
The Boltzmann constant, {{mvar|k}}, is a [[scale factor|scaling factor]] between macroscopic ([[thermodynamic temperature]]) and microscopic ([[thermal energy]]) physics. Macroscopically, the [[ideal gas law]] states that, for an [[ideal gas]], the product of [[pressure]] {{mvar|p}} and [[volume]] {{mvar|V}} is proportional to the product of [[amount of substance]] {{mvar|n}} (in [[mole (unit)|moles]]) and [[absolute temperature]] {{mvar|T}}:
:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|R}} is the [[gas constant]] ({{val|8.3144598|(48)|u=J⋅K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;ref name="2014 CODATA" /&gt;). Introducing the Boltzmann constant transforms the ideal gas law into an alternative form:
:&lt;math&gt;p V = N k T ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|N}} is the [[Number of particles|number of molecules]] of gas. For {{nowrap|1={{mvar|n}} = 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]]}}, {{mvar|N}} is equal to the number of particles in one mole ([[Avogadro's number]]).

===Role in the equipartition of energy===
{{main|Equipartition of energy}}
Given a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] system at an [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] {{mvar|T}}, the average thermal energy carried by each microscopic degree of freedom in the system is {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''kT''}} (i.e., about {{val|2.07|e=−21|u=J}}, or {{val|0.013|ul=eV}}, at room temperature).

In [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[statistical mechanics]], this average is predicted to hold exactly for homogeneous [[ideal gas]]es. Monatomic ideal gases (the 6 noble gases) possess three [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] per atom, corresponding to the three spatial directions, which means a thermal energy of {{math|{{sfrac|3|2}}''kT''}} per atom. This corresponds very well with experimental data. The thermal energy can be used to calculate the [[root-mean-square speed]] of the atoms, which turns out to be inversely proportional to the square root of the [[atomic mass]]. The root mean square speeds found at room temperature accurately reflect this, ranging from {{val|1370|u=m/s}} for [[helium]], down to {{val|240|u=m/s}} for [[xenon]].

[[Kinetic theory of gases#Pressure|Kinetic theory]] gives the average pressure {{mvar|p}} for an ideal gas as
:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{1}{3}\frac{N}{V} m \overline{v^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Combination with the ideal gas law
:&lt;math&gt;p V = N k T&lt;/math&gt;
shows that the average translational kinetic energy is
:&lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{2}m \overline{v^2} = \tfrac{3}{2} k T.&lt;/math&gt;
Considering that the translational motion velocity vector {{math|'''v'''}} has three degrees of freedom (one for each dimension) gives the average energy per degree of freedom equal to one third of that, i.e. {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''kT''}}.

The ideal gas equation is also obeyed closely by molecular gases; but the form for the heat capacity is more complicated, because the molecules possess additional internal degrees of freedom, as well as the three degrees of freedom for movement of the molecule as a whole. Diatomic gases, for example, possess a total of six degrees of simple freedom per molecule that are related to atomic motion (three translational, two rotational, and one vibrational). At lower temperatures, not all these degrees of freedom may fully participate in the gas heat capacity, due to quantum mechanical limits on the availability of excited states at the relevant thermal energy per molecule.

===Role in Boltzmann factors===
More generally, systems in equilibrium at temperature {{mvar|T}} have probability {{mvar|P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} of occupying a state {{mvar|i}} with energy {{mvar|E}} weighted by the corresponding [[Boltzmann factor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P_i \propto \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{E}{k T}\right)}{Z},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|Z}} is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. Again, it is the energy-like quantity [[kT (energy)|{{mvar|kT}}]] that takes central importance.

Consequences of this include (in addition to the results for ideal gases above) the [[Arrhenius equation]] in [[chemical kinetics]].

===Role in the statistical definition of entropy===
&lt;!-- [[Dimensionless entropy]] redirects here --&gt;
{{further|Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)}}
[[Image:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Boltzmann.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Boltzmann's grave in the [[Zentralfriedhof]], Vienna, with bust and entropy formula.]]
In statistical mechanics, the [[entropy]] {{mvar|S}} of an [[isolated system]] at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] is defined as the [[natural logarithm]] of {{mvar|W}}, the number of distinct microscopic states available to the system given the macroscopic constraints (such as a fixed total energy {{mvar|E}}):
:&lt;math&gt;S = k \,\ln W.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation, which relates the microscopic details, or microstates, of the system (via {{mvar|W}}) to its macroscopic state (via the entropy {{mvar|S}}), is the central idea of statistical mechanics. Such is its importance that it is inscribed on Boltzmann's tombstone.

The constant of proportionality {{mvar|k}} serves to make the statistical mechanical entropy equal to the classical thermodynamic entropy of Clausius:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \int \frac{{\rm d}Q}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

One could choose instead a rescaled [[dimensionless]] entropy in microscopic terms such that
:&lt;math&gt;{S' = \ln W}, \quad \Delta S' = \int \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{k T}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a more natural form and this rescaled entropy exactly corresponds to Shannon's subsequent [[information entropy]].

The characteristic energy {{mvar|kT}} is thus the energy required to increase the rescaled entropy by one [[nat (unit)|nat]].

===Role in semiconductor physics: the thermal voltage===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bipolar junction transistor]] --&gt;
In [[semiconductors]], the [[Shockley diode equation]]—the relationship between the flow of [[electric current]] and the [[electrostatic potential]] across a [[p–n junction]]—depends on a characteristic voltage called the ''thermal voltage'', denoted {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The thermal voltage depends on absolute temperature {{mvar|T}} as
:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{T}  =  { k T \over q },&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|q}} is the magnitude of the [[elementary charge|electrical charge on the electron]] with a value {{val|1.6021766208|(98)|e=−19|ul=C}}.&lt;ref name="2014 CODATA" /&gt; Equivalently,
:&lt;math&gt; { V_\mathrm{T} \over T } = { k \over q } \approx 8.61733034 \times 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{V/K}.&lt;/math&gt;

At [[room temperature]] ({{val|300|u=K}}), {{math|''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;}} is approximately {{val|25.85|u=mV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rashid |first1=Muhammad H. |title=Microelectronic circuits : analysis and design |date=2016 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9781305635166 |pages=183&amp;ndash;184 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Cataldo |first1=Enrico |last2=Lieto |first2=Alberto Di |last3=Maccarrone |first3=Francesco |last4=Paffuti |first4=Giampiero |title=Measurements and analysis of current-voltage characteristic of a pn diode for an undergraduate physics laboratory |date=18 August 2016 |eprint=1608.05638v1 |class=physics.ed-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thermal voltage is also important in plasmas and electrolyte solutions; in both cases it provides a measure of how much the spatial distribution of electrons or ions is affected by a boundary held at a fixed voltage.&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirby |first=Brian J. |title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices |url=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook |year=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-11903-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabeling&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tabeling |first=Patrick |title=Introduction to Microfluidics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-856864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although Boltzmann first linked entropy and probability in 1877, the relation was never expressed with a specific constant until [[Max Planck]] first introduced {{mvar|k}}, and gave a precise value for it ({{val|1.346|e=−23|u=J/K}}, about 2.5% lower than today's figure), in his derivation of the [[Planck's law|law of black body radiation]] in 1900–1901.&lt;ref name="Planck01"&gt;{{citation|first=Max |last=Planck |author-link=Max Planck |title=Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/historic-papers/1901_309_553-563.pdf |journal=[[Annalen der Physik|Ann.

The iconic terse form of the equation {{math|1=''S'' = ''k'' ln ''W''}} on Boltzmann's tombstone is in fact due to Planck, not Boltzmann. Planck actually introduced it in the same work as his [[Planck constant|eponymous {{mvar|h}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bertrand |last=Duplantier |title=Le mouvement brownien, 'divers et ondoyant' |language=French |trans-title=Brownian motion, 'diverse and undulating' |url=http://www.bourbaphy.fr/duplantier2.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Séminaire Poincaré 1 |pages=155–212 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Planck wrote in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture:&lt;ref name="PlanckNobel"&gt;{{citation | first = Max | last = Planck | author-link = Max Planck | title = The Genesis and Present State of Development of the Quantum Theory (Nobel Lecture) | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/planck-lecture.html | date = 2 June 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|This constant is often referred to as Boltzmann's constant, although, to my knowledge, Boltzmann himself never introduced it — a peculiar state of affairs, which can be explained by the fact that Boltzmann, as appears from his occasional utterances, never gave thought to the possibility of carrying out an exact measurement of the constant.}}

This ''"peculiar state of affairs"'' is illustrated by reference to one of the great scientific debates of the time. There was considerable disagreement in the second half of the nineteenth century as to whether atoms and molecules were real or whether they were simply a [[heuristic]] tool for solving problems. There was no agreement whether ''chemical'' molecules, as measured by [[atomic weight]]s, were the same as ''physical'' molecules, as measured by [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]. Planck's 1920 lecture continued:&lt;ref name="PlanckNobel" /&gt;
{{quotation|Nothing can better illustrate the positive and hectic pace of progress which the art of experimenters has made over the past twenty years, than the fact that since that time, not only one, but a great number of methods have been discovered for measuring the mass of a molecule with practically the same accuracy as that attained for a planet.}}

In 2017, the most accurate measures of the Boltzmann constant were obtained by acoustic gas thermometry, which determines the speed of sound of a monatomic gas in a triaxial ellipsoid chamber using microwave and acoustic resonances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pitre|first1=L|last2=Sparasci|first2=F|last3=Risegari|first3=L|last4=Guianvarc’h|first4=C|last5=Martin|first5=C|last6=Himbert|first6=M E|last7=Plimmer|first7=M D|last8=Allard|first8=A|last9=Marty|first9=B|date=1 December 2017|title=New measurement of the Boltzmann constant                            by acoustic thermometry of helium-4 gas|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1681-7575/aa7bf5/meta|journal=Metrologia|volume=54|issue=6|pages=856–873|doi=10.1088/1681-7575/aa7bf5|last10=Giuliano Albo|first10=P A|last11=Gao|first11=B|last12=Moldover|first12=M R|last13=Mehl|first13=J B|bibcode=2017Metro..54..856P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Podesta|first1=Michael|last2=Mark|first2=Darren F|last3=Dymock|first3=Ross C|last4=Underwood|first4=Robin|last5=Bacquart|first5=Thomas|last6=Sutton|first6=Gavin|last7=Davidson|first7=Stuart|last8=Machin|first8=Graham|date=1 October 2017|title=Re-estimation of argon isotope ratios leading to a revised estimate of the Boltzmann constant|journal=Metrologia|volume=54|issue=5|pages=683–692|doi=10.1088/1681-7575/aa7880|bibcode=2017Metro..54..683D|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/142135/1/142135.pdf|format=Full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decade-long effort was undertaken with different techniques by several laboratories;{{efn|Independent techniques exploited : acoustic gas thermometry, dielectric constant gas thermometry, johnson noise thermometry.

Since {{mvar|k}} is a [[physical constant]] of proportionality between temperature and energy, its numerical value depends on the choice of units for energy and temperature.  The small numerical value of the Boltzmann constant in [[SI]] units means a change in temperature by [[Kelvin|1&amp;nbsp;K]] only changes a particle's energy by a small amount. A change of {{val|1|ul=°C}} is defined to be the same as a change of {{val|1|u=K}}.  The characteristic energy {{mvar|kT}} is a term encountered in many physical relationships.

The Boltzmann constant sets up a relationship between wavelength and temperature (dividing ''hc''/''k'' by a wavelength gives a temperature) with one micrometer being related to 14&amp;nbsp;387.770&amp;nbsp;K, and also a relationship between voltage and temperature (multiplying the voltage by ''k'' in units of eV/K) with one volt being related to 11&amp;nbsp;604.519&amp;nbsp;K. The ratio of these two temperatures, 14&amp;nbsp;387.770&amp;nbsp;K/11&amp;nbsp;604.519&amp;nbsp;K&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1.239842, is the numerical value of ''hc'' in units of eV⋅μm.

===Planck units===
The Boltzmann constant provides a mapping from this characteristic microscopic energy {{mvar|E}} to the macroscopic temperature scale {{math|1=''T'' = {{sfrac|''E''|''k''}}}}. In physics research another definition is often encountered in setting {{mvar|k}} to unity, resulting in the [[Planck units]] or [[natural units]] for temperature and energy. In this context temperature is measured effectively in units of energy and the Boltzmann constant is not explicitly needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.1007/s11018-005-0195-9 |author1=Kalinin, M |author2=Kononogov, S | title = Boltzmann's Constant, the Energy Meaning of Temperature, and Thermodynamic Irreversibility | journal = Measurement Techniques | pages = 632–36 | volume = 48 | issue = 7 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equipartition formula for the energy associated with each classical degree of freedom then becomes
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{dof}} = \tfrac{1}{2} T \ &lt;/math&gt;
The use of natural units simplifies many physical relationships; in this form the definition of thermodynamic entropy coincides with the form of [[information entropy]]:
:&lt;math&gt; S = - \sum P_i \ln P_i.&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the probability of each [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]].

The value chosen for a gunit of the [[Planck temperature]] is that corresponding to the energy of the [[Planck mass]] or {{val|1.416808|(33)|e=32|u=K}}.&lt;ref name="2014 CODATA" /&gt;

'''Function'''  [[Maize]] gene for first step in biosynthesis of [[DIMBOA|benzoxazin]], which aids in resistance to insect pests, pathogenic fungi and bacteria.

'''First report'''  Hamilton 1964,&lt;ref name=Hamilton64&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=RH|title=A corn mutant deficient in 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one with an altered tolerance of atrazine|journal=Weeds|year=1964|volume=12|pages=27–30|jstor=4040633}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a mutant sensitive to the herbicide [[atrazine]], and lacking benzoxazinoids (less than 1% of non-mutant plants).

[[Mutations]] in the bx1 gene reduce the resistance to first generation [[European corn borer]] that is conferred by [[DIMBOA|benzoxazinoids]]. Molecular characterization reveals that the BX1 protein is a [[Sequence homology|homologue]] to the alpha-subunit of [[tryptophan synthase]]. The reference mutant [[allele]] has a deletion of about 900 bp, located at the 5'-terminus and comprising sequence upstream of the transcription start site and the first [[exon]]. A second mutant allele is given by a ''Mu'' [[transposon]] insertion in the fourth exon (Frey et al. 1997&lt;ref name=Frey97&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=M |author2=Chomet, P |author3=Glawischnig, E |author4=Stettner, C |author5=Grün, S |author6=Winklmair, A |author7=Eisenreich, W |author8=Bacher, A |author9=Meeley, RB |author10=Briggs, SP |author11=Simcox, K |author12=Gierl, A|title=Analysis of a chemical plant defense mechanism in grasses.|journal=Science|date=Aug 1, 1997|volume=277|issue=5326|pages=696–9|pmid=9235894|doi=10.1126/science.277.5326.696}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

A '''castellated beam''' is a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] style where an [[I-beam]] is subjected to a longitudinal cut along its web following a specific pattern in order to divide it, and reassemble the beam with a deeper web by taking advantage of the cutting pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tsavdaridis |first=Konstantinos

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">'''Cell Synchronization''' is a process by which cells at different stages of the cell cycle in a culture are brought to the same phase. "Cell synchrony" is required to study the progression of cells through the cell cycle. The types of synchronizations are broadly categorized into two groups: "Physical Fractionation" and "Chemical Blockade."

==Cell separation by physical means==
Physical fractionation or cell separation techniques, based on the following characteristics are in use.
*Cell density
*Cell size
*Affinity of [[antibodies]] on cell surface [[epitope]]s.
*Light scatter or [[fluorescent]] emission by labeled cells.
The two commonly used techniques are:

===Centrifugal separation===
The physical characteristics — cell size and sedimentation velocity — are operative in the technique of centrifugal [[elutriation]]. Centrifugal elutriator (from Beckman) is an advanced device for increasing the sedimentation rate so that the yield and resolution of cells is better. The cell separation is carried out in a specially designed centrifuge and rotor.

===Fluorescence-activated cell sorting===
[[Fluorescence-activated cell sorting]] (FACS) is a technique for sorting out the cells based on the differences that can be detected by light scatter (e.g. cell size) or fluorescence emission (by penetrated DNA, RNA, proteins, antigens).
The procedure involves passing of a single stream of cells through a [[laser]] beam so that the scattered light from the cells can be detected and recorded. There are two instruments in use based on its principle:

:a) [[Flow cytometer]] 
:b) Fluorescence-activated cell sorter

==Cell separation by chemical blockade==
The cells can be separated by blocking metabolic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=BioTechniques |title=Biological methods for cell-cycle synchronization of mammalian cells |year=2001 |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=1322–1331 |pmid=11414226 |vauthors=Davis PK, Ho A, Dowdy SF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two types of metabolic blockades are in use:

===Inhibition of DNA synthesis===
During the [[S phase]] of cell cycle, DNA synthesis can be inhibited by using inhibitors such as [[thymidine]], [[aminopterin]], [[hydroxyurea]] and [[cytosine arabinoside]]. The effects of these inhibitors are variable for this. The cell cycle is predominantly blocked in S phase that results in viable cells.

===Nutritional deprivation===
Elimination of [[Blood plasma|serum]] from the [[culture medium]] for about 24 hours results in the accumulation of cells at [[G1 phase]]{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. This effect of nutritional deprivation can be restored by their addition by which time the cell synchrony occurs.

The '''Center for NanoScience''' (CeNS) was founded in 1998 at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-University]] (LMU) in [[Munich]]. Its aim is to promote, bundle and join interdisciplinary research in the field of [[nanoscience]] in the Munich area. CeNS is an association of working groups from basic research and industry and acts as a network which connects various institutions from a variety of disciplines. The members cooperate in a horizontal structure based on voluntary commitment, and are supported by a small coordination team. 

CeNS consolidates research activities at the nanometer scale from physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine. The CeNS network promotes the mutual understanding and the collaboration between these disciplines by joint seminars, workshops, and schools.

A '''citation index''' is a kind of [[bibliographic index]], an index of [[citation]]s between publications, allowing the user to easily establish which later documents cite which earlier documents. A form of citation index is first found in 12th-century Hebrew religious literature. Legal citation indexes are found in the 18th century and were made popular by [[citator]]s such as [[Shepard's Citations]] (1873). In 1960, [[Eugene Garfield]]'s [[Institute for Scientific Information]] (ISI) introduced the first citation index for papers published in [[academic journal]]s, first the ''[[Science Citation Index]]'' (SCI), and later the ''[[Social Sciences Citation Index]]'' (SSCI) and the ''[[Arts and Humanities Citation Index]]'' (AHCI). The first automated citation indexing was done by [[CiteSeer]] in 1997. Other sources for such data include [[Google Scholar]] and Elsevier's [[Scopus]].

==History==
The earliest known citation index is an index of biblical citations in [[rabbinic literature]], the ''Mafteah ha-Derashot'', attributed to [[Maimonides]] and probably dating to the 12th century. It is organized alphabetically by biblical phrase. Later biblical citation indexes are in the order of the canonical text. These citation indices were used both for general and for legal study. The Talmudic citation index ''En Mishpat'' (1714) even included a symbol to indicate whether a Talmudic decision had been overridden, just as in the 19th-century ''Shepard's Citations''.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Hass Weinberg, "The Earliest Hebrew Citation Indexes" in Trudi Bellardo Hahn, Michael Keeble Buckland, eds., ''Historical Studies in Information Science'', 1998, p. 51''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bella Hass Weinberg, "Predecessors of Scientific Indexing Structures in the Domain of Religion" in W. Boyden Rayward, Mary Ellen Bowden, ''The History and Heritage of Scientific and Technological Information Systems'', Proceedings of the 2002 Conference, 2004, p. 126''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike modern scholarly citation indexes, only references to one work, the Bible, were indexed.

In English legal literature, volumes of judicial reports included lists of cases cited in that volume starting with ''Raymond's Reports'' (1743) and followed by ''Douglas's Reports'' (1783). Simon Greenleaf (1821) published an alphabetical list of cases with notes on later decisions affecting the precedential authority of the original decision.&lt;ref name='shapiro'/&gt;

The first true citation index dates to the 1860 publication of Labatt's ''Table of Cases...California...'', followed in 1872 by Wait's ''Table of Cases...New York...''. But the most important and best-known citation index came with the 1873 publication of [[Shepard's Citations]].&lt;ref name='shapiro'&gt;Fred R. Shapiro, "Origins of Bibliometrics, Citation Indexing, and Citation Analysis: The Neglected Legal Literature" ''Journal of the American Society of Information Science'' '''43''':5:337-339 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major citation indexing services==
{{main article|Indexing and abstracting service}}
{{main cat|Citation indices}}
General-purpose, subscription-based academic citation indexes include:
*[[Web of Science]] by [[Clarivate Analytics]] (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of [[Thomson Reuters]])
*[[Scopus]] by [[Elsevier]], available online only, which similarly combines subject searching with citation browsing and tracking in the sciences and [[social sciences]].
Each of these offer an index of citations between publications and a mechanism to establish which documents cite which other documents. They are not open-access and differ widely in cost: Web of Science and Scopus are available by subscription (generally to libraries).

In addition, [[CiteSeer]] and [[Google Scholar]] are freely available online. 

Several open-access, subject-specific citation indexing services also exist, such as:
*[[INSPIRE-HEP]] which covers high energy physics,   
*[[PubMed]], which covers life sciences and biomedical topics, and 
*[[Astrophysics Data System]] which covers astronomy and physics.

In [[computer science]], '''computational learning theory''' (or just '''learning theory''') is a subfield of [[Artificial Intelligence]] devoted to studying the design and analysis of [[machine learning]] algorithms.&lt;ref name="ACL"&gt;http://www.learningtheory.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Theoretical results in machine learning mainly deal with a type of inductive learning called [[supervised learning]].  In supervised learning, an algorithm is given samples that are labeled in some useful way.  For example, the samples might be descriptions of mushrooms, and the labels could be whether or not the mushrooms are edible.  The algorithm takes these previously labeled samples and uses them to induce a classifier.  This classifier is a function that assigns labels to samples, including samples that have not been seen previously by the algorithm.  The goal of the supervised learning algorithm is to optimise some measure of performance such as minimising the number of mistakes made on new samples.

In addition to performance bounds, computational learning theory studies the time complexity and feasibility of learning.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In
computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [[polynomial time]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} There are two kinds of time
complexity results:

* Positive results{{spaced ndash}}Showing that a certain class of functions is learnable in polynomial time.
* Negative results{{spaced ndash}}Showing that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.

Negative results often rely on commonly believed, but yet unproven assumptions,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} such as:

* Computational complexity – [[P versus NP problem|P &amp;ne; NP (the P versus NP problem)]];
* [[cryptography|Cryptographic]] – [[One-way function]]s exist.

There are several different approaches to computational learning theory.  These differences are based on making assumptions about the
[[inference]] principles used to generalize from limited data.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  This includes different definitions of [[probability]] (see [[frequency probability]], [[Bayesian probability]]) and different assumptions on the generation of samples.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The different approaches include:{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

* [[Exact learning]], proposed by [[Dana Angluin]];
* [[Probably approximately correct learning]] (PAC learning), proposed by [[Leslie Valiant]];
* [[VC theory]], proposed by [[Vladimir Vapnik]] and [[Alexey Chervonenkis]];
* [[Bayesian inference]];
* [[Algorithmic learning theory]], from the work of [[E. Mark Gold]];
* [[Online machine learning]], from the work of Nick Littlestone.

Computational learning theory has led to several practical algorithms.{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} For example, PAC theory inspired [[Boosting (meta-algorithm)|boosting]], VC theory led to [[support vector machine]]s, and Bayesian inference led to [[belief networks]] (by [[Judea Pearl]]).

{{Spirituality sidebar|experience}}
The '''evolutionary psychology of religion''' is the study of [[religious belief]] using [[evolutionary psychology]] principles. It is one approach to the [[psychology of religion]]. As with all other organs and organ functions, the [[brain]]'s functional structure is argued to have a genetic basis, and is therefore subject to the effects of [[natural selection]] and [[evolution]]. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes, religion in this case, by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Steadman, L. |author2=Palmer, C. |date=2008 |title=The Supernatural and Natural Selection: Religion and Evolutionary Success |publisher=Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of evolution==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

There is general agreement among scientists that a propensity to engage in religious behavior evolved early in human history. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. There are two schools of thought. One is that religion itself evolved due to [[natural selection]] and is an [[adaptation]], in which case religion conferred some sort of evolutionary advantage. The other is that religious beliefs and behaviors may have emerged as by-products of other adaptive traits without initially being selected for because of their own benefits.&lt;ref name="Sosis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Watts2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tamas/&gt;

Religious behavior often involves significant costs including economic costs, [[celibacy]], dangerous rituals, or by spending time that could be used otherwise. This would suggest that natural selection should act against religious behavior unless it or something else causing religious behavior to have significant advantages.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 The Evolution of Religion by Joseph A. Bulbulia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as an adaptation===
{{further|Handicap principle|Signalling theory}}

Richard Sosis and Candace Alcorta have reviewed several of the prominent theories for the [[adaptive value]] of religion.&lt;ref name="Sosis"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Signaling, solidarity, and the sacred: the evolution of religious behavior|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=12|issue=6|doi=10.1002/evan.10120|pages=264–274 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |first2=C. |last2=Alcorta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are "social solidarity theories", which view religion as having evolved to enhance cooperation and cohesion within groups. Group membership in turn provides benefits which can enhance an individual's chances for survival and reproduction. These benefits range from coordination advantages&lt;ref name=Tamas&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the facilitation of costly behavior rules.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Broad supernatural punishment but not moralizing high gods precede the evolution of political complexity in Austronesia|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1804/20142556|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2015-04-07|pmc = 4375858|pmid = 25740888|pages = 20142556|volume = 282|issue = 1804|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2556|first = Joseph|last = Watts|first2 = Simon J.|last2 = Greenhill|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Thomas E.|last4 = Currie|first5 = Joseph|last5 = Bulbulia|first6 = Russell D.|last6 = Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for development of religion for group cohesion is strongly suggested by Edward O. Wilson's theory of "eusociality".  He posited that the individuals of a small percentage of species including homo sapiens, ants, termites, bees and a few other species, replicated their genes by adhering to one of a number of competing groups.  He further postulates that, in homo sapiens, thanks to our enormous forebrains, there evolved a complex interplay between group evolution and individual evolution within a group.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Conquest of Earth|year=2007|first=Edward O.|last=Wilson|publisher=Liveright|isbn=978-0871403636}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2018}}

These social solidarity theories may help to explain the painful or dangerous nature of many religious rituals. [[Handicap principle|Costly-signaling theory]] suggests that such rituals might serve as public and hard-to-fake signals that an individual's commitment to the group is sincere. Since there would be a considerable benefit in trying to cheat the system - taking advantage of group living benefits without taking on any possible costs - the ritual would not be something simple that can be taken lightly.&lt;ref name="Sosis"/&gt; Warfare is a good example of a cost of group living, and Richard Sosis, Howard C. Kress, and James S. Boster carried out a cross-cultural survey which demonstrated that men in societies which engage in war do submit to the costliest rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Scars for war: evaluating alternative signaling explanations for cross-cultural variance in ritual costs |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.02.007 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=4| pages=234–247 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |last2=Kress |first2=H. C. |first3=J. S. |last3=Boster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that show more direct positive associations between religious practice and health and longevity are more controversial. Harold G. Koenig and Harvey J. Cohen summarized and assessed the results of 100 evidence-based studies that systematically examined the relationship between religion and human well-being, finding that 79% showed a positive influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Link between Religion and Health: Psychoneuroimmunology and the Faith Factor|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2001|first1=Harold G. |last1=Koenig |first2=Harvey J. |last2=Cohen|isbn=0-19-514360-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies are popular in the media, as seen in a recent [[NPR]] program including University of Miami Professor Gail Ironson's findings that belief in God and a strong sense of spirituality were good predictors of a lower viral load and improved immune cell levels in HIV patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104351710|title=Can Positive Thoughts Help Heal Another Person?|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara|year=2009|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Richard P. Sloan of Columbia University was quoted in the New York Times as saying that "...there is no really good compelling evidence that there is a relationship between religious involvement and health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E0DE1730F934A35756C0A9649C8B63|title=Religion and Health: New Research Revives an Old Debate|date=May 7, 2002|accessdate=2009-12-19|newspaper=New York Times | first=Mary | last=Duenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still debate over the validity of these findings, and they do not necessarily prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between religion and health. Mark Stibich claims there is a clear correlation but the reason for it is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;http://longevity.about.com/od/longevityboosters/a/religion_life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of such [[placebo]] effects, as well as the advantage of religion giving a sense of meaning, is that it seems likely that less complex mechanisms than religious behavior could achieve such goals.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

===Religion as a by-product===
{{See also|Agent detection}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] cites religion as an example of an [[exaptation]] or [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], but he does not himself select a definite trait which he thinks was actually acted on by natural selection. He does, however, bring up Freud's suggestion that our large brains, which evolved for other reasons, led to consciousness. The beginning of consciousness forced humans to deal with the concept of personal mortality. Religion may have been one solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="exaptation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|year=1991|title=Exaptation: a crucial tool for an evolutionary psychology|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=47|pages=43–65|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01822.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have proposed specific psychological processes which may have been co-opted for religion. Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm ([[agent detection]]), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion|year= 2004|publisher= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|journal= The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pascal Boyer]] suggests, in his book ''[[Religion Explained]]'', that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. He builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including [[folk psychology]]. He argues that one such factor is that it has, in most cases, been advantageous for humans to remember "minimally counter-intuitive" concepts which are somewhat different from the daily routine and somewhat violate innate expectations about how the world is constructed. A god that is in many aspects like humans but much more powerful is such a concept, while the often much more abstract god discussed at length by theologians is often too counter-intuitive. Experiments support that religious people think about their god in [[anthropomorphic]] terms even if this contradicts the more complex theological doctrines of their religion.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Pierre Lienard and Pascal Boyer suggest that humans have evolved a "hazard-precaution system" which allows us to detect potential threats in the environment and attempt to respond appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Whence collective rituals? A cultural selection model of ritualized behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=108|pages=824–827|last1=Lienard |first1=P. |first2=P. |last2=Boyer |doi=10.1525/aa.2006.108.4.814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several features of ritual behaviors, often a major feature of religion, are held to trigger this system. These include the occasion for the ritual, often the prevention or elimination of danger or evil, the harm believed to result from nonperformance of the ritual, and the detailed proscriptions for proper performance of the ritual. Lienard and Boyer discuss the possibility that a sensitive hazard-precaution system itself may have provided fitness benefits, and that religion then "associates individual, unmanageable anxieties with coordinated action with others and thereby makes them more tolerable or meaningful".

[[Justin L. Barrett]] in ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'' suggests that belief in God is natural because it depends on mental tools possessed by all human beings. He suggests that the way our minds are structured and develop make belief in the existence of a supreme god with properties such as being superknowing, superpowerful and immortal highly attractive. He also compares belief in God to belief in other minds, and devotes a chapter to looking at the evolutionary psychology of atheism. He suggests that one of the fundamental mental modules in the brain is the Hyperactive Agency Detection Device (HADD), another potential system for identifying danger. This HADD may confer a survival benefit even if it is over-sensitive: it is better to avoid an imaginary predator than be killed by a real one. This would tend to encourage belief in ghosts and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Justin L.|title=Why Would Anyone Believe in God|chapter=3|isbn=0-7591-0667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though hominids probably began using their emerging cognitive abilities to meet basic needs like nutrition and mates, [[Terror Management Theory]] argues that this happened before they had reached the point where significant self (and thus end-of-self) awareness arose. Death awareness became a highly disruptive byproduct of prior adaptive functions. The resulting anxiety threatened to undermine these very functions and thus needed amelioration. Any social formation or practice that was to be widely accepted by the masses needed to provide a means of managing this terror. The main strategy to do so was to "become an individual of value in a world of meaning…acquiring self-esteem [via] the creation and maintenance of culture", as this would counter the sense of insignificance represented by death and provide 1) symbolic immortality through the legacy of a culture that lives on beyond the physical self ("earthly significance") 2) literal immortality, the promise of an afterlife or continued existence featured in religions ("cosmic significance").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M.

===Memes===
{{See also|Memes}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] suggests in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' that cultural [[memes]] function like genes in that they are subject to natural selection. In ''[[The God Delusion#Roots of religion and morality|The God Delusion]]'' Dawkins further argues that because religious truths cannot be questioned, their very nature encourages religions to spread like "mind viruses". In such a conception, it is necessary that the individuals who are unable to question their beliefs are more biologically fit than individuals who are capable of questioning their beliefs. Thus, it could be concluded that sacred scriptures or oral traditions created a behavioral pattern that elevated biological fitness for believing individuals. Individuals who were capable of challenging such beliefs, even if the beliefs were enormously improbable, became rarer and rarer in the population. (See [[denialism]].)

This model holds that religion is the byproduct of the cognitive modules in the human brain that arose in our evolutionary past to deal with problems of survival and reproduction. Initial concepts of supernatural agents may arise in the tendency of humans to "overdetect" the presence of other humans or predators (momentarily mistaking a vine for a snake). For instance, a man might report that he felt something sneaking up on him, but it vanished when he looked around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=Stewart Elliot|title=Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-19-506901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of these experiences are especially likely to be retold, passed on and embellished due to their descriptions of standard ontological categories (person, artifact, animal, plant, natural object) with counterintuitive properties (humans that are invisible, houses that remember what happened in them, etc.). These stories become even more salient when they are accompanied by activation of non-violated expectations for the ontological category (houses that "remember" activates our intuitive psychology of mind; i.e. we automatically attribute thought processes to them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/boyer_religious_concepts.htm|title=Functional Origins of Religious concepts|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|accessdate=2009-12-19|authorlink=Pascal Boyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the attributes of our intuitive psychology of mind is that humans are interested in the affairs of other humans. This may result in the tendency for concepts of supernatural agents to inevitably cross connect with human intuitive moral feelings (evolutionary behavioral guidelines). In addition, the presence of dead bodies creates an uncomfortable cognitive state in which dreams and other mental modules (person identification and behavior prediction) continue to run decoupled from reality producing incompatible intuitions that the dead are somehow still around. When this is coupled with the human predisposition to see misfortune as a social event (as someone's responsibility rather than the outcome of mechanical processes) it may activate the intuitive "willingness to make exchanges" module of the human theory of minds resulting in the tendency of humans to try to interact and bargain with their supernatural agents ([[ritual]]).&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought|publisher=Basic Books|year=2001|authorlink=Pascal Boyer|isbn=0-465-00695-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a large enough group, some individuals will seem better skilled at these rituals than others and will become specialists. As the societies grow and encounter others, competition will ensue and a "survival of the fittest" effect may cause the practitioners to modify their concepts to provide a more abstract, more widely acceptable version. Eventually the specialist practitioners form a cohesive group or guild with its attendant political goals (religion).&lt;ref name="boyer"/&gt;

A '''floating airport''' is an airport built and situated on a [[very large floating structure]] (VLFS) located many miles out at sea utilizing a flotation type of device or devices such as [[Pneumatic stabilized platform|pneumatic stabilized platform (PSP)]] technology.

As the population increases and land becomes more expensive and scarce, [[very large floating structure]]s (VLFS) such as floating airports could help solve [[land use]], [[pollution]] and [[aircraft noise]] issues.

==Early history==
The first discussion of a floating airport was for [[Transatlantic flight|trans-Atlantic flights]]. At that time a passenger aircraft capable of making the trip could be built, but because of the massive need for fuel for the flight, it had a limited payload. An article appeared in the January 1930 issue of ''Popular Mechanics'' in which a model of a floating airport located in the Atlantic was proposed. To make safe flight possible with the aviation technology of that time, it called for eight such airports in the Atlantic. But unlike future floating airport ideas which were free floating, this 1930 concept had a floating airport platform, but with stabilizer legs which prevent the flight deck from pitching and rolling, similar in concept to some of today's off shore oil rigs. The cost of establishing eight such floating airports in 1930 was estimated at approximately USD$12,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ueQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PP8&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Mps3Ts_RNKL_sQLdiN0q&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Sea Legs of Floating Airport Prevents Rolls and Pitches" ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1930] Article and photo located bottom-right-side of page&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of floating airports was forgotten until in 1935 the famous French aviation pilot and builder [[Louis Blériot|Bleriot]] gave one of his last interviews in which he made the case for floating airports in mid-Atlantic; he called them '''Seadromes''' as a solution to economical trans-Atlantic passenger flights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aJgvTv3XKdSgsQLVyIRv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "SEADROMES! Says Bleriot" ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1935]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In theory, issues and problems of land-based airports could be minimized by locating airports several miles off the coast. Takeoffs and landings would be over water, not over populated areas, thereby eliminating noise pollution and reducing risks of aircraft crashes to the land-locked population.

Since little of the ocean's surface is currently being used for human activity, growth and alterations in configuration would be relatively easy to achieve with minimal impact to the environment or to local residents who would utilize the airport. [[Water taxi]]s or other high speed surface vessels would be a part of an offshore [[mass transit system]] that could connect the floating airport to coastal communities and minimize traffic issues.

A floating structure, such as a floating airport, is theorised to have less impact on the environment than the land-based alternative. It would not require much, if any, dredging or moving of mountains or clearing of green space and the floating structure provides a [[reef]]-like environment conducive to marine life. In theory, [[wave energy]] could be harnessed, using the structure to convert waves into energy to help sustain the energy needs of the airport.

==Modern Floating airport projects==

{{anchor|Mega-Float}}In 2000, the [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport]] sponsored the construction of Mega-Float,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlit.go.jp/english/maritime/mega_float.html Mega-Float]&lt;/ref&gt; a 1000-metre floating runway in [[Tokyo Bay]]. After conducting several real aircraft landings, the Ministry concluded that floating runways' hydro-elastic response would not affect aircraft operations, including precision instrument approaches in a protected waterway such as a large bay. The structure has been dismantled and is no longer in use.

The [[Pneumatic stabilized platform|pneumatic stabilized platform (PSP)]] was proposed as a means for constructing a new floating airport for [[San Diego]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], at least three miles off the tip of [[Point Loma]]. However, this proposed design was rejected in October, 2003 due to very high cost, the difficulty in accessing such an airport, the difficulty in transporting jet fuel, electricity, water, and gas to the structure, failure to address security concerns such as a bomb blast, inadequate room for high-speed exits and taxiways, and environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.san.org/Airport_Authority/Airport_Site_Selection/faq.asp www.san.org dead link] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105158/http://www.san.org/Airport_Authority/Airport_Site_Selection/faq.asp |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Achmad Yani International Airport]], the first floating airport in the world started construction on 17 June 2014, and  completed in 2018. However, only the passenger terminal and apron is floating.

'''"Found in collection"''' '''or FIC''' is a term used by a [[museum]] to refer to "undocumented objects that remain without status after all attempts to reconcile them to existing records of permanent collection and loan objets are completed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Buck| first1=edited by Rebecca A.| last2=Gilmore| first2=Jean Allman| title=MRM5: Museum registration methods| date=2010| publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums| location=Washington, DC| isbn=978-1-933253-15-2| page=477| edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the best efforts of museum staff, museums often have FIC items. This term was developed so that collections with incomplete provenance would be handled ethically and with transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Code of Ethics for Museums| url=http://www.aam-us.org/resources/ethics-standards-and-best-practices/code-of-ethics| website=American Alliance of Museums| publisher=American Alliance of Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paperwork and information accompanying the material, the museum has several choices in how to proceed.

==Occurrences==
Museums today are meticulous about the documentation they keep when [[Collection (artwork)#Accessioning|accessioning]] new items into their collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=NPS Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Records| url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mushbkII.html| website=National Park Service-Museum Management Program| publisher=National Park Service| accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not always the case. As the museum field professionalized so did the standard of paperwork required to accession a collection. Items can become FIC artifacts if records were not kept initially or if the documentation regarding the property transfer was lost in a disaster such as a fire or flood. Additionally, if the museum is old, it has decades of accessioning paperwork that may require its own preservation plan.

===Lapsed loans===
FIC collections can also be the result of long-term or permanent loans where contact has lapsed between the two parties. It is for this reason that most museums now renew their loans on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Loan Abandoned Property Disposition|url=https://www.arcsinfo.org/programs/resources/legislation/old-loan-abandoned-property-disposition|website=Old Loan Abandoned Property Disposition|publisher=Association of Registrars and Collections Specialists|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=319–354|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key participants==
*[[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]]/[[Collection manager|Collections Manager]]: Ultimately registrars and collections managers are in charge of accession paperwork and artifact documentation. Collections staff are responsible for assembling as much information as possible on the provenance of the objects in order to help the Collections Committee and other staff make the most informed decision they can. 
* Collections Committee: A Collections Committee at a museum is composed of [[curator]]s, collections staff, educators and senior administrators who decide what will become part of the museum's collection based on the museum's [[Collections policy|collections management policy]]. Just as importantly, the Committee rules on items that should be removed from a museum's collection due to duplication or lack of relevance to the museum's mission. The Committee will also discuss collections related issues including any FIC artifact concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Collections Management Policy|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=2|website=Developing a Collections Management Policy|publisher=American Alliance of Museums|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lawyer|Legal Counsel]]: The Collections staff and legal counsel need to work closely together. There are very specific laws governing museums and unclaimed property. 
*Director/President &amp; Board of Trustees: The Director and Board of Trustees all need to sign off and be aware of accessions and deaccessions to their museum's collection. They rely heavily on the recommendation of the Collections Committee.
*[[Public relations|Public Relations Officer]]: While museums try to deal with FIC items openly, the knowledge that museums may not have complete intellectual and physical control of their collections can sometimes cause controversy or public concern. The Public Relations Officer is in charge of explaining how museum's work, how the situation has occurred, and what is being done to solve the problem. Public education and transparency can go a long way towards keeping the relationship between the community and museum positive.
* Claimant: During the FIC process a claimant may come forward to stake a claim to the found property. Depending on the nature of the claim and whether or not the claimant is a person or organization different procedures will be followed. However, the claimant must provide some type of documentary evidence to support their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|pages=391–395|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What constitutes ownership==
Museums require three pieces of information to accession a collection. 
#  Written intent to donate on behalf of the donor.
#  Acceptance of the collection into the museum's holdings by the museum (usually through the Collections Committee). 
#  Physical possession of the collection.

The most common way this is achieved is through a [[Deed of gift|Deed of Gift]], which states these three criteria in one document&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Deeds of Gift|url=http://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/deeds-of-gift|website=A Guide to Deeds of Gift|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What action can be taken==
'''Please seek professional legal advice when dealing with FIC materials.''' Regardless of whether or not the museum wishes to retain ownership of the item, if possible the collections staff should contact the previous owner to either obtain a deed of gift or return the collection.

===Short term===
In order to keep track of the FIC collection, a temporary number should be assigned that is completely different in format from the museum's accession number to avoid further confusion. Whether the item is to be accessioned or [[Collection (artwork)#Deaccessioning|deaccessioned]], it requires establishing a chain of custody, which can be started with the application of a temporary number and assemblage of any associated documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=edited by Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=MRM5 : museum registration methods|date=2010|publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|pages=109–118|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long term===
*If the museum wishes to keep the collection:
It should try to obtain ownership by following its state's unclaimed property laws or applicable international conventions. If during the found property process a claimant wishes to challenge the museum's tie to the collection, the claimant must support their case with evidential paperwork. 
* If the museum does not want the collection:
If the museum does not want to keep the artifacts due to them being irrelevant to its mission or outside of its collecting scope, it has several options. If the museum can contact the previous owner or  heirs it should do so and return the collection. If the collection has no associated paperwork, the museum should follow the appropriate laws and conventions. Once it establishes ownership through that process the museum can legally and ethically follow its deaccession procedures. This may involve transfer the collection to another cultural institution, selling the collection at public auction, or if all other methods fail, destruction of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAMD Policy on Deaccessioning|url=https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf|website=AAMD|publisher=Association of Art Museum Directors|accessdate=1 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803191723/https://aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/AAMD%20Policy%20on%20Deaccessioning%20website.pdf|archivedate=3 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International conventions ==
The [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property|1970 UNESCO Convention]] was created to provide a platform and environment in which countries could discuss situations in which cultural property may have been illegally transported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=87–93|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout history cultural property has been taken as the spoils of war or trafficked by desperate individuals in order to make a profit.  For this reason museums may have to consider the 1970 UNESCO convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property when sifting through FIC collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illicit Trafficking of Cultural Property|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/1970-convention/|website=1970 Convention|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to pay particularly close attention to documentation of items that may have been acquired from conflict zones as sometimes customs forms and bills of sale are faked.

==Federal legislation==

=== Antiquities act of 1906 ===
[[Antiquities Act|The Antiquities Act of 1906]], signed by Theodore Roosevelt, was the first federal law enacted in response to a growing concern regarding the protection of cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=143–144|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law stated that antiquities could not be removed or damaged on federal property without the express permission of the government.  While not completely enforced in its day, it did set a precedent for caring for national cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Antiquities Act of 1906|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/anti1906.htm|website=American Antiquities Act of 1906 16 USC 431-433|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 ===
The [[Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979|Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA)]] was a much needed upgrade to the 1906 Antiquities Act. It updated definitions to close loopholes and increased fines and penalties for violators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malaro|first1=Marie C.|last2=DeAngelis|first2=Ildiko Pogány|title=A legal primer on managing museum collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1588343222|pages=145–146|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If museums have FIC collections that may have been obtained in violation of the 1906 and 1979 legislation, they should seek legal advice and follow the provisions in the Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA)|url=http://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/Laws/arpa.htm|website=NPS Archaeology Program|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act===
The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|Native American Graves Protection Act (NAGPRA)]] was signed into law in 1990 to specifically to "affirm the rights of lineal descendants, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations to custody of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony that are in the control of federal agencies and museums".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buck|first1=edited by Rebecca A.|last2=Gilmore|first2=Jean Allman|title=MRM5 : museum registration methods|date=2010|publisher=AAM Press, American Association of Museums|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|pages=448–457|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately throughout the history of the United States, Native American cultural property and even human remains were not acquired with the consent, let alone documentation. Because of this, Native American and Native Hawaiian artifacts are often FIC. In trying to resolve these culturally sensitive FIC items, NAGPRA legislation should be followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National NAGPRA|url=http://www.nps.gov/nagpra|website=National NAGPRA|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fruticose lichen''' is a form of [[lichen]] [[fungi]] that is characterized by a [[coral]]-like shrubby or bushy growth structure. It is composed of a [[thallus]] and a [[holdfast]]. It is formed from a [[symbiotic relationship]] of a [[photobiont]] such as [[cyanobacteria]] and two [[mycobiont]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spribille|first1=Toby|title=Basidiomycete yeasts in the cortex of ascomycete macrolichens|journal=Science|date=21 July 2016|doi=10.1126/science.aaf8287|pmid=27445309|volume=353|pages=488–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fruticose lichen is composed of a complex vegetation structure, and characterized by an ascending, bushy or pendulous appearance. While lichen communities are mainly controlled by water and light, vegetative dispersal and filamentous growth in fruticose lichen is often associated with areas of low elevation. Fruticose lichens can endure high degrees of [[desiccation]]. They grow very slowly and will often occur in extreme habitats such as on tree barks, on rock surfaces and on soils in the [[Arctic]] and mountain regions.

==Characteristics==
Fruticose lichen is a form of lichen composed of a shrubby or bushy thallus and a holdfast. The thallus is the vegetative body of a lichen that does not have true leaves, stems, or roots. Thallus colour of the lichen can be attributed to the amount of light in its environment. A light thallus color is associated with lower light conditions within the growing environment. Fruticose lichen is characterized by photobionts, the mode of vegetation dispersal, growth form and the substrate preference.  The lichen's ability to survive extreme desiccation is due to its ability to quench excess light energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanism of strong quenching of photosystem II chlorophyll fluorescence under drought stress in a lichen, Physciella melanchla, studied by subpicosecond fluorescence spectroscopy|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005272809002941|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics|date = 2010-03-01|pages = 331–338|volume = 1797|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2009.11.007|first = Masayuki|last = Komura|first2 = Atsushi|last2 = Yamagishi|first3 = Yutaka|last3 = Shibata|first4 = Ikuko|last4 = Iwasaki|first5 = Shigeru|last5 = Itoh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Photoprotection in the Lichen Parmelia sulcata: The Origins of Desiccation-Induced Fluorescence Quenching|jstor = 40065739|journal = Plant Physiology|date = 2007-11-01|pages = 997–1005|volume = 145|issue = 3|first = John|last = Veerman|first2 = Sergej|last2 = Vasil'ev|first3 = Gavin D.|last3 = Paton|first4 = Justin|last4 = Ramanauskas|first5 = Doug|last5 = Bruce|pmid = 17827268|doi=10.1104/pp.107.106872|pmc=2048789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Functional characteristics of a fruticose type of lichen, Stereocaulon foliolosum Nyl. in response to light and water stress|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11738-012-1203-8|journal = Acta Physiologiae Plantarum|date = 2013-01-05|issn = 0137-5881|pages = 1605–1615|volume = 35|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s11738-012-1203-8|first = Ruchi|last = Singh|first2 = Sanjay|last2 = Ranjan|first3 = Sanjeeva|last3 = Nayaka|first4 = Uday V.|last4 = Pathre|first5 = Pramod A.|last5 = Shirke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristic of fruticose lichen is the shape of the thallus. Like [[crustose]] lichen, fruticose lichen is composed of a holdfast which will act as an anchor for the lichen to grow in rock fissures, over loose sand or soil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lichen Biology|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 9780521871624|location = Cambridge, New York|editor-last = Nash|editor-first = Thomas|edition = Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth and structure==
[[File:Fruticose Lichen (Teloschistes chrysophtalmus) (8558189274).jpg|thumb|''Teloschistes chrysophtalmus'']]
Fruticose or ‘shrubby’ lichen differ from other forms of lichen based on their bushy form that is attached to the ground only at the base of the lichen. The most important difference that distinguishes fruticose lichen from other forms of lichen is the continuous algal layer that grows around the circumference of the branches of the lichen.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding Lichens|last = Baron|first = George|publisher = Richmond Publishing Co. Ltd.|year = 1999|isbn = 0855462523|location = Slough, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thallus may be either rounded or flattened, unbranched or branched.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The biology of lichens|last = Hale|first = Mason|publisher = Edward Arnold|year = 1967|isbn = 0713124563|location = London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fruticose lichens have a fine, round, hair-like structures and are loosely attached to rocks and trees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although fruticose lichens are defined as being bushy, they can also exhibit a flattened and strap-like appearance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Highly branched fruticose lichen have a high surface to volume ratio that results in a rapid drying and wetting pattern compared to lichens that have a lower surface to volume ratio.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The internal structure of fruticose lichen is composed of a dense outer cortex, a thin algal layer, a [[medulla (lichenology)|medulla]] and a hollow center or a dense central cord.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The structure of fruticose lichens depends also on their mycobionts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The lichen-forming fungi|last = Hawksworth|first = D.L.|publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall|year = 1984|isbn = 0412006413|location = Glasgow : New York: Blackie|last2 = Hill|first2 = David J.|series = Tertiary Level Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichen undergoes diffuse growth and the thallus elongates over time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diffuse growth in the fruticose beard lichen Ramalina usnea (L.)

V.|last2 = Glotov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction and dispersal==
Lichens reproduce by means of [[spores]] or vegetatively. This characteristic is also seen in free-living fungi and many other plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are three common spore-bearing structures found in lichens: the [[apothecium]], the [[perithecium]] and the [[pycnidium]]. The apothecium is described as being either sessile or immersed. The thallus is known as ''sessile'' if it sits atop the surface of its growth medium. If the apothecium is level with or sits below the surface it is known as ''immersed''. The second form of spore-bearing structure is a perithecium which refers to the complete immersion in the substratum of rock or bark. Finally, the pycnidium, commonly seen on the surface of [[foliose]] lichen and crustose lichen, are absent in fruticose lichens.

==Diversity==
[[File:A guide to the study of lichens (1904) (14744008916).jpg|thumb]]
There are many different varieties of fruticose lichen. Each type of fruticose lichen will differ in structure and some types will be more dominant in a particular environment compared to other forms of fruticose lichen.
# ''Pseudephebe minuscula'' has a fruticose thallus consisting of thin branches that result in the formation of dense mats.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Morphological effects on the water balance of Antarctic foliose and fruticose lichens|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0954102097000059|journal = Antarctic Science|date = 1997-03-01|issn = 1365-2079|pages = 36–42|volume = 9|issue = 1|doi = 10.1017/S0954102097000059|first = A.h.l.|last = Huiskes|first2 = N.j.m.|last2 = Gremmen|first3 = J.w.|last3 = Francke}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Pseudephebe pubescens'' has thin branches that are loosely entangled.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# ''Usnea'' has stringy strands that may be short, tufted and bush-like,and may reach a length of several meters. This form of lichen has a characteristic tough central core. This gives a mild degree of support to the lichen while also providing storage for a large proportion of the water contained in this form of fruticose lichen.

==Distribution and accumulation==
Fruticose growth forms can be found in wet humid climates, in temperate [[rainforests]], or in arid conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fruticose lichens are most commonly distributed in mountains, forests and arctic tundra. The accumulation rate of lichen varies within different environments. Lichen accumulation rate decreases from mountain to alpine belts and from tree top to base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fruticose arboreal lichen biomass accumulation in an old-growth balsam fir forest|url = http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/b98-144|journal = Canadian Journal of Botany|date = 1998-10-01|issn = 0008-4026|pages = 1669–1676|volume = 76|issue = 10|doi = 10.1139/b98-144|first = Marie-Josée|last = Arseneau|first2 = Jean-Pierre|last2 = Ouellet|first3 = Luc|last3 = Sirois}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because lichen near tree tops are in their early life stages when growth rates are higher. Lower lichen accumulation of the alpine belt may be explained by harsh climate.

==Economic and ecological significance==
Although they lack economic importance comparable to that of their algal and fungal components, lichen play an important role in nitrogen cycling, providing critical winter forage for caribou and colonizing newly exposed surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lichen traits and species as indicators of vegetation and environment|url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1639/0007-2745-118.3.252|journal = The Bryologist|date = 2015-08-17|pages = 252–263|volume = 118|issue = 3|doi = 10.1639/0007-2745-118.3.252|first = Peter R.|last = Nelson|first2 = Bruce|last2 = McCune|first3 = David K.|last3 = Swanson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14065">A '''functional group''' is  merely a set of species, or collection of organisms, that share alike characteristics within a community. Ideally, the lifeforms would perform equivalent tasks based on domain forces, rather than a common ancestor or evolutionary relationship. This could potentially lead to analogous structures that overrule the possibility of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. More specifically, these beings produce resembling effects to external factors of an inhabiting system.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 2: Functional Groups." ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.'' N.p.: n.p., n.d. 9-25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that a majority of these creatures share an [[ecological niche]], it is practical to assume they require similar structures in order to achieve the greatest amount of [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This refers to such as the ability to successfully reproduce to create offspring, and furthermore sustain life by avoiding alike predators and sharing meals.

==Scientific investigation==
Rather than the idea of this concept based upon a set of theories, functional groups are directly observed and determined by research specialists. It is important that this information is witnessed first-hand in order to state as usable evidence. Behavior and overall contribution to others are common key points to look for. Individuals use the corresponding perceived traits to further link genetic profiles to one another. Although, the life-forms themselves are different, variables based upon overall function and performance are interchangeable. These groups share an indistinguishable part within their [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]], providing a key position within [[food chain]]s and relationships within environment(s).&lt;ref&gt;'''Vassiliki, Markantonatou.''' "Marine Biodiversity Wiki." ''Functional Groups -''. N.p., n.d. Web. 30 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is an ecosystem and why is that important? An ecosystem is the biological organization that defines and expands on various environment factors- [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] and [[biotic component|biotic]], that relate to simultaneous interaction.&lt;ref&gt;"Ecosystem.org." Ecosystem. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it be a producer or relative consumer, each and every piece of life maintains a critical position in the ongoing survival rates of its own surroundings. As it pertains, a functional groups shares a very specific role within any given ecosystem and the process of cycling vitality.

==Categories==
There are generally two types of functional groups that range between flora and specific animal populations. Groups that relate to vegetation science, or flora, are known as plant functional types. Also referred to as PFT for short, those of such often share identical photosynthetic processes and require comparable nutrients. As an example, plants that undergo photosynthesis share an identical purpose in producing chemical energy for others.&lt;ref&gt;"The Ecosystem and How It Relates to Sustainability." The Concept of the Ecosystem. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, those within the animal science range are called guilds, typically sharing feeding types. This could be easily simplified when viewing [[trophic level]]s. Examples include primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and quaternary consumers.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 2: Functional Groups." ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology.''

Organismal level functional diversity, which adds to the overall functional diversity of an ecosystem, is important for conservation efforts, especially in systems used for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=B|date=1992|title=Biodiversity and ecological redundancy|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functional diversity can be difficult to measure accurately, but when done correctly, it provides useful insight to the overall function and stability of an ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petchey|first1=O.L|last2=Gaston|first2=K.J|date=2002|title=Functional diversity (FD), species richness and community composition|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=5|pages=402–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Redundancy ==
Functional redundancy refers to the phenomenon that species in the same ecosystem fill similar roles, which results in a sort of "insurance" in the ecosystem. Redundant species can easily do the job of a similar species from the same functional niche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Jordan|date=2002|title=Functional redundancy in ecology and conservation|journal=Synthesizing Ecology|volume=98|issue=1|pages=156–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is possible because similar species have adapted to fill the same niche overtime. Functional redundancy varies across ecosystems and can vary from year to year depending on multiple factors including habitat availability, overall species diversity, competition among species for resources, and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naeem|first1=S|date=1998|title=Species redundancy and ecosystem reliability|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation can lead to a fluctuation in overall ecosystem production. It is not always known how many species occupy a functional niche, and how much, if any, redundancy is occurring in each niche in an ecosystem. It is hypothesized that each important functional niche is filled by multiple species. Similar to functional diversity, there is no one clear method for calculating functional redundancy accurately, which can be problematic. One method is to account for the number of species occupying a functional niche, as well as the abundance of each species. This can indicate how many total individuals in an ecosystem are performing one function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ricotta|first1=C. et al.|date=2016|title=Measuring the functional redundancy of biological communities: A quantitative guide|journal=Methods in Ecology and Evolution|volume=8|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on conservation ==
Studies relating to [[Functional diversity (ecology)|functional diversity]] and redundancy occur in a large proportion of conservation and ecological research. As the human population increases, the need for ecosystem function subsequently increases. In addition, habitat destruction and modification continue to increase, and suitable habitat for many species continues to decrease, this research becomes more important. As the human population continues to expand, and urbanization is on the rise, native and natural landscapes are disappearing, being replaced with modified and managed land for human consumption. Alterations to landscapes are often accompanied with negative side effects including fragmentation, species losses, and nutrient runoff, which can effect the stability of an ecosystem, productivity of an ecosystem, and the functional diversity and functional redundancy by decreasing species diversity.

It has been shown that intense land use affects both the species diversity, and functional overlap, leaving the ecosystem and organisms in it vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Labierte|first1=E. et al.|date=2010|title=. Land use intensification reduces functional redundancy and response diversity in plant communities|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=13|issue=1|pages=76–86|pmid=19917052|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01403.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, bee species, which we rely on for pollination services, have both lower functional diversity and species diversity in managed landscapes when compared to natural habitats, indicating that anthropogenic change can be detrimental for organismal functional diversity, and therefore overall ecosystem functional diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forrest|first1=J.R|last2=Thorp|first2=R. W|last3=Kremen|first3=C|last4=Williams|first4=N.M|date=2015|title=Contrasting patterns in species and functional trait diversity of bees in an agricultural landscape|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=52|pages=706–715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research demonstrated that the functional redundancy of herbaceous insects in streams varies due to stream velocity, demonstrating that environmental factors can alter functional overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poff|first1=N.L et al.|date=2002|title=Redundancy among three herbivorous insects across an experimental current velocity gradient|journal=Community Ecology|volume=134|issue=4|pages=262–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; When conservation efforts begin, it is still up for debate whether preserving specific species, or functional traits is a more beneficial approach for the preservation of ecosystem function. Higher species, diversity can lead to an increase in overall ecosystem productivity, but does not necessarily insure the security of functional overlap. In ecosystems with high redundancy, losing a species (which lowers overall functional diversity) will not always lower overall ecosystem function due to high functional overlap, and thus in this instance it is most important to conserve a group, rather than an individual. In ecosystems with dominant species, which contribute to a majority of the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomas]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s output, it may be more beneficial to conserve this single species, rather than a functional group.

.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaksic|first1=F.M|date=2003|title=How much functional redundancy is out there, or are we willing to do away with potential back up species?|journal=How Landscapes Change|volume=162|pages=255–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges ===
Understanding functional diversity and redundancy, and the roles each play in conservation efforts is often hard to accomplish because the tools with which we measure diversity and redundancy cannot be used interchangeably. Due to this, recent empirical work most often analyzes the effects of either functional diversity or functional redundancy, but not both. This does not create a complete picture of the factors influencing ecosystem production. In ecosystems with similar and diverse vegetation, functional diversity is more important for overall [[ecosystem stability]] and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=TIlman|first1=David et al.|date=1997|title=The influence of functional diversity and composition on ecosystem proceeses|journal=Science|volume=277|issue=5330|pages=1300–1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in contrast, functional diversity of native bee species in highly managed landscapes provided evidence for higher functional redundancy leading to higher fruit production, something humans rely heavily on for food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sydenham|first1=M.A et al.|date=2016|title=The effects of habitat management on the species: phylogenetic and functional diversity of bees are modified by the environmental context|journal=Ecology and Evolution|volume=6|issue=4|pages=961–973}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent paper has stated that until a more accurate measuring technique is universally used, it is too early to determine which species, or functional groups, are most vulnerable and susceptible to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouchet|first1=M.A|last2=Villeger|first2=S|last3=Mason|first3=N.W|last4=Mouillot|first4=D|date=2010|title=Functional diversity measures: an overview of their redundancy and their ability to discriminate community assembly rules|journal=Functional Ecology|volume=24|pages=867–876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, understanding how extinction affects ecosystems, and which traits are most vulnerable can protect ecosystems as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petchey|first1=O.L.|last2=Gaston|first2=K.J|date=2002|title=Extinction and the loss of functional diversity|journal=The Royal Society|volume=25|pages=1721–1729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Research Institute for Public Administration''' (''GRIP'', [[German language|German]]: ''Deutsches Forschungsinstitut für öffentliche Verwaltung, FÖV'') is a non-university [[research institute]] for [[public administration]] located in [[Speyer]], [[Rhineland Palatinate]], [[Germany]]. Founded in 1976 as an organizationally independent institution under the jurisdiction of the [[List of Ministers-President of Rhineland-Palatinate|Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate]], it is largely integrated in, and maintains a strategic partnership with the [[German University of Administrative Sciences Speyer]]. As an "institution of nationwide interest" it forms part of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]] and is thus funded equally by the [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]]  and [[States of Germany|all 16 German states]]. At present the institute has 26 ordinary, 19 corresponding and two honorary [[fellow]]s from Germany and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesse.fr/nesse/activities/research-mapping/educational-governance/institutions/forschungsinstitut-fur-offentliche-verwaltung-bei-der-deutschen-hochschule-fur-verwaltungswissenschaften-speyer-the-research-institute-for-public-administration-at-the-german-university-of-administrative-sciences-speyer-fov

{{term|[[Chain rule]]}}
{{defn|The '''chain rule''' is a [[formula]] for computing the [[derivative]] of the [[Function composition|composition]] of two or more [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. That is, if ''f'' and ''g'' are functions, then the chain rule expresses the derivative of their composition {{math|''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}} (the function which maps ''x'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')) ) in terms of the derivatives of ''f'' and ''g'' and the [[pointwise product|product of functions]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)'=(f'\circ g)\cdot g'.&lt;/math&gt;

This may equivalently be expressed in terms of the variable. Let {{math|1=''F'' = ''f'' {{large|∘}} ''g''}}, or equivalently, {{math|1=''F''(''x'') = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}} for all ''x''. Then one can also write
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f'(g(x)) g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

The chain rule may be written in [[Leibniz's notation]] in the following way. If a variable ''z'' depends on the variable ''y'', which itself depends on the variable ''x'', so that ''y'' and ''z'' are therefore [[dependent variable]]s, then ''z'', via the intermediate variable of ''y'', depends on ''x'' as well.  The chain rule then states,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{dy} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}. &lt;/math&gt;

The two versions of the chain rule are related; if &lt;math&gt;z=f(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=\frac{dz}{dy}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(y)g'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

{{term|[[Convergent series]]}}
{{defn|defn= In [[mathematics]], a [[series (mathematics)|series]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the terms of an [[infinite sequence]] of numbers.

Given an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;\left ( a_1,\ a_2,\ a_3,\dots \right )&lt;/math&gt;, the ''n''th [[partial sum]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of the first ''n'' terms of the sequence, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;S_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k.&lt;/math&gt;

A series is '''convergent''' if the sequence of its partial sums &lt;math&gt;\left \{ S_1,\ S_2,\ S_3,\dots \right \}&lt;/math&gt; tends to a [[limit of a sequence|limit]]; that means that the partial sums become closer and closer to a given number when the number of their terms increases. More precisely, a series converges, if there exists a number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; such that for any arbitrarily small positive number &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, there is a (sufficiently large) [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge \ N&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\left | S_n - \ell \right \vert \le \ \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
If the series is convergent, the number &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; (necessarily unique) is called the '''sum of the series'''.

Any series that is not convergent is said to be [[Divergent series|divergent]].

'''Gravitational compression''' is a phenomenon in which [[gravity]], acting on the [[mass]] of an object, compresses it, reducing its size and increases the object's [[density]]. 
 
[[File:Stellar core.gif|thumb|In the [[Solar core|core]] of a star such as the [[Sun]], [[gravitational]] [[pressure]] is balanced by the outward thermal pressure from [[Nuclear fusion|fusion reactions]], temporarily halting gravitational compression.]]
At the center of a [[planet]] or [[star]], gravitational compression produces [[heat]] by the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]]. This is the mechanism that explains how [[Jupiter]] continues to [[radiation|radiate]] heat produced by its gravitational compression.&lt;ref name=SRI1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iki.rssi.ru/nineplanets/jupiter.html | title = Jupiter | publisher = Space Research Institute,Russian Academy of Sciences |accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common reference to gravitational compression is [[stellar evolution]]. The [[Sun]] and other [[main sequence|main-sequence]] stars are produced by the initial [[gravitational collapse]] of a [[molecular cloud]]. Assuming the mass of the material is large enough, gravitational compression reduces the size of the core, increasing its [[temperature]] until [[hydrogen fusion]] can begin. This [[hydrogen]]-to-[[helium]] [[fusion reaction]] releases [[energy]] that balances the inward gravitational [[pressure]] and the star becomes stable for millions of years. No further gravitational compression occurs until the hydrogen is nearly used up, reducing the thermal pressure of the fusion reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/astronomy/star_formation_010116.html | title = How a Star is Born: Clouds Lift on Missing Link  | date = 16 January 2001 | author = R.R. Britt | accessdate = 2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Sun's life, gravitational compression will turn it into a [[white dwarf]].&lt;ref&gt;

At the other end of the scale are [[Stellar evolution#Massive stars|massive stars]]. These stars burn their fuel very quickly, ending their lives as [[supernova]]e. After which further gravitational compression will produce either a [[neutron star]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the remnants.

For planets and [[natural satellite|moons]], equilibrium is reached when the [[compression (physical)|compression]] is balanced by a pressure gradient. This is due to gravity. This pressure gradient is in the opposite direction due to the strength of the material, at which point gravitational compression ceases.

In [[human computer interaction]], the '''gulf of execution''' is the gap between a [[user (computing)|user]]'s [[Objective (goal)|goal]] for action and the means to execute that goal.  [[Usability]] has as one of its primary goals to reduce this gap by removing roadblocks and steps that cause extra thinking and actions that distract the user's [[attention]] from the task intended, thereby preventing the [[flow (psychology)|flow]] of his or her work, and decreasing the chance of successful completion of the task.  Similarly, there is a [[gulf of evaluation]] that applies to the gap between an external stimulus and the time a person understands what it means.  Both phrases are mentioned in [[Donald Norman]]'s 1986 book ''User Centered System Design: New Perspectives on Human-computer Interaction.''

This can be illustrated through the discussion of a [[VCR]] problem. Let us imagine that a user would like to record a television show. They see the solution to this problem as simply pressing the ''Record'' button. However, in reality, to record a show on a VCR, several actions must be taken:

# Press the record button.
# Specify time of recording, usually involving several steps to change the hour and minute settings.
# Select channel to record on - either by entering the channel's number or selecting it with up/down buttons.
# Save the recording settings, perhaps by pressing an "OK" or "menu" or "enter" button.

The difference between the user's perceived execution actions and the required actions is the gulf of execution.

[[File:Ur_chariot.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[wheel]], invented sometime before the 4th millennium BC, is one of the most ubiquitous and important technologies. This detail of the "Standard of Ur", c. 2500 BC., displays a Sumerian [[chariot]]]]

The '''history of technology''' is the history of the [[invention]] of [[tool]]s and techniques and is one of the categories of the [[Human history|history of humanity]]. Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as [[stone tools]] to the complex [[genetic engineering]] and [[information technology]] that has emerged since the 1980s. The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech. It was first used to describe applied arts, but it is now used to described advancements and changes which affect the environment around us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology|title=history of technology – Summary &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New knowledge has enabled people to create new things, and conversely, many scientific endeavors are made possible by [[technologies]] which assist humans in [[travel|traveling]] to places they could not previously reach, and by [[scientific instrument]]s by which we study nature in more detail than our natural senses allow.

Since much of technology is [[applied science]], technical history is connected to the [[history of science]]. Since technology uses [[resource]]s, technical history is tightly connected to [[economic history]]. From those [[Resource (Windows)|resources]], technology produces other resources, including ''technological artifacts'' used in [[everyday life]].

[[Technological change]] affects and is affected by, a society's cultural [[tradition]]s. It is a force for [[economic growth]] and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth.

== Measuring technological progress ==
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}
Many [[sociology|sociologists]] and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] have created [[social theory|social theories]] dealing with [[social evolution|social]] and [[cultural evolution]]. Some, like [[Lewis H. Morgan]], [[Leslie White]], and [[Gerhard Lenski]] have declared [[technological progress]] to be the primary factor driving the development of human civilization. Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, [[Primitive culture|barbarism]], and [[civilization]]) can be divided by technological milestones, such as [[fire]]. White argued the measure by which to judge the evolution of culture was [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Elliot|last2=Smith|first2=Karen|title=American Materialism|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=American%20Materialism|website=The University of Alabama – Department of Anthropology|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For White, "the primary function of [[culture]]" is to "harness and control energy." White differentiates between five stages of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles. In the second, they use the energy of [[domestication of animals|domesticated animals]]. In the third, they use the energy of plants ([[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural revolution]]). In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of [[natural resource]]s: coal, oil, gas. In the fifth, they harness [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. White introduced a formula P=E*T, where E is a measure of energy consumed, and T is the measure of the efficiency of technical factors using the energy. In his own words, "culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased". [[Nikolai Kardashev]] extrapolated his theory, creating the [[Kardashev scale]], which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations.

Lenski's approach focuses on [[information]]. The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of [[natural environment]]) a given society has, the more advanced it is. He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the [[history of communication]]. In the first stage, information is passed by [[gene]]s. In the second, when humans gain [[sentience]], they can [[learn]] and pass information through experience. In the third, the humans start using signs and develop [[logic]]. In the fourth, they can create [[symbol]]s, develop [[language]] and [[writing]]. Advancements in [[communications technology]] translate into advancements in the [[economic system]] and [[political system]], [[distribution of wealth]], [[social inequality]] and other spheres of social life. He also differentiates societies based on their level of technology, communication, and economy:
* [[hunter-gatherer]],
* simple [[Agriculture|agricultural]],
* advanced agricultural,
* [[Industry|industrial]],
* special (such as fishing societies).

In economics, [[productivity]] is a measure of technological progress. Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output. Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced. In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way It Worked and Why It Won't: Structural Change and the Slowdown of U.S. Economic Growth |last=Bjork |first= Gordon J.|authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher =Praeger|location= Westport, CT; London|isbn=978-0275965327 |pages=2, 67| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, employment in [[manufacturing in the United States]] declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later. Similar changes occurred in other developed countries. This stage is referred to as ''post-industrial''.

In the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like [[Alvin Toffler]] (author of ''[[Future Shock]]''), [[Daniel Bell]] and [[John Naisbitt]] have approached the theories of [[post-industrial society|post-industrial societies]], arguing that the current era of [[industrial society]] is coming to an end, and [[Service (economics)|services]] and information are becoming more important than [[industry]] and [[good (economics)|goods]]. Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in [[Fictional technology|fiction]], are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-[[Technological singularity|Singularity]] societies.

==== Stone Age ====
{{Main|Stone Age}}
[[File:Prehistoric Tools - Les Combarelles - Les Eyzies de Tayac - MNP.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of [[stone tool]]s]]
During most of the '''[[Paleolithic]]''' – the bulk of the Stone Age – all humans had a lifestyle which involved limited tools and few permanent settlements. The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation. [[Stone tools]] and weapons, [[control of fire by early humans|fire]], and [[History of clothing and textiles|clothing]] were technological developments of major importance during this period.

Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' approximately 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501000000*/http://anthropology.si.edu/humanorigins/ha/sap.htm | title=Human Ancestors Hall: Homo sapiens | accessdate=8 December 2007 | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest methods of [[stone tool]] making, known as the [[Oldowan]] "industry", date back to at least 2.3 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/336555.stm | title=Ancient 'tool factory' uncovered | accessdate=18 February 2007 | publisher=BBC News | date=6 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the earliest direct evidence of tool usage found in [[Ethiopia]] within the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Great Rift Valley]], dating back to 2.5 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Environment and Behavior of 2.5-Million-Year-Old Bouri Hominids | last=Heinzelin | first=Jean de | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=April 1999 | volume=284 | issue=5414 | pages=625–629 | doi= 10.1126/science.284.5414.625 | pmid=10213682 | last2=Clark | first2=JD | last3=White | first3=T | last4=Hart | first4=W | last5=Renne | first5=P | last6=Woldegabriel | first6=G | last7=Beyene | first7=Y | last8=Vrba | first8=E}}&lt;/ref&gt; This era of stone tool use is called the ''[[Paleolithic]]'', or "Old stone age", and spans all of human history up to the development of [[agriculture]] approximately 12,000 years ago.

To make a stone tool, a "[[lithic core|core]]" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as [[flint]]) was struck with a [[hammerstone]]. This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of [[chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] or [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]].&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 May 2008|url=http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04|title=Archaeology|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Americana]]|author=Burke, Ariane |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080521022936/http://ea.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0019880-04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools greatly aided the early humans in their [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to perform a variety of tasks including [[butcher]]ing carcasses (and breaking bones to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]]); chopping wood; cracking open nuts; skinning an animal for its [[Hide (skin)|hide]], and even forming other tools out of softer materials such as bone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Flaked Stones and Old Bones: Biological and Cultural Evolution at the Dawn of Technology|author= Plummer, Thomas|publisher=[[Yearbook of Physical Anthropology]]|year=2004|issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest stone tools were irrelevant, being little more than a fractured rock. In the [[Acheulian]] era, beginning approximately 1.65 million years ago, methods of working these stone into specific shapes, such as [[hand axe]]s emerged. This early Stone Age is described as the [[Lower Paleolithic]].

The [[Middle Paleolithic]], approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the [[prepared-core technique]], where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone.&lt;ref name="ea_archaeology" /&gt; The [[Upper Paleolithic]], beginning approximately 40,000 years ago, saw the introduction of [[pressure flaking]], where a wood, bone, or antler [[punch (engineering)|punch]] could be used to shape a stone very finely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge|author= Haviland, William A.|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0534624873|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the last Ice Age about 10,000 years ago is taken as the end point of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and the beginning of the [[Epipaleolithic]] / [[Mesolithic]]. The Mesolithic technology included the use of [[microliths]] as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools.

The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the [[Neolithic]] period. During this period, polished [[stone tool]]s were made from a variety of hard rocks such as [[flint]], [[jade]], [[jadeite]], and [[Greenschist|greenstone]], largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunneling underground, the first steps in mining technology. The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared. These stone axes were used alongside a continued use of stone tools such as a range of [[Projectile point|projectiles]], knives, and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], as well as tools, made organic materials such as wood, bone, and antler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Zsuzsanna|last1=Tóth | editor1-first=Alexandra |editor1-last=Anders | editor2-first=Zsuzsanna |editor2-last=Siklósi | year=2012 | title=Bone, Antler, and Tusk tools of the Early Neolithic Körös Culture | contribution=The First Neolithic Sites in Central/South-East European Transect, Volume III: The Körös Culture in Eastern Hungary | page= | location=Oxford | publisher=BAR International Series 2334 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone Age cultures developed [[Prehistoric music|music]] and engaged in organized [[Prehistoric warfare|warfare]]. Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy [[outrigger canoe]] technology, leading to [[History of Papua New Guinea|migration]] across the [[Malay archipelago]], across the Indian Ocean to [[Madagascar]] and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and [[celestial navigation]].

Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence. Such evidence includes ancient tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lovgren|first1=Stefan|title=Ancient Tools Unearthed in Siberian Arctic|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0114_040114_siberianhumans.html|website=National Geographic News|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cave painting]]s, and other [[prehistoric art]], such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of [[mummy|mummies]]. Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology.

=== Ancient ===
{{Main|Ancient technology}}

==== Copper and bronze Ages ====
{{Main|Bronze Age}}

[[File:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|thumb|upright|A late [[Bronze Age sword]] or dagger blade]]

Metallic copper occurs on the surface of weathered copper ore deposits and copper was used before copper [[smelting]] was known.  Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery [[kiln]]s allowed sufficiently high temperatures.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields [[arsenical bronze]], which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;  [[Bronze]] is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze to became widespread. (See: [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]) [[Bronze]] was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects.  

Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.  Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC|location= New York|isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better ships enabled long distance trade and the advance of civilization. 
   
This technological trend apparently began in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and spread outward over time. These developments were not, and still are not, universal. The [[three-age system]] does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of [[Eurasia]], and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the [[Spinifex People]], the [[Sentinelese people|Sentinelese]], and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology.

==== Iron Age ====
{{Main|Iron Age}}
[[File:Axe of iron from Swedish Iron Age, found at Gotland, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright=.6|An [[axe]]head made of iron, dating from the Swedish [[Iron Age]]]]
Before iron smelting was developed the only iron was obtained from meteorites and is usually identified by having nickel content.  [[Meteoric iron]] was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks.

The '''[[Iron age]]''' involved the adoption of iron [[bloomery|smelting]] technology. It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents. The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores. Consequently, iron was produced in many areas. 

It was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.  Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.  [[Steel]] could be produced by [[forging]] bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous.

In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case.

In Europe, large [[hill fort]]s were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements. In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged. The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population.

==== Egyptians ====
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. Egyptian society made significant advances during dynastic periods in areas such as astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. They also made paper and monuments. The Egyptians made significant advances in shipbuilding. Astronomy was used by Egyptian leaders to govern people.

==== Indus Valley ====
The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Indus Valley construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation.

==== Mesopotamians ====
The peoples of [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkad (region)|Akkadians]], [[Assyria]]ns, and [[Babylonia]]ns) have been credited with the invention of the [[wheel]], but this is no longer certain. They lived in cities from c. 4000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;JN Postgate, ''Early Mesopotamia'', Routledge (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and developed a sophisticated architecture in mud-brick and stone,&lt;ref&gt;See entries under [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the true arch. The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a [[Wonder of the World]]. They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north. Their palaces had sophisticated drainage systems.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013&gt;S Dalley, ''The Mystery of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon'', Oxford University Press(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was invented in Mesopotamia, using the [[cuneiform]] script. Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived. These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary. By 1200&amp;nbsp;BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece. The Assyrian King [[Sennacherib]] (704–681&amp;nbsp;BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screws, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the 'lost wax' process.&lt;ref name=Dalley2013/&gt; The Jerwan Aqueduct (c. 688&amp;nbsp;BC) is made with stone arches and lined with waterproof concrete.&lt;ref&gt;T Jacobsen and S Lloyd, ''Sennacherib's Aqueduct at Jerwan'', Chicago University Press, (1935)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] spanned 800 years. They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.&lt;ref&gt;CBF Walker, ''Astronomy before the telescope,'' British Museum Press, (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chinese ====
The Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismometer|seismological detectors]], matches, [[paper]], sliding calipers, the double-action piston pump, [[cast iron]], the iron plough, the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the wheelbarrow, the [[suspension bridge]], the parachute, natural gas as fuel, the [[compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the propeller, the [[crossbow]], the [[South Pointing Chariot]] and [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period include [[block printing]], [[movable type|movable type printing]], phosphorescent paint, endless power [[chain drive]] and the clock escapement mechanism. The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[gunpowder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent [[Treasure voyages|large fleets]] on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa.

==== Greek ====
[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[aeolipile]], the earliest steam-powered device]]

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers [[Ancient Greek technology|were responsible for myriad inventions and improvements to existing technology]]. The [[Hellenistic period]], in particular, saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and its close association with the adjacent [[museion]]. In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as [[Archimedes]], [[Philo of Byzantium]], [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]], [[Ctesibius]], and [[Archytas]] remain known by name to posterity.

Ancient Greek innovations were particularly pronounced in mechanical technology, including the ground-breaking invention of the [[watermill]] which constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the [[sail]]). Apart from their pioneering use of waterpower, Greek inventors were also the first to experiment with wind power (see [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s windwheel) and even created the earliest steam engine (the [[aeolipile]]), opening up entirely new possibilities in harnessing natural forces whose full potential would not be exploited until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The newly devised right-angled [[gear]] and [[screw]] would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices. That is when the age of mechanical devices started.

[[File:Overshot water wheel schematic.svg|thumb|left|The compartmented water-wheel, here its overshot version, was invented in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic times]].]]

Ancient agriculture, as in any period prior to the modern age the primary mode of production and subsistence, and its irrigation methods, were considerably advanced by the invention and widespread application of a number of previously unknown water-lifting devices, such as the vertical [[water-wheel]], the compartmented wheel, the water [[turbine]], [[Archimedes' screw]], the bucket-chain and pot-garland, the [[force pump]], the [[suction pump]], the double-action [[piston pump]] and quite possibly the [[chain pump]].&lt;ref name="Lewis 2000 356f."&gt;{{Cite book

In music, the [[water organ]], invented by Ctesibius and subsequently improved, constituted the earliest instance of a [[keyboard instrument]]. In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow [[Water clock|clepsydra]] and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a [[feedback|feedback system]] and the [[escapement]] mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra.

The famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], a kind of analogous computer working with a [[differential gear]], and the [[astrolabe]] both show great refinement in astronomical science.

Greek engineers were also the first to devise [[automata]] such as [[vending machine]]s, suspended ink pots, automatic [[washstand]]s, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured many new useful mechanisms such as the [[cam]] and [[gimbal]]s.

In other fields, ancient Greek inventions include the [[catapult]] and the [[gastraphetes]] crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the [[dioptra]] for surveying, in infrastructure the [[lighthouse]], [[central heating]], the [[Tunnel of Eupalinos|tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations]], the [[Diolkos|ship trackway]], the [[dry dock]], and plumbing. In horizontal, vertical and transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the [[crane (machine)|crane]], the [[winch]], the [[wheelbarrow]] and the [[odometer]].

Further newly created techniques and items were [[List of ancient spiral stairs|spiral staircases]], the [[chain drive]], [[caliper|sliding calipers]] and [[shower]]s.

==== Roman ====
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]

The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stone masonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[reservoir]]s and [[dam]]s, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day.

==== Inca, Maya, and Aztec ====
The engineering skills of the [[Inca]] and the [[Mayans]] were great, even by today's standards. An example of this great engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks. Inca villages used irrigation canals and [[drainage]] systems, making agriculture very efficient. While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of [[hydroponics]], their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced.

Though the [[Maya civilization]] did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint. Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology. The Maya are also responsible for creating the first pressurized water system in Mesoamerica, located in the Maya site of [[Palenque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amp.livescience.com/5959-ancient-mayans-fountains-toilets.html|title=Ancient Mayans Likely Had Fountains and Toilets|date=December 23, 2009|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contribution of the [[Aztec]] rule was a system of communications between the conquered cities and the ubiquity of the ingenious agricultural technology of [[chinampas]]. In [[Mesoamerica]], without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations. The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inhereted many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the [[Olmec]] (see [[Native American inventions and innovations]]).

=== Medieval to early modern ===
One of the most significant development of the Medieval era was the development of economies where water and wind power were more significant than animal and human muscle power.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"&gt;{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=0-8129-7233-3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}} Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.  Water power was also used for blowing air in [[blast furnace]], pulping rags for paper making and for felting wool.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' recorded 5,624 water mills in Great Britain in 1086, being about one per thirty families.&lt;ref name="Stark_2005"/&gt;

As earlier empires had done, the Muslim [[caliphate]]s united in trade large areas that had previously traded little. The conquered sometimes paid lower taxes than in their earlier independence, and ideas spread even more easily than goods. Peace was more frequent than it had been. These conditions fostered improvements in agriculture and other technology as well as in sciences which largely adapted from earlier Greek, Roman and Persian empires, with improvements.

==== Medieval Europe ====

[[File:Trebuchet.jpg|thumb|Medieval [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchet]] (reconstruction)]]

{{Main|Medieval technology}}

While medieval technology has been long depicted as a step backwards in the evolution of Western technology, sometimes willfully so by modern authors intent on denouncing the church as antagonistic to scientific progress (see e.g. [[Myth of the Flat Earth]]), a generation of medievalists around the American historian of science [[Lynn White]] stressed from the 1940s onwards the innovative character of many medieval techniques. Genuine medieval contributions include for example [[mechanical clock]]s, [[spectacles]] and vertical [[windmill]]s. Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the [[watermark]] or the [[push button|functional button]]. In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent [[age of exploration]] was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon [[rudder]]s, [[lateen sail]]s, the [[dry compass]], the horseshoe and the [[astrolabe]].

Significant advances were also made in military technology with the development of [[plate armour]], steel [[crossbow]]s, [[trebuchet|counterweight trebuchets]] and [[cannon]]. The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the [[rib vault]] and [[arch|pointed arch]] gave rise to the high rising [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'.

[[Papermaking]], a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Timeline: 8th century|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|website=Oxford reference|publisher=HistoryWorld|accessdate=9 April 2015|doi=10.1093/acref/9780191735516.timeline.0001|doi-broken-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Safita|first1=Neathery|title=A Brief History Of Paper.|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Renaissance technology ====
{{Main|Renaissance technology}}
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|left|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

Due to the casting of cannon, the [[blast furnace]] came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century.  The blast furnace had been used in China since the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, NY |isbn= 978-0879513979|page=69| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the movable cast metal type [[printing press]], whose pressing mechanism was adapted from an olive screw press, (c. 1441) lead to a tremendous increase in the number of books and the number of titles published.  Movable ceramic type had been used in China for a few centuries and woodblock printing dated back even further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=}}Based on the works of Joseph Needham&lt;/ref&gt;

The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perceptivity]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied. Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of [[Ancient Rome]], and men like [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] created the large dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] as a result. He was awarded one of the first [[patent]]s ever issued in order to protect an ingenious [[crane (machine)|crane]] he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure. Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the [[cross-bow]] and ever more powerful [[artillery]], as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another. Powerful families like the [[Medici]] were strong patrons of the arts and sciences. [[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.

==== Age of Exploration ====
{{Main|Age of Exploration}}

An improved sailing ship, the (nau or [[carrack]]), enabled the [[Age of Exploration]] with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], epitomized by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[New Atlantis]]''. Pioneers like [[Vasco da Gama]], [[Pedro Álvares Cabral|Cabral]], [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland. They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence. Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the [[History of longitude|problem of longitude]] and the absence of accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]. European powers rediscovered the idea of the [[civil code]], lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks.

====Pre-Industrial Revolution====
The [[stocking frame]], which was invented in 1598, increased a knitter's number of knots per minute from 100 to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mines were becoming increasingly deep and were expensive to drain with horse powered bucket and chain pumps and wooden piston pumps. Some mines used as many as 500 horses. Horse-powered pumps were replaced by the [[Thomas Savery#First steam engine mechanism|Savery steam pump]] (1698) and the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen steam engine]] (1712).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Industrial Revolution]] is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, [[mining]], [[metallurgy]] and [[transport]] the [[steam engine]] and the invention of [[machine tool]]s.

Before invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done the spinning wheel and weaving done on a hand and foot operated loom. It took from three to five spinners to supply one weaver.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first= David. S.|year= 1969|publisher =Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|location= Cambridge, NY|isbn=  978-0521094184|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Ayres| first = Robert | title =Technological Transformations and Long Waves| year = 1989 |page= | url = http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/RR-89-001.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the [[flying shuttle]] in 1733 doubled the output of a weaver, creating a shortage of spinners. The [[spinning frame]] for wool was invented in 1738. The [[spinning jenny]], invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread. The [[water frame]] patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny. The [[spinning mule]], patented in 1779 by [[Samuel Crompton]], produced a high quality thread.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres_1989"/&gt; The [[power loom]] was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.&lt;ref name="Landes_1969"/&gt;

In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Tylecote_1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R. F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolution was driven by cheap energy in the form of [[coal]], produced in ever-increasing amounts from the abundant resources of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Coal converted to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] fueled higher temperature [[blast furnace]]s and produced [[cast iron]] in much larger amounts than before, allowing the creation of a  range of structures such as [[The Iron Bridge]]. Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power. The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased. The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title='The Mechanical Age': technology, innovation and industrialisation|url=https://eastanglia.academia.edu/EmmaGriffin/Books|work=Short History of the British Industrial Revolution|publisher=Palgrave|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam engine]] which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both [[steamboat]] and [[railway]] transportation. The [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the [[Rocket locomotive]] of [[Robert Stephenson]] being one of its first working [[steam locomotive|locomotives]] used.

Manufacture of ships' pulley [[Block and tackle|blocks]] by all-metal machines at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in 1803 instigated the age of sustained [[mass production]]. [[Machine tools]] used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by [[Richard Roberts (engineer)|Richard Roberts]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]]. The development of [[interchangeable parts]] through what is now called the [[American system of manufacturing]] began in the firearms industry at the U.S Federal arsenals in the early 19th century, and became widely used by the end of the century.

=== Second Industrial Revolution (1860s–1914) ===
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Stephenson's Rocket.jpg|thumb|left|The preserved ''Rocket'']]

The 19th century saw astonishing developments in transportation, construction, manufacturing and communication technologies originating in Europe. After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until [[World War I]]. It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research.

[[Telegraphy]] developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Visible Hand: The Management Revolution in American Business |last=Chandler Jr. |first= Alfred D. |year= 1993|publisher =Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0674940529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first [[telephone]]. March 1876 marks the date that Alexander Graham Bell officially patented his version of an "electric telegraph". Although Bell is noted with the creation of the telephone, it is still debated about who actually developed the first working model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-greatest-inventions-of-the-19th-century.php|title=Top 10 Greatest Inventions of the 19th Century |date=2010-08-09|work=Toptenz.net|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on improvements in vacuum pumps and materials research, [[incandescent light bulb]]s became practical for general use in the late 1870s. This invention had a profound effect on the workplace because factories could now have second and third shift workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology|last=Nye |first=David E.|authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher= The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA and London, England |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoe production was mechanized during the mid 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Path to Mechanized Shoe Production in the United States|last=Thomson |first= Ross |authorlink= |year= 1989|publisher =University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807818671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production of [[sewing machine]]s and [[agricultural machinery]] such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="hounshell-1984"/&gt;

Steam-powered factories became widespread, although the conversion from water power to steam occurred in England before in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730–1930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ironclad warship]]s were found in battle starting in the 1860s, and played a role in the opening of Japan and China to trade with the West.

=== 20th century ===

[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|[[Apollo 11|Landing on the Moon]]]]

20th-century technology developed rapidly. Broad teaching and implementation of the [[scientific method]], and increased research spending contributed to the advancement of modern science and technology. New technology improved communication and transport, thus spreading technical understanding.

[[Mass production]] brought [[automobile]]s and other high-tech goods to masses of consumers. [[Military research]] and development sped advances including electronic [[computing]] and [[jet engine]]s. [[Radio]] and [[telephony]] improved greatly and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until [[mobile phones]] became affordable to [[developing world]] residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

Energy and engine technology improvements included [[nuclear power]], developed after the [[Manhattan project]] which heralded the new [[Atomic Age]]. [[Rocket]] development led to long range missiles and the first [[space age]] that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.

[[Electrification]] spread rapidly in the 20th century. At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the [[World Wide Web]] was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfordevelopment.com/2014/11/rural-electrification-by-numbers-1970_2.html|title=Two Billion People Gain Electricity Access: 1970–2010|website=www.energyfordevelopment.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rural developing world.

[[Birth control]] also became widespread during the 20th century. [[Electron microscopes]] were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in [[genetic engineering]].

The first "[[test tube baby]]" [[Louise Brown]] was born in 1978, which led to the first successful [[gestational surrogacy]] pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]] in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg. [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990. These procedures have become relatively common.

The massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the [[Human Genome Project]] and the [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]] led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for [[Tim Berners-Lee]] to create the [[World Wide Web]].

[[Vaccination]] spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources.

The US [[National Academy of Engineering]], by expert vote, established the following ranking of the most important technological developments of the 20th century:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century|url=http://www.greatachievements.org/|website=greatachievements.org|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century ===

[[File:NASA Mars Rover.jpg|thumb|The [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have provided huge amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original lifespan estimates.]]

{{Main|2000s in science and technology}}

In the early 21st century research is ongoing into [[quantum computers]], [[gene therapy]] (introduced 1990), [[3D printing]] (introduced 1981), [[nanotechnology]] (introduced 1985), [[bioengineering]]/[[biotechnology]], [[nuclear technology]], [[Materials science|advanced materials]] (e.g., graphene), the [[scramjet]] and [[Unmanned combat air vehicle|drones]] (along with [[railgun]]s and high-energy laser beams for military uses), [[superconductivity]], the [[memristor]], and green technologies such as [[alternative fuel]]s (e.g., [[fuel cells]], self-driving electric and plug-in hybrid cars), [[augmented reality]] devices and [[wearable electronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and more efficient and powerful [[LEDs]], [[solar cells]], [[integrated circuits]], [[wireless power]] devices, engines, and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].

Perhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the largest single machine ever built. The understanding of [[particle physics]] is expected to expand with better instruments including larger [[particle accelerator]]s such as the LHC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Largest Science Experiment comes to Northern Ireland|url=https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|website=Science &amp; Technology Facilities Council|accessdate=9 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413064023/https://www.stfc.ac.uk/2668.aspx|archivedate=13 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and better [[neutrino detector]]s. [[Dark matter]] is sought via underground detectors and observatories like [[LIGO]] have started to detect [[gravitational wave]]s.

Genetic engineering technology continues to improve, and the importance of [[epigenetics]] on development and inheritance has also become increasingly recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov/cover|title=DNA Is Not Destiny: The New Science of Epigenetics |publisher=DiscoverMagazine.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[spaceflight]] technology and [[spacecraft]] are also being developed, like the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] and [[Dragon V2|Dragon]]. New, more capable [[Space observatory|space telescopes]], such as the [[James Webb Space Telescope|James Webb Telescope]], to be launched to orbit in early 2021, and the [[Extremely large telescope#Colossus Telescope|Colossus Telescope]] are being designed. The [[International Space Station]] was completed in the 2000s, and [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] plan a [[manned mission to Mars]] in the 2030s. The [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket]] (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.

[[Breakthrough Initiatives]], together with famed physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], plan to send [[Breakthrough Starshot|the first ever spacecraft to visit another star]], which will consist of numerous super-light chips driven by [[Electric propulsion]] in the 2030s, and receive images of the [[Proxima Centauri]] system, along with, possibly, the [[List of potentially habitable exoplanets|potentially habitable planet]] [[Proxima Centauri b]], by midcentury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2004 saw the [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|first manned commercial spaceflight]] when [[Mike Melvill]] crossed the [[boundary of space]] on June 21, 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1974">'''Horticultural botany''' is the study of the [[botany]] of current and potential cultivated [[plant]]s, with emphasis on the [[ornamental plant]]s of [[horticulture]], by a horticultural botanist or [[plantsman|''plantsman''—plantsperson]]." 

==Horticultural botanists==
Professional horticultural [[botanist]]s are employed by [[botanical garden]]s, large [[Plant nursery|plant nurseries]], university departments, and government agencies. The activities vary according to the mission goals and priorities of the institutions. 
:Duties can include: 
*searching for new plants suitable for cultivation (''plant hunting''), 
*communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and [[botanical nomenclature]] of cultivated plants, 
*carrying out original research on these topics: 
**describing the cultivated plants and their history of particular regions in [[horticultural flora]]s,  
**recording new plant introductions; 
*maintaining [[database]]s of cultivated plants; 
*curating horticultural [[herbarium|herbaria]], including collections of dried specimens and images; 
*contributing to the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]''. 

==Taxonomy of cultivated plants==
Perhaps the single major concern of horticultural botanists has been the [[taxonomy of cultivated plants]] and so, at the present time, many horticultural botanists will be members if the ''International Association of Cultivated Plant Taxonomy'' which was established in 2007.

The '''house energy rating''' (HER) is a standard measure of comparison by which one can evaluate the [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of a new or an existing [[building]]. The comparison is generally done for energy requirements for [[heating]] and [[cooling]] of indoor space. The energy is the main criterion considered by any international building energy rating scheme but there are some other important factors such as production of greenhouse gases emission, indoor environment quality, cost efficiency and thermal comfort, which are considered by some schemes. Basically, the energy rating of a residential building provides detailed information on the energy consumption and the relative energy efficiency of the building. Hence, HERs inform consumers about the relative energy efficiency of homes and encourage them to use this information in making their house purchase decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kordjamshidi|first=Maria|author-link=Maria kordjamshidi|title=House rating schemes|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many energy rating tools by which one can calculate the energy performance of a building. Basically all these tools involve a numerical description or prepare a computer-based model for the rating of a building against standard occupancy and activity templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy and Building | pages = 249–254 | first=Patxi.| last=Hernandez| year=2008| title=Development of energy performance benchmarks and building energy ratings for non-domestic buildings: An example for Irish primary schools | doi= 10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.02.020 | last2= Burke | first2= Kevin | last3= Lewis | first3= J. Owen | volume= 40 | issue= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, HERS uses a computer-simulation based methods for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings under standard conditions and its potential for improvement.

==House energy rating scheme==
HERS is a standardized scheme for evaluation of a home's energy efficiency and expected energy costs.Basically a HERS represents the guideline of a House energy rating. In all countries, HERS show variations in objectives, assessment methodologies &amp; measurement criteria but after all this variation, the goal of all HERS is approximately same and these generate the output in same way.

===HERS outputs===
Basically HERS generates three types of outputs&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy  , Pages: 339-354 | first=Jeff Ross| last=Stein| year=2000| title=Accuracy of home energy rating systems | doi= 10.1016/S0360-5442(99)00072-9 | last2= Meier | first2= Alan | volume= 25 | issue= 4 | pages= 339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 Rating score.
* 2 Energy use/Cost prediction.
* 3 Recommendations.  
&lt;br /&gt;
# Rating Scores: The energy performance rating is a type of energy assessment how efficiently the buildings use energy, relative to similar buildings. The performance scores use generally a scale ranging from 0 to 100 or 1 to 5 stars. The value of score is based on the comparison made between the rated house and a reference house that meets a desired energy code or standards.A rating of 50 indicates average energy performance, while a rating of 75 or more indicates best performance. More the score obtained by a house more will be the energy efficiency of the house and the high rating scores have many direct applications, such as it permits a buyer to quality for more mortgage comparatively.
# Energy use/Cost prediction:HERS generate [[energy use]] and cost predictions for specific end uses like s heating/cooling, hot water and for whole house. These outputs are obtained in absolute measures and unlike to score rating these outputs can be used to compare houses like that of miles-per-gallon ratings are used to compare the cars.
# Recommendations:HERS can produce a list of recommended improvements based on some life cycle's effective cost analysis. These recommendations may be pertaining to any of the inefficient components of a building i.e. insulation layer in the composite wall of building, air conditioning equipment, water heating unit, Double-glazed windows, etc.

==HERS types==
As per the national energy policies, the HERS are known by different names in different countries. The implementation and promotion of HERS in a country depends upon the national energy policy. Beside all this, the aim of all HERS is almost same and it can be classified into three types.
# Perspective HERS : This HERS provides minimum standards for the materials, equipments and methods of efficient design and construction that must be met to qualify for an energy efficiency rating. 
# Calculation based HERS: This HERS uses computer based modeling for the prediction of energy performance relative to the requirements/standards.
# Performance based HERS:In this HERS, the energy efficiency of building is checked by comparing the actual energy consumption data against the set standards.

==Need for HERS==
Increase in [[population]], [[Economic issues]] are the some factors which have escalated the energy demand across the world. In [[developed countries]], the growth rate of energy consumption rate is 1.1%/year while in [[developing countries]] the energy consumption growth rate approximately 3 time to that of developed countries. Beside this high growth in energy consumption it also causes to increase the production of [[green house gases]] to the [[atmosphere]]. The increase in demand of energy, limited resource of convention energy sources, hike in conventional fuel prices, [[global warming]] are some important factors which Impetus us to adopt energy saving techniques and alternative sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy and buildings , Pages: 897-905| first=Guy R.| last=Newsham| year=2009| title=Do [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified buildings save energy? Yes, but. | doi= 10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014 | last2= Mancini | first2= Sandra | last3= Birt | first3= Benjamin J. | volume= 41 | issue= 8 | pages= 897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building sector consumes one third of world's resources. Building currently shares approximately 40% of energy in most of the countries and are considered among the largest end-use sector. As per [[International energy agency]] (IEA) [[world energy consumption]] and green house gases level is going to increase rapidly every year. IEA recognize the building sector as one of the most cost effective sector where energy consumption can be reduced . It is estimated that the energy consumption can be reduced to 1509 million tonnes of equivalent (Mtoe) and at the same time it will cause to reduce the green house gases production up to 12.6 gigatonnes(Gt) by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/buildings_certification.pdf Energy performance certification of buildings&lt;/ref&gt; The international energy outlook report reveals that the energy consumption is increasing in each year and the energy increment trends are shown in fig. 1[[File:World market past, present and future energy consumption scenario.png|thumb|right|Worlds past, present and future energy consumption scenario]].

So, we conclude that the building sector is one of the largest sector where energy consumption and green house gases emission can be reduced effectively by improving the energy efficiency of buildings and hence HERS can play a vital role in achieving all this.

==In different countries==
=== Australia ===
[[Star (classification)|Five star]] is the first house-rating scheme of [[Australia]], which was developed in 1980 by the GMI council of Australia. This scheme was basically based on the three basic elements, glass, mass and insulation of [[dwelling]]. Due to many limitation this system get failed in attaining popularity and in 1990s they develop Victorian scheme. This scheme attains some popularity but it was also not suitable for all climate of Australia.In 1993 a more flexible HERE, known by Graded five star rating system was developed. This rating scheme was much flexible and was suitable to all climatic conditions of Australia. Presently there are different HERS available in Australia which are used in different state of this country.Some of HERS used in this country are :
* NatHERS[[File:NatHERS.jpg|thumb|right|Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme]]
* AccuRate
* FirstRate
* Quick Rate 
* BERS
* Q Rare

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], the first national program for energy efficiency in buildings (HERS), PROCEL EDIFICA was developed in 2003.The use of this rating scheme was extended to public and commercial sector in 2007 and from 2012 the operational rating is mandatory for both residential and commercial buildings. The rating system consist of a scale ranging from A to E basis, where A represent the most efficient and E represent the least efficient rating. The rating scheme consider three aspects of buildings;
*1) Building envelop thermal performance
*2) Lighting system efficiency
*3) Installed power and air conditioning system efficiency
The three groups are evaluate individually and the combined results of these indicates the level of efficiency of a building.

===Canada===
Home energy ratings in [[Canada]] have been in existence since 1997. The two government energy rating programs in Canada are
* Ener Guide for houses (EGH) 
* Ener guide for new houses (EGNH)
Both of these programs use HOT2XP and HOT 2000 as their rating tools.
Beside the aforesaid government rating programs in Canada, there are two standard bases are available for evaluating the building are;
*1) R-2000: as per this rating, 80-85 points are needed to meet Canadian specification code. 
*2) Model national energy code of Canada (MNECB): as per this rating, 70-75 points are needed to meet Canadian specification code.  
* Other HERS in Canada 
LEED is used in Canada as one of home rating scheme. This rating scheme is an adaption of the US green building council’s LEED and has been modified as per the Canadian climate, construction and regulation policies.

===[[China]]===
In China, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) develop a national building energy rating and labeling HERS in 2008. This HERS is mandatory for government buildings, big commercial complexes and those buildings applying for public retrofit funding or green label. this HERS consist a star rating scheme, ranging from 1 to 5 star. As per this HERS, more the star, more will be the energy efficiency of the building. The rating level of buildings is determined in three parameters;
*1) Basic Items : refers to the regulated energy use per square meter, obtained by [[computer modeling]] or measurements.
*2) Required Items : refers to minimum performance requirements for building envelop and Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC).
*3) Optional Items : refers to the additional energy management system which are not mandatory in the rating scheme. it covers, the application of [[renewable energy]], innovative energy efficient technologies.

===[[Denmark]]===
In Denmark, the energy rating scheme are in existence since 1981. Denmark is the first country in Europe(EU) to begin issuing Energy Performance certificates (EPCs). The EPCs are mandatory in all types of buildings in Denmark. The rating system in Denmark includes three parts.
# The first part of rating consists reports on water consumption, energy consumption and GHGs emission per year, which are compared against a standard building of same type on a scale ranging from A1-C5.
# Second part of the system, proposes the different possible ways for saving of energy and water consumption with respect to the cost involved
# This part of report provides the present state of buildings in term of size, heating system, energy usage and the cost of energy and heating.

===France===
In France, "Diagnostic de performance energetique" (DPE) is used as HERS. This scheme was developed in November 2006 and in July 2007 its use becomes mandatory for all those buildings whose registration had been filed after 1 July 2007. This rating scheme consist of two types of measurements.
* Energy consumption 
* Greenhouse gas emission
Both of the measurements comprises 7-label ratings, ranging from A (best) to G (worst) which are presented by the color coding. In ratings, the green color represents A and red color represents G label. In both cases of measurements, the buildings are evaluated in terms of necessary resource for heating, hot water production and air conditioning. The PDE of a building remains valid for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://uniondesconsommateurs.ca/docu/energie/EEratingHouses.pdf FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY(EE):A HomeEnergy Rating System&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], the building energy ratings are in existence since 2007. In this country Building Energy Rating (BER) is used as EPC.  The scheme was mandatory for new dwelling and in 2008, its use was extended to non-residential and public buildings, in 2009 the HERS cover the all types of buildings.  BER is a calculation based HERS.  Due to transparency in this HERS, there is a more awareness among the people and is accepted widely.

===Portugal===
In [[Portugal]], the EPCs scheme was launched in July 2007 and was implemented for new buildings. The use of this scheme was extended to existing buildings in January 2009. This rating scheme covers mainly the indoor air quality and energy performance of the buildings. This rating scheme is also a calculation based HERS. The compliance in the country is high and the EPC is issued only when 90% of building completion and transaction observed. There is a national database who covers all EPCs registration record and this is available for all countrymen.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] (UK) is one of the countries where HERS has been developed and implemented strongly from a very long time ago. In UK, Currently National Home Energy Rating (NHER) scheme is used widely. NHER scheme measure the [[thermal efficiency]] of the dwellings on a scale of 0-10 in terms of energy running cost. The dwelling rating is done through computer modeling which uses a computer program based on Building Research Establishment Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM). Basically NHER measure the energy efficiency of dwellings as a function of energy cost per square meter.The energy usage is calculated by considering the all aspects of buildings (location, design, construction, water heating, cooking, ventilation and appliances, lighting etc.) and for dwelling energy rating it use some standard assumptions, such as occupancy scenario, thermostat setting, occupant stay timings.

===United States===
In the US, HERS are since 1980s.  Among the various HERS energy rated homes of America is used widely.  It is used in more than 18 states of US.  This scheme uses a 100 points scale of efficiency and it is further divided into 10 categories of star rating which ranges from [[Star (classification)|one star]] to [[Star (classification)|five star]] plus. In this rating scheme a higher star rated house represents higher energy efficiency of the house. [[File:Energy star.jpg|thumb|right|ENERGY STAR]] 
The energy efficiency rating in this HERS represents the predicted energy consumption, represents the form of normalized annual energy consumption. This rating scheme consist a detailed measure of CFLs, water heater tanks, ceiling, floors and pipe [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], efficient refrigerator and freezer, high efficient space and water heating equipments, air leakage and controls. 
The other important rating schemes used in US are.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kordjamshidi|first=Maria|author-link=Maria kordjamshidi|title=House rating schemes:from energy to comfort base|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Green insect on hand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The "Spanish Fly", ''[[Lytta vesicatoria]]'' has been considered to have medicinal, [[aphrodisiac]], and other properties&lt;!--, though it contains an irritant chemical, [[cantharidin]], which is certainly toxic--&gt;.]]
'''Human interactions with insects''' include both a wide variety of uses, whether practical such as for food, textiles, and dyestuffs, or symbolic, as in art, music, and literature, and negative interactions including serious damage to crops and extensive efforts to eliminate insect pests. 

Academically, the interaction of insects and society has been treated in part as '''cultural entomology''', dealing mostly with "advanced" societies, and in part as '''ethnoentomology''', dealing mostly with "primitive" societies, though the distinction is weak and not based on theory. Both academic disciplines explore the parallels, connections and influence of [[insects]] on human populations, and vice versa. They are rooted in [[anthropology]] and [[natural history]], as well as [[entomology]], the study of insects. Other [[culture|cultural]] uses of insects, such as [[biomimicry]], do not necessarily lie within these academic disciplines.

More generally, people make a wide range of uses of insects, both practical and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The widespread use of [[insecticide]]s has failed to exterminate any [[insect pest]], but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.

Practical uses include [[entomophagy|as food]], [[Insects in medicine|in medicine]], for the valuable [[textile]] [[silk]], for [[dyestuff]]s such as [[carmine]], in science, where the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] is an important [[model organism]] in [[genetics]], and [[Entomological warfare|in warfare]], where insects were successfully used in the [[Second World War]] to spread disease in enemy populations. One insect, the [[honey bee]], provides [[honey]], [[pollen]], [[royal jelly]], [[propolis]] and an anti-inflammatory peptide, [[melittin]]; its larvae too are eaten in some societies. Medical uses of insects include [[maggot therapy]] for wound [[debridement]]. Over a thousand protein families have been identified in the saliva of blood-feeding insects; these may provide useful drugs such as anticoagulants, [[vasodilation|vasodilators]], [[antihistamine]]s and [[anaesthetic]]s.

Symbolic uses include roles [[Insects in art|in art]], [[Insects in music|in music]] (with [[List of insect-inspired songs|many songs featuring insects]]), [[Arthropods in film|in film]], [[Insects in literature|in literature]], [[Insects in religion|in religion]], and in mythology. Insect [[costume]]s are used in theatrical productions and worn for parties and carnivals.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by insects in human culture so defined.

===Cultural entomology and ethnoentomology===

[[File:Malay Archipelago Beetles.jpg|thumb|left|"[[The Malay Archipelago|Remarkable Beetles Found at Simunjon, Borneo]]": [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was a pioneer of ethnoentomology.]]

Ethnoentomology developed from the 19th century with early works by authors such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1852) and [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1862). [[Hans Zinsser]]'s "classic" ''[[Rats, Lice and History]]'' (1935) showed that insects were an important force in human history. Writers like [[William Morton Wheeler]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and [[Jean Henri Fabre]] described insect life and  communicated their meaning to people "with imagination and brilliance". Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy, and showed a positive aspect of insects. [[Food]] is the most studied topic in ethnoentomology, followed by [[medicine]] and [[beekeeping]].&lt;ref name=Posey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posey |first1=Darrell Addison |title=Topics And Issues In Ethnoentomology With Some Suggestions For The  Development Of Hypothesis-Generation And Testing In Ethnobiology |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=99–120 |url=https://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801192909/http://ethnobiology.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/JoE/6-1/Posey1986.pdf |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crop Duster.jpg|thumb|upright|Fighting insects: an [[agricultural aircraft]] applies low-[[insecticide]] bait to kill [[western corn rootworm]]s.]]

In 1968, {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Schimitschek|de}} claimed cultural entomology as a branch of insect studies, in a review of the roles insects played in [[folklore]] and culture including [[religion]], food, medicine and the arts.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schimitschek |first=E. |title=Handbuch der Zoologie |year=1968 |publisher=Berliner Akademie Verlag|editor=Helmcke J.G. |editor2=Stark D. |editor3=Wermuth H. |chapter=Insekten als Nahrung, Brauchtum, Kult und Kultur |volume= 4 | pages=1–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Charles Hogue]] covered the field in English and from 1994 to 1997, Hogue's ''The Cultural Entomology Digest'' served as a forum on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogue|first=Charles|title=Cultural Entomology|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who? What? Why?|url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/who_what_why.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogue argued that "Humans spend their intellectual energies in three basic areas of activity: surviving, using practical learning (the application of technology); seeking pure knowledge through inductive mental processes (science); and pursuing enlightenment to taste a pleasure by aesthetic exercises that may be referred to as the "humanities." [[Entomology]] has long been concerned with survival ([[economic entomology]]) and scientific study (academic entomology), but the branch of investigation that addresses the influence of insects (and other terrestrial Arthropoda, including [[arachnids]] and [[myriapods]]) in literature, language, music, the arts, interpretive history, religion, and recreation has only become recognized as a distinct field through Schimitschek's work.&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schimitschek 1961"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schimitschek | first=E. | title=Die Bedeutung der Insekten für Kultur und Wirtschaft des Menschen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart | journal=Istanbul Universitesi | date= 1961 |volume= 908: | pages=1–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogue 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |date=January 1987|volume= 32 |pages=181–199 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.en.32.010187.001145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hogue set out the boundaries of the field by saying: "The narrative history of the science of entomology is not part of cultural entomology, while the influence of insects on general [[history]] would be considered cultural entomology."&lt;ref name="Hogue"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hogue |first=Charles |title=Cultural Entomology |url=http://www.insects.org/ced1/cult_ent.html |publisher=Cultural Entomology Digest |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Because the term "cultural" is narrowly defined, some aspects normally included in studies of human societies are excluded."&lt;ref name="Hogue"/&gt;

Darrell Addison Posey, noting that the boundary between cultural entomology and ethnoentomology is difficult to draw, cites Hogue as limiting cultural entomology to the influence of insects on "the essence of humanity as expressed in the arts and humanities". Posey notes further that cultural anthropology is usually restricted to the study of "advanced", industrialised, and literate societies, whereas ethnoentomology studies "the entomological concerns of 'primitive' or 'noncivilized' societies". Posey states at once that the division is artificial, complete with an unjustified us/them bias.&lt;ref name=Posey/&gt; Brian Morris similarly criticises the way that anthropologists treat non-Western attitudes to nature as monadic and spiritualist, and contrast this "in [[gnostic]] fashion" with a simplistic treatment of Western, often 17th century, mechanistic attitude. Morris considers this "quite unhelpful, if not misleading", and offers instead his own research into the multiple ways that the people of [[Malawi]] relate to insects and other animals: "pragmatic, intellectual, realist, practical, aesthetic, symbolic and sacramental."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and costs==

===Insect ecosystem services===
[[File:Honeybee (Apis mellifera) pollinating Avocado cv.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pollination]], here by a bee on an [[avocado]] crop, is an [[ecosystem service]].]]

The [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (MEA) report 2005 defines [[ecosystem services]] as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet is that a few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, [[ant]]s, [[mosquito]]es, and [[spider]]s).  However, insects offer [[ecological goods and services]].&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|title=Ecosystems and human well-being : synthesis|date=2005|publisher=Island Press|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.356.aspx.pdf|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1-59726-040-1|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xerces Society]] calculates the economic impact of four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. "the importance of bugs to [[hunting]], [[fishing]], and wildlife observation, including [[bird-watching]]"), dung burial, and [[biological pest control|pest control]]. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lyman Kirst |first=Marian |title=Insect – the neglected 99% |url=http://www.hcn.org/blogs/goat/insects-the-neglected-99-percent/ |accessdate=22 July 2012 |newspaper=High Country News |date=29 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the ant expert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward O.

Wilson]] observed: "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.O. |title=The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth |date=2006 |publisher=Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Nova (TV Series)]] segment on the American [[Public Broadcasting Service]] framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives&amp;nbsp;... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little Creatures Who Run the World|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2203crea.html|work=Nova|publisher=PBS Airdate: August 12, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated: "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the [[Asian tiger mosquito]] or the [[fire ant]], appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Higgins |first=Adrian |title=Saving Earth From the Ground Up |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/29/AR2007062902334.html |work=June 30, 2007 |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=22 July 2012 |date=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 can be regarded as serious [[pest insect|pest]]s, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including [[pollinator]]s such as bees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller G.T. |title=Sustaining the Earth |edition=6th |year=2004 |publisher=Thompson Learning |pages=211–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==

===As food===
{{main article|Entomophagy}}
[[File:Witchetty grub.jpg|thumb|left|[[Witchetty grub]]s were prized as food by [[Australian aborigine]]s.]]

[[Entomophagy]] is the eating of insects. Many insects are considered a culinary [[delicacy]] in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's ''Insects as Human Food'' (1951) drew attention to the scope and potential of entomophagy,  but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item.&lt;ref name="Meyer-Rochow 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyer-Rochow | first=Victor Benno | title=Can insects help to ease the problem of world food shortage? | journal= ANZAAS Journal: "Search"| date= 1975|volume= 6 |issue= 7 | pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer [[caterpillar]]s to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) &lt;ref name="Nyishi"&gt;Chakravorty, J., Ghosh, S., and V.B. Meyer-Rochow. (2011). Practices of entomophagy and entomotherapy by members of the Nyishi and Galo tribes, two ethnic groups of the state of Arunachal Pradesh (North-East India). ''Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 7(5)''&lt;/ref&gt; point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008).&lt;ref name="Laos"&gt;Meyer-Rochow V.B., Nonaka K., Boulidam S (2008) More feared than revered: Insects and their impacts on human societies (with specific data on the importance of entomophagy in a Laotian setting. ''Entomologie Heute 20: 3–25''&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, ant larvae and Corixid water boatman eggs are sought out as a form of [[caviar]] by gastronomes. In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug ''[[Lethocerus indicus]]''.&lt;ref name=GullanCranston2009/&gt;

{{main article|Insects in medicine}}

Insects have been used medicinally in cultures around the world, often according to the [[Doctrine of Signatures]].

Many people believe the urban myth that the daddy longlegs [[Opiliones]] have the most poisonous bite in the spider world, but that the fangs are too small to penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Just Plain Weird Stories |url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/spidermyth/myths/daddyvenom.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daddy Longleg myth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1DzkM0zqDQ |publisher=Myth Busters |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Brazilian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]], members of the [[Tupí–Guaraní]] language family have been observed using ''Pachycondyla commutata'' ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing the sting of ''Pseudomyrmex'' spp. for fevers and headaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Balée]] (2000), "Antiquity of Traditional Ethnobiological Knowledge in Amazonia: a Tupí–Guaraní Family and Time" ''Ethnohistory'' 47(2):399–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The red harvester ant ''[[Pogonomyrmex californicus]]'' has been widely used by natives of Southern California and Northern Mexico for hundreds of years in ceremonies conducted to help tribe members acquire spirit helpers through hallucination.  During the ritual, young men are sent away from the tribe and consume large quantities of live, unmasticated ants under the supervision of an elderly member of the tribe.  Ingestion of ants should lead to a prolonged state of unconsciousness, where dream helpers appear and serve as allies to the dreamer for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Groark.

Both the symbolic form and the actual body of insects have been used to adorn humans in ancient and modern times. A recurrent theme for ancient cultures in Europe and the Near East regarded the sacred image of a bee or human with insect features.  Often referred to as the bee "goddess",  these images were found in gems and stones. An onyx gem from [[Knossos]] (ancient Crete) dating to approximately 1500 BC illustrates a Bee goddess with bull horns above her head.  In this instance, the figure is surrounded by dogs with wings, most likely representing [[Hecate]] and [[Artemis]] – gods of the underworld, similar to the Egyptian gods Akeu and Anubis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gough |first=Andrew |title=The Bee Part 2 Beewildered |url=http://andrewgough.co.uk/bee2_1.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beetlewing]] art is an ancient craft technique using iridescent beetle wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. Beetlewing pieces are used as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of metallic wood-boring beetle wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to the genus [[Sternocera]].  The practice comes from across Asia and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, Myanmar, Japan, India and China.  In Thailand beetlewings were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewellery in former court circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Beetle-Wing Tea-Cosy |url=https://hampshireculturaltrust.org.uk/content/beetle-wing-tea-cosy |publisher=Hampshire Cultural Trust |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian entomologist [[C.H. Curran]]'s 1945 book, ''Insects of the Pacific World'', noted women from India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles of the species ''[[Chrysochroa ocellata]]'' as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, probably with a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rivers |first=Victoria |title=Beetles in Textiles |url=http://www.insects.org/ced2/beetles_tex.html |work=[[Cultural Entomology Digest]] February |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Butterflies]] have long inspired humans with their life cycle, color, and ornate patterns. The novelist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was also a renowned butterfly expert. He published and illustrated many butterfly species, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I discovered in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. Both were a form of magic, both were games of intricate enchantment and deception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Speak, Memory |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage International |location=New York |page=129 |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was the aesthetic complexity of insects that led Nabokov to reject [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahuja |first=Nitin |title=Nabokov's Case Against Natural Selection |journal=Tract |url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tract/nabokov.html |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nabokov |first=Vladimir |title=Strong Opinions |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist Ian MacRae writes of butterflies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the animal is at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet beautiful and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as "kaleidoscopic instabilities," "oxymoron of similarities," "rebellious rainbows," "visible darkness" and "souls of stone" have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories&amp;nbsp;... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In the natural history of the animal, we begin to sense its literary and artistic possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacRae |first=Ian |title=Butterfly Chronicles: Imagination and Desire in Natural &amp; Literary Histories |journal=Canadian Journal of Environ Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011, the artist Anna Collette created over 10,000 individual ceramic insects at [[Nottingham Castle]], "Stirring the Swarm." Reviews of the exhibit offered a compelling narrative for Cultural Entomology: "the unexpected use of materials, dark overtones, and the straightforward impact of thousands of tiny multiples within the space. The exhibition was at once both exquisitely beautiful and deeply repulsive, and this strange duality was fascinating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=French |first=Anneka |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/interface/reviews/single/1652788 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stirring the Swarm |url=http://download.cnet.com/Stirring-the-Swarm/3000-12511_4-75660244.html |accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s essay ''Butterflies'' analyses the treatment of the butterfly in [[Japanese literature]], both prose and poetry. He notes that these often allude to Chinese tales, such as of the young woman that the butterflies took to be a flower.

The honey bee played a central role in the cosmology of the [[Mayan people]]. The stucco figure at the temples of Tulum known as "Ah Mucen Kab" – the Diving Bee God – bears resemblance to the insect in the Codex Tro-Cortesianus identified as a bee.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8280">The '''International Center for Technology Assessment''' (ICTA) is a U.S. non-profit bi-partisan organization, based in [[Washington, D.C.]]. ICTA aims to provide the public with full assessments and analyses of technological impacts on society. ICTA explores the economic, ethical, social, environmental and political impacts that can result from the applications of technology or technological systems.

==Objectives of the Center==

ICTA seeks to assist the public and policy makers in better understanding how technology affects society.

===Nanotechnology===
ICTA lobbies for stronger regulation of [[nanotechnology]] through its Nanotechnology Project ''NanoAction''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoaction.org/nanoaction/index.cfm Introduction to NanoAction] NanoAction website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[implications of nanotechnology]] run the gamut from the [[Nanomedicine|medical]], ethical, mental, legal and environmental applications, to fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, computing, materials science, military applications, and communications. Nanotechnology is improving current techniques along with creating new tools and capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saini|first=Rajiv |author2=Saini, Santosh |author3=Sharma, Sugandha|title=Nanotechnology: The Future Medicine|journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=32–33|doi=10.4103/0974-2077.63301|pmid=20606992|pmc=2890134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration in 2007 decided that no special regulations or labeling of [[nanoparticles]] were required. "The consumer is being made the guinea pig", said George Kimbrell of the International Center for Technology Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/43305/story.htm FDA Says No New Labeling For Nanotech Products] 27-Jul-07, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, a coalition of over 40 [[civil society]] groups endorsed a statement of principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials |publisher=International Center for Technology Assessment |year=2008 |url=http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for [[Precautionary principle|precautionary action]] related to nanotechnology.  The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the International Center for Technology Assessment's report ''Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials''.&lt;ref name="JulyCTA07release"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Broad international coalition issues urgent call for strong oversight of nanotechnology| publisher = International Center for Technology Assessment| date = 2007-07-31| url = http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| accessdate = 2007-10-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065131/http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| archivedate = 2007-11-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

Among the projects that ICTA is working upon are ''Patent Watch'', an effort to put stricter ethical and public interest restrictions on patents.

ICTA is also concerned about some of the developments that are taking place in the area of [[Transhumanism|human biotechnology]]. ICTA warns that "a new eugenics age has begun".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icta.org/biotech/index.cfm Human Biotechnology: The Age of the "New Eugenics"] ICTA website&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, this refers to highly profit-driven areas of biotechnology such as [[genetic engineering]], [[genetic screening]], and [[cloning]].

ICTA, in collaboration with approximately 100 other organizations, including [[Friends of the Earth]] and the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]], have put forth a moratorium against [[synthetic biology]]. These organizations claim that “the technology could lead to environmental hazards of Frankensteinian proportions, including new strains of unstoppable invasive species and unpredictable hazards to human health.” They seek global regulation and [[biosafety]] measures on synthetic biology research and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/13/10672301-what-to-do-about-synthetic-life What to do about synthetic life? ] By Alan Boyle, Retrieved 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICTA also does a lot of work in the areas of [[corporate accountability]] and economics, trying to ensure the observance of ethical principles as part of business practices. Thus, ICTA is a founding member of the ''Center for Corporate Policy'' that works actively in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatepolicy.org/ Center for Corporate Policy] website&lt;/ref&gt;

ICTA contributes strongly to the areas of [[global warming]] and the environment. In particular, they are concerned about the modern threat to the environment of "biological pollution", such as the [[invasive species]]. Also, the introduction of [[genetically modified plants]] and [[:Genetically modified organism#Transgenic animals|animals]] is of concern. [[Pharming (genetics)|Crops engineered to produce pharmaceuticals (Pharming)]], or resist herbicides may well spread [[genetic pollution]] by cross-pollinating with weeds or other crops, and ICTA is actively addressing these issues.

==History==

ICTA was formed in 1994. Its executive director is consumer advocate Andrew Kimbrell. Its sister organization is the [[Center for Food Safety]].

In 2004, ICTA took an active part in [[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]], a leading Supreme Court of Canada case on patent rights for biotechnology. The case involved [[Percy Schmeiser]], a Saskatchewan canola farmer. Intervening on Schmeiser’s behalf were a consortium of six non-government organizations, among which was the International Center for Technology Assessment. Schmeiser lost the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=international_center_for_technology_assessment Canada’s Supreme Court Hears Percy Schmeiser’s Appeal], History Commons, January 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2004-01-19-schmeiser_x.htm Small farmer's fight becomes anti-biotech crusade] By Paul Elias, USA TODAY, 1/19/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Friends of the Earth]] and ICTA filed a formal petition with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for better monitoring and regulating of cosmetic and toiletry products containing [[nanoparticles]] and stated they would sue if the FDA does not take adequate action in 180 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keay Davidson|title=FDA urged to limit nanoparticle use in cosmetics and sunscreens|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/05/17/MNGFHIT1161.DTL|accessdate=2007-04-20|date=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jerzy Sikorski''' (born July 25, 1935) is a Polish historian, [[Copernicus|Copernicologist]], [[medievalist]], [[museologist]], author, publisher, journalist, and encyclopedist, who writes and publishes primarily in Polish.  He is a resident of [[Olsztyn]], Poland.

==Life==
===Early life===
Jerzy Sikorski was born on July 25, 1935 in [[Vilnius]] ([[Polish language|Polish]]: Wilno), to Anna Wołk-Lewanowicz (1914–1995) and Feliks Sikorski (1889–1980).  Five years later (1940) Sikorski's sister Maria Danuta was born.

In October 1944, during [[World War II]], Sikorski's mother Anna was arrested by the [[People's Commissariat for State Security]] along with 40 other people, when she was exposed as a courier between Vilnius' "Kedyw" and the general staff of the Polish [[Home Army]]. Early in January 1945 Sikorski's father Feliks was also arrested because he was a soldier of the 1st Polish Corps under the [[Poland|Polish]] general [[Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki]] in the ''Polish-Soviet War,'', but he was released after three months. Upon his release, Feliks made efforts to obtain Anna's release from prison, locate and take care of Jerzy and Maria, and reunite his family. Anna was released from prison camp in June 1946, and the family moved to Olsztyn. They chose Olsztyn based on the fact that most of the Vilnius board of education where Feliks once worked had been evacuated to Olsztyn, and Feliks could resume his position there.&lt;ref name=js2012&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2012). "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/biografia Biografia: Jerzy Sikorski – O Sobie]". ''www.jerzysikorski.pl'', Olsztyn. Accessed 2018-08-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Following World War II, Sikorski's mother was prevented from teaching due to political persecution. After Sikorski graduated from high school in 1953, he was repeatedly denied entry to university in spite of passing exams in [[Gdańsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Toruń]], and [[Poznań]]. Each time, he received the characteristic preprinted postcard with "not accepted due to lack of space".   On the advice of a Polish studies specialist teacher (Polish [[philologist]]), Janina Kirkicka, Sikorski was able to enroll in a two-year teacher's college in Olsztyn, but after two weeks the director Bolesław Wytrążek instructed Sikorski to leave the college, due the decision of the local [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) in [[Olsztyn]].  Through [[:pl:Hieronim_Skurpski|Hieronim Skurpski]], who was the director at the Museum of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]] located at [[Olsztyn Castle]], Sikorski obtained employment (1954–1955) at the [[:pl:Muzeum Mikołaja Kopernika we Fromborku|Nicolas Copernicus Museum in Frombork]], which was under the patronage of the regional museum in Olsztyn.  The work at Frombork’s museum and the person of the great Polish Astronomer [[Nicolas Copernicus]], who spent most of his life in Frombork and Warmia region, made a lasting impression on Sikorski. As a result, Copernicus and ''Copernicana'' research became the dominant subject in Sikorski's lifetime work and in his professional affiliations with various research centers. Ultimately, it led to Sikorski's discovery and publication of Copernicus' resting place at Frombork’s cathedral in 1973, which was confirmed archaeologically in 2005.

In the fall of 1955 Sikorski enrolled at the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń]], where he chose to study under professor [[:pl:Karol Górski|Karol Górski]], who among other scholarly pursuits studied and researched the life and politics of Copernicus' maternal uncle, Bishop [[Lucas Watzenrode]].&lt;ref name=gorski1973&gt;Górski Karol (1973). ''Łukasz Watzenrode. Życie i działalność polityczna (1447–1512).'' Wrocław 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sikorski wrote his master’s thesis on Watzenrode, and   subsequently wrote his doctoral dissertation "Polish monarchy and Warmia at the end of the 15th century:  Issues in systemic-law and politics".&lt;ref name=js1978&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1978).  ''Monarchia polska i Warmia u schyłku XV wieku. Zagadnienia prawno-ustrojowe i polityczne''. Olsztyn, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing of his academic studies at the Nicolas Copernicus University in Toruń in 1960, Sikorski accepted a position at the Museum of Warmia at [[Lidzbark Warmiński Castle]], where Copernicus spent at least seven years (1503–1509). Copernicus had strong ties to the city of Lidzbark, and had visited there at the invitation of his maternal uncle Bishop Lucas Watzenrode in 1495. Sikorski worked at the museum from 1961 to 1962.

Lidzbark Warmiński Castle was of substantial significance for Jerzy Sikorski's ''Copernicana'' studies in terms of the history of astronomy; as well as because the castle was a strongly fortified seat of the bishops of Warmia and the administration center of their lands  from the second half of the 14th century. At that time, Lidzbark city had one of the largest populations in Warmia, similar to [[Braniewo]].  In Lidzbark, Sikorski researched historic documents pertaining to the history of Poland's [[Baltic Sea|Baltic seashore]] ([[Pomerania]], [[Warmia]], [[Mazury]], [[Prussia]]), and its extant architectural relics, documents, and other materials relating to Nicolaus Copernicus.  Following the death of bishop Watzenrode in Toruń on March 29, 1512, Copernicus only sporadically visited Lidzbark, either as an emissary of the Warmia Chapter, or as a personal medical doctor for the successive bishops: [[:pl:Fabian Luzjański|Fabian Luzjański]] (d. 1523), [[Mauritius Ferber]] (Polish: Maurycy Ferber 1471–1537), and [[Johannes Dantiscus]] (Polish: Jan Dantyszek; 1485–1548).&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;

==Author==
An organized index of published books and articles by Sikorski is listed at [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/lista-publikacji his web portal], covering four areas of research: 1. Copernicana; 2.  Cities and castles of Prussia; 3.  Historic tradition of the region; and, 4. The History of Science.

An additional indexed list of Sikorski's complete articles and papers is available online at the [http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/baza-artykulow Database of Articles] (in Polish), including two English language papers: "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/empirical-table-olsztyn-question-nicolaus-copernicus-scientific-workshop The Empirical Table of Olsztyn the Question of Nicolaus Copernicus' Scientific Workshop]", and "[http://www.jerzysikorski.pl/practice-bishops-burials-frombork-cathedral-and-question-grave-nicolaus-copernicus-s-uncle The Practice of Bishops' Burials in Frombork Cathedral and the Question of the Grave of Nicolaus Copernicus' Uncle Łukasz Watzenrode]".
       
In 1973, in time for the 500th anniversary of Nicolas Copernicus' birth, Sikorski authored a popular [[monograph]] on the astronomer's life, work, and times.&lt;ref name=js1973&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1973).

==History of Science consultant==
[[File:Torun_Merian_1641.jpg|thumb|Toruń city plan from 1641]]
Dr Jerzy Sikorski is credited for history of science consultation in the opening titles to the Polish motion picture ''Kopernik'', released in [[Toruń]], [[Poland]], on February 14, 1973.&lt;ref name=petelski&gt;Petelski Czesław Ewa (1973).

==Journalist==
Between 1966 and 2007 Jerzy Sikorski published a number of articles in ''Mazury-Warmian Communications'' (''[[:pl:Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie|Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie]]''), on the history of [[Poland]]'s ancestral [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seashore [[Pomerania]], and the Polish regions of [[Warmia]] and [[Masuria]]. He also published articles on the life and activities of the Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].&lt;ref name=js1969&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (1969). ''Wieża, dom i obserwatorium fromborskie Mikołaja Kopernika oraz jego folwarki''. Copernicana. Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie nr 4, 619-645, 1969. Contains English Summary: "''The tower, house, and observatory of Nicholas Copernicus at Frombork, and his allodiums''."  Digitized by Muzeum Historii Polski (bashum.mushp.pl).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sikorski was a member of the editorial staff at ''Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie'', and also a member of staff at ''Frombork's Commentaries'' (''Komentarze Fromborskie''), and also the substitute editor-in-chief of ''Olsztyn Yearly'' (''[[:pl:Rocznik Olsztyński|Rocznik Olsztyński]]''),&lt;ref name=js2007&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2007). ''Rocznik Olsztyński (1958-1997)'', "Komunikaty Mazursko-Warmińskie" 2007, nr 3, s. 295-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encyclopedist==
Jerzy Sikorski published a number of short biographies of Warmian Chapter canons and members in the ''[[Polish Biographical Dictionary]]'', which is printed by the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. These included biographies of Preuck Jan (1575–1631), Preuck Jerzy (d. 1556), Reich Feliks (c. 1475–1539), Sculteti Aleksander (1485–1564), Sculteti Bernard (d. 1518), and Sculteti Jan (d. 1526).

===Copernicus' Polish nationality and descent===
[[File:Locationes mansorum desertorum Nicolaus Copernicus.JPG|thumb| Nicolaus [Nicolas] Copernicus' extant manuscript, 15 pages –  ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs'')]]
Reviewing the document ''Locationes mansorum desertorum'' (''Allocation of abandoned fiefs''), which was written by Copernicus in the region of Olsztyn Castle, Olsztyn, Poland, Jerzy Sikorski discovered that, out of the 136 names of allocation of fiefs, 60 were Polish names (peasants had only first names) written in phonetically correct Polish.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|131}}  Sikorski also cites an extant document where Copernicus’ witness was Copernicus’ Polish servant: ''Wojciech Cebulski''.&lt;ref name=js2011/&gt;{{rp|128}} These documents indicate that Copernicus spoke and wrote Polish.

[[File:Letter of N. Copernicus to king Sigismund I of Poland 16-XI-1520 A.jpg|thumb|Letter of Warmia Chapter to King Sigismund I of Poland, handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, November 16, 1520 ''(or. Staatliches Archivlager, Göttingen, OBA – 16 XI 1520 d); older signature: Aus D 641.'']]
In a letter to king Sigismund I of Poland handwritten by Nicolas Copernicus in Olsztyn Castle, the administrator, chancellor, and commander in chief of the defense of Olsztyn Castle Copernicus and Warmia Canons together affirm their Polish nationality as subjects to King Sigismund I of Poland against the enemy, the German Teutonic Order. The writers say that they are willing to die defending Olsztyn Castle, Warmia, and Poland from the Teutonic Knights.  Nicolas Copernicus is directly associated with Sigismund I of Poland in the wars against the Teutonic Order, the reform of royal mints and the minting of coins, in establishing modern market economy in 16th century Poland, in direct contacts with king's personal medical doctor, with Cracow (Kraków) and the Jagiellonian University, and with the Polish Roman Catholic Church in Cracow.

Sikorski wrote "the intellectual adventure of my life were my discoveries of Copernicus’ Polish ancestry and nationality".&lt;ref name=js2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fedo2015&gt;Fedoniuk B. (2015).

Retrieved: December 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copernicus’ resting place===

Copernicus was reportedly buried in [[Frombork Cathedral]], but archaeologists searched there in vain for centuries for his remains. Efforts to locate the remains in 1581, 1626, 1802, 1909, 1939 and 2004 came to nought. In 1973 Dr Jerzy Sikorski published the location of Copernicus' resting place in his book, including the photo of the Altar of Saint Wacław, today Altar of Saint Cross, with a subscription (English translation of Polish) "The remains of Mikołaj Kopernik rest unnamed next to this altar".&lt;ref name=js1973/&gt;{{rp|193}}

Sikorski's analysis of recovered chapter documents guided the Polish archaeological searches of Frombork in 2004–2005.&lt;ref name="Genetic"/&gt;&lt;ref name=js2005&gt;Sikorski Jerzy (2005).

===Location of Copernicus’ observatories===

[[File:Frombork-Cathedral-Altars-Tower-Curia-4b-final.jpg|thumb|Photographs of Frombork Cathedral and defensive walls, Copernicus’ extant Canonic Curia inside the walls (''Curiae intra muros''), and the location of Copernicus’ no-longer-extant Canonic Curia outside walls (''Curiae extra muros'').]]

Sikorski discovered the location of Copernicus' Canonic Curia outside the walls of Frombork (the ''Curiae extra muros'').&lt;ref name=js1969/&gt;{{cn|reason=Need a reference to a reliable secondary source.|date=September 2018}}  The building is not extant, having been burned by Teutonic Knights on February 1, 1520, but the foundation remains. 

Sikorski searched the area nearby with instruments such as [[ground-penetrating radar]] in an effort to find Copernicus’ observatory "pavimentum", which was believed to have been nearby, but did not find it.
Sikorski was aided in the search by the notebook of Elias Olsen, who was sent by [[Tycho Brahe]] to Frombork in 1584 to use the still-extant ''pavimentum'' to obtain astronomic observations for comparison with those of Copernicus. {{As of|2011}} the ''pavimentum'' has still not been located. Its foundations may have been destroyed during extensive ground works near Copernicus’ external curia.  

Sikorski since 1973 researched and wrote on Copernicus' observatory in Olsztyn, which contains a still-extant plaster astronomical table that was used by Copernicus from 1516 to 1521.

==Recognition==
Sikorski has been awarded Polish presidential medals for his professional work as a historian and Copernicologist: the [[Gold Cross of Merit]] (1975) and Knight's Cross of the [[Order of Polonia Restituta]] (1986).&lt;ref&gt;Formal statement from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, BON – Department of Orders and Decorations, Reference: BON.0600.454.2.2017, July 27, 2017, Warsaw, addressed and forwarded by BON to Mr Artur Chojecki, the Province Region Governor of Warmia &amp; Mazury.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the fifteenth anniversary of the Warmia-Mazury Business Club, the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński gave presidential orders and awards to deserving club members. On March 28, 2008, the title "Personality of the Year 2008 in Warmia and Mazury" was awarded to Jerzy Sikorski for his research into the life and science of Nicolas Copernicus, and for his 1973 discovery of Copernicus's resting place.

'''Kanai Yoshiko''' ('''{{lang-ja|金井淑子}}''', born 1944) is Japanese academic and feminist theorist. She explored the complexities of the feminist movements in Japan and the difficulty in launching women's studies in a society bound by [[gender binary|dualistic]] definitions of gender. Coining the phrase "housewife feminism", she addressed how Japanese society had attempted to appease women without addressing the underlying systemic problems that continued to foster inequality.

==Early life==
Kanai Yoshiko was born in 1944 &lt;!-- on 5 October 1944 --&gt; in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan. She graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] (UT) with a degree in literature and philosophy in 1967 and went on to further her education at UT, earning a master's degree education and ethics.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}}

==Career==
Kanai began her career at the newly established [[Nagaoka Women's Junior College]] in 1971. She was one of the first academics in Japan to focus on [[women's studies]]. She remained at Nagaoka Junior College until 1999, when she accepted a position at [[Yokohama National University]] in the Human Sciences Department. She reached the university's mandatory retirement barrier in 2010 and took a post in the philosophy and letters department at [[Rissho University]], from which she retired in 2015.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}} 

Kanai was most known as a specialist in [[gender studies]] and ethics, writing numerous books analyzing the feminist movement in Japan and its limitations.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|p=x}}{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} She coined the phrase "housewife feminism" to refer to a particular type of issues-based feminism, where the official response establishes quotas and training to counteract imbalances, but does nothing to address the underlying [[systemic bias]]es.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Smith|2013|pp=160-161}} She argued that rather than giving women real power for their own development, the focus of [[identity politics]] on nationalist and traditional aims provided pacifiers, such as men taking on more household duties, and led to continued co-opting of women's ability to define themselves and direct policies which affected them.{{sfn|Loftus|1997}} In turn, she found that no radical feminist movement developed in Japan, because women readily accepted a [[binary gender]] model and succumbed to pressure to define themselves in the role of wife.{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} By accepting traditional roles, Japanese motherhood is glorified and a one-size-fits-all approach is used to address issues.{{sfn||Liddle|Nakajimo|2000|p=11}} She has noted that the failure to grasp that "…equality of sexual power [is] a human right of women and sexual violence against women [is] a violation of human rights" was a stumbling block to women's empowerment.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=161}}

Leptocephali are also characterized by their fang-like teeth that are present until metamorphosis, when they are lost.&lt;ref name = "Source 6" /&gt;

Leptocephali differ from most [[fish larvae]] because they grow to much larger sizes&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; and have long larval periods of about three months to more than a year. Another distinguishing feature of these organisms is their mucinous pouch.&lt;ref name = "Source 15" /&gt; They move with typical anguilliform swimming motions&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; and can swim forwards and backwards.&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt; Their food source was difficult to determine because zooplankton, which are the typical food of fish larvae, were never seen in their guts.&lt;ref&gt;Mochioka, N. and M.

Leptocephali appear to feed on tiny particles floating free in the ocean, which are often referred to as [[marine snow]]. Leptocephali larvae live primarily in the upper {{convert|100|m}} of the ocean at night,&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; and often a little deeper during the day. Leptocephali are present worldwide in the oceans from southern temperate to tropical latitudes, where adult eels and their close relatives live. American eels, European eels, conger eels, and some oceanic species spawn and are found in the [[Sargasso Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;McCleave, J.D. (1993). “Physical and behavioural controls on the oceanic distribution and migration of leptocephali.” [Abstract] Journal of Fish Biology 43 (1993): 243-273.

''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' was declared as a biological species in 1856, but was later found to be the larva of ''[[Anguilla anguilla]]'', which was declared by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758 and thus has priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=314762|title=WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Leptocephalus brevirostris Kaup, 1856|work=marinespecies.org|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The development of leptocephali can be summarized briefly. The eggs of eels in the Anguilliformes order are quite large compared to those of many other fishes.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; They are about {{convert|1|–|4|mm|um thou}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; Once the larvae are newly hatched, the yolk extends posteriorly.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; Some larvae hatch with features of the head more developed than others.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The preleptocephalus stage is the period immediately after the larvae hatch.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; During this stage, the larvae do not yet feed externally.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; These larvae typically have poorly developed eyes and few or no teeth.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt;

The leptocephalus stage of the larvae begins after the nutrients from the yolk have been absorbed and the eyes and teeth are formed.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; At this point, the larvae usually have long forward-facing pointy teeth.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; As the larvae grow larger, the teeth will be replaced by shorter teeth and will increase in number.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The maximum size larvae reach varies from about {{convert|5|–|10|cm|0}} but can be as large as {{convert|30|cm}} or more depending on the species.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; After the leptocephali have reached their maximum size, they enter their glass eel stage. Their laterally compressed bodies tend to become more rounded in this stage.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt; The head also thickens, the olfactory organ enlarges, and their teeth are lost.&lt;ref name="Source 5" /&gt;

Leptocephali differ from other fish larvae in their development. In other teleosts (those without leptocephali), the egg hatches and then the larvae get nutrients from a [[yolk sac]].&lt;ref name = "Source 20" &gt;Pfeiler, Edward (1986). "Towards and Explanation of the Developmental Strategy in Leptocephalus Larvae of Marine Teleost Fishes." Environmental Biology of Fishes 15 (1986): 3-13. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following this, external feeding begins once the yolk sac has depleted.&lt;ref name ="Source 20" /&gt; The larvae begin to increase in size and develop into a juvenile fish once external feeding begins.&lt;ref name = "Source 20" /&gt; In those fish with a leptocephalus stage; however, after hatching and obtaining nutrients from the yolk, the larvae do not begin external feeding.&lt;ref name =" Source 20" /&gt; This is peculiar because the larvae still continue to grow in size.&lt;ref name ="Source 20" /&gt; From this information, it is concluded that one of the biggest and most basic differences in the developmental cycles of teleosts without leptocephali and teleosts with leptocephali is the food source that the larvae use.&lt;ref name = "Source 20" /&gt;

Leptocephali are poorly understood, partly because they are very fragile and eat particulate material instead of zooplankton, and their good swimming ability lets them avoid most standard-sized plankton nets used by marine biologists. A video recording of a naturally swimming leptocephalus filmed at night off the island of Hawaii shows an example of their swimming behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmuseum.net.au/movie/Ophichthid-leptocephalus-Kona-Hawaii/|title=Ophichthid leptocephalus off Kona, Hawaii - Australian Museum|work=australianmuseum.net.au|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual system==
Two facts are known regarding the visual system of the leptocephali. The first is that they have a rod-dominated visual system.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Scott Michael, Ellis Loew, and Michael Grace (2011). “A rod-dominated visual system in leptocephalus larvae of elopomorph fishes (Elopomorpha: Teleostei).” Environmental Biology of Fishes 92 (2011): 513-523. Retrieved on 2012-11-02 from Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that the Synaphobranchidae (a specific family of leptocephali) have telescopic eyes, meaning a tubular eye with a sphere-shaped lens on the top occurs.&lt;ref name ="Source 5" /&gt;

==Aquaculture==
Some progress has been made to grow the leptocephali of the [[Japanese eel]] in the laboratory. The goal of that effort is to produce [[glass eels]] through artificial spawning and larval rearing, to be used for aquaculture to produce [[unagi]] for food. Unagi is a popular food in Japan and East Asia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Leptocephali are rarely used as food, except in some parts of Japan. The leptocephali of the common Japanese conger, ''[[Conger myriaster]]'', are called '''''noresore'''''·[[w:ja:のれそれ|のれそれ]] in [[Kōchi Prefecture]], [[Japan]], and are often served uncooked to the table, and are eaten after dipping in ''tosazu'' mixed [[vinegar]]. It is a spring seasonal specialty.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Geography==
Livingston is located at {{Coord|30|29|55|N|90|44|54|W|type:city}} (30.498721, -90.748371).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|3.1|sqmi|km2}}, all land.
The communities of Doyle and Livingston, combined in 1955 to create the Town of Livingston.  Doyle was established northeast of present-day Livingston, located on Hog Branch, off present-day North Doyle Road but moved when the railroad was built from [[Baton Rouge]] to [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]], and the community was re-located in 1901 by the McDonald family.

Livingston was started by the Lyons Lumber Company in 1916 as a logging community on 63 acres just west of Doyle, to support their logging industry and timber mill in [[Garyville, Louisiana|Garyville]], located south of Livingston on the [[Mississippi River]]. Therefore, Livingston and Garyville are sister cities.

When Livingston was first established there was a house on every lot, a board walk in front of every home, and water wells drilled on each corner so every home would have access to running water.

In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=POLLEX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/mana1/ |title=Entries for MANA.1 [OC&amp;#93; Power, effectiveness, prestige |publisher=Pollex.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in [[Polynesia]]n culture and is part of contemporary [[Pacific Islander]] culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in [[cultural anthropology]]—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between ''mana'' and earlier phases of Western religion: [[animism]] at first, followed by [[Robert Ranulph Marett|pre-animism]].

==Etymology==
According to the POLLEX Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|date=2011|title=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|url=http://simon.net.nz/files//2012/12/Greenhill_and_Clark2011.pdf|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=551–559|doi=10.1353/ol.2011.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for "mana"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-"—existed in [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, "mana" means "thunder, storm, or wind" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant "powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own."&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=R. A|title=Proto-Oceanic *mana Revisited|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|date=2007|volume=46|issue=2|pages=404–423|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In Polynesian culture}}Polynesian culture==
Mana is a foundation of the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian worldview]], a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have ''mana'' implies influence, [[authority]], and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of ''mana'' is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess ''mana'', and its possessors are accorded respect.

==={{anchor|In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture}}Hawaiian and Tahitian culture===
In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and in [[French Polynesia]] are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the [[Haleakalā]] volcano on the island of [[Maui]] and the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in the [[Society Islands]].

Ancient Hawaiian believed that the island of [[Molokaʻi]] possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha I]], battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.

A person may gain mana by ''[[pono]]'' (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]] formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (''ʻimihaku'', or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In [[Māori language|Māori]], a tribe with ''mana whenua'' must have demonstrated their authority over a territory.

According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:

{{quote|Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded definitions by contemporary writers. As concepts, especially Maori concepts they can not easily be translated into a single English definition. Both mana and tapu take on a whole range of related meanings depending on their association and the context in which they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/mana-and-tapu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522222543/http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/h/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-1-traditional-maori-concepts/mana-and-tapu |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-05-22 |title=Mana and Tapu |publisher=Ministry of Justice, New Zealand  |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===={{anchor|In general usage}}General use====
In contemporary [[New Zealand English]], the word "mana", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=357 |title=Kiwi (NZ) to English Dictionary |publisher=New Zealand A to Z |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the [[politicisation]] of Maori issues stemming from the [[Māori Renaissance]]. 

=={{anchor|In fantasy}}Gaming and literature==
{{main article|Magic (gaming)}}

[[Larry Niven]] adopted the term in his 1969 short story, [[All the Myriad Ways|"Not Long Before the End"]].  In this and subsequent stories, "mana" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.

Following on from the idea of mana as something that could be "used up", fantasy [[role-playing game]]s and video games adopted the term to quantify "magical power."&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golub |first1=Alex |title=The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic |url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052259/http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic|dead-url=no |archive-date=20 June 2014 |website=theappendix.net |publisher=The Appendix |accessdate=4 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic points (MPs) were used by ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' replaced "magic points" with "mana points" as the definition of MPs.

Mana was used in a number of early role-playing [[board game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Matt|last2=P.

=={{anchor|The academic study of mana}}Academic study==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 116272 Southern Cross (ship).jpg|thumb|275px|alt=Photo of a three-masted schooner|The 1891 ''[[Southern Cross (1891 Melanesian Mission ship)|Southern Cross]]'', one of the ships at [[Norfolk Island]]'s [[Melanesian Mission]] where Codrington taught and worked]]

Missionary [[Robert Henry Codrington]] traveled widely in [[Melanesia]], publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book ''The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore'' contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as "a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control".&lt;ref name="Codrington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Codrington|first1=Robert Henry|title=The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore|date=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486202587|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Melanesians:+Studies+in+Their+Anthropology+and+Folklore.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxDYVJHlGIHZggSm0YL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His era had already defined [[animism]], the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s 18th-century animism was adopted by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]], who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind''&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylor|first1=Edward B.|title=Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1108017517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Tylor's cultural evolution===
In Tylor's [[cultural anthropology]], other [[primate]]s (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The discovery that primates and other mammals [[animal culture|have some culture]] (practical knowledge taught by parents who learned it from their parents) does not substantially affect the argument, since humanity's characteristically-complex learned behaviour is unique.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, "a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals" and "savage life as in some sort representing an early known state."&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|33}} He described such a hypothetical state as "the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|30}} According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of [[Comparative cultural studies|comparative culture]], similar to [[comparative anatomy]] and the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method of historical linguistics]] and following [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits ([[meme]]s and [[memeplex]]es): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, "From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... "&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|24}} and identified his model with the "progression-theory of civilization".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

===Evolution of religion===
Tylor cited a "minimum definition" of religion as "the belief in Spiritual Beings".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|108–110}} He used the word "animism" in two different senses.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|385}} The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which [[comparative religion]] attempts to reconstruct.

Tylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called "pre-animistic religion") was [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], in a series of papers collected and published as ''Threshold of Religion''. In its preface he takes credit for the adjective "pre-animistic" but not the noun "pre-animism", although he does not attribute it.&lt;ref name="Marett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marett|first1=Robert Randolph|title=Threshold of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Hardpress Ltd|location=|isbn=1313151963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

According to Marett, "Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion." Tylor had used the term "natural religion",&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|386}} consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, "One must dig deeper" to find the "roots of religion".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Pre-animistic phase of religion}}Pre-animism===
Describing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): "When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... ".&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In Melanesia the ''animae'' are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits "of ghost-like appearance" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|115–120}}

The most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. ''Animae'' act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a "Power of awfulness" (in the sense of awe or wonder).&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Objects possessing it impress an observer with "respect, veneration, propitiation, service" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: "startling manifestations of nature", "curious stones", animals, "human remains", blood,&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|2}} thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a [[bullroarer]].&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|14–17}}

If mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the ''anima''). An ''anima'' may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a "rudimentary religion" or "magico-religious" phase in which the mana figures without ''animae'', "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the [[supernatural]]—the "mysterious", as opposed to the reasonable.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

==={{anchor|Criticisms}}Criticism===
In 1936, [[Ian Hogbin]] criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: "Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious".&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogbin|first1=H. Ian|title=MANA|journal=Oceania|date=March 1936|volume=6|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1936.tb00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} Spells, for example, may be found "from Central Australia to Scotland."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Early 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", [[Marcel Mauss]] drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as "power ''par excellence'', the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them".&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauss|first1=Marcel|title=A General Theory of Magic|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415253963|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the [[Iroquois]] [[orenda]] and the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] [[manitou]], convinced of the "universality of the institution";&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|116}} "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Mauss and his collaborator, [[Henri Hubert]], were criticised for this position when their 1904 ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' was published. "No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer [[Marcel Fournier]], "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension".&lt;ref name="Fournier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier|first1=Marcel|title=Marcel Mauss: A Biography|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691117775|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and "even among the varying formulae (''mana'', ''wakan'', ''orenda'', etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies".&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Patterns in Comparative Religion|date=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803267336|page=22|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".&lt;ref name="Eliade2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities|date=1992|publisher=Peter Smith|location=Magnolia, Massachusetts|isbn=9780844666259|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">'''Nature Detectives''' is an online [[phenology]] research and education project for 4–18-year-olds in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It is run by the [[Woodland Trust]], as part of the UK Phenology Network.

Participants record the dates they see seasonal events, such as leafing, flowering, bird migration, nesting or fruit ripening in their own recording form on the website. The data they collect is fed into the UKPN national database, which has over 11,000 contributors and now contains over one million records.

The project monitors the activity of birds, insects, amphibians, grasses, fungi, flowers and trees, all of which are being affected by [[climate change]]. There is also information on phenology, climate change and "doing your bit for the environment".

Schools, youth groups, families and individuals all take part, and it is proving a great way to involve children in the natural world and teach them about plants and wildlife and environmental issues.

'''The Orthopterists' Society''' (formerly the Pan American Acridological Society) is an international scientific organization devoted to facilitating communication and research among persons interested in [[Orthoptera]] and related organisms. (The Orthoptera include grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, katydids and other insects.) The Society currently has 330 members from 43 countries on six continents. The journal publishes papers on all aspects of the biology of these insects from [[ecology]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] to [[physiology]], [[endocrinology]], [[cytogenetics]], and control measures. The Society publishes the refereed biannual ''Journal of Orthoptera Research''.

The Society was founded in 1976 by some 35 orthopterists who met at [[San Martín de los Andes]], [[Argentina]]. Its Constitution and Bylaws were adopted in 1977, and it was accorded tax-exempt status by the United States government in 1978. The meetings held since San Martín have been at [[Bozeman]] (USA), [[Maracay]], (Venezuela), [[Saskatoon]] (Canada), [[Valsaín]] (Spain), [[Hilo]] (USA), [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]] (Australia), [[Montpellier]] (France), and [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]] (Canada).

Graduate students and young researchers can apply for the Orthopterists' Society Research Fund.

** [[Office automation]] &amp;ndash;  the varied computer machinery and software used to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate, and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic tasks such as [[business process automation]] and [[robotic process automation]].

== Fields contributing to automation ==
* [[Cybernetics]] &amp;ndash;  the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems.
* [[Cognitive science]] &amp;ndash;  interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines what cognition is, what it does and how it works.
* [[Robotics]] &amp;ndash;  the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots and computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

== History of automation ==

* [[Mass production#History|History of mass production]] &amp;ndash; Prerequisites of mass production were interchangeable parts, machine tools and power, especially in the form of electricity. Mass production was popularized in the 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford's Ford Motor Company, which introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production.
* [[Numerical control]] (NC) &amp;ndash;  refers to the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually via handwheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone.
* [[History of home automation]]

== Automated machines ==
* [[Machine to Machine]] &amp;ndash;
* [[OLE for process control]] (OPC) &amp;ndash; 
* [[Process control]] &amp;ndash;  a statistics and engineering discipline that deals with architectures, mechanisms and algorithms for maintaining the output of a specific process within a desired range.
* [[Run Book Automation]] (RBA) &amp;ndash; 
* [[Robot]] &amp;ndash;  a mechanical or virtual intelligent agent that can perform tasks automatically or with guidance, typically by remote control.

== Automated machine components ==
* [[Artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it.
* [[Friendly artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; an artificial intelligence that has a positive rather than negative effect on humanity, and the field of knowledge required to build such an artificial intelligence.

===Automation tools===

* [[Artificial neural network]] (ANN) &amp;ndash;  mathematical model or computational model that is inspired by the structure or functional aspects of biological neural networks.
* [[Human machine interface]] (HMI) &amp;ndash; operator level  local control panel that control monitors the field devices,
* [[Laboratory information management system]] (LIMS) &amp;ndash;  software package that offers a set of key features that support a modern laboratory's operations.
* [[Industrial control system]] &amp;ndash; encompasses several types of control systems used in industrial production, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other smaller control system configurations such as skid-mounted programmable logic controllers (PLC) often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures.
** [[Distributed control system]] (DCS) &amp;ndash; control system usually of a manufacturing system, process or any kind of dynamic system, in which the controller elements are not central in location (like the brain) but are distributed throughout the system with each component sub-system controlled by one or more controllers.
** Manufacturing execution system (MES) &amp;ndash; system that manages manufacturing operations in a factory, including management of resources, scheduling production processes, dispatching production orders, execution of production orders, etc.
** [[Programmable automation controller]] (PAC) &amp;ndash; digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.
** [[Programmable logic controller]] (PLC)A Programmable Logic Controller, PLC or Programmable Controller is a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures. The abbreviation "PLC" and the term "Programmable Logic Controller" are registered trademarks of the Allen-Bradley Company (Rockwell Automation). PLCs are used in many industries and machines. Unlike general-purpose computers, the PLC is designed for multiple inputs and output arrangements, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory. A PLC is an example of a hard real time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result. &amp;ndash;
** [[Supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA) &amp;ndash; generally refers to industrial control systems (ICS): computer systems that monitor and control industrial, infrastructure, or facility-based processes, as described below:* Industrial processes include those of manufacturing, production, power generation, fabrication, and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes.
* [[Simulation#Engineering Technology simulation or Process simulation]] &amp;ndash;

==Social movements ==

Automation-related social movement &amp;ndash; a movement that advocates semi- or fully automatic systems to provide for human needs globally. For example, automation of farming and food distribution throughout the world so that no one will go hungry. One goal is to automate all mundane labor, to free humans to engage in more creative activities (or less work).
* The [[Technocracy movement]] &amp;ndash; social movement active from the Great Depression (1930s) to date that proposes replacing politicians and businesspeople with scientists and engineers who have the technical expertise to manage the economy.
* [[The Zeitgeist Movement]] &amp;ndash;  movement advocating the replacement of the market economy with an economy in which all resources are equitably, commonly and sustainably shared.

== Automation in the future ==
* [[Android (robot)|Android]] &amp;ndash; a robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human, and with a body having a flesh-like resemblance
* [[Technological singularity]] &amp;ndash;  the hypothetical future emergence of greater-than-human intelligence through technological means

Pencil beam scans (Medical physics)

==Ionizing radiation==

Ionizing radiation [[photon]]s or [[x-ray]]s ([[IMRT]]) use pencil beam scanning to precisely target a tumor. Bone scan densitometry uses a fan scan system that replaces a pencil beam system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8220974 | volume=66 | issue=790 | title=Dual X-ray absorptiometry: a comparison between fan beam and pencil beam scans |date=October 1993 |vauthors=Blake GM, Parker JC, Buxton FM, Fogelman I | journal=Br J Radiol | pages=902–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Radiation treatment planning]] has pencil beam scanning as one of its modalities.  [[mean free path]] is involved in IMRT planning. Also used in [[Monte Carlo method for photon transport]]. Another three sources are: [[Hybrid theory for photon transport in tissue]] which is a combination of [[Diffusion theory]] and the [[Monte Carlo method]] all using, in part, pencil beam scanning.  Photon pencil beam scans are defined as crossing of two beams to a fine point.

==Charged particles==
 
Several [[charged particle]]s devices used with [[Proton therapy]] cancer centers use pencil beam scanning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWDQnxd-r1UC&amp;pg=PA521#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Physics of Radiation Therapy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newer proton therapy machines use a pencil beam scanning technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf10/K100766.pdf page4&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique is also called spot scanning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/news-backgrounders/03-30-09-advances-in-proton-therapy-pencil-beam-technology-reach-patient-care.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paul Scherrer Institute]] was the developer of spot beam.&lt;ref&gt;http://radmed.web.psi.ch/asm/gantry/scan/n_scan.html&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a [[Scripps Health]] (Varian Medical System) [http://www.scripps.org/sparkle-assets/documents/scripps_protontherapycenterinfographic.pdf ''diagram'']. Mayo clinic (Hitachi) has a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTd5dv3VDws ''video ''] demonstrating pencil-beam techniques.

==Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy==

Varian's IMPT system uses all pencil-beam controlled protons where the beam '''intensity''' can also be controlled at this small level. This can be done by going back and forth over a previously radiated area during the same  radiation session. This is using the same [[Raster scan]] technique that is used in an obsolete cathode ray tube television set and other electronic applications.

A '''planetarium projector''' is a device used to project images of celestial objects onto the dome in a [[planetarium]].

The first modern planetarium projectors were designed and built by the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Jena]] company in [[Germany]] between 1923 and 1925, and have since grown more complex. Smaller projectors include a set of fixed stars, Sun, Moon, and planets, and various [[nebula]]e. Larger machines also include [[comet]]s and a far greater selection of stars. Additional projectors can be added to show twilight around the outside of the screen (complete with city or country scenes) as well as the [[Milky Way]]. Still others add coordinate lines and [[constellation]]s, photographic slides, [[laser]] displays, and other images.  The [[IMAX|OMNIMAX]] [[Film|movie]] system (now known as IMAX Dome) was originally designed to operate on planetarium screens.

Companies that make (or have made) planetarium projectors include [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Jena]] (Germany), [[Armand Spitz|Spitz]] (US), [[GoTo (telescopes)|Goto]] and [[Minolta]] (Japan), [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]] (US), [[Emerald planetariums]] (Israel) and [[Megastar (projector)|Ohira Tech]] (Japan).

==1960s==

A good example of a "typical" planetarium projector of the 1960s was the Universal Projection Planetarium type 23/6, made by [[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Jena]] in what was then [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name="JenaMagazine"&gt;''The McLaughlin Planetarium of the Royal Ontario Museum'', Jena Review. 1984: no. 3, p 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The planetarium projector was a {{convert|13|ft|m|sing=on}}-long dumbbell-shaped object, with {{convert|29|in|mm|sing=on}}-diameter spheres attached at each end representing the night sky for the northern and southern hemispheres. Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors, including those dedicated to the planets, the Sun, and specific stars.

Each globe held representations of almost 4,500 stars per hemisphere. The "stars" were created by tiny holes that were punched into copper foil, ranging from 0.023 to 0.452&amp;nbsp;mm in size, the larger holes letting more light get through and thereby creating brighter star images. Two glass plates held this foil between them to create what was called a "star field plate". Each globe was illuminated using a 1,500-watt lamp that was located in its center. A number of aspherical condenser lenses were placed within each globe to focus the light onto the plates. Twenty-three of the most prominent stars had their own projectors, designed to project a small disk instead of pinpoint of light, and were also colored: [[Betelgeuse]] and [[Antares]] would appear reddish, [[Rigel]] and [[Spica]] would each have a blue tinge. An image of the [[Milky Way]] was created by using drum-type projectors that were studded with unfocused pinprick-sized holes based on photographic images of our galaxy. Specific projectors could imitate the light changes of such [[variable stars]] as [[Algol]] or [[Omicron Ceti]], and other projectors could produce images of the constellations, of specific historical [[comet]]s, [[cardinal directions|compass points]] and other astronomical phenomena. When a particular star or planet dipped below the artificial [[horizon]], a gravity-based [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-filled shutter would be activated, blocking out the light.

In recent years, planetariums &amp;mdash; or dome theaters—have broadened their offerings to include wide-screen or "wraparound" films, [[fulldome|fulldome video]], and laser shows that combine music with laser-drawn patterns. The newest generation of planetariums such as [[Evans &amp; Sutherland]]'s [[Digistar 3]], [[Global Immersion]]'s [[Fidelity]] or [[Sky-Skan]]'s [[DigitalSky]], offer a fully [[Digital data|digital]] projection system, in which a single projector with a fish eye lens, or a system of digital video or laser video projectors around the edge of the dome, are used to create any scene provided to it from a computer. This gives the operator tremendous flexibility in showing not only the modern night sky as visible from [[Earth]], but any other image they wish (including the night sky as visible from points far distant in space and time).  While many projection systems maintain their large single or multiple projectors, other systems like the [[Emerald planetariums]] LITE series, at 42lbs to 62lbs, and the [[Digitalis Education Solutions, Inc]] [[Digitarium]] Iota and Delta 3, at 20.6 and 33.5 lbs, respectively, cater to portable planetariums.

Some substances can serve as either antioxidants or pro-oxidants, depending on conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Herbert V |title=Prooxidant effects of antioxidant vitamins. Introduction |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/126/4_Suppl/1197S.pdf |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=126 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=1197S–200S |year=1996 |pmid=8642456}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the conditions that are important include the concentration of the chemical and if [[oxygen]] or [[transition metal]]s are present. While thermodynamically very favored, reduction of molecular oxygen or peroxide to [[superoxide]] or [[hydroxyl radical]] respectively is [[Selection rule|spin forbidden]]. This greatly reduces the rates of these reactions, thus allowing aerobic life to exist.  As a result, the reduction of oxygen typically involves either the initial formation of [[singlet oxygen]], or [[spin-orbit coupling]] through a reduction of a transition-series metal such as manganese, iron, or copper.  This reduced metal then transfers the single electron to molecular oxygen or peroxide.

==Metals==
Transition metals can serve as pro-oxidants.  For example, chronic [[manganism]] is a classic "pro-oxidant" disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Han SG, Kim Y, Kashon ML, Pack DL, Castranova V, Vallyathan V |title=Correlates of oxidative stress and free-radical activity in serum from asymptomatic shipyard welders |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=172 |issue=12 |pages=1541–8 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16166614 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200409-1222OC |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/full/172/12/1541}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another disease associated with the chronic presence of a pro-oxidant transition-series metal is [[hemochromatosis]],  associated with elevated iron levels.  Similarly, [[Wilson's disease]] is associated with elevated tissue levels of copper.  Such syndromes tend to be associated with a common symptomology.  Thus, all are occasional symptoms of (e.g) hemochromatosis,  another name for which is "bronze diabetes".   The pro-oxidant herbicide [[paraquat]], Wilson's disease, and striatal iron have similarly been linked to human [[Parkinsonism]].  Paraquat also produces parkinsonian-like symptoms in rodents.

==Fibrosis==
[[Fibrosis]] or scar formation is another pro-oxidant-related symptom.  E.g., interocular copper or [[Vitreous humor|vitreous]] chalcosis is associated with severe vitreous [[fibrosis]],  as is interocular iron.  Liver [[cirrhosis]] is also a major symptom of Wilson's disease.  The  [[pulmonary fibrosis]] produced by [[paraquat]] and the antitumor agent [[bleomycin]] is also thought to be induced by the pro-oxidant properties of these agents.   It may be that oxidative stress produced by such agents mimics a normal [[redox signaling|physiological signal]] for [[fibroblast]] conversion to [[myofibroblast]]s.

==Pro-oxidant vitamins==
[[Vitamin]]s that are reducing agents can be pro-oxidants.  [[Vitamin C]] has antioxidant activity when it [[redox|reduces]] oxidizing substances such as [[hydrogen peroxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duarte TL, Lunec J |title=Review: When is an antioxidant not an antioxidant? A review of novel actions and reactions of vitamin C |journal=Free Radic. Res. |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=671–86 |year=2005 |pmid=16036346 |doi=10.1080/10715760500104025}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it can also reduce metal ions which leads to the generation of [[free radical]]s through the [[Fenton's reagent|fenton reaction]].&lt;ref name=Carr&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carr A, Frei B |title=Does vitamin C act as a pro-oxidant under physiological conditions? |url=http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/full/13/9/1007 |journal=FASEB J. |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=1007–24 |date=1 June 1999|pmid=10336883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stohs SJ, Bagchi D |title=Oxidative mechanisms in the toxicity of metal ions |journal=Free Radic. Biol. Med. |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=321–36 |year=1995 |pmid=7744317 |doi=10.1016/0891-5849(94)00159-H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 OH'''·''' + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  Ascorbate  →  2 Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  Dehydroascorbate

The metal ion in this reaction can be reduced, oxidized, and then re-reduced, in a process called [[redox cycling]] that can generate reactive oxygen species.

The relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidant vitamins are an area of current research, but vitamin C, for example, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the body.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valko M, Morris H, Cronin MT |title=Metals, toxicity and oxidative stress |journal=Curr.

==Anticancer Drugs==
Several important anticancer agents both bind to DNA and generate reactive oxygen species.  These include [[adriamycin]] and other [[anthracycline]]s,  [[bleomycin]], and [[cisplatin]].  These agents may show specific toxicity towards cancer cells because of the low level of antioxidant defenses found in tumors. Recent research demonstrates that redox dysregulation originating from metabolic alterations and dependence on mitogenic and survival signaling through reactive oxygen species represents a specific vulnerability of malignant cells that can be selectively targeted by pro-oxidant non-genotoxic redox chemotherapeutics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wondrak GT |title=Redox-directed cancer therapeutics: molecular mechanisms and opportunities |journal=Antioxid.

A '''religious image''', sometimes called a '''votive image''', is a work of [[visual art]] that is representational and has a religious purpose, subject or connection. All major historical religions have made some use of religious images, although their use is strictly controlled and often controversial in many religions, especially [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] ones. General terms associated with religious images include [[cult image]], a term for images, especially in [[sculpture]] which are or have been claimed to be the object of [[religious worship]] in their own right,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and [[icon]] strictly a term for [[Eastern Orthodox]] religious images,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} but often used more widely, in and outside the area of religion.

==Christianity==
{{main|Christian art}}
{{see also|Early Christian art}}
[[Image:Madonna catacomb.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] depicting the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Christ Child]] in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]] in [[Rome]]. This is earliest known image of Mary and the Infant Jesus independent of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]] episode. The figure at the left appears to be [[Balaam]] pointing to a star (outside the frame). The star is from {{bibleverse||Numbers|24:17|HE}}.]]

Images flourished within the Christian world, but by the 6th century, [[Iconoclasm (Byzantine)|certain factions]] arose within the Eastern Church to challenge the use of icons, and in 726-30 they won Imperial support.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]] actively destroyed icons in most public places, replacing them with the only religious depiction allowed, [[Christian cross|the cross]]. The [[Iconodules]] (those who favored the veneration of images), on the other hand, argued that icons had always been used by Christians and should continue to be allowed. They further argued that not only should the use of icons be permitted, it was necessary to the Christian faith as a testimony of the [[dogma]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Christ]]. [[Saint John Damascene]] argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Of old God the incorporial and uncircumscribed was not depicted at all. But now that God has appeared in the flesh and lived among men, I make an image of the God who can be seen. I do not worship matter, but I worship the Creator of matter, who for my sake became material and deigned to dwell in matter, who through matter effected my salvation."&lt;ref&gt;St. John Damascene, ''On the Holy Icons'' ([[Patrologia Graecae]], xciv, 1245A)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, after much debate at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], held in 787, the Iconodules, supported by the Empress, upheld the use of icons as an integral part of Christian [[Sacred tradition|tradition]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, and the Western Church, which had been almost totally unaffected by the dispute, confirmed this.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} According to the definition of the council, icons of Jesus are not intended to depict his divinity, but only the [[Logos|Incarnate Word]]. Saints are depicted because they reflect the grace of God, as depicted by their [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]].

===Eastern Christianity===
{{Main|Icon}}
[[Image:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|Icon of [[Christ Pantokrator]] ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Mount Sinai]]).]]
The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fully ascribes to the teachings of the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] and celebrates the restoration of the use of icons after the period of Iconoclasm on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]]. So important are the icons in Orthodox theology that the ceremony celebrating their restoration is known as the [[Triumph of Orthodoxy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In the traditions of [[Eastern Christianity]], only flat images or ''[[bas relief]]'' images are used (no more than 3/4 [[relief]]). Because the Eastern Church teaches that icons should represent the spiritual reality rather than the physical reality, the traditional style of Orthodox iconography was developed in which figures were stylized in a manner that emphasized their holiness rather than their humanity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Traditional icons differ from Western art in that they are not romantic or emotional, but call the viewer to "sobriety" (''[[nipsis]]''). The manner of depicting the face, and especially the eyes, is intended to produce in the viewer a sense of calm, devotion, and a desire for [[asceticism]]. Icons also differ from Western art in that they use [[inverse perspective]] (giving the impression that the icon itself is the source of light), and for this reason make very little use of shadow or highlight. The background of icons is usually covered with [[gold leaf]] to remind the viewer that the subject pictured is not earthly but otherworldly (gold being the closest earthly medium in which to signify heavenly glory).

[[Image:Eglise de Bethanie, peintures murales.jpg|thumb|left|Drawings made from [[icon]] murals in Betania [[Monastery]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], exemplifying classical Orthodox iconography.]]

Jesus and the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] are depicted wearing the robes of [[philosopher]]s. The precise manner of depicting the face of Jesus and many of the saints is also fixed by tradition. Even the colours used in depicting the clothing of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and other saints is fixed by tradition, with symbolic meaning attached to each color.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Icons of Jesus depict him with a halo that displays three bars of a cross and the Greek letters which signify [[YHWH|I AM]] (the Divine Name which God revealed to [[Moses]] at the [[Burning Bush]]). The halos of saints, even the [[Theotokos]] (Mother of God) are usually simple circles, filled with gold leaf. Over the centuries, painter's manuals have developed to help preserve the traditions and techniques of Orthodox iconography, one of the best-known is the manual from the [[Stroganov School]] of iconography in Russia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Despite these strict guidelines, the Orthodox iconographic style is not stilted, and the individual artist is always permitted to bring his own style and spiritual insight into his work, so long as he remains faithful to [[Sacred Tradition]], and many icons display remarkable movement and depth.

The thoughtful use of symbolism allows the icon to present complex teaching in a simple way, making it possible to educate even the illiterate in theology. The interiors of Orthodox Churches are often completely covered in icons of Christ, Mary and the saints.  Most are portrait figures in various conventional poses, but many narrative scenes are also depicted.  It is not unusual in narrative icons for the same individual to be depicted more than one time.

[[Image:Frescos in St. Georges church in Qakh, Azerbaijan 1.jpg|thumb|[[Sacred Tradition]] determines not only the style of representation, but also the traditional placement of icons in an Orthodox church (Georgian Orthodox Church of St. George in [[Qax]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]

Orthodox Christians do not pray "to" icons; rather, they pray "before" them. An icon is a medium of communication, rather than a medium of art. Gazing at an icon is intended to help draw the worshipper into the heavenly kingdom. As with all of Orthodox theology, the purpose is ''[[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]]'' (mystical union with God).{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Icons are [[veneration|venerated]] by the faithful by [[poklon|bowing]] and kissing them. Traditionally, the faithful would not kiss the face of the one depicted on the icon, but rather the right hand or foot depicted on the icon. The composition of an icon is planned with this veneration in mind, and the iconographer will usually portray his subject so that the right hand is raised in blessing, or if it is the saint's full figure is depicted, the right foot is visible.

Icons are also honored with [[thurible|incense]] and by burning [[lampada]]s (oil lamps) in front of them. Icons are carried in [[procession]]s, and the [[bishop]] or [[priest]] may [[blessing|bless]] the people by holding an icon upright and making the [[sign of the cross]] with it over them.

===Western Christianity===
[[File:Interior, All Saints Church, Bolton - geograph.org.uk - 428400.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom, in its current form, in the parish church of [[Bolton, Cumbria|Bolton]] in [[Cumbria]], [[England]].]]
Until the 13th century, icons followed a broadly similar pattern in West and East, although very few such early examples survive from either tradition.  Western icons, which are not usually so termed, were largely patterned on Byzantine works, and equally conventional in composition and depiction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  From this point on the Western tradition came slowly to allow the artist far more flexibility, and a more realistic approach to the figures.

In the 15th century the use of icons in the West was enormously increased by the introduction of [[old master print|prints]] on [[paper]], mostly [[woodcut]]s which were produced in vast numbers.  With the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], after an initial uncertainty among early [[Lutherans]], [[Protestants]] came down firmly against icon-like portraits, especially larger ones, even of Christ.  Many Protestants found these [[Idolatry|idolatrous]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Catholics maintained and even intensified the traditional use of icons, both printed and on paper, using the different styles of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]].  Popular Catholic imagery to a certain extent has remained attached to a [[Baroque painting|Baroque style]] of about 1650, especially in [[Italy]] and [[Spain]].

In the [[Church of England]], the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms of the United Kingdom]] has been used like an icon, owing to its absence of human portraiture, as a representation of the sovereign as Head of the Church. It has been done in wood and stone as well as painted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasler|first=Charles|title=The Royal Arms – Its Graphic And Decorative Development| publisher=Jupiter|date=1980|pages=87,93,97}} Retrieved 29 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{expand section|date=November 2011}}
[[Image:Murudeshwar shiva.JPG|thumb|The [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]]. Note the ''[[damaru]]'' drum held in his back hand.]] {{Main|Hindu iconography}}
Images of [[Hindu gods]] and goddesses use a rich [[symbol]]ism. Some figures are blue-skinned (the color of [[heaven]]) or have multiple arms holding various symbols which depict aspects of the god.

==Islam==
{{See also|Islamic art}}
[[Muslims]] view sanctified icons as idols, and strictly forbid their worship, nor do they pray in front of one.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  However, the various [[divisions of Islam]] take different positions on the role of visual depictions of living (or once-living) creatures, including people.  At one end of the spectrum, sects such as the [[Wahhabi]]s totally ban drawings and photography.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Some branches of Islam forbid only the former but allow the latter.  The majority of [[Sunni]] Muslims permit both.  Some [[Shia]] allow even [[Depictions of Muhammad|the depiction of]] [[Muhammad]] and the [[twelve Imams]], a position totally unacceptable to most Sunnis.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Judaism==
It is commonly thought that the [[Judaism|Jews]] absolutely prohibit "[[Idolatry|graven images]]"; this, however, is not entirely true. There are numerous instances within [[Torah|the scriptures]] that describe the creation and use of images for religious purposes (the angels on the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the bronze snake [[Moses]] mounted on a pole, etc.). What is important to note is that none of these are worshipped as [[God]]. Since God is incorporeal and has no form, He cannot be depicted.  During the Late Antique period of [[Jewish history]] it is clear that restrictions on representation were relaxed considerably; for example, the synagogue at [[Dura Europas]] had large figurative wall paintings{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  It is also clear there was a tradition of painted [[scroll]]s, of which the [[Joshua Roll]] and the [[Utrecht Psalter]] are medieval Christian copies, none of the originals having survived{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}.  There are also many medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]s, especially of the [[Haggadah of Pesach]] ([[Passover]]).

A unique Jewish tradition of animal iconography was developed in Eastern Europe, which included symbolic depictions of God's attributes and powers as various animal scenes and plant ornaments in the [[wooden synagogues]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth]], as well as some mystical imagery on the gravestones. A part of the same imagery also appears on the [[Ashkenazic]] [[Shiviti|Shivisi]] - meditative images used for contemplation over God's name, not unlike the Eastern [[Mandala]]s.

Some synagogue wall paintings contained over 80 various animals, including lions, [[unicorn]]s, [[dragon]]s, lion-headed mermaids, [[three hares]], three intertwined fishes, [[Uroboros]], elephants, deer, leopards, bears, foxes, wolves, squirrels, turkeys, ostriches and many others.

God himself was usually represented as a two-headed golden eagle in the center of the Sun, painted on the ceiling of the synagogue, and surrounded by the Zodiac circle. This system was based on the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] symbolic tradition; unfortunately, the meaning of some forgotten symbols is hard to recover.

[[Thomas Hubka]] has traced the style of decorative painting in the wooden synagogues to the medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts of Ashkenazi Jewry, and its meaning to the Jewish mystical literature, such as the [[Zohar]] and the works of Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]].&lt;ref&gt;"Medieval Themes in the Wall-Paintings of 17th and 18th-Century Polish Wooden Synagogues," by Thomas C. Hubka, p. 213 ff. in ''Imagining the Self, Imagining the Other: Visual Representation and Jewish-Christian Dynamics in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, edited By Eva Frojmovic, BRILL, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7995">The '''repatriation and reburial of human remains''' is a current debate in [[archaeology]]. Various indigenous peoples around the world, such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[Indigenous Australians]] have requested that human remains from their respective communities be repatriated for reburial. A famous case is that of the [[Kennewick Man]] in the United States. Similarly, contemporary [[Neo-druidism|Druids]] have requested the reburial of ancient human remains in the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeology Live, English Heritage repatriation request notes. ''"a test case for the Druids to gain a precedent for more repatriations all over the British isles [sic]"'' |url=http://archaeological.livejournal.com/449932.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130626191502/http://archaeological.livejournal.com/449932.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 June 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repatriation in general seems to be concerned with objects, in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from human remains to [[art repatriation]]. But it actually is about people in the present and their perception of the past in the present. Repatriation claims are linked to politics, ethnic identity, and other debates or problems in contemporary society that have or claim to have a historical link to the object.

== Ethical considerations ==
The controversy comes from the fact that some believe that it is disrespectful to the dead and to their contemporary descendants for their remains to be displayed in a [[museum]] or stored in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre and Scarre (2006). ''The ethics of archaeology : philosophical perspectives on archaeological practice'', p. 206-208. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-54942-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The trauma of history ==
The first and foremost undercurrent of repatriation is the ill treatment of people in the past, the repatriation of human remains is to a degree part of a healing process bandaging the traumas of history.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence it is important that this ill treatment is addressed but with the repatriation and reburial of remains they are essentially lost to the world as a reminder of that part of the object's history or biography. Repatriation also presents an opportunity for people to lay claim to their own past and actively decide what is and what is not a part of their cultural heritage. The basis beneath the open wounds of history is the difference in treatment of remains that were seen as sufficiently other and could therefore be studied without any ethical considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 2. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contesting of ownership of human remains in museums and other institutions, and demands of return to cultural groups is largely fuelled by the difference in the handling of ‘white’ and indigenous remains. Where the former were reburied the latter were subjects of study and eventually ending up in museums. In a sense one cultural group assumed the right to carry out scientific research upon another cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1-3. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This disrespectful unequal treatment stems from a time when race and cultural differences had huge social implications. These are changing but the aftermath of centuries of inequality cannot be corrected so easily. This frustration is what partly fuels the repatriation and ownership claims that seem to have increased in the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The “traumas of history” can be addressed by reconciliation, repatriation and formal governmental apologies disapproving of conducts in the past by the institutions they now represent. A good example of a repatriation case is described by Thorton where a large group of massacred Indians is returned to their tribe, showing the healing power of the repatriation gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, R. (2002). Repatriation as healing the wounds of the trauma of history: cases of Native Americans in the United States of America. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''. C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). London and New York, Routledge: 17-25. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Druids and human remains==
The [[Neo-druidism|Neo-druidic]] movement is a modern religion, with some groups originating in the 18th century and others in the 20th century. They are generally inspired by either Victorian-era ideas of the [[druids]] of the [[Iron Age]], or later [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] movements. Some practice [[ancestor veneration]], and because of this may believe that they have a responsibility to care for the ancient dead where they now live. In 2006 Paul Davies requested that the Alexander Keiller Museum in [[Avebury]], [[Wiltshire]] rebury their [[Neolithic]] human remains, and that storing and displaying them was "immoral and disrespectful"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/12766795/Request_for_the_Reburial_of_Ancestral_Human_Remains_at_Avebury_Wiltshire_2008_&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] refused to allow reburial, but did allow for Neo-druids to perform a healing ritual in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consultation on ancient human remains ends Jan 31 |journal=British Archaeology |issue=104 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological community has voiced criticism of the Neo-druids, making statements such as "no single modern ethnic group or cult should be allowed to appropriate our ancestors for their own agendas. It is for the international scientific community to curate such remains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument proposed by archaeologists is that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Druids are not the only people who have feelings about human remains... We don't know much about the religious beliefs of these [Prehistoric] people, but know that they wanted to be remembered, their stories, mounds and monuments show this. Their families have long gone, taking all memory with them, and we archaeologists, by bringing them back into the world, are perhaps the nearest they have to kin. We care about them, spending our lives trying to turn their bones back into people... The more we know the better we can remember them. Reburying human remains destroys people and casts them into oblivion: this is at best, misguided, and at worse cruel."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4680">'''Research Committee on Sociology of Law''' (RCSL) was established in 1962 by [[William M. Evan]] ([[University of Pennsylvania]]) and [[Adam Podgórecki]] ([[University of Warsaw]]), with the support of [[Renato Treves]] ([[University of Milan]]) during the Congress of the [[International Sociological Association]] (ISA), which was held in Weshington D. C. Treves was elected as the first president of the RCSL, Podgórecki as the vice-president and Evan as the Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL aimed at "opening up a broader
range of opportunities for the participation of individual members in the activities of
the Association in the field of [[sociology of law]]".&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCSL was initially formed as a largely informal forum to encourage and facilitate exchanges between sociologists of law from different countries. A Board was created in 1968, formal by-laws were adopted in 1973, and regular election were organised once every fourth year.&lt;ref&gt;The RCSL Statutes (as modified in July 2009) are available at http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_Statutes_2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The RCSL also holds annual meetings, occasionally together with other similar associations such as the Law and Society Associations or the Socio-Legal Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;See the editoria by Johannes Feest, on the 40th anniversary of RCSL in RCSL Newsletter, Summer Issue 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual meetings are often devoted to specific theoretical and methodological themes, but space is reserved for organising sessions on general topics. The selection of themes and the call for papers are the responsibility of the RCSL Board and is carried out in cooperation with the local organising committee. The RCSL Board encourages countries not represented by its Board members to participate and to submit suggestions for organising its annual meetings.

Since the late 1960s, RCSL has supported the formation of permanent Working Groups, which focus on various research areas such as Comparative Studies of Legal Professions, Social and Legal Systems, Comparative Legal Cultures, Gender, Law and Politics, Law and Urban Space, Family and Human Rights, in order to promote research in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;For a complete list of Working Groups see: http://rcsl.iscte.pt/rcsl_wg.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 December 1988, the RCSL signed an agreement with Government of the Basque Country creating the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]] in [[Oñati]] which is located in the province of [[Guipúzcoa]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in the north of [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;See RCSL, ''30 Years for the Sociology of Law'', Oñati, IISL, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:University Onate.JPG|right|thumb|The University of Oñati which houses the International Institute for the Sociology of Law.]]

Since its establishment in 1962, the RCSL has contributed to the development of the [[Sociology of law]] by systematically promoting social scientific research about law, legal institutions and legal systems. For more information see the section on [[Sociology of law]] and the [[International Institute for the Sociology of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;For a worldwide overview of socio-legal scholarship, produced in the late 1980s, see Ferrari, Vincenzo (ed.), ''Developing Sociology of Law. A World-Wide Documentary Enquiry'', Milano, Giuffré, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Masayuki Murayama (Japan) is currently the President of the RCSL. Previous Presidents include Vittorio Olgiati (Italy), Anne Boigeol (France), [[Lawrence Friedman]] (Stanford, USA), Johannes Feest (Bremen, Germany), Rogelio Perez Perdomo (IESA, Caracas, Venezuela), Mavis Maclean (Oxford, UK), Vincenzo Ferrari (Degli Studi Milano, Italy), Jean van Houtte (Belgian), Jan Glastra Van Loon (the Netherlands) and Renato Treves (Italy).

'''Adam Podgórecki Prize'''

"In honour and memory of the lifetime achievements of [[Adam Podgórecki]] and his place in the history of RCSL, the Board of RCSL established the annual RCSL Adam Podgórecki Prize at its meeting in 2004. The Prize is awarded for outstanding achievements in socio-legal research, either in the form of distinguished and outstanding lifetime achievements in one year or in the form of outstanding scholarship of a socio-legal researcher at an earlier stage of his or her career, in the next year of the award."&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ee http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc12_prize.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4718">'''Sander L. Gilman''' (born February 21, 1944) is an American [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[history of literature|literary historian]].&lt;ref name="psp"&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/index.html Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his contributions to [[Jewish studies]] and the [[history of medicine]]. He is the author or editor of over ninety books.

Gilman's focus is on medicine and the echoes of its rhetoric in social and political discourse. In particular, Gilman investigates the constellations of medical, social, and political discourse that emerge at certain historical junctures.

==Academic career==

Gilman obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] from [[Tulane University]] in 1963, where he proceeded to gain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree, also in German, in 1968. He was a Professor at [[Cornell University]] (1976–1995), then moving to the [[University of Chicago]] for six years (1994–2000). He was then at the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago for four years, founding its Program in Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/Dr.%20GilmanCV%20updated%20Dec%2008.pdf Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was appointed a distinguished professor of the Liberal Arts and Sciences at [[Emory University]], where he was the Director of the Program in Psychoanalysis as well as of Emory University’s Health Sciences Humanities Initiative.  During 2017-8 he was the Alliance Professor of History at the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich.

In 2007 he was appointed Professor, Institute in the Humanities, Birkbeck College (London) and a Visiting Fellow of the new Institute of Advanced Studies, Warwick University, UK. He was president of the [[Modern Language Association]] in 1995.  He has been awarded a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) at the University of Toronto in 1997, elected an honorary professor of the Free University in Berlin (2000), made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 2008 and made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2016).

==Writing==
His ''Stand Up Straight! A History of Posture'' appeared with Reaktion Press (London) in 2018; his most recent edited volume is ''Jews on the Move:  Modern Cosmopolitanist Thought and Its Others'' published in 2018.   He is the author of the basic study of the visual stereotyping of the mentally ill, ''Seeing the Insane'', published by John Wiley and Sons in 1982 (reprinted: 1996) as well as the standard study of ''[[Jewish Self-Hatred]]'', the title of his Johns Hopkins University Press monograph of 1986."&lt;ref name="psp"/&gt;

===Freud===

He has examined [[Sigmund Freud]], addressing the question of what role, if any, was played by Freud’s Jewish origins in his composition of the psychoanalytic corpus. Gilman’s thesis concerning this subject is that the prejudices of biology in the nineteenth century classified the Jew as being somehow [[Femininity|feminine]], a [[social stigma|stigma]] that Freud sought to escape by carving out a scientific niche of his own. Licensed by his own brand of science, Freud could simultaneously lay claim to the [[manhood]] that the Viennese scientific establishment of the nineteenth century threatened to deny him, and also to the neutrality that was the warrant of its authority.

To make the case that contemporaneous [[anti-Semitism]] shaped Freud’s thought, Gilman provides a catalogue of the most egregious anti-Semitic stereotypes of the time and place, including straightforward documentation of certain anti-Semitic prejudices, such as the belief in Jewish [[male menstruation]],&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Sander. ''Creating Beauty to Cure the Soul''. 1998, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as period depictions of anti-Semitic [[stereotypes]] in graphic media.

==Editorial board membership==
Gilman sits on the Honorary International Advisory Board of the [[Mens Sana Monographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmonographs.org/aboutus.asp Member, Hon Int Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''semantic overload''' occurs when a word or phrase has more than one meaning, and is used in ways that convey meaning based on its divergent constituent concepts. Semantic overload is related to the linguistic concept of [[polysemy]]. Overloading is related to the psychological concept of [[information overload]], and the computer science concept of an [[overloaded expression]]. A term that is semantically overloaded is a kind of "overloaded expression" in language that causes a certain small degree of "information overload" in the receiving audience.

An example of this is the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''herri'' which can be translated as ''nation; country, land; people, population''; and ''town, village, settlement'',&lt;ref name=Aulestia&gt;Aulestia, G. ''Basque-English Dictionary'' (1989) [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] Press {{ISBN|0-87417-126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other things leading to difficulties in translating the indigenous term [[Euskal herria#Etymology|Euskal Herria]]. Another example is the term ''memory'', especially as used in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David C.|date=2005-02-15|title=The Abuses of Memory: Reflections on the Memory Boom in Anthropology|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/178196|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=78|issue=1|pages=197–211|doi=10.1353/anq.2005.0001|issn=1534-1518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Profanity|Expletive]]s are also notable for this quality, and conversely this quality is also a contributor to why such terms may be regarded as crude or inappropriate.

Meanings associated with a semantically overloaded word have different qualities: those the word itself [[reference|refers directly]] to, and other meanings [[Inference|inferred]] from its use in [[Context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolinger|first=Dwight|date=1971-01-01|title=Semantic Overloading: A Restudy of the Verb Remind|jstor=412376|journal=Language|volume=47|issue=3|pages=522–547|doi=10.2307/412376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language planning==
Minority languages that spread into new domains frequently suffer from semantic overloading by attempting to adapt existing terms to cover new concepts. One such example from [[Scottish Gaelic]] is the over-use of the word ''comhairle'' (originally "advice, counsel") for concepts such as ''committee'', ''council'', and ''consultation'' as exemplified by Donald MacAulay in ''dh'iarr a' chomhairle comhairle air a’ chomhairle chomhairleachaidh'': "The committee sought advice from the consultative council"—a sentence that is opaque in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Wilson ''Faclair na Pàrlamaid, a critical evaluation'' (2001) Department of Celtic and Scottish Studies, University of Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacAulay, Donald ''New Gaelic'' (1986) Scottish Language, 5, 120-25&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Marxian economics |Concepts}}

In the theoretical works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] and subsequent [[Marxist]] writers, '''socialization''' (or the '''socialization of production''') is the process of transforming the act of producing and distributing goods and services from a solitary to a social relationship and collective endeavor. With the development of capitalism, production becomes centralized in firms and increasingly mechanized in contrast to the pre-capitalist modes of production where the act of production was a largely solitary act performed by individuals. Socialization occurs due to centralization of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in industries where there are [[increasing returns to scale]] and a deepening of the division of labor and the specialization in skills necessary for increasingly complex forms of production and value creation. Progressive socialization of the forces of production under [[capitalism]] eventually comes into conflict with the persistence of relations of production based on private property; this contradiction between socialized production and private appropriation of the social product forms the impetus for the socialization of property relations (socialism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Marx's critique of political economy, as capitalism develops a contradiction emerges between the increasingly socialized act of production and the private ownership and appropriation of surplus value. Classical Marxist theory posits that this contradiction will intensify to a point where socialization of surplus value appropriation in the form of [[social ownership]] of the means of production will be necessitated, resulting in a transition from capitalism to [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;''Capital, Volume 1'', by Marx, Karl. From "Chapter 32: Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation": "Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor. As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the laborers are turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialization of labor and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the laborer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many laborers."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Karl Marx defined socialization as a general phenomenon where the labor process comes to embody the capabilities and constraints developed in society as opposed to private experiences, with objective socialization of the forces of production being the deepening of the social division of labor including specialization of skills and deepening interdependence between industries and regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhurst|first1=Chris|last2=Keep|first2=Ewart|last3=Grugulis|first3=Irena|orig-year=2004|chapter=Skill Trends Under Capitalism and the Socialisation of Production|title=The Skills That Matter|publisher=Palgrave|publication-date=February 27, 2004|page=242–260|isbn= 9781403906397|quote=.|date=2004-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Marxist theory ==
Socialization is a process that begins to take place in capitalism as large-scale manufacturing based on a vertical [[division of labour]] displaces "cottage industry" - the small-scale production shops, guilds and family-run businesses that existed in [[Feudalism|feudal economies]]. This process transforms the act of production into an increasingly social and collective process involving planning and greater coordination among producers, but appropriation of the social product in the form of private profit continues to be a private affair by investors and owners of the enterprise. Furthermore, exchange of the commodities produced is the private act of a small group of capitalists or an individual owner. As the process of socialization expands, a contradiction between the socialized nature of production and the individual nature of appropriation of the surplus product arises, coinciding with the obsolescence of the functions performed by the capitalists (the private owners).

The socialization and centralization of industry and capital under capitalism lays the foundations for a socialist economy. Socialism entails ownership of the socialized means of production by the workers engaged in the production either in the form of [[Worker cooperative|worker ownership]] or [[social ownership]] by all of society. The establishment of social ownership over the means of production resolves the contradiction between social production and private exchange/appropriation under capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Socialism: Utopian and Scientific'', by Engels, Friedrich. From "Part III: Historical Materialism": "Capitalist Revolution - transformation of industry, at first be means of simple cooperation and manufacture. Concentration of the means of production, hitherto scattered, into great workshops. As a consequence, their transformation from individual to social means of production — a transformation which does not, on the whole, affect the form of exchange. The old forms of appropriation remain in force. The capitalist appears. In his capacity as owner of the means of production, he also appropriates the products and turns them into commodities. Production has become a social act. Exchange and appropriation continue to be individual acts, the acts of individuals. The social product is appropriated by the individual capitalist. Fundamental contradiction, whence arise all the contradictions in which our present-day society moves, and which modern industry brings to light."&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Marx envisioned socialization under socialism as involving an expansion of [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] on the part of workers over their work processes, in contrast to the rigid hierarchy and bureaucracy that characterizes traditional capitalist enterprises. As workers gain more autonomy, they also gain more collective decision-making power and control over their work processes. Socialization of the ownership of the means of production is different from [[nationalization]], which can, but usually does not imply the socialization of the workplace. In a capitalist economy, socialization is limited because the socialized enterprise continues to operate in a commodity economy under the capitalist laws of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/o.htm#socialisation&lt;/ref&gt; Socialization therefore takes a different form in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] than in the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]].

==Background==
Increasing [[urbanization]] has caused problems with increased [[flash flooding]] after sudden rain. As areas of vegetation are replaced by concrete, [[asphalt]], or roofed structures, leading to [[impervious surface]]s, the area loses its ability to absorb rainwater. This rain is instead directed into surface water drainage systems, often overloading them and causing floods.

The idea behind SuDS is to try to replicate the drainage patterns of natural systems by using cost-effective solutions with low [[environmental impact]] to drain away dirty and [[surface water]] run-off through collection, storage, and cleaning before allowing it to be released slowly back into the environment, such as into water courses. This is to counter the effects of conventional drainage systems that often allow for flooding, [[pollution]] of the environment – with the resultant harm to wildlife – and [[groundwater contamination|contamination]] of [[groundwater]] sources used to provide drinking water. The paradigm of SuDS solutions should be that of a system that is easy to manage, requiring little or no energy input (except from environmental sources such as sunlight, etc.), resilient to use, and being environmentally as well as aesthetically attractive. Examples of this type of system are basins (shallow landscape depressions that are dry most of the time when it's not raining), [[rain garden]]s (shallow landscape depressions with shrub or herbaceous planting), [[Swale (landform)|swales]] (shallow normally-dry, wide-based ditches), filter drains (gravel filled trench drain), bioretention basins (shallow depressions with gravel and/or sand filtration layers beneath the growing medium), reed beds and other [[wetland]] habitats that collect, store, and filter dirty water along with providing a habitat for wildlife.

Originally the term SUDS described the UK approach to sustainable urban drainage systems. These developments may not necessarily be in "urban" areas, and thus the "urban" part of SuDS is now usually dropped to reduce confusion. Other countries have similar approaches in place using a different terminology such as '''[[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]]''' (BMP) and '''[[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low-impact development]]''' in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC (2006). [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=124 "Fact Sheet: Low Impact Development and Other Green Design Strategies."] 2006-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[water-sensitive urban design]] in Australia .

SuDS use the following techniques:
* source control
* [[permeable paving]] such as [[pervious concrete]]
* storm water [[detention basin|detention]]
* storm water [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]
* [[transpiration|evapo-transpiration]] (e.g. from a [[green roof]])

A common misconception of SuDS is that they reduce flooding on the development site. In fact the SuDS is designed to reduce the impact that the surface water drainage system of one site has on other sites.  For instance, sewer flooding is a problem in many places. Paving or building over land can result in flash flooding. This happens when flows entering a sewer exceed its capacity and it overflows. The SuDS system aims to minimise or eliminate discharges from the site, thus reducing the impact, the idea being that if all development sites incorporated SuDS then urban sewer flooding would be less of a problem. Unlike traditional urban [[stormwater]] drainage systems, SuDS can also help to protect and enhance ground water quality.

==History==
The first sustainable drainage system to utilise a full management train including source control in the UK was [[Oxford services]] designed by Robert Bray Associates, specialist SuDS consultants.&lt;ref&gt;CIRIA [http://www.susdrain.org/case-studies/case_studies/welcome_break_wheatley.html Oxford Motorway Services Case Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61931">The '''taxonomy of the Orchidaceae ([[orchid family]])''' has evolved slowly during the last 250 years, starting with [[Carl Linnaeus]] who in 1753 recognized eight [[genera]].&lt;ref name="linnaeus1753"&gt;Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von Linné). 1753. ''Species Plantarum'', 1st edition, vol. 2, pages 939-954. Holmiae: Impensis Laurentii Salvii (Lars Salvius). (A facsimile with an introduction by William T. Stearn was published by the Ray Society in 1957). (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|De Jussieu]] recognized the Orchidaceae as a separate [[family (biology)|family]] in his [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|Genera Plantarum]] in 1789.&lt;ref name=jussieu1789&gt;Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. 1789. "ORCHIDEAE" pages 64-66. In: ''Genera plantarum: secundum ordines naturales disposita,&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;'' (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olof Swartz]] recognized 25 genera in 1800.&lt;ref name=swartz1800&gt;Olof Swartz. 1800. "Afhandling om Orchidernes Slägter och deras Systematiska indelning". ''Kongliga vetenskaps academiens nya handlingar'' 21:115-139. (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Claude Richard]] provided us in 1817 with the [[Glossary of plant morphology|descriptive terminology]] of the orchids.&lt;ref name=richard1817&gt;Louis Claude Richard. 1817. ''De Orchideis Europaeis annotationes''. Parisiis, ex typographia A. Belin.&lt;/ref&gt; (See ''External links'' below). The next step was taken in 1830-1840 by [[John Lindley]], who recognized four [[subfamilies]].&lt;ref name=lindley&gt;John Lindley. 1830-1840. ''The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants''. Ridgeways, Piccadilly: London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally recognized as the father of orchid [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. The next important step was taken by [[George Bentham]] with a new [[Systematics|classification]], recognizing [[Tribe (biology)|subtribes]] for the first time. This classification was first presented in a [[Scientific paper|paper]] that Bentham read to the [[Royal Society]] in 1881.&lt;ref name=bentham1881&gt;George Bentham. 1881. page 288. In: "Notes on Orchideae". ''The Journal of the Linnean Society. Botany''. 18(110):281-367. (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pridgeon6&gt;Alec M. Pridgeon, Phillip J.

Dodson|Dodson]] (1960), [[Leslie Andrew Garay|Garay]] (1960, 1972), [[Jaap J. Vermeulen|Vermeulen]] (1966), again Dressler (1981).&lt;ref name=dressler1981&gt;Robert L. Dressler. 1981. ''The Orchids: Natural History and Classification''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-87525-8}}.

Dressler. 1993. ''Phylogeny and Classification of the Orchid Family''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-45058-4}}. 314 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

''Genera Orchidacearum'' was published in 6 volumes over 15 years, from 1999 to 2014.&lt;ref name=pridgeon6/&gt; It covers all of the known orchids, including a [[Taxonomy (biology)#Taxonomic descriptions|description]] of each genus. It reflects the considerable progress in orchid taxonomy that had been made since Dressler published his classification in 1993. In the 1990s, orchid taxonomy began to be influenced by [[molecular phylogenetics]] based on [[DNA sequence]]s. The first molecular phylogenetic study to include a substantial [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of orchids was published in 1999.&lt;ref name=cameron1999&gt;Kenneth M. Cameron, Mark W. Chase, W. Mark Whitten, Paul J. Kores, David C. Jarrell, Victor A. Albert, Tomohisa Yukawa, Harold G. Hills and Douglas H. Goldman. 1999. "A phylogenetic analysis of the Orchidaceae: evidence from rbcL nucleotide sequences". ''American Journal of Botany'' '''86'''(2):208-224. (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; The first classification that was based on [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA]] [[data]] was published by [[Mark W. Chase|Chase]] [[et alii]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=chase2003&gt;Mark W. Chase, Kenneth M. Cameron, Russell L. Barrett, and John V. Freudenstein. 2003.

''Orchid Conservation''. Natural History Publications, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia. {{ISBN|978-983-812-078-4}}. (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt;

An update to that classification was published by Chase et alii in 2015.&lt;ref name=chase2015&gt;Mark W. Chase, Kenneth M. Cameron, John V. Freudenstein, Alec M. Pridgeon, Gerardo A. Salazar, Cássio van den Berg, and André Schuiteman. 2015. "An updated classification of Orchidaceae". ''Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society'' '''177'''(2):151-174. (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt; This classification takes a different approach from ''Genera Orchidacearum'', by consolidating many of the tribes and subtribes, and by recognizing very widely [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] genera. As of 2015, Orchidaceae was not yet covered in [[Kubitzki system|''The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants'']], though most of the [[vascular plant]] families had been covered by that time.

The number of genera recognized in the family has varied from one classification to another. In ''Genera Orchidacearum'', many genera were consolidated, reducing their number to 765, smaller than in any previous modern classification.&lt;ref name=pridgeon6/&gt; In 2015, Chase et alii merged even more genera, reducing their number to 736.&lt;ref name=chase2015/&gt;

Useful resources include the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]]. [[Wikispecies]] ([[species:Orchidaceae|Orchidaceae]]) closely follows this source with modifications as they become accepted. [[The Plant List]] also has lists of genera and species, but no other taxonomic information.&lt;ref name=tpl&gt;The Plant List: Orchidaceae.

== History ==
The following [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] follows largely the [[Scientific classification|classification]] system of [[Robert Louis Dressler]], an [[orchid]] specialist and [[Adjunct professor|adjunct]] [[curator]] at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]]. This classification, published in 1981 in the book ''The Orchids: Natural History and Classification'', was widely accepted by [[botanist]]s and [[Floriculture|growers]] before the [[Academic publication|publication]] of ''Genera Orchidacearum''. The initial scheme of 1981 was modified in 1986, twice in 1990, and then again in 1993. This comprehensive classification relies heavily on [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], especially a few key [[Phenotypic trait|characters]], such as [[anther]] configuration and [[pollinarium]] structure. Consequently, many of the [[taxa]] are not [[monophyletic]].

Cladistic analyses, especially those based on molecular [[data]], provide a firmer basis for classification than [[intuition]], and the certainty (or uncertainty) of conclusions can be quantified by measures of [[Resampling (statistics)|statistical support]]. While our understanding of orchid [[phylogeny]] has greatly improved in recent years, the elucidation of orchid [[Phylogenetic tree|relationships]] is still ongoing.

When Dressler published his classification in 1993, the relationships of orchids to other [[monocot]]s was still unknown. Some of the first molecular phylogenetic studies of [[monocot]]s resolved the Orchidaceae as [[sister taxon|sister]] to the [[astelioid clade]] of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Asparagales]], but this result never had strong statistical support. It is now known that Orchidaceae is the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] [[clade]] in Asparagales, with the astelioid clade [[Speciation|diverging]] next.&lt;ref name="apgiii"&gt;{{Citation |last=Angiosperm Phylogeny Group |year=2009 |title=An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=105–121 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.00996.x }} (See ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apweb"&gt;Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). "Orchidaceae" At: [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]]. At: [[Missouri Botanical Garden]] Website. (see ''External links'' below)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[cladistic]] analyses based on morphological character states or on [[nucleotide]] sequences, the orchid family is a monophyletic group. The subfamilies recognized by Dressler, however, were not all monophyletic. Dressler's delimitation of subfamilies was contradicted by subsequent [[Research|studies]] of [[mitochondrial]], [[chloroplast]], and [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[DNA sequence]]s. In 2003, a new [[phylogenetic]] classification divided Orchidaceae into five subfamilies: Apostasioideae, Vanilloideae, Cypripedioideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae. These five subfamilies were all strongly supported as monophyletic groups in subsequent studies.

In 2003, the position of Vanilloideae remained equivocal. The subfamilies Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae clearly formed a monophyletic group and Dressler believed that their closest [[Affinity (taxonomy)|relative]] was Vanilloideae. In 2006, a study based on the [[plastid]] [[gene]]s [[rbcL]] and [[atpB]] found the closest relative of this pair to be Cypripedioideae, rather than Vanilloideae.&lt;ref name=cameron2006&gt;Kenneth M.

Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden. printed by Allen Press: USA.&lt;/ref&gt; This result had only weak [[maximum parsimony]] [[Jackknife resampling|jackknife]] support, but in a [[phylogenomic]] study in 2015, it received strong [[maximum likelihood]] [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] support.&lt;ref name=givnish2015&gt;Thomas J.

''Annals of Botany'' '''115'''(4):665-681. {{doi|10.1093/aob/mcu253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have been published. Phylogenies of several tribes and subtribes have also been published. Compared to previous classifications, more of the tribes and subtribes of Dressler were monophyletic, but not all of them were supported by subsequent studies.

In the classification that was published in 2015, the authors expressed doubt about their division of the tribes [[Orchideae]] and [[Vandeae]] into subtribes. The placement of the genera [[Pachites]], [[Holothrix]], and [[Hederorkis]] is especially problematical. The monophyly of the subtribe [[Cranichidinae]] is also in doubt. These authors singled out the tribe [[Podochileae]], as well as the subtribes [[Oncidiinae]], [[Goodyerinae]], and [[Angraecinae]] as being in special need of phylogenetic study. The basal epidendroids, especially the tribe [[Gastrodieae]], remain poorly sampled in phylogenetic studies.&lt;ref name=chase2015/&gt;

== Taxonomy ==
The orchid family ([[Orchidaceae]]) is subdivided into five subfamilies, and then into tribes and subtribes. Groups of closely related genera are sometimes referred to informally as [[alliance (taxonomy)|alliances]]. An alliance is a group of taxa, at any [[taxonomic rank]], but usually at the rank of genus or species, that are thought to be closely related. Alliances are designated provisionally and are not recognized in the [[ICNAFP]].

The subtribes are formally divided into genera. Some of the genera are divided into subgenera, and some of the subgenera are divided into [[Section (botany)|sections]]. All of the genera contain at least one species. A special [[Botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]] is used to name [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between different species.

About 150 species and about a dozen new genera were described each year from 2000 to 2015.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

According to [[Robert Louis Dressler|Dressler]], there are 5 subfamilies, 22 tribes, 70 subtribes, and about 850 genera of orchids. When he published his classification, only about 20,000 species of orchids were known. Several thousand have been described since then.&lt;ref name=tpl/&gt;

A distinction between monandrous flowers and others is especially important in the classification of orchids. A monandrous flower is one that has only a single [[stamen]]. The flowers are monandrous in the subfamilies Vanilloideae, Orchidoideae, and Epidendroideae. Like many others before him, Dressler believed that the monandrous orchids form a monophyletic group. It is now known that monandry [[Parallel evolution|arose twice]] in the orchids, once in Vanilloideae, and again in the [[common ancestor]] of Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae. The other subfamilies, [[Apostasioideae]] and [[Cypripedioideae]], have either three stamens or two stamens and a [[staminode]].

The following subfamilies are recognized:
*Subfamily [[Apostasioideae]]: monophyletic - the most basal of the orchids: three fertile [[anther]]s or two fertile anthers and a filamentous [[staminode]].
*Subfamily [[Cypripedioideae]]: monophyletic - two fertile diandrous anthers, a shield-shaped staminode and a saccate (= pouch-like) [[Labellum (botany)|lip]].
*Subfamily [[Orchidoideae]]: monophyletic - one fertile, monandrous, basitonic anther.
**(Subfamily Spiranthoideae): now accepted as nested within a more broadly defined Orchidoideae as the sub-tribe Spiranthinae of the tribe Cranichideae.
*Subfamily [[Epidendroideae]]: monophyletic - includes almost 80% of the orchid species; orchids with an incumbent to suberect (= ascending towards the edges) anther.
**(Subfamily Higher Epidendroideae (formerly Vandoideae): specialised clade within a more broadly defined Epidendroideae
*Subfamily [[Vanilloideae]]: monophyletic - an ancient clade now recognized as a distinct subfamily. Their phylogenetic position had long been controversial.

[[Cladistics|Cladistically]], the interrelationships of these subfamilies can be shown in a [[phylogenetic tree]] as follows:

==Subfamily [[Apostasioideae]]==
The subfamily Apostasioideae belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae).
All well-sampled molecular phylogenetic studies have produced strong [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] support for its position as [[Sister taxon|sister]] to a clade consisting of the other orchid subfamilies. Bootstraping is a method of [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]] for quantifying the statistical support for nodes in a [[phylogenetic tree]] (= a treelike diagram showing the [[evolution]]ary [[Biodiversity|diversification]] of [[organism]]s).

The apostasioid orchids are the most [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] orchids, with only two genera. ''Neuwiedia'' has three fertile, [[Glossary of botanical terms#abaxial|abaxial]] (= facing away from the stem) anthers, while ''Apostasia'' has two fertile abaxial anthers and a filamentous [[staminode]] (= a sterile stamen). Plants with mealy or paste-like pollen, which ordinarily are not aggregated into pellets, called [[pollinia]], with two or three fertile long anthers, leaves with [[Leaf sheath|sheathing]] bases, elongated staminode and [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]] similar to the petals.

These primitive features make them, according to some authorities, not true orchids but rather [[Symplesiomorphy|ancestors]] of modern orchids. However, more recent studies indicate that many of their differences with the other orchids were not inherited from a [[common ancestor]] with orchids, but [[autapomorphy|arose within]] the [[stem group]] of apostasioid orchids.

This is the largest subfamily, comprising more than 10,000 species in about 90 to 100 genera. Most are [[tropical]] [[epiphyte]]s (usually with [[pseudobulb]]s), but some are terrestrials and even a few are [[myco-heterotrophs]]. All show a unique development of the single anther: it is incumbent, meaning that it forms a right angle with the column axis or pointed backward in many genera. Most have hard [[Pollinium|pollinia]], i.e. a mass of waxy pollen or of coherent pollen grains; pollinia with [[caudicle]] and [[viscidium]] or without; [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] entire or 3-lobed; [[rostellum]] present; 1-[[Locule|locular]] [[ovary (plants)|ovary]]; leaves: [[distichous]] or spiraling

==Subfamily Higher Epidendroideae==
Formerly called Vandoideae, this is the second largest subfamily with over 300 genera in more than 5,000 species. They are mostly epiphytes, but include some terrestrials and myco-heterotrophs, all occurring in most tropical areas. The main stem grows in a single direction. Many of the species develop pseudobulbs (i.e. a bulge at the base of a stem), that are normally shorter and sturdier than those in the epidendroids. The striking characteristics of the vandoids are a cellular pollinium stalk (= stipe), superposed pollinia and the unique development of the incumbent anther, that bends early in development.

===Tribe [[Cymbidieae]]===
About 1,800 species in 100 to 130 genera. Species are either terrestrial or epiphytic, and range throughout global tropical regions. All species have, as a unique feature, a sympodial growth habit and two pollinia.

'''Vortextuality''' is a concept developed in the work of Garry Whannel, an academic thinker working in the area of the cultural analysis of media sport. Whannel uses this concept in his work to analyse and account for the ways in which some news stories acquire a rapid momentum, briefly dominating the mediascape and the [[blogosphere]].

In his book, ''Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Whannel, G|year=2002|title=Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh4THME06t0C&amp;pg=PT213|isbn=0-415-17038-9|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explained this term, noting:"The growth in the range of media outlets, and the vastly increased speed of circulation of information have combined to create the phenomenon of a "vortex" effect".

The vortextual effect produces a compression of the media agenda, in which other news items disappear from the agenda or have to be connected in some way to the dominant event. Developing this idea, Whannel observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Various media constantly feed off each other and, in an era of electronic and digital information exchange, the speed at which this happens has become very rapid.  Certain super-major events come to dominate the headlines to such an extent that it becomes temporarily difficult for columnists and commentators to discuss anything else.  They are drawn in, as if by a vortex."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whannel gives the example of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as an example of Vortextuality as this story dominated the media for days, to the extent that it removed most other items from the news agenda. Likewise, during global sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]], journalists and columnists with no expertise or pre-existing interest in sport comment on the event as Marshal et al. (2010) point out. Recent examples, of media vortextuality include the [[election of Barack Obama]] and the [[death of Michael Jackson]].&lt;!-- NOT PUBLISHED YET &lt;ref name=cp65&gt;Whannel, G.
