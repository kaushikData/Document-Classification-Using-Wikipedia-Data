The '''Accra Sport Stadium disaster''' occurred at the [[Ohene Djan Stadium]], [[Accra]], [[Ghana]] on May 9, 2001. It took the lives of 127 people, making it the worst stadium disaster to have ever taken place in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="deaths"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/public_agenda/article.php?ID=1504|title=Prosecution closes case on stadium disaster|date=June 23, 2003|accessdate=August 2, 2012|publisher=Ghanaweb}}{{dead link|date=June 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;!-- reserve url: http://www.ghanaweb.com/public_agenda/issue.php?PUBLISHED=2003-06-23&amp;CAT=4{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} --&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citifmonline.com/2017/05/09/may-9-victims-remembered-16-yrs-on-herbert-mensah-urges-discipline/|title=May 9 victims remembered 16-yrs on; Herbert Mensah urges discipline|last=Afanyi-Dadzie|first=Ebenezer|date=2017-05-09|website=Ghana News|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The tragedy ==
Ghana's two most successful football teams played that day, the [[Accra Hearts of Oak Sporting Club|Accra Hearts of Oak (The Phobians) Sporting Club]] and the [[Asante Kotoko|Asante Kotoko (Porcupine Warriors) Sporting Club,]]. Officials were anticipating crowd disturbances, and had taken extra security measures. Accra scored two late goals, and a referee called 2–1 Accra, resulting in disappointed Kotoko fans throwing plastic seats and bottles onto the pitch..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1322433.stm|title=Ghana mourns after football tragedy|date=May 10, 2001|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2011/05/09/2477743/may-9-2001-when-the-beautiful-game-became-ugly-in-ghana|title=May 9 2001: When the beautiful game became ugly in Ghana - Goal.com|date=2011-05-09|work=Goal.com|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/bmqnbv/fifteen-years-after-africas-deadliest-stadium-disaster-not-much-has-changed|title=Fifteen Years After Africa’s Deadliest Stadium Disaster, Not Much Has Changed|website=Sports|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police responded by firing [[tear gas]] into the crowd. Panic and a stampede ensued as fans tried to escape. Gates were locked and the stadium's compromised design left a bottleneck, with fewer exits than originally planned. Ghana Institute of Architects called the stadium a "death trap." After the hour-long ordeal, it was found that 117 deaths resulted from [[compressive asphyxia]] and 10 fans died from trauma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1322433.stm|title=Ghana mourns after football tragedy|date=May 10, 2001|newspaper=BBC|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2011/05/09/2477743/may-9-2001-when-the-beautiful-game-became-ugly-in-ghana|title=May 9 2001: When the beautiful game became ugly in Ghana - Goal.com|date=2011-05-09|work=Goal.com|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/bmqnbv/fifteen-years-after-africas-deadliest-stadium-disaster-not-much-has-changed|title=Fifteen Years After Africa’s Deadliest Stadium Disaster, Not Much Has Changed|website=Sports|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fan, Abdul Mohammed, had passed out from the tear gas and moved to a morgue, thought to be dead. He became conscious after someone stepped on his foot, narrowly missing a burial.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reports claim that medical staff had already left the stadium, as the incident happened near the end of the match. Some gates were locked, preventing escape.&lt;ref name="deaths" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/golf/artikel.php?ID=40742 |title=Investigate the murder of the Ya Na -NDC |date= August 7, 2003 |accessdate = August 2, 2012 |publisher=Ghanaweb }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAT&gt;{{cite news|title=Death toll rises to 126 in Ghana soccer stampede|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2001-05-09-stampede.htm|accessdate=6 June 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=19 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=125 killed in Ghana soccer crush|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/05/09/stadium.stampede/|accessdate=6 June 2015|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=10 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
An official inquiry blamed police for over-reacting with reckless behaviour and indiscriminate firing of [[plastic bullet]]s and tear gas. It also accused some officers of dishonesty and indefensible laxity. Six police officers were charged with 127 counts of manslaughter. The court ruled that the prosecution had failed to make a case and that the asphyxia may have been caused by the stampede and not the tear gas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1462508.stm|title=Ghana tragedy: Police to blame|date=July 29, 2001|accessdate=August 2, 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission of inquiry recommended improvements to stadium security and first aid facilities, and that nationwide rapid response teams should be set up.&lt;ref name="inquiry" /&gt;

Accra Sports Stadium was renovated in 2007 according to [[FIFA]] standards. Politics may have deferred the National Sports Council's attention to the stadium and 15 years later it again is in disrepair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Memorial ==

[[File:Stevic bounces the ball.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Umpire [[Matt Stevic]] bounces the ball in a game between [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[St Kilda Football Club|St. Kilda]], [[2011 AFL season|2011]].]]
A '''ball-up''' (pl. '''ball-ups''') in [[Australian rules football]] describes a method of restarting play at a neutral contest after a stoppage within the field of play. It is not to be confused with a boundary throw-in which occurs in most cases when the ball is forced out of bounds. Ball-ups may be considered to be the equivalent of a [[jump ball]], [[faceoff]] or [[dropped-ball]].  Historically they were performed in most cases by a [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|field umpire]] throwing the ball firmly into the ground such that it bounces directly upwards several metres into the air.  They are also known as bouncedowns.

The [[Australian Football League]] amended the rules prior to the 2013 season to instruct the umpires to only bounce the ball at the start of each quarter and after a goal is scored, and throw the ball vertically upwards at all other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-16/afl-keeps-interchange-uncapped-for-2013/4316160/?site=sport&amp;section=afl|title=AFL keeps interchange uncapped for 2013|date=16 October 2012|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously throw-ups were only used if ground conditions did not allow for the ball to be bounced effectively, or after a bounced ball-up is poorly executed and recalled (skewing in such a way that only one of the competing ruckmen is able to contest the ball).  The skill of being able to bounce an oblong shaped ball vertically upwards on a grass surface is unique to Australian Football and the difficulty has been blamed for deterring some from becoming umpires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A bid to beat bouncedown yips|first=Martin |last=Blake|date=1 May 2003|work=[[The Age]]|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/04/30/1051381998497.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball-up executed in the centre circle at the beginning of each quarter and after each [[Goal (sport)|goal]] is known specifically as the ''centre bounce''. Centre bounces are contested by one nominated [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]] from each team, who attempts to direct the ball to a teammate.

Ball-ups can also occur at other locations around the ground. Umpires often have to decide whether a player tackled while in possession of the ball had a prior opportunity to pass the ball before they were tackled; if so, they will pay a free kick for [[holding the ball]]. If there was no such opportunity, then the umpire will call for a ball-up. Ball-ups are also frequently called when players from both teams scramble for a loose ball and neither can clearly secure possession. At ball-ups which are not centre bounces, other players may help their ruckman in the contest by unexpectedly entering the contest and becoming the ''third man up''.

A ball-up is also called for if a defensive player moves outside of the goal square before kicking the ball back into play following a [[Behind (Australian rules football)|behind]]. In this case, the ball is bounced at the top of the goal square.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14241">The '''Best Play [[ESPY Award]]''' has been conferred annually since [[2002 in sports|2002]] on the play in a single [[regular season]] or [[playoff]] game contested [[professional sports|professional]]ly under the auspices of one of the four [[Major North American professional sports leagues|major North American leagues]] or [[college sports|collegiately]] under the auspices of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] adjudged to be the most outstanding or best.

Between 2002 and [[2004 in sports|2004]], the award voting panel comprised variously [[fan (aficionado)|fans]]; [[sports journalism|sportswriter]]s and [[Sports presenter|broadcasters]], sports [[corporate officer|executives]], and retired [[sportsperson]]s, termed collectively ''experts''; and [[List of ESPN personalities|ESPN personalities]], but balloting thereafter has been exclusively by fans over the [[Internet]] from amongst choices selected by the ESPN Select Nominating Committee.  The [[ESPY Awards#Ceremonies|ESPY Awards ceremony]] is conducted in July and awards conferred reflect performance and achievement over the twelve months previous to presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Because of the [[ESPY Awards#Timing|rescheduling]] of the ESPY Awards ceremony, the award presented in [[2002 in sports|2002]] was given in consideration of performance betwixt February [[2001 in sports|2001]] and June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years, the format has been: sixteen plays are placed in brackets (1 vs. 16, 2 vs. 15, etc.) The winners in voting then advance to the second round. The winners go to the finals, where voters select Best Play.

'''Bragg Memorial Stadium''' is a 25,500-seat football stadium in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], United States. It opened in 1957 and was renovated in 1982. It is home to the [[Florida A&amp;M Rattlers]] [[American Football|football]] team.&lt;ref name="FAMU1"/&gt;

==History==
Built in 1957, Bragg Memorial Stadium is home to Florida A&amp;M Football. The stadium is named in memory of two of the school's earliest figures in its storied intercollegiate athletic program—the "First Family of Rattler Football"—the father and son combination of Jubie and Eugene Bragg.&lt;ref name="FAMU1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bragg Memorial Stadium and The Galimore-Powell Field House|url=http://www.famuathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205111949|publisher=Florida A&amp;M University Athletics|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jubie Bragg was one of the school's first athletic directors, being one of the key figures in the football program gaining varsity status in 1906. He returned after a brief stint at Tuskegee to become the school's first head football coach and athletic director at FAMU from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1930 to 1932.

Bragg's son, Eugene, one of the school's first All-America gridders (1927), took over the reins of the program in 1934, coaching through 1935, when an automobile accident ended his life. Until the stadium's construction in 1957, the Rattlers played on a cow pasture south of the campus and then on a grass field, first known as Bragg Field located on a hill directly behind the current Gaither Gymnasium, where the present track and field complex is located.

The field was moved to that location, so that fans could use the bathroom facilities in the nearby dormitories. At the previous location in the cow pasture, it was a walk of a quarter mile to the nearest restroom. However, thanks to appropriations from the Florida Legislature, the all-steel stadium on the campus' westernmost edge was built in 1957. That configuration featured 10,500 permanent seats and bleachers elevated the capacity to 13,200.

But by the 1980s, the stadium had fallen into disrepair and had grown too small for the Rattler football program. The 1980 season saw the stadium condemned by the State of Florida engineers, prompting the Legislature (thanks to heavy lobbying by the FAMU Administration) to appropriate over a half million dollars for the stadium's renovation and expansion to begin 1981 with remodeling, to make the stadium suitable for crowds again.

To date, the largest single game attendance at Bragg Memorial Stadium was set in 1996 when 33,954 people were in attendance for the Homecoming football game against the Bears of Morgan State University.

===Renovations===
By 1982, the renovation and expansion had made the stadium a 25,500-seat facility with press box elevator, a $125,000 scoreboard with message center, a built-in sprinkler and drainage system, improved restroom, concessions and ticket booths and paved parking areas.

The project was completed in 1983, with the unveiling of the Galimore-Powell Fieldhouse, located adjacent to the stadium's south end zone.

On March 31, 2017, the Florida A&amp;M Athletics released information about an upcoming proposed renovation to Bragg Memorial Stadium. Upgrades would include, but may not be limited to: new coaches offices, meeting rooms, classrooms and a team meeting room totaling nearly 10,000 square feet. Additionally, renovations would fix certain structural issues that the stadium currently has, including repairing damaged columns in the stadium, as well as repairs to the stairs going into the stands. The proposed upgrades would also include an increase in seating from its current capacity at 25,500, to an improved 35,000, as well as the installation of 25 luxury suites and improvements to the fan experience, which could include better concession stands, retail sales areas and the inclusion of restaurants. No formal date has been set for construction to start on the facility; however, FAMU Athletics officials have stated funding for the improvements will be entirely from fundraising efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAMU Mulling a new Bragg Stadium|url=http://urbantallahassee.com/index.php/headlines/item/915-famu-mulling-a-new-bragg-stadium|publisher=Florida A&amp;M University Athletics|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design process begins on Bragg Stadium repairs|url=http://www.wctv.tv/content/news/622000-needed-to-repair-Bragg-Memorial-Stadium-406637825.html|publisher=Florida A&amp;M University Athletics|date=March 7, 2017|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2018, Florida A&amp;M Athletics announced the installation of AstroTurf to the Stadium. It's set to be in place by the beginning of the 2018 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.famuathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=25300&amp;ATCLID=211719301&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Jake Gaither Stadium Plan'''

In January 2018 the university released plans to relocate its football stadium to the south side of the campus and renaming it Jake Gaither Stadium. The Jake Gaither Stadium will open to the rest of the new south campus. This new, state-of-the-art establishment will be half dug into the sloping terrain, with a series of terraces accenting the building, allowing for crowds to enter from the campus. During a game, fans have full 360-degree access to the concourse. Rising from the field in three tiers, this 35,000 seat stadium pulls fans as close to the field as possible while keeping optimal site lines. The stadium will remain flexible for other sports such as soccer and lacrosse while featuring 20 Leasable Luxury Suites, 4 Non-leasable University-Utilized Luxury Suites, 16 Lounge Boxes, 1,076 Premium Club Seats and 3,000 Priority Seats.&lt;ref&gt;http://constructtwo.com/pinnacle/buildings/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The structure contains coaches' offices, conference room, equipment and training/treatment rooms (with X-ray machines), two locker rooms, one for each team, home and visiting, plus an official's locker room and a weight training room.

The '''Brumbrella''' was a large [[cricket pitch|pitch]] covering used at the [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]] from 1981 to 2001.&lt;ref name=conned&gt;''Cricket: Spectators conned by embarrassing lack of cover'', Jack Bannister, Birmingham Post, 9 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Its name is a [[portmanteau word]] derived from "[[Brummie|Brum]]"—a nickname for Birmingham, reflecting its location—and "[[umbrella]]", reflecting its function in protecting the pitch from rain.

The Brumbrella was praised and criticised - its speed of deployment helped groundstaff protect the pitch quickly, but as a flat protector, it was prone to "sweating". It was deemed to have contributed to the Edgbaston pitch's deterioration, and its demise was hastened by legislation against flat covers.

It was briefly replaced by "Son of Brumbrella", but today the groundstaff rely on manpower to manoeuvre the covers onto the Edgbaston pitch.

==Description==
The Brumbrella comprised a flat rainproof covering which was mechanically unrolled across the playing surface to protect the pitch and most of the outfield from rain.  The motorised roller was intended to allow the cover to be rapidly deployed in bad weather, and then removed when the weather improved, so play could continue as quickly as possible,&lt;ref name="ECB"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/77893.html | title=ECB's ban on flat covers hits Brumbrella | date=21 April 1999 | publisher=Cricinfo| accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was not always achieved:

{{quote|It stretched from one side of the ground to the other, across the full length of the cricket table and part of the outfield. At the time it was a very innovative piece of equipment, but had its problems. It was so heavy, and took so long to unroll, that it became impractical. By the time it had completed its journey, the shower that it was supposed to be protecting the surface from, had passed, dumping its load on the way! Eventually, when it broke down during a county game, it was decided to return to the more practical method of covering the entire cricket square and run ups with plastic sheeting and roll on roll off covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pitchcare.com/magazine/its-a-cover-up.html | title=It's a cover up! | last=Stretton | first=Bob | date=June–July 2009 | work=Pitchcare Magazine | number=25 | accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The original mechanism, a large section of [[North Sea oil]] pipeline wrapped with a [[tarpaulin]] and weighing some 6 tons, was installed in the winter of 1980 having been designed by Terry Rutter of Sports Ground Consultants.  The £43,380 cost was met by the [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]] Supporters' Association.&lt;ref name=shelter&gt;''Cricket: Brumbrella lends county shelter'',  Birmingham Post, 21 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It was first used during a heavy rain shower in [[England national cricket team|England]]'s second [[One-day International]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] on 6 June 1981.When the surface water had been removed by the roller wrapped cover, Umpire Dickie Bird met cover designer Terry Rutter on the pitch and said "let's get them back on shall we"?&lt;ref name=shelter/&gt; It was prone to malfunction once the cover fabric had been changed, notably suffering damage on the first day of the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1990|1990 Edgbaston Test match]], which prevented its use for the duration of the five-day match.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153149.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-moisture policy==
In 1999, the [[English Cricket Board|ECB]] introduced a policy against "flat" covers, which can encourage moisture to sweat out of a damp pitch, making batting [[sticky wicket|more difficult]], and opposing captains were given the right to object to its use.&lt;ref name=ECB /&gt; The Brumbrella continued in use for a little while longer, but, after 20 years of use, it was replaced in early 2001.&lt;ref name=ECB /&gt;  Parts were given away to Warwickshire clubs to use as covers, including Moseley Ashfield,&lt;ref name=shelter /&gt; and a "massive section" was acquired by Atherstone Town Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atherstonecc.co.uk/htm/season2001preview.htm |title=2001 Season Preview |publisher=Atherstone Town Cricket Club |accessdate=2009-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050227010538/http://www.atherstonecc.co.uk/htm/season2001preview.htm |archivedate=27 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brumbrella was also blamed, in part, for a deterioration in the condition of the Edgbaston pitch.

==Replacement==
The new mechanism—dubbed "Son of Brumbrella"&lt;ref name=shelter /&gt;—cost around £80,000 and was much lighter, weighing only one ton.&lt;ref name=ECB /&gt;  It had two motorised rollers, housed in trenches on either side of the outfield, and was operated by remote control.  However, it proved temperamental in use, and malfunctioned several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci//content/story/102712.html|title=Ostler enlivens another day of attrition at Edgbaston|last=Sheldon|first=John|date=2001-06-02|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It failed before the first [[County Championship]] match of the season against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] on 20–23 April, and a second time on 2 June, during the third day of Warwickshire's third home Championship match against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], and the groundstaff returned to manual covers for England's One-day International against [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] on 7 June.&lt;ref&gt;''Cricket: Brumbrella facing Edgbaston exit'', Ian Willars, Birmingham Evening, 4 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cricket: Brumbrella ruled out for one-dayer'', Birmingham Evening Mail, 5 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; However, the groundstaff struggled to deploy and remove manual covers quickly during the rain-affected [[the Ashes|Ashes Test]] on 5–8 July 2001.&lt;ref name=conned /&gt; The new Brumbrella was abandoned later that year and returned to its manufacturers, Tildenet, who refunded its cost to Warwickshire.&lt;ref name=delay&gt;Cricket: Warwicks delay move on cover at Edgbaston, ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', 9 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Edgbaston groundsman [[Steve Rouse]] subsequently explained that it became too heavy to use once it was covered with water.&lt;ref&gt;''Cricket: Pitch perfect and swing bowling'', George Dobell, Birmingham Post, 17 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Edgbaston now boasts a new rain protection system called a "Hover Cover" based on the Hovercraft principle, that covers the wicket only but also has flaps that roll out on four sides to also protect the rest of the cricket square, as seen live on UK television 7 August 2010, England v Pakistan 2nd test at Edgbaston&lt;ref&gt;David Lloyd commentary from Sky's coverage&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Since the Brumbrella's demise, Edgbaston officials have been "unable to find a suitable replacement they now have to rely on the fast legged groundsmen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/sports/features/cricket2.shtml | title=Cricket and the Weather | work=[[BBC Weather]] | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a [[Test cricket|Test match]] day, Rouse's "normal staff of six rises to around 20, the extra hands principally used for getting the pitch covers on and off quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/cricket/the_ashes/1414119.stm | title=Pitching in for the Ashes | last=Beauchamp | first=Steve | date=2001-06-29 |publisher=[[BBC]] | work =[[BBC Sport Online]] |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having been retired in 2001, the Brumbrella remains a point of reference for the efficient covering of cricket pitches: [[Derek Pringle]] in ''The Daily Telegraph'' and [[Mike Selvey]] in ''The Guardian'' both favourably compared the efficient performance of the groundstaff at [[Kandy]] during England's Test match against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in December 2007 to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/derekpringle/2327324/England-let-chance-slip-in-Sri-Lanka.html | title=England let chance slip in Sri Lanka| last=Pringle| first=Derek| newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] | date=2007-12-03 | accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/dec/03/cricket.englandcricketseries | title=Murali's menace offers ominous pointers for England| last=Selvey| first=Mike| newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=2007-12-03| accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cricketfieldingpositions.jpg|thumb|400px|right]] '''Cover''', alternatively '''the covers''', is a region of the field with respect to the batsman in [[cricket]].

The location of the cover region depends on a batsman's [[handedness]], but it is always a part of the [[Fielding (cricket)|field]] on the [[off side]] in front of the batsman, stretching from around slightly forward of square on the off side through an approximately twenty-degree sweep upward across the field. The diagram shows the location of the cover region for a right-handed batsman.

The [[Cover_drive_(cricket)|cover drive]] is considered one of the most graceful shots playable in the sport.&lt;ref&gt; Nicholas Hogg.

The '''cover drive''' in [[cricket]] is the act of stroking the ball through the [[Cover_(cricket)|covers]] with well-timed wristwork and conventional movement of the front foot toward the pitch of a delivery aimed at or outside the [[Stump (cricket)|off stump]].
The cover drive is considered one of the most graceful shots playable in the sport.&lt;ref&gt; Nicholas Hogg.
 [http://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1058018/on-beauty On beauty: Yes, it matters in cricket. But what is it?] The Cricket Monthly.&lt;/ref&gt; Batsmen able to master the cover drive are usually given especially high praise because of the shot's difficulty in execution and its requirement for exquisite timing. When played to perfection, the cover drive comprises a batsman's seemingly effortless wielding of the blade in a downward trajectory through the [[off side]], with the cricket ball gliding through infielders in the covers at pace toward the boundary at deep cover.

The stroke has historically been associated with gentlemanly play of the sport, particularly during the [[Golden Age of cricket|Golden Age of Cricket]] in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries when England still [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|distinguished between amateurs and professionals]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Marqusee. [http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/anyone-but-england-9781448216703/ Anyone but England: Cricket, Race and Class.] Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, '''amateurs''', or aristocratic cricketers, some of whom played for the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen]], prided themselves on proper, conventional off-side play, including the front-foot cover drive. '''Professionals''', or working-class cricketers, some of whom played for the [[Gentlemen v Players|Players]], were better-known for workmanlike shots through the leg side, including flicks around the wicket.

[[Sourav Ganguly]], [[Mark Waugh]], [[Damien Martyn]], [[Michael Vaughan]], [[Brian Lara]], [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Kumar Sangakkara]] and [[Herschelle Gibbs]] are widely known to have used the stroke in modern era of international cricket.

In [[field hockey]], each player carries a '''stick''' and cannot take part in the game without it. The stick for an adult is usually in the range 89–95&amp;nbsp;cm (35–38&amp;nbsp;in) long. A maximum length of 105&amp;nbsp;cm (41") was stipulated from 2016. The maximum permitted weight is 737 grams.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of Hockey 2015-2016&lt;/ref&gt;The majority of players use a stick in the range 19&amp;nbsp;oz to 22&amp;nbsp;oz (538&amp;nbsp;g - 623&amp;nbsp;g). Traditionally hockey sticks were made of [[hickory]], ash or mulberry wood with the head of the sticks being hand carved and therefore required skilled craftsmen to produce. Sticks made of wood continue to be made but the higher grade sticks are now manufactured from composite materials which were first permitted after 1992. These sticks usually contain a combination of [[fibreglass]], [[Aramid|aramid fiber]] and [[carbon fibre]] in varying proportions according to the characteristics (flexibility; stiffness; resistance to impact and abrasion) required.

==Early rules==
[[Image:Splice Handle Head.jpg|thumb|upright| Parts of hockey stick.]]

After centuries of different variations of field hockey (including a version in [[England]], sometime prior to 1860, in which, because of the very hilly heathland area in which it was played, a rubber cube and not a ball was used), the game became more organised and regularised.

By 1886, when an association of clubs was formed and the game became more standardised, the modern game as we know it began (and a white painted [[cricket ball]] had become the standard object to play with). The game had also by this time divided into various branches which developed as separate sports. [[Shinty]], a game popular in Scotland, uses both sides of a round stick with a curved end, which is shaped in a similar way to a walking stick; the Irish game, [[hurling]], uses both sides of a stick which is flat on both sides and shaped somewhat like bill-hook with an axe-like handle. [[Bandy]] also uses both sides of the stick. It was called "hockey on ice" in the beginning, as it was considered an ice variety of hockey. The stick in England, possibly because of the close association with it of cricket players, developed with a stick with just one flat playing side, the left face, below a round grip area—with the use of the right-face side, which is rounded, prohibited—an oddity that had a profound effect on the later development of the hockey stick and of the game itself.

There have been only three parts of a hockey stick ever named in the rules: the '''head''', the '''handle''', and the '''splice'''. Originally (until 2004) the handle was the part above the bottom end of the splice and the head was the part below the bottom end of the splice. Other terms in common use are "grip", which refers to the part of the stick held, particularly that area held with two hands when hitting the ball. Most sticks have a round grip which is covered in a non-slip, sweat absorbent, fabric tape. The handle remains rounded on the reverse, back or right hand-side but becomes gradually flat on the "face" side and also becomes wider, changing from a diameter of approximately 30&amp;nbsp;mm to a flat width of approximately 46&amp;nbsp;mm (the permitted maximum was 2 in—now 51&amp;nbsp;mm). This flat area above the curve of the head is generally referred to as the "shaft". The head of the stick is generally thought of as the curved part. The right side is called the face, the upturn the "toe" and the bend of the head where it joins the shaft the "heel". In recent times using the edges of the stick (as well as the face side) to strike at the ball has been permitted and thus "forehand edge stroke" and "reverse edge stroke" will be found in rule terminology. Forehand and reverse stroke refers to the taking of these strokes, from the right or left hand side of the body respectively, as the stick may be used "face up" or "face down" to make an edge stroke, the two edges of the stick are not separately named but simply referred to as edges.
 
Initially there were six rule requirements applying to the hockey stick:

*  The stick had to be flat on the playing side (the left side when the toe of the stick head is facing away from the user).
*  It had to be able to be passed completely through a two-inch (internal diameter) ring.
*  The stick was to be smooth (no rough or sharp edges).
*  The head of the stick was to be '''a)''' curved and '''b)''' made from wood.
*  A maximum and minimum weight were specified, 28 oz and 12 oz respectively.

During the 19th century, field hockey evolved in England. This evolution led to the creation of the Federation Internationale de Hockey (FIH) in 1924.

Contance Applebee is responsible for introducing field hockey to the United States in 1901. The United States Field Hockey Association was formed in 1922.

In 1908, men's field hockey was introduced into the Olympic Games. Women's field hockey was first recognized in the Olympic Games in 1980.

The World Cup is the crowning achievement in international field hockey. The World Cup is held every four years and 12 men's and 12 women's teams compete for the title of World Champion.

==Head length==

[[Image:Head Overlays.jpg|thumb|150px|Hockey stick head overlays]]
[[Image:Short_Reverse_Variation.jpg|thumb|150px|The extreme in short heads]]

when im sterring at a page when im haching out a plot The first major devements to what was later termed the "English style" stick (and the method of play with such sticks) occurred in India. (The game in its modern form was apparently brought to India by the British Army, although there does not appear to be any specific evidence of this. But certainly hockey was played by the British forces in India.) At that time the stick head was very long  (in excess of 12"—300&amp;nbsp;mm) and made from an indigenous British timber, [[Fraxinus|ash]]. The Indians then produced sticks with a much shorter head length and a tighter heel bend and used [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]], which is tougher than ash, but has similar bending characteristics and weight and is easy to work. This development changed the nature of the game, led to the "Indian dribble" and to Indian dominance of the game in the first half of the twentieth century.

A hockey stick is occasionally used in the vertical position shown, but manipulating the movement and the direction of the ball in a controlled way (dribbling) is carried out in what is termed a "dribbling crouch", when the handle of the stick will usually be angled between 35° and 55°. Hitting or pushing the ball can be done with the stick at any angle between the vertical and horizontal and recent changes to the rules allow even the edges of the stick to be used to sweep or strike at the ball on the ground. 
The various stick head designs can be compared in respect of how, with the handle at an angle of 45°, they differ in the carrying out of the Indian dribble, i.e. controlling the direction of the ball by rotating the stick head over the top/front of the ball rather than (or as well as) around the back of the ball (the English style dribble). The multi-layered stick head diagram indicates the changes in head shape and length that occurred over thirty years or so.

The earliest trend was in shortening the stick head. While that reduced the stopping area of the head it was beneficial because, according to the rules at the time, only one side of the stick head could be used (at that time the ball could not be played with the edges of the head or handle but with the flat side or face side only).

Using extreme examples is useful as a means of demonstrating effects that occur in less extreme configurations but are much more difficult to spot and therefore to explain. The first observation is an easy one (top left in the image captioned "Reversed head in various…"). If the stick head is rotated onto the reverse (lighter colour) the toe is not going to disappear into the ground to enable the reverse side of the stick to be presented to the ball—a vertical adjustment is necessary.  Secondly (top right), if the handle of the stick is kept at exactly the same angle and rotated, a horizontal adjustment is necessary to bring the reversed head to a position where contact will be made with the ball. The third figure (bottom left) shows these adjustments having been made (and a change to the angle of the handle because the position of the hand holding the stick at the top would be about the same as it is when gripping the stick in the forehand position), but the area of stick head making contact with the ball is very small; so control may not be adequate. The fourth figure (bottom right) demonstrates that to get good contact with the ball on a larger area of the reversed head, it is necessary to move the handle much nearer to the vertical. This means the player must bring the ball in very close to the feet and come to a more upright dribbling position—this in turn impairs the ability to scan the pitch and keep the ball in peripheral vision at the same time—a considerable disadvantage when dribbling to evade opponents.

So, although the long head stick was an adequate shape for a dribbling style which was based on moving the ball forward from directly behind the ball; and changes of direction could be achieved by rotating the stick around the back of the ball and/or moving the feet to either side of the ball, it was not so easy to use the long stick head to bring the ball across the feet and back again, particularly when it was placed wide to the left of the feet of the player. (This left side position was compounded in difficulty with a very severe interpretation of "obstruction", which prohibited shielding of the ball from an opponent. The game was also, at the time, seen as "right-sided" and positioning the body between the ball and a close or closing opponent, approaching from the right hand side, was not allowed.)  Reversed stick hitting, pushing and flicking would be short range skills and difficult to do accurately, if at all, especially when moving at speed.

Gradually over many years stick heads were made shorter and the "heel" was made to a tighter bend. This process continued until the "one piece" head could not be made to a sharper bend without the timber splitting out on the base. As it was, attempts to have the grain follow entirely the same curve as the bend, as it should for maximum strength (this is why the timber is bent rather than cut to shape) were abandoned by some producers and an upturn to the toe was sometimes achieved by cutting across the wood-grain at the toe end of the head to achieve the desired shape. Some manufacturers resorted to gluing a separate piece of wood on top of the toe or glued additional strips of timber to the inner edge of the handle above the head to get the effect of a tighter heel bend. ("Head adjustment" frequently happened to update old style stock or where unmodified presses were in use.).

Some players were cutting part of the toe off their sticks, to achieve a shorter head, and rounding the end off, (although on the older styles this did nothing to tighten the bend to the heel and often just ruined the stick). Predictably, there were sticks produced for the 1986 World Cup with heads with a horizontal length of only 95&amp;nbsp;mm. The international players to whom they were handed out tried them and then returned them as unusable.

The difficulty was twofold: 1) The toe was so short that it could not be rotated completely over the top circumference of the ball and 2) When the stick head was played around the back of the ball it "ran off", because there was insufficient "run length" to the stick head. If, for example, a player "propped" the ball while moving in a dribbling crouch (putting the stick head over the front of the ball), drew the ball back towards his feet and then took the stick head around the back of the ball to bring it forward again, perhaps moving the ball off in another direction (a common movement), the margin for error was so small that the ball could easily slip off the stick head. The ultra-short stick head was to some extent based on the idea that the new artificial surfaces would lead to a style of hockey based on stopping the ball with the handle of the stick near horizontal to the ground and that dribbling to elude opponents would be almost eliminated with near continuous passing of the ball. Although there was a development of "system hockey" that overcame the stick/ball skill deficiencies of the Europeans compared with India and Pakistan at the time, it was not as fluid as the kind of one and two touch passing game common in soccer and that ideal was (and still is) a long way off.

==The hook==
[[Image:Grays Hook 86 .jpg|thumb|"Hook" manufactured by Grays circa 1986]]

In 1982 a Dutch inventor, Toon Coolen, patented a hockey stick with a "hook" head. The hockey stick manufacturers Grays took the design up in 1983 and the first mass-produced hockey sticks, with laminated timber head parts, were manufactured in Pakistan. This new design was possible because of the development of epoxy resin glues that did not require perfectly dry timber for bonding and curing to a strength that could cope with the immense stresses placed on a stick head when a hockey ball is struck with it.

By 1993 the "Hook" patent, had been ruled (following a court case in Germany) to protect only hook shapes within 20° of the vaguely written "nearly 180°" (referring to the degree of upturn of the toe in relation to the shaft of the stick in the patent description; the shaft of the handle being described a being bent through "nearly 180°" to form the hook shape of the stick head). That opened the way for the appearance of more J-shaped stick heads and the gradual morphing of the "midi" shape with the hook shape. In that year also a patent application, lodged in Pakistan in 1987 by Martin Conlon, for a kinked shaft hockey stick, with a set-back head (which was also hook shaped, but not to "near 180°"), was granted after strong opposition in Pakistan. (Indian and UK patents had been granted in 1988, although the same company had also opposed the UK patent application). Mr. Conlon designed and imported to the UK the first J-head sticks in 1990 but, prior to the 1993 decision, other distributors and manufacturers had been very reluctant to order made or produce hook style sticks of any sort, because of uncertainty about the strength of the patent that "ring-fenced" the hook hockey stick.

==The "midi" head==
[[Image:One-Piece-&amp;-Midi-.jpg|thumb|Comparison of "One-piece" and "midi" style stick heads]]
[[Image:Original_'Hook'_and_'Shortie'.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of horizontal head length of "hook" and a standard short head stick]]
[[Image:English &amp; Utra Short.jpg|thumb|right|"English" stick head and the "Ultra Short"]]

The death knell of the ultra short head was sounded in 1986, due to the introduction of the midi head shape, produced with a laminating process; although of course many players continued to use "one-piece" short head sticks for many years after that date and many thousands more of them were manufactured. The reason for the continued use of the one piece was that the midi length was similar to that of the more popular one piece stick heads that had been around for the previous ten or so years. Some one piece constructions were still being produced on presses on which the central boss had not been modified and the heel bend was "slower" than on that of the production of the more aware manufacturers, but the more "go ahead" manufacturers were producing a one piece that could compete well with the laminated midi—at least as far as playing functionality was concerned.

The biggest casualty of the midi was the patented Hook produced by the same company. It had not taken off in the UK culture of the short-head stick and for a number of years after the midi was introduced the Hook was seen as something of a novelty, even as an indoor stick or a stick exclusively for goalkeepers. In fact versions of it were produced specifically for goalkeepers, with a very extended toe (6 in—150&amp;nbsp;mm or more) and that development continued until some were made with the toe extending nearly the length of the handle and the FIH stepped in and ruled that the vertical toe limit was in future to be 4 in (100&amp;nbsp;mm).

The hook was 124&amp;nbsp;mm, measured horizontally across face of the stick head, when the handle was held vertically; the midi was 113&amp;nbsp;mm; many one piece heads between 110&amp;nbsp;mm and 115&amp;nbsp;mm, and the unusable ultra short 94&amp;nbsp;mm. A difference of only 30&amp;nbsp;mm between the head length of a stick that was considered cumbersome (although the Hook also had the height of the toe causing a feeling of imbalance) to one that was considered too short to easily play with. There were still many players playing quite happily with a stick with a head length of 7 in (175&amp;nbsp;mm), but players buying new sticks were now conscious of quite subtle differences in stick feel and performance due to length, shape, and the distribution of head weight—not just the total ounce weight and the "swing weight or balance" of the stick—and for the first time, in the years after 1986, were being offered a wide range of hockey sticks from a greatly increased number of manufacturers, from which to choose what suited them. After the arrival of the laminations, some brands were offering as many as ten different shapes or styles of stick head on the traditional shaft. The arrival of composites would complicate the picture further.

In the early 1990s there were an astonishing number and variety of hockey sticks on offer compared with what had been available ten years earlier. By 1992, hockey stick reinforcement was a big issue and composites had been accepted into an (extended) FIH experimental trial period (there was a great deal of concern about the power generated by these new reinforcements and the safety of players). There were also hockey sticks with metal handles and inserted plywood heads (made by the American company Eastons, better known for making baseball bats), as well as the wide range of one piece head sticks still produced and an expanding range of laminated midi and laminated shorties. The metal handled sticks were later banned for "safety reasons", in what was widely regarded as a political move by the FIH.

==Heel bend, ball position, hitting &amp; stopping==

It may be noted from the diagram above that no matter how "tight" the heel bend, reversing the stick head over the ball, with a "traditional" style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and horizontal adjustment of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than in the middle of the shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.

One of the incidental effects of the tighter heel bend of the modern stick is an increase in playing reach with the optimum striking or stopping part of the head of the stick when used in the normal range of playing angles. Held parallel the distance between the curve of the base of the stick head and the top of the handle is the same in the two sticks illustrated. At an angle of 45°, as shown, there is a difference of approximately 3&amp;nbsp;cm.

[[Image:Slow and tight heel bends jpg.jpg|thumb|left| Tighter bend giving greater hitting and stopping reach]]

[[Image:Face Ball combinations.jpg|thumb|150px|Ball positioned mid-face of long head and ball positioned against face of modern hook]]

The positioning of the ball mid-face on the stick head of the modern stick, compared with the mid-face position on the longer stick, also brings the middle of the ball much closer to a line projected through the centre of the handle and the circumference closer to the back edge of the stick, enabling better close control of the ball.

[[Image:English style vert ball stop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"English" style stick held vertically]]

It will be appreciated after a glance at the illustration of the 'English' style hockey stick that stopping a ball on the ground with the handle held vertically would not be easy. If the ball is lined up centrally with the centre of the handle (red) it would be likely to deflect off the heel side of the head. Even with the ball positioned central to the head (blue) stopping would not have been very secure with an upright handle.[[Image:English style ball stopping.jpg|thumb|right| Stopping and hitting with the 'English' head]] Presenting the stick at an angle of 35° or more (40° in the illustration) solves the problem of the ball running off the head by presenting a very long area behind the ball (relative to the width of the ball) but presents the problem of the best or optimum position to stop the ball for the following action. For hitting the optimum positions seems to be where a line projected through the leading edge of the shaft of the handle passes through the centre of the ball because it is the position closest to the centre line of the handle where the entire width of the head is behind the ball. Stopping the ball closer to the toe of the stick is acceptable but not optimal, as adjustment, which takes time, is necessary before the next intended action. [[Image:Modern Ball stopping.jpg|thumb|right| Stopping and Hitting]] In the modern stick the vertical handle position is still not as secure as an angled presentation of the handle but the angle now can be considerably less, because of the tighter heel bend and the stopping and hitting positions of the ball are easier to determine. The line of the leading edge of the handle still projects close to the center of the ball when the angle of the stick handle is in the 30°–50° range and a line through the centre of the handle will project to the back and underside of the ball.

==Set-back heads, ball position &amp; stopping==

[[Image:Modern Hook and Set-back.jpg|thumb|left| Vertical stopping position Set-back on Hook]]
[[Image:Head length -ball range.jpg|thumb|right|Ball positions on stick heads between "slow heel" and "set-back".]]
The illustration called 'Stopping and Hitting' shows that when a vertical stick shaft is aligned to the centre of the ball part of the ball protrudes to the heel side, this would happen even if the heel was not a bend but a 90° corner and the only way to cover the entire ball with the shaft held vertical is to use a set-back head—that is a head that is set-back to the heel side of the shaft.

A stick with a set-back head and toe-side protrusion, with the handle positioned vertically, covers substantially more of the ball and can reduce off heel deflection errors in stopping. Using the set-back head in the more comfortable or natural stopping angle puts a vertical area of shaft above the ball while at the same time aligning centre ball and a line projected through the centre of the handle.

In the upright hitting position, which is generally between 15° and 25° off vertical, the heel bend of the Indian stick of the 1970s will cover the whole ball. As the heel bend gets tighter in the 1980s and 1990s the ball is controlled closer to the centre line of the stick but it is not until the setback stick appears that the centre of the shaft is aligned (or nearly so) with the centre of the ball. The ball appears to move back along the length of the various stick heads as the heads become shorter and the heel tighter, in fact the playing position of the ball is moved further and further from the feet as playing reach is increased.

[[Image:Set-back and Conventional vert stop..jpg|thumb|left| Setback head without shaft protrusion on conventional head.]]
[[Image:Recurve and 'kinked' shaft..jpg|thumb|right|upright|Setback comparison of "recurve" and "kinked shaft" sticks]]
 
There are presently two styles of outfield set-back stick, the degree of setback to the head is a feature they have in common; they differ in that one has a 'kink' or shaft protrusion on the toe side above the head of the stick while the other does not. In the goalkeeper versions some also have the toe of the head cut flat (parallel to the handle) rather than rounded to allow the user to present  the stick closer to the ground when stopping in a horizontal position on the reverse side, this is to more easily prevent the ball from going under the handle of the stick.

==The modern hook==

In the mid-90s the "hook" head style hockey stick was relaunched, this time by the former German U21 International player Thomas Kille. Bright colours, bold graphics and painted heads were introduced. Manufacturers became much more aware of the look of their products and hockey sticks sold, particularly to new players, as much on colour and fashion as strength and usability.

[[Image:Original &amp; New Hooks.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of original hook shapes with modern designs.]]

Today, across many brands, there is a choice of angle of hook upturn, 45°, 60°, and 75°. A style of stick that almost no-one in Europe wanted to use in 1987, is today used almost universally; it is difficult now to find a player who is not using a hook style hockey stick and many of them have never used the "shortie" style at all; just as many of the players of today have never played hockey on a natural grass pitch—the development of artificial surfaces has also had a significant effect on the ways in which hockey sticks are used.

The original version, the 'Hook' relied on a patent description that put the inner side edge of the toe parallel (or nearly so) to the facing edge of the handle. The vertical height of the toe was approximately 80&amp;nbsp;mm (dotted line) '''Fig.1''' and it was of almost uniform thickness with the remainder of the stick head.

Early modification '''Fig. 1.''' reduced the horizontal head length to approximate 115&amp;nbsp;mm and the 'toe height' to approximately 75&amp;nbsp;mm. A hockey ball is between about 71&amp;nbsp;mm and 75&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter (224–235&amp;nbsp;mm in circumference)—so that put the 'toe height' at the same height as the maximum height of the ball. This is a common feature across hook head designs today, the toe generally varies in height, between the minimum and maximum height of the ball, when the handle is in a vertical position.

The next development was a hook with a toe with an inner edge that sloped away from the handle by approximately 30° (a 60° angle to the ground or a 150° 'upturn'. The 'toe height' was 75&amp;nbsp;mm. (Modern versions '''Fig. 2'''  vary between 70&amp;nbsp;mm and 75&amp;nbsp;mm. in toe height.) The horizontal length of the head was based on the length of the 'standard' one-piece short-head stick, approximately 110&amp;nbsp;mm. and modern versions seem to vary between 110&amp;nbsp;mm and 115&amp;nbsp;mm. The mid-90s saw the introduction of the more 'open' hooks '''Fig. 3''', some at 45° and a significant increase in horizontal head length, some as much as 120&amp;nbsp;mm.

New names have been coined to describe the various hook shapes but there is much confusion and overlapping of names. 'Maxi' and 'Mega' are also terms for styles of hook shape but there is no common agreement about what these terms mean outside of each 'brand' name that employs them: what one brand terms a midi another calls a 'hook' but, basically, there are three types of hook. The near symmetrical 'U', a 'tight' or 'closed' toe shape, between 60° and 75° and an 'open' shape of 45°–55°. Where the toe is shorter the same toe angles are generally referred to as midi.

==Set-back stick heads==
[[Image:Handle Curve &amp; AREC.jpg|thumb|left|The curve to the 'heel' side of the handle]]

The big headed 'Hook' also suffered for a short time from the appearance at the 1986 World Cup of the first sticks with set-back heads. There was not a significant impact but it (and others) added to the general confusion, as apparently 'everyone and his dog' were presenting new ideas in head shape. (Metal handled and fully composite sticks had not yet made an appearance so at the time the 'battle' was about head shape and length rather than materials and to a lesser extent, because hockey players at the time tended to be more 'traditionalist', the head/handle configuration. Even reinforcement with fiberglass and carbon fibre was not the issue it was later to become.

One hockey stick produced by AREC for the French inventor, Jean Capét, had the centre of the handle aligned with the centre of the horizontal length of the head. There was a lot of promotion based on 'rotational balance' and the 'sweet spot' and 'power hitting'. The 'Hook' certainly felt out of rotational balance, especially to those who had been playing with short-head sticks that had been made with a very thin toe, so as to concentrate the weight of the head closer to the shaft.

Aligning the centre of the handle with the centre of the horizontal length of a short-head, rather than with the centre of the ball created some unusual playing characteristics, for example, the reversed-stick ball position being further from the feet than the forehand ball position, which is the opposite of what happens with a conventional 'traditional' handle head configuration. (When the centre line of the handle aligns with the centre of the ball—or very nearly so—there is no or very little difference in ball position in relation to the stick or the feet of the player between the forehand and reverse playing positions.)

The AREC stick was initially produced without a significantly upturned toe and had a short horizontal length (approximately 105&amp;nbsp;mm), it was in this regard similar to standard short-head sticks of the time. The lack of an upturned toe, combined with the unusual reverse ball position, caused some difficulty in adapting to the stick and when the horizontal head lengths of sticks began to be made longer, by popular demand. A stick with the handle aligned to the centre of the head length was no longer practical for playing hockey. Manufacture of it as an outfield stick ceased in the early 1990s, probably by 1992 but similar sticks, by other manufacturers, have appeared for goalkeeper use.

==Kinked-shaft &amp; recurve heads==
 
The traditional small arc to the heel edge of the hockey stick had the effect of setting the stick head back slightly. This aspect of stick design (of which the AREC hockey stick was an extreme example) was first explored just prior to the Men's [[Hockey World Cup]] of 1986 and resulted in the production of hockey sticks with a stick head considerably more set-back in relation to the handle. The original design, aligning the centre line of the handle with the centre of the ball, in the common striking position,  featured a counterbalancing "kink" or protrusion to the handle on the toe edge of the handle, just above the head of the stick. This invention of the kinked-shaft and set-back head stick led directly to rules governing the amount of bend or "permitted deviation" to the "edge sides" of the hockey stick handle. Some of these were later termed "recurve" heads (a description given to a later style, produced by an Australian manufacturer, without the patented kink feature.)

[[Image:Snakecompa.jpg|thumb|upright|The extremes]]

The early extremes in stick design were in those sticks intended for use by goalkeepers. The aim was simply to present the maximum stopping area to the ball. The first was the extended hook (far left), which was made with a toe of approximately 150&amp;nbsp;mm (6&amp;nbsp;in). When sticks with an upturn substantially more than that (some more than half the length of the handle) began to appear, which was around 1988, the FIH placed a limit of 100&amp;nbsp;mm (4") on the upturn of the toe of the head.

In 1990 a plywood cutout of a stick with multiple kinks in the shaft was presented to the FIH for comment, the intention was to produce it as a goalkeeper's stick. Having limited the toe upturn only two years previously the FIH saw this as mockery and issued a press release, in April 1990, proposing a ban on all hockey sticks with "non-straight" handles to take effect after the Barcelona Olympics of that year. There was protest from those who had been marketing sticks with set-back heads and or kinked shafts and it was in any case not a sensible proposal because there is no such thing as a hockey stick with a perfectly straight handle. The result was the withdrawal of the proposed ban and the imposition of "limits of deviation", which permitted one bend to either side of the handle to a maximum of 20&amp;nbsp;mm on each side. In 2000 a diagram explaining the permitted deviation was included in the Rules of Hockey. Previously the only restraint on the configuration of a hockey stick was that it had to pass through a ring of 2" diameter (later adjusted to 51&amp;nbsp;mm—2 in rounded up to the nearest millimeter).

==Permitted deviation ==
Although permitted deviation (from the straight) to the edges of a hockey stick (handle) were included in the 1991 Rules of Hockey, a diagram of a hockey stick, to illustrate what was permitted was not included until 2000 and then it was a part stick diagram placed horizontally on a page smaller than the A6 page of the present rulebook. The diagram was very poorly drawn but it was a significant step for the FIH to include it at all. The diagram remained unchanged until 2004, when the orientation was altered so that the stick was shown upright and it was also shown full length. The x-axis (previously vertical) became the ground plane and the y-axis a vertical line through the centre of the handle. Further improvements to the diagram (particularly the drawing of the representation of the stick and an illustration of possible curves to the handle) were made in 2006 and a second diagram, detailing head configuration, was added.

[[Image:Hockey Stick Variation.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Limits of deviation with sample of an actual stick superimposed in green.]]
[[Image:Permitted deviation 2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Limits of deviation, sample curves.]]

To describe the dimensions of head and handle the hockey stick is envisaged to be placed with the bottom curve of the stick head on a level surface, the x-axis, with the stick-handle perpendicular to it (the y-axis). The y-axis runs from an intersection with the x-axis (0) vertically through the midpoint of the top of the handle. The Head is the part from the x-axis to the line C-C (diagram) a vertical distance of 100&amp;nbsp;mm. This line C-C also describes the limit on any upturn to the toe of the head. By Rule there is no limit to the length of the stick head along the x-axis, but practical considerations, as well as technicalities related to the joining of the head and the Handle (on the line C-C), did create limitations with wooden sticks.

The extent of the stick head along the X+ axis, towards the 'heel' of the Head is confined by the rule requirement that the stick head and the handle meet in a smooth continuous fashion at the line C-C and by a rule restriction on the shape of the handle, which is that the stick-handle must not project beyond the line B1-B1. It is possible to envisage a stick where the width of handle did not extend beyond the line A1-A1, thus allowing a significant extension of the stick head along the X+ axis, but the practicalities of such a design seem to be limited and have not been explored. The length of the Head (or toe) along the X- axis has varied enormously, especially since the Second World War and again after the introduction of the timber lamination process in the early 1980s.

The stick handle may be bent or 'deviated', in a smooth curve only, once only to either side. That is the handle may have one out-moving curve on the 'heel' side of the head and one out-moving curve on the toe side. It is therefore possible to have a hockey stick with a handle deviation to the front or toe side or a handle deviation to the back or 'heel' side or a stick-handle that is bent once to both the toe and 'heel' sides.

The sample diagram on the right shows three deviating areas (a), (b), and (c). Any of these areas could exist on a stick by itself but, in this illustration, area (a) could legally coexist with area (b) and area (c) could coexist with area (b); but areas (a) and (c) could not legally coexist on the same stick because they are both on the same edge and only one protrusion either beyond the line AA or beyond the line A1A1—or both—is permitted on the handle.

The maximum permitted width of the handle (51&amp;nbsp;mm) is illustrated in the diagram by the distance between the dotted lines A-A and A1-A1. A hockey stick handle will rarely be of the maximum permitted width: most are between 46&amp;nbsp;mm and 48&amp;nbsp;mm at the widest point.
[[Image:Long B-B Protrusion.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sample goalkeeper stick with long edge deviation to toe side]] The maximum permitted 'deviation' is shown by the lines B-B and B1-B1 respectively. The line B-B is 20&amp;nbsp;mm further along the X- axis than the line A-A and the line B1-B1 is 20&amp;nbsp;mm further along the X+ axis than the line A1-A1. There is no limit to the length of a protrusion along the y-axis specified, so the deviation curve or curves may be of any length along the length of the stick-handle. Some goalkeeping sticks have an outward curve on the toe side (within the line B-B) that extends for almost half the total length of the stick.

The sample illustrated does not reach the line A1A1 on the 'heel edge' and the Y axis is not central to the shaft, which raises the question "How is the stick positioned for measurement of permitted deviation." The answer is that the vertical axis Y runs through the top centre of the handle and the stick is assumed to be suspended from that top centre point and perpendicular to the X axis (the ground), the curve to the base of the head of the stick being in contact with the ground, it is therefore not necessary for the Y axis to pass through the centre of the shaft just above the head of the stick, although in most traditional sticks it will do so (or very nearly do so—as 'rake' to the handle may cause the Y axis to run a few millimeters to the heel side of the true centre of the shaft). To October 2015 no official measuring method or device for measuring 'permitted deviation' has been approved by the FIH.

==Permitted bow==

Increasing the degree of bow to the face side (flat side) makes it easier to get high speeds from the drag-flick (a "sling-shot" style stroke started from behind the body of the flicker) and allows easier execution of the stroke. At first, after extreme bows were introduced (2005), the Hockey Rules Board (HRB) placed a limit of 50&amp;nbsp;mm on the maximum depth of such a bow over the length of the stick, but experience quickly demonstrated this degree of bend to be excessive.

The Rules of Hockey 2006 limited this particular curve of the stick to 25&amp;nbsp;mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked and to try to ensure that hitting control was maintained (the curvature to the face of the stick considerably influences the angle at which the stick head strikes through the ball). The placement of the maximum bow along the length of handle has now been specified in the Rules of Hockey at 20&amp;nbsp;cm above the head (the line C-C). 

[[Image:Bow Measure.jpg|thumb|Ascertaining compliance to bow limits]]

It is now illegal for any hockey stick to have a bow that exceeds 25&amp;nbsp;mm. The bow height is measured by placing the stick face-side to a flat surface and presenting the official measuring device, a 25&amp;nbsp;mm-high metal triangular or cylindrical measure, to the gap between the surface and the under-flat of the stick.

Since this article was first written in 2008, there have been attempts to get around the rule by the production of a stick which 'in a natural resting position' has a face side that is not parallel to the flat surface measured from but rests with the face at a sharp angle. The result of the sloping of the face side is to put one edge of it closer than 25&amp;nbsp;mm to the flat surface and permit a much deeper bow than would otherwise be possible. This flouts the intention of the rule, so it is possible that there may be a move to a measuring cylinder, under and across, the entire face of the stick.

[[Image:Bow and stick presentation.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Position of bow and effect on angle of head presentation]]

There was a development in design called the 'low bow'. This placed the maximum bow of the stick much closer to the head than was previously the case, when it was positioned more centrally on the length of the stick. The effect of placing the maximum bow lower down the handle was to increase the angle at which the stick head was presented to the ball. The angle of presentation of a '25&amp;nbsp;mm low bow' was approximately the same as was achieved when the maximum permitted bow was 50&amp;nbsp;mm but the maximum was situated at about the mid-length of the stick.

Extreme bow has an effect on the ease with which stick-work and hitting of the ball (so that it stays on the ground) may be carried out. There has always been some bow to a stick handle, 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm was common (right in diagram) because to have a stick that was straight would make 'gathering' the ball, by pulling it towards the body from the left, more difficult and a bow in the other direction (a convex bow) would cause 'dragging' in stick-work and make hitting the ball cleanly difficult in the other.

A stick with a very small degree of bow (no more than 5&amp;nbsp;mm) was popular in the days when the clip hit in the outfield was a permitted stroke (a chip hit is a hit down on the top or back of the ball which causes it to rise sharply and produces under-spin, so that the ball does not run on when it lands). The increased use of the scoop when the lifted hit in the outfield was banned led to an increase in bow depth (and many players also found that a moderate bow aided stick-work as well). The maximum depth of this bow was generally at around the mid-length of the stick.

The 'low bow' has been popularized by the development of the drag-flick, particularly as a first shot on goal at a penalty corner. The Pakistan International player Sohail Abbas, who holds the record for the number of goals scored at international level, mostly scored with the set piece drag-flick, had such a stick made especially to his own requirements and many have copied his design—and tried to improve on it.

[[Image:Upright bow face ball presentations.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hitting at various stick angles with a bowed stick.]]

Although there can be no doubt that the 'slingshot' effect of a bowed stick, when the ball is 'dragged' from the rear of the feet and released after powerful body and arm rotation to the front of the feet, has dramatically increased the velocity at which the ball may be propelled by this flicking method, there may be considerable difficulty in hitting the ball along the ground with a very bowed stick. This may be of advantage when shooting at the goal with a lifted hit from within the 'circle' (which is legal) but a disadvantage when hitting the ball outside of the scoring 'circles', because it is illegal to intentionally lift the ball with a hit except when within the scoring 'circles' i.e. the opponent's 'circle'.

The upright forehand hitting stroke, which is commonly used when the ball is close to the feet, will seldom be made with the handle in the same plane as the ball, unless the ball is to the immediate right of the player i.e. beside or alongside his feet. (Stick shown on far right of illustration)—which is generally the case when the ball is being hit directly to the front or from left to right—with a bowed stick even this vertical handle position will present an angled head to the ball. The further away to the front of the player the ball is the greater will be the head angle presented to the ball. To deal with the problem of head presentation some players use a low 'roundhouse' style of hitting, rather than an upright style and may also employ sweep-hits or slap-hitting of the ball (the difference being the positioning of the hands, sweep hits are generally made with the hands together at the top of the stick and with the base of the stick head in contact with the ground, while slap-hits are usually made with the hands in the more spread dribbling grip and the stick head is not necessarily in contact with the ground, but it may be), either sweep or slap type strokes give greater control over the angle of the face of the stick as it makes contact with the ball and are often the preferred strokes when passing the ball over longer distances (over shorter distances—less than 20&amp;nbsp;m—a push stroke is often preferred).

[[Image:Bowed stick face presentation.jpg|thumb|right| Stick-face contact position: Ball contact position.]]

The detail illustration shows that when the handle is angled away from the ball both the position of contact with the ball on the ball and the part of the face of the stick making contact will be altered. The greater the bow the greater the degree of adjustment the player must make to his swing and to the hitting position of the ball to achieve a hit flat along the ground.

==Stages of development==

The development of the modern hockey stick has not taken place in one continuous flow with each development following on from a previous one. Many things changed in the same time frame but at different speeds, especially some of the later developments. There have been more changes in stick design in the last twenty-five years than there were in the previous one hundred and twenty-five and the pace of change has been an ever increasing one. There will no doubt be further development, probably in materials, possibly because of changes to the rules. In roughly chronological order this is what has happened so far.

* 1860s: Hockey taken to India. Stick head made shorter; move from ash to mulberry timber for the stick head.
** Further shortening of stick head; heel of head made tighter. Taken as far as possible by 1986, when a move back towards a midi length began.
* 1960s: Reinforcement with fiberglass.
* 1970s: Reinforcement with carbon and aramid as well as glass fibres.
* 1980s: Stick heads made from glued lamination of wood in addition to the one piece heads
* 1982: Introduction of upturned toe, first the hook closely followed by midi and "J" shaped designs.
* 1980s: Limit placed on upturn of toe of head at 100&amp;nbsp;mm.
* 1986: Kinked shaft stick. Set back stick head. 
* 1980s: Stick lengths other than 36", up to 39", become widely available and custom lengths 42"+ can be purchased.
* 1990: Permitted deviation rule—limited bends to edges of stick handle defined.
* 1990: Specialist goalkeeper's sticks introduced, the first being the ZigZag Save. 
* 1980s: Metal handled stick with an inserted wooden head (plywood) introduced.
* 1994: Composite sticks fully accepted in rules after a two-year "experiment".
* 1990s: Metal handles banned.
* 2004: Rule redefining of head and handle. Head the part from the base of the curve perpendicular to 100&amp;nbsp;mm—handle the remainder of the stick.
* 2000s: Refinement of head shapes, probably five shapes available as "standard".
* 2000s: Number of wood core sticks in use declines as moulded "composites" become the norm.
* 2006: Bow of the face of the handle is increased to facilitate drag-flicking. Closely followed by a rule concerning maximum permitted bow; initially at 50&amp;nbsp;mm and subsequently at 25&amp;nbsp;mm.
* 2007: Low bow sticks introduced.
* 2011: Maximum stick bow position not permitted to be less than 8" (20&amp;nbsp;cm) above the head of the stick.
* 2013: Maximum permitted weight reduced to 737&amp;nbsp;g (26&amp;nbsp;oz)
* 2015: Maximum length limit of 41" (105&amp;nbsp;cm)introduced.

==The forehand striking position==
[[Image:Stick_Ball_Position_Size_45.jpg|thumb|right|Ball position for propelling]]

For the purposes of this article the ball will be assumed to be 73&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. Ball size does play a significant part in stickwork and ball control (as does the weight and hardness of the ball) but an investigation of these is outside the scope of this article. The width of stick handles does vary (as does the horizontal length of stick heads) but for clarity and convenience the shaft of the handle just above the head has been taken as 46&amp;nbsp;mm, which is fairly common, and the sticks scaled from that measurement.

The position of the ball when it is played, particularly hit with the stick head, does, however have a bearing on stick head design. Using just one of the whole range of angles the ball may be struck at from the forehand (right-hand) side (45°), the position of the ball will be looked at in relation to both the centre of the head of the stick and a line projected to run through  the centre of the handle. An examination on the position of wear on the base of stick heads that have been used over a period on an abrasive playing surface lead to the conclusion that the ball is positioned close to the center of the head length of the modern stick. This is also the more usual position for receiving or stopping the ball in play while in the 'dribbling crouch'. Obviously when the handle is vertical or horizontal there is considerable variation but in most common hitting and dribbling positions the line of the uppermost edge of the handle projects close to the centre of the ball.

One of the problems with a striking head that is significantly narrower than the diameter of the ball is that the ball is easily lifted unintentionally if struck with the face of the stick head inclined backward, 'open', rather than vertical or nearly so. Striking the ball with a 'closed' face is not always a solution, because it is then possible to 'squeeze' or 'clip' it, again causing the ball to rise, possibly even more steeply than with the so-called 'undercut' hit.

Another difficulty is striking the ball accurately at the point on the stick head that is intended (the usual range of error can be seen, in the diagram, in the difference of the lengths of the red lines that run from the centre of the two differently positioned stick heads).

It is also necessary to avoid unintentionally turning the handle during a hit at the ball so that the ball is "sliced" (to the right) or hooked (to the left), this is achieved by gripping the stick firmly, generally with one hand locked against the other at the top of the handle, at the moment of impact with the ball.

Ensuring vertical and flat (perpendicular to intended direction of ball travel) contact with the ball is in the hands of the player and the coach, but achieving a correct contact position between the stick head and the ball can be helped by the design of the stick.

[[Image:Ball_Hooks_45.jpg|thumb|left|"Heel" position, toe height]]

At a common playing angle three different styles of hook stick head present identical ball/handle relationships because the bend of the 'heel' is the same in each stick. An increase in the height of the toe over the ball is very noticeable and is most pronounced in the more 'open' shape. The modern hook does not suffer from the effects of a rotational imbalance in the head as much as the original did  because stick heads are now generally tapered towards the toe, rather than of uniform thickness so toe height is not, from a weight and rotational balance point of view, as much of an issue as it once might have been. The stick head is also generally tapered from the midpoint of the striking area towards the bottom curve, so when the stick is in the reversed position the maximum thickness of the head is not at the highest point. This gives a more balanced rotation of the weight of the stick head over the ball.

Some of the early hooks were actually thinner in the centre and became thicker in the toe; it is likely that this was done to facilitate more powerful reversed-stick hitting of the ball but it gave the stick unusual handling characteristics when turning it over the ball and back in "stickwork": an "overturning" or "throw" of the stick head had to be taken into account. The composite stick is generally lighter than the previous wood versions and it is unusual these days to find a young player using the 25–26 oz sticks that were quite commonly used on grass in the 1970s, especially by those likely to be regularly taking hits at a stationary ball.

==Field hockey stick brands==

The majority of modern hockey sticks are manufactured in Asia (Pakistan, India, and China predominantly). Manufacturers will often produce sticks for a number of different brands.

[[File:1894-Mayo-Cut-Plug-Football-Anonymous-John-Dunlop.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[John Dunlop (American football)|John Dunlop]] 1894 Mayc Cut Plug Card]]
A '''football card''' is a type of collectible [[trading card]] typically printed on paper stock or card stock that features one or more [[American football]] or [[Canadian football]] players or other related sports figures. These cards are most often found in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] where the sport is popular.

Most football cards features [[National Football League]] players. There are also [[Canadian Football League]] and [[college football]] cards. Player cards normally list the player's statistics. Some special edition packs of cards include authentic autographs or jersey cards. Some may include bubble gum or a special edition player card. Many cards are now serial-numbered, meaning that there are only so many of that particular card produced. These include unique prints (numbered 1/1). Included in these are printing plates, used in the actual production of the card.

==History ==
The first football cards were included in cigarette packages in the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="Rielly2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rielly|first=Edward J.|title=Football: An Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGT9zyPDJEwC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=1 February 2014|year=2009|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803226302|pages=369–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 Yale football player [[Harry Beecher|Henry W. Beecher]] was included as the only football player in a set of 50 cards distributed in packs of [[Old Judge]] and [[Goodwin_%26_Company|Gypsy Queen]] cigarettes, being the first football card.&lt;ref name="Rielly2009"/&gt; The first set of cards to focus on football players was printed by [[Mayo Cut Plug Tobacco]] Company in the early 1890s and featured players from the schools that became the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref name="Rielly2009"/&gt;

In the early 1900s, trading cards were printed in mixed sport sets, and the football players were generally from college football.&lt;ref name="Rielly2009"/&gt; They were used to promote other items in addition to tobacco products such as [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]]'s sporting goods, breakfast cereal, ice cream, doughnuts and gum.&lt;ref name="Rielly2009"/&gt;

Along with baseball cards, football cards began gaining popularity after [[World War II]]. In 1948, there were two sports card producers, [[Bowman Gum]] and [[Leaf Candy Company]]. Both produced their first football card sets, each consisting of about 100 cards of then-current players from the [[National Football League]], with the Leaf set including a number of prominent college players. Leaf only went on to produce one more set, a skip-numbered set in 1949. However, Bowman continued producing sets, from 1950 through 1955. Bowman was bought out by the [[Topps]] Chewing Gum Company in 1956.&lt;ref name="Rielly2009"/&gt; That year, Topps produced its first regular football card set (after producing sets of historic college players in 1950, 1951, and 1955). Topps continued producing football cards until 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=35631 |title=Company Overview of The Topps Company, Inc. |work=Bloomberg Business Week |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular companies are [[Upper Deck]], [[Panini Group|Panini]] and [[Leaf Trading Cards|Leaf]].

==Reception==
In 2007, one of the earliest known football cards featuring [[John Dunlop (American football)|John Dunlop]] from Harvard, was sold for $10,000, the highest price paid for a football card up to that time.&lt;ref name="(II.)2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=(II.)|first=Robert F.

In their humor book ''Football Uncyclopedia'', Michael Kun and Adam Hoff compare football card collectors to [[baseball card]] collectors claiming among other things that "Baseball fans keep their old baseball cards in firm plastic sleeves...[and] include their baseball-card collections in their wills" while "Football fans could not give two craps about collecting football cards" which they present as "Exhibit A for why football fans are smarter than baseball fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kun|first1=Michael|last2=Hoff|first2=Adam|title=Football Uncyclopedia: A Highly Opinionated Myth-Busting Guide to America's Most Popular Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eFGLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=2013-10-09|publisher=Clerisy Press|isbn=9781578603114|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, football cards from the collection of Jefferson R.

[[Image:SPAN1010468.JPG|thumb|[[Vassilis Spanoulis]] taking a free throw]]
In [[basketball]], '''free throws''' or '''foul shots''' are unopposed attempts to score points by shooting from behind the free throw line (informally known as the foul line or the charity stripe), a line situated at the end of the [[Key (basketball)|restricted area]]. Free throws are generally awarded after a [[Personal foul (basketball)|foul]] on the shooter by the opposing team. Each successful free throw is worth one point.

==Description==
[[File:Kobe Bryant.ogv|thumb|left|[[Kobe Bryant]] practicing free throws.]]

Free throws can normally be shot at a high percentage by good players. In the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], most players make 70–80% of their attempts. The league's best shooters (such as [[Mark Price]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Rick Barry]], [[Ray Allen]], [[José Calderón (basketball)|José Calderón]], [[Stephen Curry]], [[Reggie Miller]], [[Kevin Durant]], and [[Dirk Nowitzki]]) can make roughly 90% of their attempts over a season, while notoriously poor shooters (e.g. [[Dwight Howard]], [[DeAndre Jordan]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Andre Drummond]], [[Andris Biedrins]], [[Chris Dudley]], [[Ben Wallace]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], and [[Dennis Rodman]]) may struggle to make 50% of them. During a foul shot, a player's foot must be completely behind the foul line. If a player lines up with part of his or her foot on the line, a violation is called and the shot does not count. Foul shots are worth one point.

==When Free Throws are awarded==
[[Image:GT vs Centenary Free Throw 2006.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Players waiting on the side during a free throw at a [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets basketball|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] vs. [[Centenary Gentlemen basketball|Centenary Gentlemen]] [[college basketball]] game.]]

There are many situations when free throws can be awarded.

The first and most common is when a player is fouled while in the act of shooting. If the player misses the shot during the foul, the player receives either two or three free throws depending on whether the shot was taken in front of or behind the three-point line. If, despite the foul, the player still makes the attempted shot, the number of free throws is reduced to one, and the basket counts. This is known as a [[three-point play|three-point]] or [[four-point play]], depending on the value of the made basket.

The second is when the fouling team is in the team [[Bonus (basketball)|bonus (or foul penalty) situation]]. This happens when, in a single period, a team commits a set number of fouls whether or not in the act of shooting. In FIBA, (W)NBA and NCAA women's play, the limit is four fouls per quarter; in the NBA, starting with the fifth foul (fourth in overtime), or the second in the final 2 minutes if the team has less than 5 fouls (4 in OT), the opposing team gets two free throws. In the WNBA, the fouled player shoots two free throws starting with the opponent's fifth foul (4th in overtime), or second team foul in the final minute if that team has committed under 5 fouls in a period (4 in overtime). In FIBA and NCAA women's basketball, the fouled player also shoots two free throws starting with the opponent's fifth foul in a period, considering that team fouls accrue from the fourth period on, as all overtimes are extensions of it for purposes of accrued team fouls. In NCAA men's basketball, beginning with the seventh foul of the half, one free throw is awarded; if the player makes the free throw, another is given. This is called shooting a "one-and-one". Starting with the tenth foul of the half, two free throws are awarded. In addition, overtime is considered an extension of the second half for purposes of accumulated team fouls. Free throws are not awarded for offensive fouls (most often [[Personal foul (basketball)|charging fouls]]), even if the team fouled is in the bonus. The number of fouls that triggers a penalty is higher in college men's basketball because the game is divided into two 20-minute halves, as opposed to quarters of 12 minutes in the NBA or 10 minutes in the WNBA, college women's basketball, or FIBA play (note that the college women's game was played in 20-minute halves before 2015–16). As in professional play, a foul in the act of shooting is a two- or three-shot foul, depending on the value of the shot attempt, with one free throw being awarded if the shot is good.

If a player is [[injured]] upon being fouled and cannot shoot free throws, the offensive team may designate any player from the bench to shoot in the place of the injured player in college; in the NBA, the opposing team designates the player to shoot, and the injured player can't return, unless the foul committed was a flagrant-2, in which case the player's own team also gets to pick the replacement shooter. If a player fouled takes exception to the foul, and starts or participates in a [[fight]], and gets ejected, he or she is not allowed to take his or her free throws, and the opposing team will choose a replacement shooter. In all other circumstances, the fouled player must shoot his or her own foul shots.

If a player, coach, or team staff (e.g., doctor, statistician) shows poor sportsmanship, which may include arguing with a [[Official (basketball)|referee]], or commits a technical violation (delay of game, excessive time outs, or when a team has no eligible players remaining after a player has fouled out or subsequently the last player to foul out must re-enter the game, the latter two are NBA rules) that person may get charged with a more serious foul called a [[technical foul]]. In the NBA, a technical foul results in one free throw attempt for the other team. In FIBA play, technical fouls result in two free throws in all situations. Under NCAA rules, technical fouls are divided into "Class&amp;nbsp;A" (violent or serious unsportsmanlike conduct) and "Class&amp;nbsp;B" (less egregious violations such as hanging on the rim or delay of game). Class&amp;nbsp;A technicals result in two free throws, and Class&amp;nbsp;B technicals result in one. At all levels, the opposing team may choose any player who is currently on the court to shoot the free throws, and is then awarded possession of the ball after the free throws. Since there is no opportunity for a [[rebound (basketball)|rebound]], these free throws are shot with no players on the lane.

Finally, if a referee deems a foul extremely aggressive, or that it did not show an attempt to play the ball, the referee can call an even more severe foul, known as an "unsportsmanlike foul" in international play or a "[[flagrant foul]]" in the NBA and NCAA basketball. This foul is charged against the player (and depending on the severity of the offense, can even be ejected), and the opponent gets two free throws and possession of the ball afterwards. Unlike technical fouls, the player fouled must shoot the awarded free throws.

Fouls "away from the ball" (fouls that do not occur on the shooter or near the ball) are handled like the second case above in most situations. Many times defenders hold their opponent to prevent them from catching an in-bound pass or fight through screens and thus are called for fouls. These fouls are almost always treated as normal personal fouls. In the NBA, when there are only two minutes left on the clock of either half, off-ball fouls when the fouling team is over the limit are rewarded with one free throw and possession of the ball. It is therefore common for a losing team to deliberately single out its opponent's poor free throw shooters, regardless of their dominance in other aspects of the game (as in the cases of [[Ben Wallace]] and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]), as the targets of deliberate fouls until the two-minute mark, after which the losing team plays intense defense for the rest of the game; this strategy is known as the "[[Hack-a-Shaq]]". It is believed that this rule was instituted because of [[Wilt Chamberlain]].{{cn|date=February 2018}} Previously teams had been allowed to foul any player on the court regardless of whether that player had possession of the ball, with only two free throws awarded to the fouled player. This motivated teams to chase poor free throw shooters, such as Chamberlain, around the court in attempt to foul him in an effort to extend the game. To discourage this practice, the NBA changed the rule to award one free throw and possession of the ball to a player who is fouled away from the ball in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter. This rule does not apply in international or NCAA play and in fact plays a very vital strategic role in the NCAA Tournament.

==Procedure==
[[File:SackoLF2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[:fr:Fatimatou Sacko|Fatimatou Sacko]] for her first free throw.]]

Free throws are organized in procession. The shooter takes his place behind the free throw line ({{convert|5.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the base line, {{convert|4.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the basket). All other players must stand in their correct places until the ball leaves the shooter's hands: up to four people in the NCAA rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g-macsports.com/custompages/Governance/NCAArulebooks/Basketball_Mens_Rule_Book_2013-2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306054918/http://g-macsports.com/custompages/Governance/NCAArulebooks/Basketball_Mens_Rule_Book_2013-2015.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and three people in the FIBA rules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiba.com/downloads/Rules/2014/Official_Basketball_Rules_2014_Y.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309233056/http://www.fiba.com/downloads/Rules/2014/Official_Basketball_Rules_2014_Y.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the defensive team and two people from the shooting team line up along the sides of the restricted area (keyhole, paint, lane). These players are usually the ones that rebound the ball. Three line up on each side. A defensive player always takes the place closest to the basket.

The remaining players must remain behind the three-point line and the "free throw line extended" (an imaginary line extended from the free throw line in both directions to the sidelines).

Leaving their designated places before the ball leaves the shooter's hands, or interfering with the ball, are violations. In addition, the shooter must release the ball within five seconds (ten seconds in the United States) and must not step on or over the free throw line until the ball touches the hoop. Players are, however, permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rule No. 9-Free Throw |work= National Basketball Association |publisher= NBA Media Ventures, LLC |url= http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_9.html?nav=ArticleList |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090307221916/http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_9.html?nav=ArticleList |archivedate= 2009-03-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A violation by the shooter cancels the free throw; a violation by the defensive team results in a substitute free throw if the shooter missed; a violation by the offensive team or a shot that completely misses the hoop results in the loss of possession to the defensive team (only if it is on the last free throw).

Under [[FIBA]] rules, if the shooter does not commit a violation, and the ball goes in the basket, the attempt is successful, regardless of violations committed by any non-shooter.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Penalty applies to fouls in excess of four in a regulation period or in excess of three in an overtime period. If a team has not committed its foul quota by the two minute mark of a period, it shall be allowed one foul before the penalty applies. Offensive fouls do not count toward this total.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Defensive fouls committed during an inbounds pass prior to the ball being released result in two free throws regardless of the penalty situation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; In the NBA, a team must have five players on the court at all times. If a team is down to five players because of injuries and players with six fouls, and a player commits his sixth foul, he remains in the game and a technical foul is charged. The technical foul penalty of one free throw and the ball applies.

===Historical===
Prior to the 1954–55 season, the NBA established the rule that a backcourt foul would result in a "three to make two" situation (up to three attempts to make two free throws) if the violating team was over the team foul limit.&lt;ref name=nbaRules&gt;{{cite web| title=NBA.com: NBA Rules History| url=http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html| accessdate=2011-04-04| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303213838/http://www.nba.com/analysis/rules_history.html| archivedate=2011-03-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1979, the rule had been extended to the penalty situation for flagrant fouls, fouls made in the act of shooting (resulting in a miss), and fouls due to the swinging of the elbows.&lt;ref name=winick&gt;{{Cite book| last = Winick | first = Matt | title = Official 1979–80 National Basketball Association Guide | publisher = The Sporting News | year = 1979 | page = Rules Index 31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 0-89204-049-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1981–82 season, this rule and the related "two to make one" rule were abolished.&lt;ref name=nbaRules/&gt;

In 1956, in response to reports that Wilt Chamberlain was able to dunk free throws, the NCAA established a rule requiring that free throw shooters keep both feet behind the free throw line during an attempt.&lt;ref name=toledo&gt;{{citation |title=That Stilt, Wilt, Responsible For 2 Rule Changes; Kansas' Chamberlain Even Dunked His Foul Shots | newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=November 28, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBA later adopted this rule.&lt;ref name=silverman&gt;{{Cite book| last = Silverman | first = Drew | title = Kansas Jayhawks | publisher = Sportszone| year = 2012 | page = 21 | isbn = 978-1617832833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
[[File:Tirs lliures.ogv|thumb|250px|right|Free throwing at a [[Valencia Basket]] match.]]
As mentioned earlier, some players are notoriously bad free throw shooters. Historical examples of star players who were poor shooters include Wilt Chamberlain, Ben Wallace, and Shaquille O'Neal.&lt;ref name="fixler20121213"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sbnation.com/longform/2012/12/13/3758698/rick-barry-underhand-free-throw-nba | title=Shooting for Perfection | work=SB Nation | date=2012-12-13 | accessdate=December 16, 2012 | author=Fixler, Kevin | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216014212/http://www.sbnation.com/longform/2012/12/13/3758698/rick-barry-underhand-free-throw-nba | archivedate=December 16, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a strategy where a team intentionally fouls this player, hoping that they will miss one or both shots and the defending team will re-gain possession of the ball. This strategy was dubbed [[Hack-a-Shaq]] when famously used on Shaquille O'Neal. Dwight Howard, DeAndre Jordan and Andre Drummond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=15415006|title=Does Hack-a-Shaq actually work?|publisher=ESPN|date=April 28, 2016|accessdate=June 20, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625180538/http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=15415006|archivedate=June 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been subjected to this strategy as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Landman|first=Seth|title='Hack-a-Howard' strategy in full effect|url=http://espn.go.com/fantasy/blog/_/name/boxscore_basketball/id/7458162/dwight-howard-busy-night-free-throw-line-not-helpful-fantasy-owners|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=21 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228185459/http://espn.go.com/fantasy/blog/_/name/boxscore_basketball/id/7458162/dwight-howard-busy-night-free-throw-line-not-helpful-fantasy-owners|archivedate=28 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as have [[Hack-a-Shaq#Application against other players|other players]].

It can be advantageous for a trailing team to intentionally foul late in a close game. While this allows the leading team to shoot free throws and increase their lead, it also stops the clock, similar to a time out in [[Gridiron football|football]] (in basketball, a time out may only be called by a team with possession of the ball). As well, it allows the trailing team the chance to take possession if the second free throw is missed, and if it is made awards possession outright to the trailing team. Therefore, many teams substitute players with high free throw percentages when they are leading late in games to combat this strategy. It is seen as a last resort strategy with little chance of success, but if it is not employed the leading team may run out the clock and end the game.

As well, a defensive team leading by three may foul an offensive team intentionally late in the game, if the game clock is no greater than a couple of seconds. In such circumstances, the opposing team would most likely not have enough time for multiple possessions. Down three points, the opposing team's obvious strategy would be to attempt a [[three-point field goal|three-pointer]] to try to send the game into overtime; however, the leading team may attempt to foul the trailing team before a shot is attempted, as this would lead to only two free throws which is not enough to tie the game. If the trailing team is placed into the situation of shooting two free throws, they must attempt to intentionally miss the second free throw in the hopes of securing the offensive rebound (which is harder than normal with free throws, as the defending team is automatically given position) and scoring before the game clock expires – if the first free throw is made, a two-pointer would tie the game, and a three-pointer would win the game; if the first free throw is missed, only a three-pointer would tie the game. Theoretically, adopting this strategy makes a leading team four times more likely to win the game than allowing the trailing team to attempt a three-pointer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawhorn|first=Adrian|title="3-D": Late-Game Defensive Strategy with a 3-Point Lead|url=http://www.82games.com/lawhorn.htm|publisher=82games.com|accessdate=21 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504045529/http://82games.com/lawhorn.htm|archivedate=4 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
The majority of adult professional players shoot free throws in the overhand style, despite both theoretical and practical demonstrations that the underhand style (aka "granny-style") usually produces better average results.&lt;ref name=discover&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/the-body/07-physics-proves-it-everyone-should-shoot-granny-style |first=Curtis |last=Rist |title=Physics Proves It: Everyone Should Shoot Granny-Style |publisher=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202012458/http://discovermagazine.com/2008/the-body/07-physics-proves-it-everyone-should-shoot-granny-style |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/ct-granny-shot-nba-free-throw-20161228-story.html |first=Adam |last=Kilgore |title='Granny' shot master Rick Barry is glad someone had the guts to bring it back to the NBA |publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2016-12-28 |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119125235/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/ct-granny-shot-nba-free-throw-20161228-story.html |archivedate=2017-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famously, in the NBA, [[Rick Barry]] retired in 1980 while ranked first in NBA history at the time with his 0.900 free throw percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/barry_bio.html |title=Rick Barry |publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc. |work=NBA.com |accessdate=2017-01-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317133934/http://www.nba.com/history/players/barry_bio.html |archivedate=2010-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only a few professional players who have utilized this technique, while the vast majority of them resisted adopting the technique for the fear of ridicule or for other similar reasons unrelated to performance.&lt;ref name=discover/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT/&gt;

The '''Glacier Ice Rink''' is a two-sheet ice arena located in [[Missoula, Montana]]. It is operated by the Missoula Area Youth Hockey Association (MAYHA), a non profit organization whose mission is to "provide recreational opportunities for learning and playing the game of hockey and other ice skating activities for children and adults in our community." The rink is open 10 months a year and offers youth and adult hockey leagues, hockey tournaments and public skating sessions. Glacier Ice Rink is also home to the Missoula Figure Skating Club, the Missoula Curling Club, the Missoula Referees Association, and the Women's Hockey Association of Missoula (WHAM).

From 2007 to 2016, it was also home to the [[Missoula Maulers]] junior hockey team before the team owner and MAYHA had a contract dispute and the team was shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://missoulian.com/sports/local/maulers-owner-explains-decision-to-disband-local-hockey-team/article_2be5c1a1-e393-5807-b053-b5191d356423.html |title=Maulers owner explains decision to disband local hockey team |publisher=''[[The Missoulian]]'' |date=May 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maulers' owner Michael Burks had installed all the bleachers at the ice rink with his own funding, so after failing to negotiate a new contract, he removed the bleachers, forcing Glacier Ice Rink to raise funds for replacement seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/junior-hockey/Content?oid=3139752|title=Bruins drop the puck|date=September 22, 2016|publisher=''[[Missoula Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Islip Speedway''' was a .2-mile (320-meter) oval [[race track]] in [[Islip (hamlet), New York|Islip]], [[New York (state)|New York]] which was open from 1947 until 1984.&lt;ref name=genesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=gauge&gt;{{cite web | author=Goldsmith, Paul | title=Gauge Nears 'E' at Riverhead Raceway | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/31/nyregion/gauge-nears-e-at-riverhead-raceway.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher= | date=2003-08-31 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest track ever to host [[NASCAR]]'s [[Grand National Series]] (now the Sprint Cup Series),&lt;ref name=nascar&gt;{{cite web | author=Aumann, Mark | title=Countdown: New York | url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/01/31/countdown.daytona.ny/index.html | work=[[NASCAR]] | publisher= | date=2006-01-31 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|author=London, Gary |title=NASCAR Has A Long History Racing In The Northeast |url=http://www.nationalspeedsportnews.com/columns/gary-london/nascar-has-a-long-history-racing-in-the-northeast |work=[[National Speed Sport News]] |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908033426/http://www.nationalspeedsportnews.com/columns/gary-london/nascar-has-a-long-history-racing-in-the-northeast/ |archivedate=September 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1964 to 1971.&lt;ref name=genesis/&gt;&lt;ref name=nascar/&gt; The first [[demolition derby]] took place at Islip Speedway in 1958.&lt;ref name=kapow/&gt; The idea was patented by Larry Mendelson, who worked at Islip Speedway.&lt;ref name=mend/&gt;

==Figure 8==
In 1962 a [[Figure 8 racing|Figure 8 track]] was added. The Figure 8 course shared the north and south turns with the oval and crisscrossed using lanes paved through the infield. The first Figure 8 race was held on August 11, 1962. The popular Figure 8 class became a regularly featured division from the time of its inception until the track's final date of operation September 8, 1984.
In 1964 track promoter Larry Mendelsohn conceived the idea of hosting the first "Figure 8 World Championship" event and sold his idea to ABC-TV, who would film the daytime event for broadcast at a later date on their popular Saturday afternoon television show, "ABC's Wide World of Sports". To draw out-of-town competitors, Mendelsohn would guarantee a starting spot in the feature event to all Figure 8 division track champions who would travel to Long Island and represent their home track, hoping to claim the title of "World Champion". The remaining starting positions were determined through heat races. The "Demolition Derby World Championship" was held immediately following the "Figure 8 World Championship" feature race and was also taped for future broadcast on "ABC's Wide World of Sports". These broadcasts led to increased exposure and notoriety of the track, which came to be known as "World Famous Islip Speedway".
Figure 8 drivers who won the title and were crowned "Figure 8 World Champion" at Islip were:
1963- Larry Wood, Northport, NY; 1964-Benny Giaraputo, West Islip, NY; 1965-Art Cox, Anderson, IN; 1966-Forrest Halliburton, Indianapolis, IN; 1967-Richie Gomes, Brentwood, NY; 1968-Richard Simmons, Plymouth, MI; 1969-Aaron Coller, Tampa, FL; 1970-Lester Slone, Pinellas Park, FL; 1971 &amp; 1973-Sonny Thompson, Indianapolis, IN; 1972- Mike Pinchuk, Bay Shore, NY; 1974 &amp; 1975-Carl Voelker, Islip NY; 1976 &amp; 1979-Chuck Hall, Toledo, OH; 1977-Quinn Vollgraff, Ronkonkoma, NY; 1978-Allen Brock, Medford, NY; 1980-Eddie Sutton, Crownville, MD; 1981, 1982 &amp; 1983-Doug Huber, Bellport, NY; 1984-Chuck Hlatky, Ronkonkoma, NY.

==NASCAR racing==
Islip Speedway hosted six [[NASCAR]] races from 1964 to [[1971 Islip 250|1971]],&lt;ref name=nascar/&gt; skipping the years 1969 and 1970.&lt;ref name=genesis/&gt; [[Richard Petty]] won the last NASCAR race at Islip&lt;ref name=genesis&gt;{{cite web | author=Wallmuller, Bill | title=Islip Speedway - Local Auto Racing 1947-1984 Genesis Of Some Great Auto Racing Trivia | url=http://www.auto-racing-sports.com/racing_trivia_contributions.html | work=Merokee's Auto Racing Sports | publisher=Merokee Enterprises | year=2007 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=streets&gt;{{cite web | author=Caraviello, David | title=No racetrack?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6226">"'''Kapa o Pango'''" is a prematch [[Haka (sports)|haka]] or challenge unique to the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]], the All Blacks.
Since 2005 the "Kapa o Pango" haka has been performed before [[Test match (rugby union)|rugby test matches]] by the All Blacks as an alternative to the usual "[[Ka Mate]]" haka. The longest sequence of "Kapa o Pango" performances is four, which occurred in 2014.

==History==
In August 2005, before the Tri-Nations test match between New Zealand and South Africa at [[Carisbrook]] stadium in Dunedin, New Zealand, performed a new haka, "Kapa o Pango", specially composed by Derek Lardelli and "...designed to reflect the multi-cultural make-up of contemporary New Zealand{{snd}}in particular the influence of [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] cultures".&lt;ref name="KapaoPango"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10342926 |title=New haka the cutting edge of sport |work= NZ Herald |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=14 June 2008 |last=Stokes |first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kapa o Pango" was to be performed on special occasions and was not intended to replace "Ka Mate".&lt;ref name="KapaoPango"/&gt;

[[John Smit]], the Springbok captain who faced the debut performance of "Kapa o Pango", said after the match: "To stand there and watch it for the first time was a privilege."&lt;ref name="KapaoPango"/&gt; ''The Daily Telegraph'' columnist Mick Cleary criticised the new haka as "unmistakably provocative … There is a fine line and the All Blacks crossed it. Carisbrook is a rugby field not a back-street alley."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France national rugby union team|French]] coach [[Bernard Laporte]] requested New Zealand not to perform "Kapa o Pango" during their November 2006 tour of France, claiming that "It's no good for the promotion of our sport."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 24 September 2011, for their [[2011 Rugby World Cup Pool A|Pool A]] match against France at [[Eden Park]], the All Blacks performed "Kapa o Pango", which included the act of drawing the thumb across the throat at the end. The French had ousted New Zealand at the [[2007 Rugby World Cup knockout stage|2007 World Cup]]. It had since been a fixture since the knockout stages against Argentina and Australia.

==Controversy==
"Kapa o Pango" concludes with what has been interpreted as a "[[Taunting#Cutthroat|throat slitting]]" gesture that led to accusations that "Kapa o Pango" encourages violence, and sends the wrong message to All Blacks fans.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[The Age]] |publisher=Fairfax |location=Australia | title=All Blacks coach slams haka criticism | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/All-Blacks-coach-slams-haka-criticism/2006/07/28/1153816359796.html| accessdate=17 January 2007 |date=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Lardelli, the gesture represents "drawing vital energy into the heart and lungs".&lt;ref name="GestureMeaning"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/454218/779048 |title=New haka gets public approval |publisher= [[TVNZ]] |date=8 July 2006 |accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The All Blacks opted not to perform "Kapa o Pango" in their opening test of 2006 against {{nrut|Ireland}}. It was requested that they perform their usual "Ka Mate" haka while a review was conducted into "Kapa o Pango".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life is precious, live it to da fullest...! |url=http://souvenjawaven89.blogspot.co.nz/2008/09/rugbykamate-kamate-all-blacks-haka.html |accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The throat-slitting action at the end of "Kapa o Pango" had drawn many complaints in the lead-up to the Irish test, with members of the public complaining about it to the [[NZRU]]. The NZRU said that it was not because of public pressure that it was not performed against Ireland.

In the run-up to the first All Blacks Test of the [[2006 Tri Nations Series|2006 Tri Nations]] at [[Jade Stadium]] in Christchurch against {{nrut|Australia}}, the NZRU completed their review, and concluded that the gesture had a radically different meaning within [[Māori culture]] and haka traditions, indicating the drawing of "''[[hauora]]''", the breath of life into the heart and lungs. As a result, "Kapa o Pango" was performed, complete with the final gesture, before the Australia test.

Despite this, the controversial gesture was withdrawn in 2007, with a modified action (raking the right arm from the left hip to over the right shoulder) performed in the challenge when "Kapa o Pango" was performed in test matches against France and South Africa. During the [[2008 Tri Nations series]], the All Blacks appear to have reverted to the original action of drawing the hand across the throat.

==Players who have led performances==
One All Blacks player is assigned in each test match to lead the haka. 
Although the leader is often of [[Māori people|Maori]] descent, this is not compulsory as several players have [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] heritage.
Since its introduction in 2005 the following players have led Kapa o Pango (number in brackets represents tests player has led):
* [[Piri Weepu]] (25)
* [[Liam Messam]] (12)
* [[Keven Mealamu]] (7)
* [[TJ Perenara]] (6)
* [[Rico Gear]]  (3)
* [[Tana Umaga]] (2)
* [[Carl Hayman]] (2)
* [[Aaron Smith (rugby union)|Aaron Smith]] (3)
* [[Hosea Gear]] (1)

The '''Khartoum League''' began in 1952 and was a famous historical regional championship in [[Sudan]]. The teams playing in it were those from the three cities of the capital [[Khartoum]]; Khartoum, [[Bahri]], and [[Omdurman]].

The most famous winners of the Khartoum league were the two traditionally strong teams from Sudan, [[Al-Merrikh]] and [[Al-Hilal (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]]. They won the championship 17 and 16 times respectively before their eventual withdrawal in 1997. No team had exceeded the number of tiles of Al-Merreikh even though the club has not taken part in the competition since early 1997.

'''Kinnick Stadium''', formerly known as '''Iowa Stadium''', is a [[stadium]] located in [[Iowa City, Iowa]], United States.  It is the home stadium of the [[University of Iowa]] [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Hawkeyes]], in the [[sport]] of [[college football]]. First opened in 1929 to replace [[Iowa Field]], it currently holds up to 69,250 people, making it the 7th largest stadium in the [[Big Ten]], and one of the 20 largest university owned stadiums in the nation. It is named for [[Nile Kinnick]], the 1939 [[Heisman Trophy]] winner and the only Heisman winner in university history, who died in service during [[World War II]]. It was named Iowa Stadium until 1972, when longtime lobbying by ''[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|Cedar Rapids Gazette]]'' sportswriter Gus Schrader successfully convinced the UI athletic board to change the name.  It is currently the only college football stadium named after a Heisman Trophy winner.

==Construction==
Iowa Stadium was constructed in only seven months between 1928 and 1929. Groundbreaking and construction began on March 6, 1929. Workers worked around the clock using lights by night and horses and mules as the primary heavy-equipment movers. There was a rumor for many years that horses that died during the process were buried under what now is the North end zone.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iagenweb.org"&gt;[http://iagenweb.org/johnson/Postcard80.htm IAGenWeb Project]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians report this is a myth and the animals were disposed of in the nearby Iowa River.&lt;ref name="iagenweb.org"/&gt; The round-the-clock construction came to an end in July. Despite several problems to overcome, including the [[athletic director]]'s resignation and a slight redesign, the stadium was completed and the first game was played October 5, 1929, against [[Monmouth College]]. Iowa won the game 46&amp;ndash;0. The stadium was dedicated two weeks later, when the Hawkeyes tied [[1929 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]] 7&amp;ndash;7.&lt;ref name="dedication"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kinnick Stadium|url=http://football.ballparks.com/NCAA/Big10/Iowa/index.htm|work=Ballparks.com|year=2005|accessdate=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The playing surface is currently the synthetic FieldTurf (installed in 2017), although it was [[AstroTurf]] from 1972 until grass was reinstalled for the 1989 season. The installation of artificial turf came at the same time that Iowa Stadium was renamed Kinnick Stadium in honor of the Heisman winner who had perished 29 years earlier.

When filled to capacity, Kinnick Stadium would be the sixth largest city in Iowa (after [[Des Moines]], [[Cedar Rapids]], [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]], [[Sioux City]], and Iowa City).&lt;ref name="10largestcities"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iowa-demographics.com/cities_by_population|title=Iowa Cities by Population|date=May 2018|work=Iowa-Demographics|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2015 football season, the stadium did not have permanent lights; the school contracted Musco Lighting's portable light trucks for night games in previous years. The school had installed permanent practice lights at the stadium in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Permanent Lights at Kinnick Stadium Could Mean More Evening Events|first=Mark|last=Carlson|url=http://www.thegazette.com/subject/sports/permanent-lights-at-kinnick-stadium-could-mean-more-evening-events-20150901|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]]|date=September 1, 2015|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kinnick Stadium|url=http://hawkeyesports.com/sports/2016/6/13/facilities-iowa-kinnick-stadium-html.aspx|publisher=The University of Iowa Athletics|date=June 13, 2016|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iowa Football Practicing Around Construction|url=http://hawkeyesports.com/news/2012/4/2/iowa_football_practicing_around_construction.aspx|publisher=The University of Iowa Athletics|date=April 2, 2012|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By capacity, Kinnick Stadium is the 27th largest college football stadium, the 42nd largest sports stadium in the United States, and the 86th largest sports stadium in the world. On November 14, 2015, Iowa set the national collegiate wrestling dual-meet attendance record at Kinnick with over 42,000 fans in a victory over #1 [[Oklahoma State Cowboys wrestling|Oklahoma State]].

[[File:Fall 2009 010.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inside the visitor's pink locker room inside Kinnick Stadium. Former Iowa coach Hayden Fry had the locker room painted pink.|Inside the visitor's pink locker room inside Kinnick Stadium. Former Iowa coach Hayden Fry had the locker room painted pink.]]

Kinnick Stadium is well known for its [[pink]] visitors' locker rooms, a tradition started by emeritus Iowa coach [[Hayden Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayden Lives On: Visitors' Quarters Still Pretty in Pink|first=Sean|last=Keeler|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/desmoinesregister/access/1785670031.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+21%2C+2005&amp;author=Keeler+Sean&amp;pub=Des+Moines+Register&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.1&amp;desc=Headline%3A+Hayden+lives+on%3A+Visitors%27+quarters+still+pretty+in+pink|newspaper=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=August 21, 2005|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that pink would put opponents in a "passive mood", and because he thought that some believed pink was a "sissy color", Fry had the visiting locker rooms decorated completely in the color pink.
{{quote box|quote=One thing we didn't paint black and gold was the stadium's visitors locker room, which we painted pink. It's a passive color, and we hoped it would put our opponents in a passive mood. Also, pink is often found in girls' bedrooms, and because of that some consider it a sissy color.|source=Hayden Fry, ''Hayden Fry: A High Porch Picnic'', p. 102&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Hayden|first2=George|last2=Wine|title=Hayden Fry: A High Porch Picnic|year=1999|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-033-9|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=75%|align=right}}

The pink locker room tradition has been continued with the newly renovated locker rooms, which include everything from pink urinals to pink lockers. Controversy flared during the 2005 season when a visiting law professor, along with other university faculty and students protested the pink coloration as demeaning to women and homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Opponents Seeing Red Over Iowa's Pink Locker Room|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9517000/|agency=[[Associated press]]|work=[[MSNBC]]|date=September 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iowa Pink Visitors' Locker Room Under Fire|first=Christopher|last=Curtis|url=http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2005/09/28/4|website=[[gay.com]]|date=September 28, 2005|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060428054204/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2005/09/28/4|archivedate=April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Buzuvis|first=Erin|title=Reading The Pink Locker Room: On Football Culture And Title IX|journal=William &amp; Mary Journal of Women and the Law|year=2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=2|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol14/iss1/2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these protests and with lots of student support, however, the locker room remains pink.

A more recent feature is the {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} bronze statue of  [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Nile Kinnick]], the statue depicts Kinnick dressed as a scholar, rather than in his football uniform. The bronze statue is placed near the team entrance to the stadium.  When the renovation of the stadium was completed, and the statue unveiled, a tradition among the players began: one player, before entering the locker room, reached out and touched the helmet that was placed at Kinnick's feet. From that point on, all Iowa players, before entering the locker room, and after getting off the bus, walk up to the statue and rub the helmet, as a token of respect for Kinnick - the only Iowa player to ever win the Heisman Trophy.

The on-field entrances to the stadium all have one thing in common, a picture of Nile Kinnick is placed above the tunnel before exiting the tunnel to the field.

==Renovation==
[[File:New Kinnick scoreboard.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The new scoreboard in the south end zone at Kinnick Stadium.]] After 75 years of operation, the [[Board of Regents, State of Iowa|Iowa Board of Regents]] endorsed a major renovation of Kinnick Stadium on March 10, 2004. The US$86.8 million project was to build a new state of the art press box, a new scoreboard with a new sound system, replace the "temporary" south endzone bleachers with permanent seating, triple the restroom facilities, and more than double the number of concession stands, as well as smaller changes such as new locker rooms, a bronze statue of [[Nile Kinnick]] and the dedication of the Krause Family Plaza to which Kinnick Stadium is now adjacent. Every brick for the renovation came from the Glen-Gery Brickyard in [[Redfield, Iowa]], which is located near Nile Kinnick's childhood home in [[Adel, Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Iowa Hawkeyes Roost in Historic Rebuilt Stadium|url=http://www.gass.com/colleen/CI_Update/CI_summer06_ebook.pdf|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was rededicated on September 1, 2006. Among other things, the rededication featured a [[flypast|flyover]] by a [[F4F Wildcat]], the aircraft that Kinnick flew in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kinnick Set to Reopen|first=Ian|last=Smith|url=http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2006/08/30/Sports/Kinnick.Set.To.Reopen-2251240.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailyiowan.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com|newspaper=[[The Daily Iowan]]|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=March 5, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305040221/http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2006/08/30/Sports/Kinnick.Set.To.Reopen-2251240.shtml?sourcedomain=www.dailyiowan.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com|archivedate=March 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium also underwent major renovations in 1956, 1983, and 1990 where capacity was gradually taken from 53,000 to 70,397. The 2004&amp;ndash;06 renovations pushed the capacity to 70,585.

In the spring of 2009, the natural grass turf and 20-year-old drainage system were replaced with a new state-of-the-art synthetic [[FieldTurf]] playing surface.

In 2013, the Iowa Board of Regents approved an $8 million upgrade of Kinnick Stadium's video and sound systems. These upgrades include the installation of new HD video displays in both the north and south endzones, as well as a new HD ribbon display above the north endzone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Regents Approve Kinnick Video, Sound Upgrade|first=Marc|last=Morehouse|url=http://thegazette.com/2013/04/25/regents-approve-kinnick-video-sound-upgrade/|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)]]|date=April 25, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upgrades were completed by the start of the 2013 football season.

In 2016, the Iowa Board of Regents approved an $89.9 million upgrade to Kinnick Stadium's north end zone. The proposed renovation features the addition of box seating, outdoor club seating and a scoreboard larger than the board in the south end zone. All seating will be ready for the 2018 football season while the rest of the project is scheduled to be completed by the start of the 2019 football season.&lt;ref name="2016 Renovation"&gt;{{cite web |title=UI Receives Approval for Kinnick Stadium Renovation|url=http://www.hawkeyesports.com/news/2016/10/20/football-ui-receives-approval-for-kinnick-stadium-renovation.aspx|publisher=The University of Iowa Athletics|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Children's Hospital and the Wave==
The [[University of Iowa Children's Hospital]]'s new building overlooks the Kinnick Stadium. The opening of the new hospital in 2017 led to the creation of what [[ESPN]] called "[[college football]]'s coolest new tradition." 

The new facility includes a top-floor lounge area known as the Press Box Cafe that has a view of the entire field, allowing patients and their families to see all Iowa home games live, and also includes big-screen TVs to allow them to watch Hawkeyes road games. A suggestion on a Hawkeyes fan page on [[Facebook]] led to "The Wave"—at the end of the first quarter of Iowa home games, the crowd faces the hospital and waves at the patients and their families watching in the Press Box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/20744480/iowa-hawkeyes-hospital-wave |title=Inside college football's coolest new tradition: Iowa's hospital wave |first=Mitch |last=Sherman |publisher=''[[ESPN.com]]'' |date=September 18, 2017 |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Hawkeyes' first night home game of the [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|2017 season]] against [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], the fan site where the idea of "The Wave" originated encouraged fans to turn on their cell phone flashlights while they waved to the patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Meet-the-woman-who-helped-make-The-Wave-happen-446953363.html |title=Meet the woman who helped make 'The Wave' happen |first=Forrest |last=Saunders |publisher=[[KCRG-TV]] |location=Cedar Rapids, Iowa |date=September 22, 2017 |accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Kinnick Voodoo" ==
Since 2008, Iowa is 4-1 against AP Top 5 opponents in Kinnick Stadium. In 2008, an unranked Iowa beat 3rd ranked [[2008 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] on kicker Daniel Murray’s walk off field goal. The game-winning field goal capped a stunning Iowa comeback in a game that Penn State led 23-14 with 9:21 remaining in the 4th quarter.

In 2010, 5th ranked [[2010 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] visited Kinnick Stadium looking to continue their undefeated season. The 18th ranked Hawkeyes would beat the Spartans by a final score of 37-6, in a game that Iowa led 30-0 at halftime. The Spartans would not put any points on the scoreboard until the 4th quarter.

In 2015, fans in Kinnick Stadium got to witness Iowa's most successful regular season in school history. The [[2015 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Hawkeyes]] went 12-0 and won the Big Ten West Division. After a heartbreaking loss in the [[2015 Big Ten Football Championship Game|Big Ten Championship Game]] to [[2015 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]], the Hawkeyes received a bid to the [[2016 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], its first [[College Football Playoff New Year's Six|New Year's Six bowl]] invitation since the start of the College Football Playoff system.

In 2016, 3rd ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] was knocked off by an unranked Iowa by a score of 14-13, with kicker Keith Duncan’s walk off game-winning field goal. The game was televised on [[ABC Saturday Night Football]].

In 2017, an unranked and 20 point underdog Iowa knocked off the 3rd ranked [[2017 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State Buckeyes]] by a score of 55-24. Earlier in 2017, it took a touchdown on 4th down on the last play of the game for the 3rd ranked [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State Nittany Lions]] to beat the unranked Hawkeyes  21-19. The game was televised on [[ABC Saturday Night Football]].

'''Laugardalshöll''' is an [[indoor arena|indoor sporting arena]] located in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. The capacity of the arena is 5,500 people.

It hosts various sporting events, such as handball, basketball, volleyball and athletics, as well as for other events. Aside from sporting events, it is the largest concert venue in Iceland, with a maximum capacity of 11,000. Aside from sports and music events, it serves as a general purpose hall for all manner of events.

==Events==
Perhaps the most prominent event to be held at Laugardalshöll was the [[World Chess Championship 1972]], often dubbed the "Match of the Century", in which [[United States of America|America]]n challenger [[Bobby Fischer]] defeated the [[Russia]] champion [[Boris Spassky]]. The movie ''[[Bobby Fischer Against the World]]'' (2011) features scenes from Laugardalshöll.&lt;ref&gt;Conolly, Jez and Caroline Whelan. ''World Film Locations: Reykjavik''. Intellect Books. Page 100. {{ISBN|9781841506418}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena which hosted the [[1995 World Men's Handball Championship]] and many matches of the [[Iceland national handball team]], one of the most successful sports of the country.

On November 6, 2010, the "National Assembly", the first step of a constitutional reform process, was held here. It gathered 1000 citizens, randomly picked in the national register. It produced a document listing the main principles of the island nation.

From 2007 to 2011, it also hosted [[CCP Games]]' [[EVE Online]] annual 'Fanfest'.

Every year since 2016, the arena has held the finals of [[Söngvakeppnin]], the Icelandic preliminary round for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">[[File:Ice_Hockey_Left_Wing_Lock.gif|thumb|250px|In this diagram, the red team is executing a left wing lock.]]The '''left wing lock''' is a defensive [[ice hockey]] strategy similar to the [[neutral zone trap]].

In the most basic form, once puck possession changes, the [[Winger (ice hockey)|left wing]] moves back in line with the [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defencemen]]. Each defender (including the left winger) plays a [[zone defence]] and is responsible for a third of the ice each.{{sfn|Raimondo|2007}} Since there are normally only two defencemen, this [[Ice hockey#Tactics|tactic]] helps to avoid [[odd man rush]]es.  

With the reinforced defensive line, the [[Centre (ice hockey)|centre]] and [[Winger (hockey)|right wing]] [[forecheck]] aggressively. Often the forecheckers will try to drive the puck over to the opponent's right wing.

Under coach [[Scotty Bowman]], the [[Detroit Red Wings]] began using "the lock" heavily during the [[1994-95 NHL season]], earning the [[President's Trophy]] for the league's best record during the regular season. The following season Detroit was even more dominant, finishing one point short of the [[NHL]] record for most points in a season by a team. However, the system broke down during the playoffs each year, especially as they were frustrated by the neutral zone trap strategy employed by [[Jacques Lemaire]]'s [[New Jersey Devils]] in the [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals]]. It was not until 1997 that Detroit broke through and finally matched their regular-season success with a [[Stanley Cup]] championship.

Although "the lock" was made famous by the Red Wings and has been used to great success in their [[Stanley Cup]] runs in the past decade, they are not credited with inventing it. The "lock" was invented in [[Czechoslovakia]] to work against the dominant [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|teams]] of the 1970s.{{sfn|Raimondo|2007}} A former assistant coach under Scotty Bowman, [[Barry Smith (ice hockey, born 1952)|Barry Smith]], was credited with seeing the left wing lock in [[Europe]] and bringing it back to the Red Wings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/barry-smith/ Barry Smith - Slap Shot Blog], ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The simplicity of "the lock" has made it popular at all levels of hockey and it is not uncommon to see it implemented in [[youth hockey]].

'''Macclesfield Cricket Club Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in Victoria Road, [[Macclesfield]], Cheshire. A small ground,&lt;ref name="NEWS"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/macclesfieldexpress/news/s/394950_cricket_club_defends_its_land_swap_deal|title=Cricket club defends its land swap deal|last=Taylor|first=Paul|date=7 August 2003|work=[[Macclesfield Express]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is bordered to the east by [[Macclesfield District Hospital]] and to the south and west by housing. The ground is used by [[Macclesfield Cricket Club]]. [[Field hockey]] and [[lawn bowls]] are also played at the ground.

==History==
Macclesfield Cricket Club has been in existence for over 180 years, though where the club originally played is unknown. The first recorded match on the current ground came in [[Cheshire County Cricket Club|Cheshire's]] first match there in the 1921 [[Minor Counties Championship]] against [[Staffordshire County Cricket Club|Staffordshire]].&lt;ref name="MCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/613_minc.html|title=Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Macclesfield Cricket Club Ground|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheshire played an annual Minor Counties Championship at the ground until 1931.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; [[Minor counties of English and Welsh cricket|Minor counties]] cricket did not return to the ground until 1949, when Cheshire played the [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire Second XI]] in the Minor Counties Championship. Cheshire played annually at the ground throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It was in the [[1966 Gillette Cup]] that the ground held its first [[List A cricket|List A]] match when Cheshire played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] opponents in the form of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="LAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/613_a.html|title=List A Matches played on Macclesfield Cricket Club Ground|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two further List A matches were held there in the [[1968 Gillette Cup]], with Cheshire defeating [[Norfolk County Cricket Club|Norfolk]] in a first round match, but losing to [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] in the second round.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; A final List A match was held there in 1974, when the ground was selected as a home venue for [[Minor Counties North]] in the [[1974 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup|Benson &amp; Hedges Cup]], with Lancashire as the visitors.&lt;ref name="LAM"/&gt; The ground continued to host Minor Counties Championship matches during the 1970s, with the final Minor Counties Championship match held in 1982.&lt;ref name="MCM"/&gt; In 1983, the ground held the first final of the [[MCCA Knockout Trophy]], which saw Cheshire triumph over [[Bedfordshire County Cricket Club|Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/44/44063.html|title=Cheshire v Bedfordshire, 1983 MCCA Kockout Trophy|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second MCCA Knockout Trophy match was held in 1984, with [[Hertfordshire County Cricket Club|Hertfordshire]] as the visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/613_mint.html|title=Minor Counties Trophy Matches played on Macclesfield Cricket Club Ground|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time the ground was used by Cheshire.

In latter years the ground has had to contend with deteriorating facilities. In 2003, plans were drawn up for Macclesfield Cricket Club to sell the ground for development and move to a new ground along London Road.&lt;ref name="NEWS"/&gt; However these plans failed to come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/macclesfieldexpress/news/s/405810_cricket_ground_plan_rejected_by_inspector|title=Cricket ground plan rejected by inspector|date=6 October 2004|work=[[Macclesfield Express]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, plans were drawn up to transform the ground into one of the leading leisure facilities in Cheshire, with the undertaking of an £800,000 redevelopment project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/macclesfieldexpress/news/s/1408295_video_cricket_club_sets_out_new_vision|title=Cricket club sets out new vision|last=Slater|first=Chris|date=16 February 2011|work=[[Macclesfield Express]]|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began operation in November 2006 as the first slots casino in the state of Pennsylvania.

In January 2010, [[Ed Rendell|then Governor Ed Rendell]] signed a bill to legalize [[table game]]s in Pennsylvania.  The Mohegan Sun casino was among the first to receive approval for table games, and planned to hire 600 new employees for the expansion.  Table games began operation on July 13, 2010.

In November 2013, Mohegan Sun opened a hotel that is connected to the casino floor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">The Pakistan national Team, led by [[Asif Iqbal (cricketer, born 1943)|Asif Iqbal]], came to Bangladesh for a short tour in January, 1980, in the middle of their long tour of India. Two matches were scheduled, a two-day match at [[Chittagong]]. followed by a 3-Day fixture at [[Dacca]]. Unortunately, trouble broke out during the Tea break in the second day of the match at Chittagong, and the remainder of the tour was abandoned.

==Unfortunate incident==
A section of the crowd entered the ground immediately after the tea break on the second day attacking the Pak players. They were angry over the alleged remarks by some Pak cricketers about the independence of Bangladesh. It is still impossible to verify the truth of the allegation. But the match was instantly called off, and consequently the 3-Day match at [[Dhaka]] was cancelled. This was a big disappointment for the Dhaka crowd, as more than 30,000 tickets were already sold.

==Uneasy relations==
As the tourists left to restart their tour of India, the cricketing relationship between Bangladesh and Pakistan reached a new low. A tour of Pakistan by the Bangladesh team, scheduled for the following month was promptly cancelled. Though, [[Mushtaq Mohammad]] led a PIA side in Feb. 1984, it was really the tour of the Omar Quareshi XI, (led by [[Imran Khan]]), in Jan 1986, that eventually normalized the relationship. A Bangladeshi team, led by [[Gazi Ashraf]] toured [[Bangladeshi cricket team in Pakistan in 1986|Pakistan]] in March, and the two teams met on their first official ODI on 31 March, in the 2nd Asia Cup.

The football side of the stadium (located beyond the right and right center field fence of the baseball field) only has bleachers on one side of the field.&lt;ref name="QU Football"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quhawks.com/sports/2010/12/27/FB_1227101536.aspx|title=QU Stadium-Football|publisher=quhawks.com|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is surrounded by its original limestone wall built in 1938.

==History==
The stadium was built in 1938 as part of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]&lt;ref name="QU Baseball"/&gt; and originally owned by the City of Quincy. It is constructed of large limestone blocks and concrete.  A "sister" facility of limestone and concrete was built near Quincy High School (which was then located at 13th &amp; Maine). This sister facility was the practice field for Quincy High School athletic teams until a new high school was built at 30th &amp; Maine. At that time, the building at 13th &amp; Maine became Quincy Junior High School and the athletic fields continued to be used by QJHS athletic teams.

In 1984, the city sold the stadium to Quincy College (later [[Quincy University]]), a local liberal-arts 4-year Roman Catholic college affiliated with the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans). The name of the stadium was changed to QC stadium and then to QU stadium, after Quincy College changed its name to Quincy University.&lt;ref name="Gems"/&gt;

===Baseball history===
The stadium has been home to the [[Quincy Gems (baseball)|Quincy Gems baseball]] of the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League|Three-I League]] from 1946 to 1956.&lt;ref name="BB Ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Q_Stadium|title=Q Stadium|publisher=baseball-reference.com|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1960 to 1961 the [[Quincy Giants]] of the [[Midwest League]] (ML) played there. During the 1962 and 1963 seasons the [[Quincy Jets]] ([[Midwest League|ML]]), a [[New York Mets]] farm team, played their home games at the stadium and in 1964 another [[Quincy Gems (baseball)|Quincy Gems baseball]] team played at the stadium.

===Football history===
The stadium was originally used for football by [[Quincy Senior High School]] and [[Quincy Notre Dame High School]] as their home football field until a new stadium was completed in 1980 (Flinn Stadium). Both schools, as well as Quincy College (later [[Quincy University]]), used the baseball side of the stadium for football.&lt;ref name="QU Football"/&gt;

After both high schools quit using the stadium for football, the Quincy YMCA Tackle Football League began using the football side for the 7th &amp; 8th grade league.  The YMCA also used the field for two youth flag football leagues – a 2nd through 4th grade league, and a 5th &amp; 6th grade league.  The Quincy Family YMCA completed a field on its property, so the tackle football and flag football leagues moved to that field in 1984.

In 1987, then [[Quincy University|Quincy College]] re-instated its football program after an over 30 year hiatus. The Hawks began using the football side of QC Stadium competing in NCAA Division III.  The Hawks moved up to NCAA Division II during the 1990s. In 2010, the football team moved to Flinn Stadium, but moved back to QU Stadium in 2014 after a major renovation.&lt;ref name="QU Football"/&gt;

''Sleeping Bag Liners'' are lightweight cloth sacks usually fitted inside [[sleeping bag]]s to provide extra comfort, insulation, and help keep the sleeping bag clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/5-best-sleeping-bag-liners-10082198.html|title=''5 best sleeping bag liners'' - independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dofeshopping.org/expedition-kit/sleeping-bags-and-mats|title=Advice on Sleeping Bag Liners from The Duke of Edinburgh's Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thin bag liner may feel softer against the sleeper's skin, add 5 F warmth to the bag (not pad), and be easily washed after use (unlike the thicker sleeping bag).   A thick, fleece-like liner can increase warmth by 10-15 F.  Liners also allow a sleeper to use the liner alone, without the bag in hot conditions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/sleeping-bag-liners.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theadventurejunkies.com/best-sleeping-bag-liner/&lt;/ref&gt;  Optionally, bug-repellents, pockets, and a pillow holder can be added to liners.

A [[vapor barrier]] liner (VBL) is special type of liner that blocks the sleeper's moisture from reaching the bag, thus stopping [[Heat transfer#Evaporative cooling|evaporative]] heat loss.  Usually a sleeping bag liner is used inside a VBL.

''Bag Liners'' are issued as basic kit by various militaries including the [[United States Armed Forces|US]] and [[British Armed Forces|British]] armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/Black_Bag_A5_booklet.pdf|title=Clothing for Operations "The Black Bag" - Ministry of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fabrics ==

''Liners'' are made of [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[nylon]] and [[polyester]] among others.

Silk liners are light, soft and strong and retain much thermal insulation even when wet.

Cotton is heavier and bulkier than silk and absorbs water.

Synthetic [mix] liners are usually light, strong, and do not absorb water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Southgate Cricket Club''' is located in the [[London]] suburb of [[Southgate, London|Southgate]]. The club played eight matches ranked as [[first-class cricket|first-class]] between 1863 and 1868. Six of these were against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and the remaining two were against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. Though recognised as first-class fixtures, they were all scheduled for only two days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com CricketArchive scorecard oracle - search on team name of "Southgate"].&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were away fixtures.

== Club history ==
The club was founded in 1855 by the Walker brothers, the famous [[The Walkers of Southgate|"Walkers of Southgate"]]. Its ground, Chapel Fields in Waterfall Road, Southgate, was renamed the [[John Walker's Ground|Walker Cricket Ground]] in their honour in 1907 and is maintained by the Walker Trust to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/ground/57319.html Cricinfo: "The Walker Cricket Ground, Southgate"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewalkerground.co.uk Walker Trust website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the Walker brothers played for the [[United All-England Eleven]]. Both the United All-England team and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] would visit Southgate to take on the brothers and their team, attracting crowds of up to 10,000.

More recently Southgate CC won the national club cricket competition in 1977 (then called the John Haig Trophy) and the Middlesex County Cricket League in 1976 and 1977.

== The club today ==
The club and its ground are very active. The club now plays in the [[Middlesex County Cricket League]]. [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex CCC]], which was also founded by the Walkers, still occasionally plays [[County Championship]], one day and 20/20 matches at the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/107/107805.html Scorecard of Middlesex v Leicestershire at Southgate, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the 1st XI gained promotion to the Middlesex County Cricket League Premier Division, winning the Division Two championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southgatecc.com/champions/ Southgate CC Website, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The club remains in the Premier League at the start of the 2017 season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middlesexccl.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
