In [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]], '''anterior consonants''' refer to [[consonant]]s [[Place of articulation|articulated]] in the front of the mouth; they comprise the [[labial consonant]]s, [[dental consonant]]s and [[alveolar consonant]]s. [[Retroflex]] and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] consonants, as well as all consonants articulated further back in the mouth, are usually excluded.

Some versions of [[featural phonology]] posit anterior consonants to be characterized by a [[phonological feature]] [+anterior], and distinguish labial consonants by the feature [+labial]. Under this scheme, there is no feature such as [dental], and dental or alveolar consonants are simply modelled as the [[unmarked]] counterpart of the labial consonants: [+anterior], [-labial].

'''Assyrian Neo-Aramaic''' ({{lang-syc|ܣܘܪܝܬ}}, ''sūrët''), or simply '''Assyrian''', is a [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] language within the [[Semitic language|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic]] language family, that is largely spoken by [[Assyrian people]], who are also known as [[Terms for Syriac Christians|Syriac Christians]].&lt;ref name="Nordhoff, Sebastian 2013"&gt;Nordhoff, Sebastian; Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds.

Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is spoken by an estimated 200,000 people&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; who are native to [[Upper Mesopotamia]], which is a large region stretching from the plain of [[Urmia]] in northwestern [[Iran]], to the [[Nineveh plains]], and the [[Irbil]], [[Kirkuk]] and [[Duhok]] regions in northern [[Iraq]], together with the [[Al Hasakah]] region of northeastern [[Syria]], and parts of southeastern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Maclean 1895"&gt;[[Arthur John Maclean|Maclean, Arthur John]] (1895).

Cambridge University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Instability throughout the [[Middle East]] over the past century has led to a worldwide diaspora of Assyrian speakers, with many [[Assyrian–Chaldean–Syriac diaspora|speakers now living abroad]], such as in [[North America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Assyrians After Assyria, Parpola&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] are ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and are descendants of the ancient Assyrian inhabitants of Northern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;The Fihrist (Catalog): A Tench Century Survey of Islamic Culture.

Translator: Bayard Dodge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories, VII.63, s:History of Herodotus/Book 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From a lecture by J. A. Brinkman: "There is no reason to believe that there would be no racial or cultural continuity in Assyria, since there is no evidence that the population of Assyria was removed." Quoted in Efram Yildiz's "The Assyrians" Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, 13.1, pp. 22, ref 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Especially in view of the very early establishment of Christianity in Assyria and its continuity to the present and the continuity of the population, I think there is every likelihood that ancient Assyrians are among the ancestors of modern Assyrians of the area." Biggs, pp. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is one of the largest Neo-Aramaic languages (232,000 speakers), with Chaldean Neo-Aramaic (213,000 speakers) and Turoyo (250,000 speakers) making up most of the remaining Neo-Aramaic speakers. Despite the terms ''Chaldean Neo-Aramaic'' and ''Assyrian Neo-Aramaic'' indicating a separate ethnic identity, both the languages and their native speakers originate from the same [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n region (which was [[Assyria]]).&lt;ref name="Nordhoff, Sebastian 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;*{{cite journal

 |quote=Based on interviews with community informants, this paper explores socialization for ingroup identity and endogamy among Assyrians in the United States. The Assyrians descent from the population of ancient [[Assyria]] (founded in the 24th century BC), and have lived as a [[linguistic]], political, religious, and [[ethnic minority]] in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey since the fall of the [[Assyrian Empire]] in 608 BC. Practices that maintain ethnic and cultural continuity in the [[Near East]], the United States and elsewhere include language and residential patterns, ethnically based [[Christian]] [[local church|church]]es characterized by unique holidays and [[rite]]s, and culturally specific practices related to life-cycle events and [[food preparation]]. The interviews probe parental attitudes and practices related to ethnic [[Cultural identity|identity]] and encouragement of [[endogamy]]. Results are being analyzed.

Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is, to a significant degree, [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and they are sometimes considered to constitute dialects of the same language rather than two separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;Tekoglu, R. &amp; Lemaire, A. (2000). La bilingue royale louvito-phénicienne de Çineköy. Comptes rendus de l’Académie des inscriptions, et belleslettres, année 2000, 960-1006.&lt;/ref&gt; To a moderate degree, Assyrian is also intelligible with [[Senaya]], [[Lishana Deni]] and [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]] (which are, at times, also considered to be dialects of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic), and is partially intelligible with [[Lishan Didan]], [[Hulaulá]] and [[Lishanid Noshan]].&lt;ref&gt;Avenery, Iddo, ''The Aramaic Dialect of the Jews of Zakho''.

Aramaic was the language of commerce, trade and communication and became the vernacular language of [[Assyria]] in the late [[Iron Age]] and [[classical antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightofword.org/aramaic/pdf/Introduction.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - PeshittaNewTestament.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202005322/http://www.lightofword.org/aramaic/pdf/Introduction.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imperial aramaic"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718444 Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B.

Aramaic writing has been found as far north as [[Hadrians Wall]] in [[Ancient Britain]], in the form of inscriptions in Aramaic, made by [[Assyria]]n and [[Aramean]] soldiers serving in the [[Roman Legions]] in northern England during the 2nd{{nbsp}}century AD.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrian Empire resorted to a policy of deporting troublesome conquered peoples (predominantly fellow [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[Arameans|Aramean]] tribes as well as many [[Jews]]) into the lands of [[Mesopotamia]]. By the 6th{{nbsp}}century, the indigenous and originally [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking [[Semitic people|Semites]] of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]], spoke Akkadian-infused dialects of [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]]. Consequently, during the Persian rule of Assyria, Aramaic gradually became the main language spoken by the Assyrians.
Even before the Empire fell, the Assyrians had made Aramaic the'' lingua franca'' of its empire, and were capable of speaking both [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and Aramaic.&lt;ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrian Identity in Ancient Times and Today"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Simo Parpola|Parpola, Simo]] |year=2004 |title=National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times |journal=[[Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies]]|volume=18|issue=2|publisher=JAAS|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-17|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local unwritten Aramaic dialects emerged from [[Imperial Aramaic]] in [[Assyria]]–[[northern Mesopotamia]], an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-influenced version of the [[Old Aramaic]] language which was introduced as the lingua franca of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] by [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745–727{{nbsp}}BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The impact of Israeli Hebrew on the Neo-Aramaic dialect of the Kurdish Jews of Zakho: a case of language shift|journal=[[Hebrew Union College Annual]]|number=46 |last = Sabar |first = Yona |authorlink=Yona Sabar |year = 1975 |pages=489–508}}

Following the [[Achaemenid Assyria|Achaemenid]] conquest of Assyria under [[Darius I]], the [[Aramaic language]] was adopted as the "vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages". After the conquest of Assyria by the [[Seleucid Empire]] in the late 4th century BC, Imperial Aramaic and other Aramaic dialects gradually lost their status as imperial languages but continued to flourish as lingua francas alongside [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drijvers|first=H.

R.}} p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that the adoption of Syriac, was led by missionaries. Much literary effort was put into the production of an authoritative translation of the Bible into Syriac, the [[Peshitta]] ({{lang|syr|ܦܫܝܛܬܐ}} ''{{transl|syr|Pšīṭtā}}''). At the same time, [[Ephrem the Syrian]] was producing the most treasured collection of poetry and theology in the Syriac language. 

By the 3rd century AD, churches in [[Edessa]] in the [[Neo-Assyrian]] kingdom of [[Osroene]] began to use Syriac as the language of worship and the language became the literary and liturgical language of many churches in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. Syriac was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Middle East]] until 900 AD, when it was superseded by [[Arabic]].The differences with the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] led to the bitter [[Nestorian schism]] in the Syriac-speaking world. As a result, Syriac developed distinctive [[Turoyo language|western]] and eastern varieties. Although remaining a single language with a high level of comprehension between the varieties, the two employ distinctive variations in pronunciation and writing system, and, to a lesser degree, in vocabulary.

The [[Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century, and the religiously motivated massacres of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] by [[Tamurlane]] further contributed to the rapid decline of the language. In many places outside of northern Mesopotamia (the [[Assyrian homeland]]), even in liturgy, it was replaced by [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Isabella, ''Journeys in Persia and Kurdistan, including a summer in the Upper Karun region and a visit to the Nestorian rayahs'', London: J. Murray, 1891, vol. ii, pp. 282 and 306&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Mesopotamian]] writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC, the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Odisho, Edward Y. (2001). „ADM’s educational policy: A serious project of Assyrian language maintenance and revitalization “, Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, XV/1:3-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 2700 BC, [[cuneiform]] began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], a [[language isolate]]. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for [[logograms]], [[syllable]]s and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonia]]n) around 2600 BC. With the adoption of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as the 'lingua franca' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609{{nbsp}}BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing, Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'' pp 381–383&lt;/ref&gt;

The Syriac script is a [[writing system]] primarily used to write the [[Syriac language]] from the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578972/Syriac-alphabet | title=Syriac alphabet | work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[abjad]]s directly descending from the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and shares similarities with the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], and the traditional [[Mongolian script|Mongolian alphabet]]s. The alphabet consists of 22 letters, all of which are consonants. It is a [[cursive]] script where some, but not all, letters connect within a word.&lt;ref&gt;Pennacchietti, Fabrizio A. (1997). „On the etymology of the Neo-Aramaic particle qam/kim; in Hebrew“, M. Bar-Aher (ed.): Gideon Goldenberg Festschrift, Massorot, Stud&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern development===
[[File:East Syriac Karshuni Script Thaksa.jpg|thumb|left|250px|East Syriac [[Garshuni]] script in ''Madnhāyā'' script, 1799.]]
The oldest and classical form of the alphabet is ''{{transl|sem|ʾEsṭrangēlā}}'' ({{lang|syr|ܐܣܛܪܢܓܠܐ}}); the name is thought to derive from the Greek adjective {{lang|grc|στρογγύλη}} (''strongylē'', 'rounded'),&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hatch|Hatch, William]] (1946). ''An album of dated Syriac manuscripts''. Boston: The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, reprinted in 2002 by Gorgias Press. p. 24. {{ISBN|1-931956-53-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888).

[translated to English as ''Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary'', by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams &amp; Norgate 1889. p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt; Although ʾEsṭrangēlā is no longer used as the main script for writing Syriac, it has undergone some revival since the 10th century.

When [[Arabic language|Arabic]] gradually began to be the dominant spoken language in the [[Fertile Crescent]] after the 7th century AD, texts were often written in Arabic with the Syriac script. [[Malayalam]] was also written with Syriac script and was called [[Suriyani Malayalam]].&lt;ref&gt;Thackston, Wheeler M. (1999). ''Introduction to Syriac''. Bethesda, MD: Ibex Publishers, Inc. {{ISBN|0-936347-98-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Madnhāyā'', or eastern, version formed as a form of shorthand developed from the Syriac alphabet and progressed further as handwriting patterns changed. The ''Madnhāyā'' version also possesses vowel markings to help foreigners learn and read Syriac. Other names for the script include ''{{transl|sem|Swāḏāyā}}'', "conversational", often translated as "contemporary", reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Coakley, J. F. (2002).

===Letters===
{{Syriac alphabet}}
Three letters act as [[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]: rather than being a consonant, they indicate a vowel. ''[[Aleph (letter)|ʾĀlap̄]]'' ({{lang|syr|ܐ}}), the first letter, represents a [[glottal stop]], but it can also indicate a vowel at the beginning or the end of a word. The letter ''[[Waw (letter)|Waw]]'' ({{lang|syr|ܘ}}) is the consonant ''w'', but can also represent the vowels ''o'' and ''u''. Likewise, the letter ''{{Nowrap|[[Yodh|Yōḏ]]'' ({{lang|syr|ܝ}})}} represents the consonant ''y'', but it also stands for the vowels ''i'' and ''e''. In addition to foreign sounds, a marking system is used to distinguish ''{{transl|sem|qūššāyā}}'', 'hard' letters) from ''{{transl|sem|rūkkāḵā}}'', 'soft' letters). The letters ''Bēṯ'', ''Gāmal'', ''Dālaṯ'', ''Kāp̄'', ''Pē'', and ''Taw'', all [[plosives]] ('hard'), are able to be [[spirantization|spirantized]] into [[fricative]]s ('soft').&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, George (1866). ''A Syriac Grammar''. Cambridge: Deighton, Bell, &amp; Co.; London: Bell &amp; Daldy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system involves placing a single dot underneath the letter to give its 'soft' variant and a dot above the letter to give its 'hard' variant (though, in modern usage, no mark at all is usually used to indicate the 'hard' value).&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, Ioannis Davidis (1784). ''Grammatica Syriaca''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the script has 22 consonants and 3 vowels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle, Eberhard]] (1888). ''Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar''. Berlin: H. Reuther's Verlagsbuchhandlung. [translated to English as ''Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary'', by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams &amp; Norgate 1889].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin alphabet===
{{further|Syriac alphabet#Latin alphabet and romanization}}
In the 1930s, following the state policy for minority languages of the [[Soviet Union]], a [[Latin alphabet]] was developed and some material published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/syriac.pdf Syriac Romanization Table]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Brock, "Three Thousand Years of Aramaic literature", in Aram,1:1 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that this innovation did not displace the Syriac script, the usage of the Latin script in the Assyrian community has become rather widespread due to the [[Assyrian diaspora]]'s settlement mostly being in [[Europe]] and the [[anglophone]], where the Latin script dominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language = de |title = Neusyrisches in Lateinschrift aus der Sowjetunion|journal=[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]|number=109 |last = Friedrich |first = Johannes |authorlink=Johannes Friedrich (linguist) |year = 1959 |pages=50–81 |url = http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/94045}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin alphabet is preferred by most Assyrians for practical reasons and its convenience, especially in [[social media]], where it is used to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle, Eberhard (1888). Syrische Grammatik mit Litteratur, Chrestomathie und Glossar. Berlin: H. Reuther's Verlagsbuchhandlung. [translated to English as Syriac grammar with bibliography, chrestomathy and glossary, by R. S. Kennedy. London: Williams &amp; Norgate 1889. p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Syriac Latin alphabet contains [[diacritics]], most Assyrians rarely utilize the modified letters and would conveniently rely on the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|basic Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;Moscati, Sabatino, et al. The Comparative Grammar of Semitic Languages. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden, Germany, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin alphabet is also a useful tool to present Assyrian terminology to anyone who is not familiar with the Syriac script.&lt;ref&gt;Hatch, William (1946). An album of dated Syriac manuscripts. Boston: The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, reprinted in 2002 by Gorgias Press. p. 24. {{ISBN|1-931956-53-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A precise [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] may not be necessary for native Assyrian speakers, as they would be able to pronounce words correctly, but it can be very helpful for those not quite familiar with Syriac and more informed with the Latin script. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Studies in Modern Syriac |journal = [[Journal of Semitic Studies]] |volume = 6 |number = 1 |last = Polotsky |first = Hans Jakob |authorlink = Hans Jakob Polotsky |year = 1961 |pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] {{IPAslink|ʕ}}, as heard in ''[[ayin]]'' (ܥ), is a marginal phoneme that is generally upheld in formal or religious speech and in [[hymn]]s. Among the majority of Assyrian speakers, ''ayin'' would be realized as diphthongs {{IPA|/aɪ̯/}} or {{IPA|/eɪ̯/}}, and even /ɛ/, depending on the dialect. However, the letter ''itself'' is still usually uttered with {{IPA|/ʕ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Brock|Brock, Sebastian]] (2006). ''An Introduction to Syriac Studies''. Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press. {{ISBN|1-59333-349-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/f/}} is a phoneme only heard in the [[Tyari]], Barwari and Chaldean dialects. In most of the other Assyrian varieties it merges with {{IPA|/p/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Rudder, Joshua. ''Learn to Write Aramaic: A Step-by-Step Approach to the Historical &amp; Modern Scripts''. n.p.: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2011. 220 pp. {{ISBN|978-1461021421}} Includes the Estrangela (pp. 59–113), Madnhaya (pp. 191–206), and the Western Serto (pp. 173–190) scripts.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} are strictly used in the Tyari, Barwari and Chaldean dialects, which respectively merge with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} in [[standard variety|standard]] Assyrian (''Iraqi Koine/Urmian'') and other ''Ashiret'' dialects. Furthermore, in the Upper Tyari dialects, /t/ is mostly [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] and replaced with {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. As such, due to the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], the word ''be'''t'''a'' ("house") in standard Assyrian will be pronounced as ''be'''sh'''a''. In the Marga dialect, the /t/ may at times be replaced with an /s/ ("''be'''s'''a''").
* In the Urmian dialect {{IPA|/w/}} has a widespread allophone {{IPAblink|ʋ}} (it may vacillate to {{IPAblink|v}} for some speakers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Aramaic| encyclopedia = The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|publisher=William B Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA |year=1975|isbn=0-8028-2402-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some Jilu speakers, {{IPAslink|q}} may be uttered as {{IPAblink|k}}. As such, '''''q'''alama'' ("pen") will be pronounced as '''''k'''alama''.
* In the Urmian and some Tyari dialects, {{IPAslink|ɡ}} is palatalized and thus pronounced as {{IPAblink|dʒ}}. Therefore, '''''g'''ana'' ("self") in standard Assyrian will be uttered as '''''j'''ana''.&lt;ref&gt;Tsereteli, Konstantin G. (1990). „The velar spirant 0 in modern East Aramaic Dialects“, W. Heinrichs (ed.): Studies in Neo-Aramaic (Harvard Semitic Studies 36), Atlanta, 35-42.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/k/}} may be palatalized as {{IPAblink|tʃ}} in Urmian and Nochiya speakers. So for example, '''''k'''ma'' ("how much") will be pronounced as '''''ch'''ma''.
* {{IPA|[[Voiced velar fricative|/ɣ/]]}} is a marginal phoneme that occurs in a few words, albeit only for some speakers (mainly those who speak [[Arabic]] as a second language). For others, it is realized as {{IPA|[[Voiceless velar fricative|/x/]]}}.
* In some Tyari and Chaldean dialects {{IPA|/r/}} may be realized as {{IPAblink|ɹ}}.&lt;ref&gt;*Beyer, Klaus (1986). ''The Aramaic language: its distribution and subdivisions''. Göttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht. {{ISBN|3-525-53573-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some speakers, a [[dental click]] (English ''tsk'') may be used para-linguistically as a negative response to a "[[Yes and no|yes or no]]" question. This feature is more common among those who still live in the homeland or in the Middle East, than those living in the diaspora.

=== Vowels ===
Vowel phonemes of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (''Standard Urmian/Iraqi Koine'') are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Coakley, J. F. (2002). ''Robinson's paradigms and exercises in Syriac grammar'' (5th ed.). Oxford University Press. pp. 10–14 {{ISBN|978-0-19-926129-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{IPA|/a/}}, as commonly uttered in words like ''n'''a'''sha'' ("man") and ''n'''a'''ra'' ("river"), is central {{IPAblink|ä}} for many speakers. Though it is usually {{IPAblink|a}} in the Urmian and [[Nochiya tribe|Nochiya]] dialects. For some Urmian and [[Jilu]] speakers, {{IPAblink|æ}} may be used instead. In those having a thicker Jilu dialect, this vowel is mostly fronted and raised to {{IPAblink|ɛ}}. In the [[Tyari]] and [[Barwari]] dialects, it is usually more back {{IPAblink|ɑ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Theodore Henry (1915). ''Paradigms and exercises in Syriac grammar''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-926129-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, a [[long vowel]], as heard in ''r'''a'''ba'' ("much"), may also be realised as {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, depending on the speaker. It is more rounded and higher in the Urmian dialect, where it is realized as {{IPAblink|ɔ}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Brockelmann|Brockelmann, Carl]] (1895). ''Lexicon Syriacum''. Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard; Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, heard in ''b'''e'''ta'' ("house") is generally diphthongized to {{IPA|[eɪ̯]}} in the [[Andaç, Uludere|Halmon]] dialect (a Lower Tyari tribe). To note, the [eɪ̯] [[diphthong]] is a [[Conservative (language)|vestigial]] trait of [[classical Syriac]] and thereby it may be used in [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|formal speech]] as well, such as in [[Sacred language|liturgy]] and [[hymn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tsereteli, Konstantin G. (1972). „The Aramaic dialects of Iraq“, Annali dell’Istituto Ori-entale di Napoli 32 (n. s. 22):245-250.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/i/}}, as heard in ''k'''ee'''pa'' ("rock"), may be realized as {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in the Tyari, Barwari, Chaldean and Baz dialects.
* {{IPA|/ə/}} (a [[schwa]]), uttered in words like ''d'''i'''dwa'' ("housefly"), is mostly realized as {{IPAblink|ɪ}} in the Tyari and Barwari dialects.
* {{IPA|/u/}}, as in ''g'''u'''ra'' ("big"), may be realized as {{IPAblink|ɔ}} in the Tyari, Baz, Chaldean and Barwari dialects. The Urmian dialect may diphthongize it to {{IPA|[ui]}}.
* {{IPA|/o/}}, as in ''t'''o'''ra'' ("cow") may be diphthongized to {{IPA|[aw]}} in the Tyari, Barwari, Chaldean and Jilu dialects.

Two basic [[diphthong]]s exist, namely {{IPA|/eɪ̯/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}}. For some words, many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively. When it comes to [[plurals]], a commonly used vowel alteration in Assyrian is shifting the ''ɑ'' sound to ''e'', so ''ṭĕr'''ā''''' ('bird') will be ''ṭĕr'''ĕ''''' ('birds') in its plural form. This [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is called an [[apophony]] and it is exemplified in English as the internal vowel alternations that produce such related words as ''foot'' and ''feet''.

===Phonetics of Iraqi Koine===
Iraqi Koine is a standard Assyrian dialect which emerged in the mid-20th century, being influenced by both Urmian and Hakkari dialects.
*Iraqi Koine, like the majority of the Assyrian dialects, realizes {{IPA|/w/}} as {{IPAblink|w}} instead of {{IPAblink|ʋ}}. 
*Iraqi Koine generally realizes the [[interdental fricative]]s {{IPA|/{{IPA link|θ}}/, /{{IPA link|ð}}/}} in words like ''ma'''t'''a'' ("village") and ''rqa'''d'''a'' ("dancing") as [[alveolar stop]]s {{IPA|[{{IPA link|t}}], [{{IPA link|d}}]}} respectively.
*Predominantly, {{IPA|/q/}} in words like '''''q'''alama'' ("pen") does not merge with {{IPA|/k/}}.
*The diphthong {{IPA|/au/}} in words like ''t'''aw'''ra'' ("cow"), as heard in most of [[Hakkari]] dialects, are realized as {{IPAblink|oː}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yona Sabar|Sabar, Yona]] (2003). "Aramaic, once a great language, now on the verge of extinction," in When Languages Collide: Perspectives on Language Conflict, Language Competition, and Language Coexistence, Joseph, DeStefano, Jacobs, Lehiste, eds. The Ohio State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The {{IPA|/ui/}} diphthong in ''z'''uy'''zeh'' ("money") is realised as {{IPAblink|u}}.&lt;ref name="The British Survey 1968, page 3"/&gt;
*Depending on the speaker, the [[velar stop]]s {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} may be affricated as {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} respectively.
*{{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} in verbs like '''''ch'''i'akhla'' ("[she] eats") is retained as {{IPAblink|k}}.

==Grammar== 
[[File:Syriac Christianity.svg|thumb|right|295px|alt=The distribution of the Syriac language in the Middle East and Asia|Post 2010, in [[Iraq]], 
Assyrian Neo-Aramaic is mainly spoken in the [[Nineveh plains]] and the cities around [[Mosul]], [[Duhok]], [[Irbil]] and [[Kurkuk]] (magenta).]]
Assyrian is a [[nominative–accusative language|nominative-accusative]], [[null-subject language]] with an inflecting [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and it features a [[pro-drop language|pronoun drop]] to a significant degree.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeggli, Osvaldo, and Ken Safir (1989) ''The Null Subject Parameter''. Dordrecht: Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; Like English and [[modern Hebrew]], Assyrian largely lacks [[grammatical case]]s. The Semitic [[genitive case|genitive]], which a noun is possessed or modified by another noun or noun phrase, is expressed morphologically by the genitive [[morpheme]] ''-i'' (''bĕtī'' — 'my house'), indicating [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]].&lt;ref&gt;Healey, John F (1980). ''First studies in Syriac''. University of Birmingham/Sheffield Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-7044-0390-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Word stress]] bears a strong relationship to [[vowel length]]. A final vowel, long or short, may not be stressed, though one of the last three syllables may be stressed. As such, the last [[heavy syllable]] (containing a long vowel or ending in a consonant) is stressed. [[Gemination]] occurs in the language, as heard in words like ''le'''bb'''aa'' ("heart") and ''shma'''yy'''a'' ("sky").&lt;ref name="Khan2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Khan|title=The Neo-Aramaic Dialect of the Assyrian Christians of Urmi (4 vols)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_C5RDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138|date=16 June 2016|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-31393-4|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO) is the default [[sentence structure]] of Syriac, [[subject–object–verb]] (SOV), [[verb–subject–object]] (VSO), [[verb–object–subject]] (VOS), [[object–verb–subject]] (OVS) and [[object–subject–verb]] (OSV) are also commonly used word orders in modern Assyrian, thus making Assyrian Neo-Aramaic a flexible language, akin to [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;Mereu, Lunella. "Agreement, Pronominalization, and Word Order in Pragmatically-Oriented Languages." Boundaries of Morphology and Syntax. Amsterdam: J. Benjamins, 1999. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian [[List of loanwords in Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|has an extensive number]] of [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] [[loanwords]] (namely [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]) incorporated in its vocabulary and grammar, as well as some Arabic and English loanwords. That is because of its close geographical proximity to those languages.&lt;ref&gt;Younansardaroud, Helen, ''Synharmonism in the Särdä:rïd Dialect'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies 12:1 (1998): 77-82.&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[central Semitic]] language, Assyrian is closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], [[Western Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Mandean language|Mandean]], and would bear similar grammar style to these languages.

=== Personal pronouns ===
In Assyrian, [[personal pronoun]]s have 7 forms. In singular forms, the [[Grammatical person|3rd]] have separate [[masculine gender|masculine]] and [[feminine gender|feminine]] forms, while the 1st and 2nd person do not. The 3rd person plural form also lacks a gender.&lt;ref&gt;Yildiz, Efrem, ''The Aramaic Language and Its Classification'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies 14:1 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|-
! [[grammatical person|person]] !! [[Grammatical number|singular]] !! plural
|-
| 1st person || ''āna'' ("I" or "me") || ''akhni'' ("we" or "us") 
|-
| 2nd person ([[gender neutral]]) || ''aten'' or ''ati'' ("you") || ''akhtokhun'' ("yourselves")
|-
| 3rd person (masc.) || ''awa'' ("him") || ''aneh'' ("them" or "they"; gender neutral)
|-
| 3rd person (fem.) || ''aya'' ("her") || As above 
|}

Like all Semitic languages and the unrelated [[Insular Celtic languages]], Assyrian uses [[inflected preposition]] when it comes to personal pronouns – The preposition ''al'' ("on") inflects as ''ali'' ("on me").&lt;ref&gt;Li, Charles N. ''Mechanisms of Syntactic Change''. Austin: U of Texas, 1977. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Nouns carry grammatical gender (masculine or feminine). They can be either singular or plural in number (a very few can be dual) and can exist in one of three grammatical states (somewhat akin to case in [[Indo-European languages]]). The states should not be confused with [[grammatical case]]s in other languages. [[Adjective]]s always agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify. Adjectives are in the absolute state if they are [[predicative adjective|predicative]] but agree with the state of their noun if [[attributive adjective|attributive]].&lt;ref&gt;Moro, Andrea (1997) ''The raising of predicates. Predicative noun phrases and the theory of clause structure'', Cambridge Studies in Linguistics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Syriac languages, most genitive noun relationships are built using the [[construct state]], but contrary to the genitive case, it is the head-noun which is marked by the construct state. Thus, ''{{transl|syc|šeqlay malkūṯā}}'', means "the taxes of the kingdom". Quickly, the construct relationship was abandoned and replaced by the use of the relative particle ''{{transl|syc|d-, da-}}''. Thus, the same [[noun phrase]] becomes ''šeqlē d-malkūṯā'', where both nouns are in the emphatic state. Very closely related nouns can be drawn into a closer grammatical relationship by the addition of a pronominal suffix. Thus, the phrase can be written as ''{{transl|syc|šeqlêh d-malkūṯā}}''. In this case, both nouns continue to be in the emphatic state, but the first has the suffix that makes it literally read "her taxes" ("kingdom" is feminine), and thus is "her taxes, [those] of the kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;George D. Morley, ''Explorations in Functional Syntax: A New Framework for Lexicogrammatical Analysis,'' Equinox Publishing Ltd., 2004, pp. 68–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, P. (2007). ''Syntactic relations: A critical survey''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbs===
Finite verbs carry [[grammatical person|person]], grammatical gender (except in the first person) and number, as well as [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. The non-finite verb forms are the [[infinitive]] and the [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice|passive]] [[participle]]s. The emphatic state became the ordinary form of the noun, and the absolute and construct states were relegated to certain stock phrases (for example, bar nāšā, "man, person", literally "son of man"). Verb forms are marked for person (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), gender (masculine or feminine), [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[perfect tense|perfect]] or [[imperfect tense|imperfect]]), mood ([[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[jussive]] or [[infinitive]]) and [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] ([[Dynamic verb|active]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] or [[Passive voice|passive]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bresnan, Joan (ed.) (1982) ''The Mental Representation of Grammatical Relations'', MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian employs a system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]s to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.
[[Verb conjugations]] are present in other Semitic languages. These are regular modifications of the verb's root to express other changes in meaning. The first conjugation is the ground state, which models the shape of the root and carries the usual meaning of the word. The next is the intensive state form of the verb, which usually carries an [[intensive|intensified]] meaning. The third is the extensive state form of the verb, which is often [[causative]] in meaning. Each of these conjugations has its parallel [[passive voice|passive]] conjugation. The particle ''"-wa"'' may be affixed to verbal forms derived from the present and past bases.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.-T. James. "On the distribution and reference of empty pronouns". Linguistic Inquiry 15: 531-574. 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian may also feature [[double negative]]s, such as in sentences like '''''leh''' yawin '''la''' zoozeh'' ("I '''won't''' give '''no''' money").

===Suffixes===
Assyrian uses verbal inflections marking person and number. The suffix "''-i''" indicates "my" or "me" and the suffix "''-eh''" indicates a [[plural]] (i.e. "warda" or ''flower'' [[inflection|becomes]] "ward'''eh'''"). [[Enclitic]] forms of [[personal pronoun]]s are affixed to various parts of speech. As with [[object pronoun]], all [[possessive pronouns]] are [[suffix]]es that are [[possessive affix|attached to the end of nouns]] to express possession similar to the English pronouns ''my, your, his, her,'' etc., which reflects the gender and plurality of the person or persons.&lt;ref&gt;Zwicky, Arnold M. "''Clitics and Particles''." Language 61.2 (1985): 283-305. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[synthetic language|synthetic]] feature found in other Semitic languages, and also in unrelated languages such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ([[Uralic languages|Uralic]]), [[Persian language|Persian]] ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ([[Turkic languages|Turkic]]), to name a few. Moreover, unlike many other languages, Assyrian has virtually no means of [[morphological derivation|deriving]] words by adding prefixes or suffixes to words. Instead, they are formed according to a limited number of templates applied to roots.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Zomaya S. (1994). ''Basic sentence structure in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, VIII/1:83-107&lt;/ref&gt;

{| border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" align="center"
|-
! [[grammatical person|person]] !! [[Grammatical number|singular]] !! plural
|-
| 1st person || ''bĕtī'' (my house) || ''bĕtan'' (our house)
|-
| 2nd person (masc.) || ''bĕtūkh'' (your house) || ''bĕtōkhun'' (your house)
|-
| 2nd person (fem.) || ''bĕtakh'' (your house) || ''bĕtōkhun'' (your house)
|-
| 3rd person (masc.) || ''bĕtū'' (his house) || ''betĕh'' (their house)
|-
| 3rd person (fem.) || ''bĕtō'' (her house) || ''bĕtĕh'' (their house)
|}

Although possessive suffixes are more convenient and common, they can be optional for some people and seldom used, especially among those with the Tyari and Barwari dialects, which take a more [[analytic language|analytic]] approach regarding possession, just like modern Hebrew and English. The following are [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] ways to express possession, using the word "bĕtā" (''house'') as a base:

*my house: ''bĕtā it dēyi'' ("house of mine")
*your ([[Grammatical gender|masc.]], sing.) house: ''bĕtā it dēyūkh'' ("house of yours")
*your (fem., sing.) house: ''bĕtā it dēyakh'' 
*your (plural) house: ''bĕtā it dēyōkhūn'' ("house of yours")
*3rd person (masc., sing.): ''bĕtā it dēyū'' ("house of his")
*3rd person (fem., sing.): ''bĕtā it dēyō'' ("house of hers")
*3rd person (plural): ''bĕtā it dēyĕh'' ("house of theirs")

===Consonantal root===
Most Assyrian Neo-Aramaic [[noun]]s and verbs are built from [[triliteral]] roots, which are a form of word formation in which the [[root (linguistics)|root]] is modified and which does not involve stringing [[morpheme]]s together sequentially. [[Broken plurals]] are formed by changing the pattern of [[consonant]]s and vowels inside the singular form. Semitic languages typically utilize triconsonantal roots, forming a "grid" into which vowels may be inserted without affecting the basic root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The root {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}}, ''{{transl|syc|ŠQL}}'', has the basic meaning of ''taking'', and the following are some words that can be formed from this root:
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}} – ''{{transl|syc|šqeleh}}'': "he has taken"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}} – ''{{transl|syc|šāqel}}'': "he will take"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠ}} – ''{{transl|syc|šqull}}'': "take it!"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠܐ}} – ''{{transl|syc|šqālā}}'': "a taking, burden, recension, portion or syllable"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܩܠܘܬܐ}} – ''{{transl|syc|šaqlūṯā}}'': "a beast of burden"
* {{lang|syc|ܫܘܩܠܐ}} – ''{{transl|syc|šūqqālā}}'': "arrogance"

===Determinative===
When it comes to a [[determinative]] (like in English ''this'', ''a'', ''the'', ''few'', ''any'', ''which'', etc.) modern Assyrian generally has an absence of an [[Article (grammar)#Zero article|article]] (English ''the''), unlike its sister language [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which use a [[definite article]] (such as "[[al-]]"). [[Demonstratives]] (''aha'' and ''aya''/''awa'', translating to "[[Demonstrative|this]]" and "[[that]]", respectively) are commonly utilized instead (i.e. "''aha beta''", which means "this house"), which can have the sense of "the". An indefinite article ("an" or "a") can mark definiteness if the word is a [[direct object]] (but not a subject) by using the suffix "''l-''" (e.g. ''shaqi'''l''' qalama'', meaning "he takes a/the pen"). [[Article (grammar)#Partitive article|Partitive]] articles may be used in some speech ("''bayeetoon '''khacha''' miya?''", which translates to "do you want '''some''' water?").&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997). ''Functional and other exotic sentences in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, XI/2:44-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Ancient Aramaic had a [[definite]] article in the form of a suffix: "''-aa''" for masculine words and "''-t(h)aa''" (if the word already ends in -aa) for feminine. The definite forms were ''palaaxaa'' for "the (male) worker" and ''palaxtaa'' for "the (female) worker". Over time, the definite form of the word became dominant and the definite sense of the word [[Phonological change|merged]] with the indefinite sense so that ''palaaxa'' became "a/the (male) worker" and ''palaxtaa'' became "a/the (female) worker."

===Tenses===
Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, like its [[parent language]] Syriac, has only two true [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] tenses: [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[imperfect]]. Whereas these tenses were originally [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] in Aramaic, they have become a truly temporal [[past tense|past]] and [[future tense|future]] tenses respectively. 

The [[present tense]] is usually marked with the [[participle]] followed by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] [[pronoun]]. However, such pronouns are usually omitted in the case of the third person. This use of the participle to mark the present tense is the most common of a number of ''compound'' tenses that can be used to express varying senses of tense and aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard, ''Tense'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
{{Further|List of Assyrian tribes}}
[[File:Syriac Dialects EN.svg|thumb|260px|The Assyrian dialects.]]
SIL Ethnologue distinguishes five dialect groups: ''Urmian, Northern, Central, Western'', and ''Sapna'', each with sub-dialects. Mutual intelligibility between the Assyrian dialects is as high as 80%–90%.

The [[Urmia]] dialect has become the prestige dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic after 1836, when that dialect was chosen by [[Justin Perkins]], an American [[Presbyterian]] missionary, for the creation of a standard literary dialect of Assyrian. A second standard dialect derived from ''General Urmian'' known as "''Iraqi [[Koine language|Koine]]''", developed in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rev. Justin Perkins : “A residence of eight years in Persia among the Nestorian Christians”, New York, 1843 – P: 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, Perkins' translation of the Bible into General Urmian was published by the American Bible Society with a parallel text of the classical Syriac [[Peshitta]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilmshurst, David, ''The ecclesiastical organisation of the Church of the East, 1318-1913'', Leuven: Peeters Publishers, 2000, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odisho, Edward, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

** Lower Barwari – The dialect within this group has more in common with Tyari than with Upper Barwari dialect
*** Dooreh

===Iraqi Koine===
[[File:IraqiKoine.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Iraqi Koine dialect (voice by [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]). Notice how it combines the phonetic features of the Hakkari and Urmian dialects.]]
''Iraqi Koine'', also known as ''Refined Urmian'' and ''Standard Assyrian'', is a compromise between the thicker rural accents of Hakkari and [[Nineveh Plains]] (listed above), and the former prestigious dialect in [[Urmia]]. ''Iraqi Koine'' does not really constitute a new dialect, but an incomplete merger of dialects. ''Koine'' is more analogous to Urmian in terms of manner of articulation, place of articulation and its [[consonant cluster]] formations, though it just lacks the regional [[Farsi language|Farsi]] influence in some consonants and vowels.&lt;ref name="Shamāshā Dāwīd 1963, p. 895"/&gt;

During the [[First World War]], many Assyrians living in [[Ottoman Turkey]] were forced from their homes, and many of their descendants now live in [[Iraq]]. The relocation has led to the creation of this dialect. ''Iraqi Koine'' was developed in the [[Urban area|urban]] areas of [[Iraq]] (i.e. [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]], [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] and [[Kirkuk]]), which became the meccas for the rural Assyrian population. By the end of the 1950s vast number of Assyrians started to speak ''Iraqi Koine''. Today, ''Iraqi Koine'' is the predominant use of communication between the majority of the Assyrians and it is also used as the standard dialect in music and formal speech.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

To note, the emergence of the ''Koine'' didn't mean that the rest of the spoken dialects vanished. The ''Ashiret'' dialects were still active because some Assyrians remained in the rural areas and the fact that the [[first generation immigrant|first generation]] speakers who relocated in urban areas still maintained their native dialects. Elements of original ''Ashiret'' dialects can still be observed in ''Iraqi Koine'', especially in that of older speakers.

===Dialect continuum===
Assyrian Neo-Aramaic has a rather slightly defined [[dialect continuum]], starting from the [[Assyrian tribes]] in [[northern Iraq]] (i.e. [[Alqosh]], [[Batnaya]]) and ending in Western [[Iran]] ([[Urmia]]). The dialects in Northern Iraq, such as those of ''Alqosh'' and ''Batnaya'', would be minimally unintelligible to those in Western Iran.&lt;ref name="Shamāshā Dāwīd 1963, p. 895"&gt;Beth-Zay‘ā, Esha‘yā Shamāshā Dāwīd, ''Tash‘īthā d-Beth-Nahreyn'', Tehran: Assyrian Youth Cultural Society Press, 1963, p. 895&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialects in Northern Iraq have a distinct phonetic system (such as the realization of [[Voiceless pharyngeal fricative|/ħ/]]) and, as such, would be considered part of [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]]. Nearing the Iraqi-Turkey border, the [[Barwari]] and [[Tyari]] dialects are more "traditionally Assyrian" and would sound like those in the [[Hakkari province]] in Turkey. Furthermore, the Barwar and Tyari dialects are "transitional", acquiring both Assyrian and Chaldean phonetic features (though they don't use /ħ/). Gawar, Diz and [[Jilu]] are in the "centre" of the spectrum, which lie halfway between Tyari and Urmia, having features of both respective dialects, though still being distinct in their own manner.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Odisho, Edward: The Sound System of Modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic) - Weisbaden, Harrassowitz, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hakkari, going east (towards [[Iran]]), the [[Nochiyaye|Nochiya]] dialect would begin to sound distinct to the Tyari/Barwar dialects and more like the Urmian dialect in [[Urmia]], [[West Azerbaijan Province|Western Azerbaijan]], containing a few Urmian features. The Urmian dialect, alongside ''Iraqi Koine'', are considered to be ''Standard Assyrian''. Though ''Iraqi Koine'' is more widespread and had thus become the more common standard dialect in recent times. Both Koine and Urmian share phonetic characteristics with the Nochiya dialect to some degree.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[File:Carved stone at Lavatmangemu.JPG|thumb|250px|A stone carved with Avoiuli writing.]]

[[File:Notice in Avoiuli script at a custom school, Pentcost Island, 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|A sign in the Avoiuli script.]]
'''Avoiuli''' (from [[Raga language|Raga]] ''avoi'' "talk about" and ''uli'' "draw" or "paint") is a writing system used by the [[Turaga nation|Turaga indigenous movement]] on [[Pentecost Island]] in [[Vanuatu]]. It was devised by Chief Viraleo Boborenvanua over a 14-year period, based on designs found in traditional [[sand drawing]]s, and intended as a native alternative to the [[Latin alphabet]]. It is used mainly for writing in the area's native [[Raga language]], although it can also be used for other languages including [[Apma language|Apma]], [[Bislama]] and [[English language|English]].

== Features ==
The Avoiuli alphabet comprises characters equivalent to the letters A-Z, decimal numerals and other symbols, including a range of currency symbols representing the [[livatu]] and specific items of traditional value such as pigs and dyed mats. Like the Western orthography used to write [[Raga language]], it represents the [[velar nasal]] ''ng'' and [[prenasalised consonant]] ''ngg'' using modified forms of the letters ''n'' and ''g'' respectively, but represents the [[Velarized|labiovelar consonants]] ''bw'', ''mw'' and ''vw'' using [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Although in some respects it is a relatively straightforward imitation of the [[Latin alphabet]], Avoiuli has a few distinctive features.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2013, The Languages of Pentecost Island.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like the sand drawings on which it is based, Avoiuli words are designed to be formed in a single stroke. The script can be written either left-to-right or right-to-left (with the letter shapes reversed, though the majority are symmetrical anyway). A few texts in Avoiuli are in [[boustrophedon]] style, with alternating lines of left-to-right and right-to-left writing.

Capital letters in Avoiuli are similar to lowercase but are enlarged and drawn around a + shaped 'frame', a feature also seen in traditional sand drawings. Capital letters are not used much in everyday writing.

Scholars learn to write in Avoiuli at Turaga's traditional school at Lavatmanggemu in north-eastern Pentecost, and at affiliated 'custom schools', paying substantial school fees for the privilege. Avoiuli is also used in record-keeping by the [[Tari Bunia Bank|Tangbunia indigenous bank]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5605">The first known translations of the [[Bible]] into the [[Lithuanian language]] appeared in the middle of the 16th century following the spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The full Protestant Bible was first published in 1735 in [[Königsberg]]. The full Roman Catholic translation was published in 1911–1937 in [[Kaunas]].

==Protestant bibles==
The first book in Lithuanian, ''[[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas|Simple Words of Catechism]]'' by [[Martynas Mažvydas]], published in 1547, contained the [[Ten Commandments]], two psalms, and short excerpts from [[New Testament]]. In 1579, Baltramiejus Vilentas published a collection of selected excerpts from the Bible. In 1579–1590, [[Jonas Bretkūnas]] completed translation of the full [[Luther Bible]], but it was not published.&lt;ref name=bible/&gt; Another translation was prepared by [[Samuel Bogusław Chyliński]] in [[Oxford]] in 1656–1660. The printing of the [[Old Testament]] was started but stopped in May–August 1662 due to financial difficulties and doubts on the quality of the translation.&lt;ref name=luksa/&gt; The full New Testament was published in 1701 by {{illm|Samuelis Bitneris|lt}} and in 1727 by [[Pilypas Ruigys]]. The full Bible in Lithuanian was first published in 1735 in [[Königsberg]]. This translation was sponsored by [[Johann Jakob Quandt]] and was prepared by joint Lutheran and Calvinist efforts. This translation was edited by [[Ludwig Rhesa]] (published in 1816), {{illm|Frydrichas Kuršaitis|lt}} (published in 1853), Adomas Einoras (published in 1897).&lt;ref name=bible/&gt;

Algirdas Jurėnas published New Testament and Psalms in 1961 in London and full Bible in 2000 in [[Duncanville, Texas]]. Ladas Tulaba published new translation of the New Testament in 1979 in Rome. Alfredas Vėlius published the Bible and the [[Biblical apocrypha]] in 1988. [[Methodist]] Kostas Burbulys translated the Bible which was published in 1999 in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=bible/&gt;

==Roman Catholic bibles==
The Roman Catholic Church showed no particular interest in publishing the Bible in the Lithuanian language. Some excerpts were published by [[Mikalojus Daukša]] (1599), [[Konstantinas Sirvydas]] (1629, 1644), and others. A collection of excerpts from the Bible was published by {{illm|Jonas Jaknavičius|lt}} in 1647. This work received some 30 revised and expanded editions,&lt;ref name=karde/&gt; but the full New Testament was not published until 1816. This translation was prepared by {{illm|Józef Arnulf Giedroyć|pl}}, [[Bishop of Samogitia]], but did not include customary explanations. The full bible, translated by Archbishop [[Juozapas Skvireckas]] from the [[Vulgate]], was published in six volumes in 1911–1937 by the [[Society of Saint Casimir]] and [[Saliamonas Banaitis]] in [[Kaunas]].&lt;ref name=barsys/&gt; An edited Old Testament was published in Rome in 1955–1956.&lt;ref name=bible/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14140">A '''nebular opposition''' (also '''binary system''') is a pair of related terms or concepts that are opposite in meaning. Binary opposition is the system by which language and thought, two theoretical opposites are strictly defined and set off against one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=G. |year=1996 |title=Binary opposition and sexual power in Paradise Lost |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=27 |issue=4 |page=383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the contrast between two mutually exclusive terms, such as on and off, up and down, left and right.&lt;ref name="Baldick"/&gt; Binary opposition is an important concept of structuralism, which sees such distinctions as fundamental to all language and thought.&lt;ref name="Baldick"&gt;Baldick, C 2004. The concise Oxford Dictionary of literary terms, viewed 8 March 2011, http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1056-binaryopposition.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[structuralism]], a binary opposition is seen as a fundamental organizer of human philosophy, culture, and language.

Binary opposition originated in Saussurean structuralist theory.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"&gt;Fogarty, S 2005, The literary encyclopedia, viewed 6 March 2011, http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?pec=true&amp;UID=122&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the binary opposition is the means by which the units of language have value or meaning; each unit is defined in reciprocal determination with another term, as in binary code. It is not a contradictory relation but a structural, complementary one.&lt;ref name="Fogarty"/&gt; Saussure demonstrated that a sign's meaning is derived from its context (syntagmatic dimension) and the group (paradigm) to which it belongs.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, N 2000, Narrative and Genre, p.64, Palgrave, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is that one cannot conceive of 'good' if we do not understand 'evil'.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, N 2000, Narrative and Genre, p. 65, Palgrave, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is "often value-laden and ethnocentric", with an illusory order and superficial meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Goody|1977|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Pieter Fourie discovered that binary oppositions have a deeper or second level of binaries that help to reinforce meaning. As an example, the concepts ''hero'' and ''villain'' involve secondary binaries: good/bad, handsome/ugly, liked/disliked, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fourie|first=Pieter|title=Media Studies Volume 2: Content, Audiences and Production|year=2001|publisher=Juta Education|location=Lansdowne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of binaries in Western thought==
A classic example of a binary opposition is the presence-absence dichotomy. In much of Western thought, including [[structuralism]], distinguishing between presence and absence, viewed as polar opposites, is a fundamental element of thought in many cultures. In addition, according to post-structuralist criticisms, ''presence'' occupies a position of dominance in Western thought over ''absence'', because ''absence'' is traditionally seen as what you get when you take away ''presence''. (Had ''absence'' been dominant, ''presence'' might have most naturally been seen as what you get when you take away an ''absence''.) &lt;ref&gt;Britannica 2011, Binary opposition, viewed 9 March 2011, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/65552/binary-opposition&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nasser Maleki, there is another example of this phenomenon whereby people value one part of a binary opposition over another; “we, as living in a certain culture, think and act similarly in situations when we want to pick out one of the concepts in the binary oppositions or while seeking truth or a center. For example, we give superiority to life rather than death.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki|first1=Nasser|title=Contextualising Kathleen Raine's selected poems in the light of Derridean midel of deconstruction|journal=Journal of Language and Literature|volume=5|issue=2|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the cultural setting a reader is a part of may influence their interpretation of a work of literature; “only one concept, from the binary opposition, is ready, in our mind, to be privileged and the other one is usually put aside as having the second priority.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki|first1=Nesser|title=Contextualising Kathleen Raine's selected poems in the light of Derridean model of deconstruction|journal=Journal of Language and Literature|volume=5|issue=2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached this conclusion by giving a name to the shared western unconsciousness for a preferred binary concept - [[logocentrism]]. This is the belief that “an ultimate reality or centre of truth exists and that can serve as the basis for all our thought and actions. This might imply that readers might unconsciously take side with one concept of binary opposition, and Derrida traces this reaction as a cultural phenomenon.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maleki|first1=Nesser|title=5. Contextualising Kathleen Raine's selected poems in the light of Derridean model of deconstruction|journal=Journal of Language and Literature|volume=5|issue=2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Jacques Derrida]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |year=1992 |title=Positions |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning in the West is defined in terms of binary oppositions, “a violent hierarchy” where “one of the two terms governs the other.” Within the white/ black binary opposition in the United States, the African American is defined as a devalued other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hogue |first=W. |year=2008 |title=Radical democracy, African American subjectivity and John Edgar Wideman's Philadelphia Fire |journal=Melus |volume=33 |issue=3 |page=48 |doi=10.1093/melus/33.3.45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a binary opposition is the male-female dichotomy. A post-structuralist view is that ''male'' can be seen, according to traditional Western thought, as dominant over ''female'' because ''male'' is the presence of a phallus, while the vagina is an absence or loss. John Searle has suggested that the concept of binary oppositions—as taught and practiced by postmodernists and poststructuralist—is specious and lacking in rigor.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://free--expression.blogspot.com/2007/10/john-searle-on-derrida.html 1983], American philosopher [[John Searle]] reviewed Johnathan Culler's ''On Deconstruction: Theory and Criticism after Structuralism'' for the [[New York Review of Books]], writing,
:"In Culler's book, we get the following examples of knowledge and mastery [attained from analysis of binary opposites and deconstruction]: speech is a form of writing (passim), presence is a certain type of absence (p. 106), the marginal is in fact central (p. 140), the literal is metaphorical (p. 148), truth is a kind of fiction (p. 181), reading is a form of misreading (p. 176), understanding is a form of misunderstanding (p. 176), sanity is a kind of neurosis (p. 160), and man is a form of woman (p. 171). Some readers may feel that such a list generates not so much feelings of mastery as of monotony. There is in deconstructive writing a constant straining of the prose to attain something that sounds profound by giving it the air of a [[paradox]], e.g., "truths are fictions whose fictionality has been forgotten" (p. 181).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deconstruction of Western binaries==
The political (rather than analytic or conceptual) critique of binary oppositions is an important part of [[third wave feminism]], [[post-colonialism]], [[post-anarchism]], and [[critical race theory]], which argue that the perceived binary dichotomy between man/woman, civilized/uncivilised, and white/black have perpetuated and legitimized Western power structures favoring "civilized white men." In the last fifteen years it has become routine for many social and/or historical analyses to address the variables of gender, class, sexuality, race and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Dunk"&gt;Dunk, T 1997, 'White guys: studies in post-modern domination and difference', Labour, vol. 40, p. 306, (online Infotrac).&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these categories there is usually an unequal binary opposition: bourgeoisie/working class man; white/people of colour; men/women; heterosexual/homosexual.&lt;ref name="Dunk"/&gt;

[[Post-structuralism|Post-structural]] criticism of binary oppositions is not simply the reversal of the opposition, but its [[deconstruction]], which is described as apolitical&amp;mdash;that is, not intrinsically favoring one arm of a binary opposition over the other. Deconstruction is the "event" or "moment" at which a binary opposition is thought to contradict itself, and undermine its own authority.&lt;ref&gt;"One sometimes gets the impression that deconstruction is a kind of game that anyone can play. One could, for example, invent a deconstruction of deconstructionism as follows: In the hierarchical opposition, deconstruction/logocentrism (phono-phallo-logocentrism), the privileged term "deconstruction" is in fact subordinate to the devalued term "logocentrism," for, in order to establish the hierarchical superiority of deconstruction, the deconstructionist is forced to attempt to represent its superiority, its axiological primacy, by argument and persuasion, by appealing to the logocentric values he tries to devalue. But his efforts to do this are doomed to failure because of the internal inconsistency in the concept of deconstructionism itself, because of its very self-referential dependence on the authority of a prior logic. By an [[aporetical]] [[Aufhebung]], deconstruction deconstructs itself." Searle, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deconstruction assumes that all binary oppositions need to be analyzed and criticized in all their manifestations; the function of both logical and [[axiological]] oppositions must be studied in all [[discourse]]s that provide meaning and values. But deconstruction does not only expose how oppositions work and how meaning and values are produced in a [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] or [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]] position, "thereby preventing any means of intervening in the field effectively". To be effective, and simply as its mode of practice, deconstruction creates new notions or concepts, not to synthesize the terms in opposition but to mark their difference, undecidability, and eternal interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Jacques Derrida,  “Positions” (The University of Chicago Press, 1981), pp. 41-43&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to logocentrism==
Logocentrism is an idea related to binary opposition that suggests certain audiences will favour one part of a binary opposition pair over the other. This favouritism is often most strongly influenced by a readers' cultural background. The strong patriarchal themes in 'The Women and the Pot', an Amharic folktale, would be one such example of logocentrism.  This tells the story of two women who are upset at their diminished role in society, and who consequently go to their King for help. He effectively conveys the message that women cannot be relied upon to take on a greater role in society, which becomes the moral of the tale. Prasad explains this idea; “The logocentric value is seen through the 'Eternal Knowledge' – the naturalness of male superiority – that is conveyed through the folktale. The hidden a priori binary opposition is 'Man over Woman'.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prasad|first1=A|title=8. Logocentrism and a priori Binary Opposition vis-a-vis Women. Politics in Ethiopia Folktales- A Study of Selected Ethiopian Folktales|journal=Fabula|volume=48|issue=1–2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the cultural heritage of an audience having an influence on their unconscious preference for one part of a binary opposition, Prasad says; “By way of studying a selection of Ethiopian folktales, the paper uncovers the presence of logocentrism and a priori binary opposition being at work in Ethiopian folktales. These two elements attempt to endorse and validate the 'given' subservient position of women in society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prasad|first1=A|title=8. Logocentrism and a priori Binary Opposition vis-a-vis Women. Politics in Ethiopia Folktales- A Study of Selected Ethiopian Folktales|journal=Fabula|volume=48|issue=1–2|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Binary opposition is deeply embedded within literature as language, and paired opposites, rely upon a relation with adjoining words inside a paradigmatic chain. If one of the paired opposites were removed the other’s precise meaning would be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P., 2009. ''Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory''. 3rd ed. New York, USA: Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, binary opposition was explored in children’s literature and it was found that authors were reinforcing Westernized images and philosophies of feminism via the binary hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai, K. 2013. pp. 141 - 147"&gt;Varga-Dobai, K., 2013. Gender Issues in Multicultural Children's Literature - Black and Third-World Feminist Critiques of Appropriation, Essentialism, and Us/Other Binary Oppositions. Multicultural Perspectives, 15(3), pp. 141–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Western authors were creating a representation of non-Western countries based on colonial discourse, using binary oppositions to categorize human behaviour into one term or another – not both. The non-Western woman, therefore, was “the opposite or ‘other’ to women and girls from the West”.&lt;ref name="Varga-Dobai, K. 2013. pp. 141 - 147"/&gt;

'''Blondes vs. Brunettes''' is a [[Powderpuff (sports)|powderpuff football]] game played in cities across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blondesvsbrunettes.org/ Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Fundraiser]&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from the event are donated to The [[Alzheimer's Association]]. Games have been held in more than 40 cities and have cumulatively raised more than $5 Million for the care, support and research efforts of the Association.

==History==
The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative [[Joseph Hugh Allen]], died of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in 2008.  Looking for a way to raise funds for the [[Alzheimer's Association]], Abbott organized a powder puff [[American football|football]] game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan.  Abbott, who was residing in [[Washington D.C.]] at the time, believed that too many [[charitable organizations]] were raising money through formal black tie events.  Along with her sister, she thought a powder puff football game that leveraged popular culture's [[blonde vs. brunette rivalry]] would be more appealing to a younger set of donors. She thought the $20 ticket price would provide a low cost way for attendees to support a good cause.&lt;ref name="nptimes"&gt;Staff writer (September 15, 2010) "Blondes vs. Brunettes: Grassroots Effort Scores for Alzheimer's Association” ''The Non-Profit Times'' Retrieved March 16, 2012 {{cite web |url=http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/blondes-vs-brunettes-1850 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020090503/http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/article/detail/blondes-vs-brunettes-1850 |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2005, the first [[blond]]e vs. [[Brown hair|brunette]] powder puff football game was played at [[Hains Point]] in Washington D.C. and raised $10,000.  Subsequently, the game searched for a more suitable home and moved around the Washington D.C area before settling in at [[George Washington University]]’s Mount Vernon Athletic Field in 2009.  Since its inception, the game has received considerable publicity to include feature articles in the [[Washington Post]] and has raised over $500,000 in the Washington, D.C. alone.&lt;ref&gt;Argetsinger, Amy (November 13, 2013) “Athletes First, Stylistas Second” ''The Washington Post'' Retrieved November 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, Blondes vs. Brunettes Powderpuff Football was being played in cities across the United States and each city has a slightly different approach to the game. “In Washington, the rivalry is intense. If friends are on opposite teams, they usually don't talk the weekend of the games," Abbott shared. &lt;ref name="nptimes"/&gt;  Cities that host the game include: Albany, [[Amarillo]],&lt;ref&gt;Amarillo Globe News "Alzheimer's Association's Blondes vs. Brunettes" Retrieved October 6, 2012 [http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2012-06-09/alzheimers-associations-blondes-vs-brunettes]&lt;/ref&gt; Akron, Atlanta, [[Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alz.org/texascapital/in_my_community_58524.asp "Welcome to Blondes vs. Brunettes Austin"]&lt;/ref&gt; Bakersfield, CA, Baton Rouge, Boston, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bvbbuffalo.com/ "Western New York Powderpuff Fundraiser"]&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte, Burlington, IA, [[Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bvbchicago.org/ “Blondes vs. Brunettes - Chicago”] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105022618/http://bvbchicago.org/ |date=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbia, SC, [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://act.alz.org/site/TR?fr_id=2181&amp;pg=entry ”Blondes vs. Brunettes – Columbus”]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Denver]],&lt;ref&gt;Staff writer (June 7, 2012) "Brunettes Trounce Blondes in Benefit for Alzheimer's Association of Colorado"  ''The Denver Post.''

'''Budyonnivskyi District''' ({{lang-uk|Будьоннівський район}}) is an urban district of the city of [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], named after [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]] [[Semyon Budyonny|Semyon Mikhailovich Budyonny]].

It was created in 1980 out of the Proletarskyi, Kirovskyi and Leninskyi districts. The district's name was a revival of the original name of Proletarskyi District.

'''Daniel Francois Roodt''' (born 26 May 1957) is an Afrikaner author, publisher, and commentator.

==Early life and education==
Roodt was born in the mining town of Springs, east of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. He completed his schooling in Johannesburg, after which he enrolled for a [[Bachelor's degree]] at the [[University of Witwatersrand]].&lt;ref name="a72497"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article72497.ece |title=Radical thoughts of a right-wing reactionary |publisher=Times LIVE |date=3 April 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724025700/http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article72497.ece |archivedate= 24 July 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roodt has six degrees, including a Ph.D. from the University of the Witwatersrand in Afrikaans, obtained with a thesis on the works of {{ill|John Miles (writer)|lt=John Miles|af|John Miles}} in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Ondermyning in die prosa van John Miles: 'n postmoderne lesing. http://www.worldcat.org/title/ondermyning-in-die-prosa-van-john-miles-n-postmoderne-lesing/oclc/775690588&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Roodt lectured at the [[University of Durban-Westville]] for a while, and in 1985 left South Africa for France to avoid [[conscription]] in the South African Defence Force.&lt;ref name="a72497"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oulitnet.co.za/mond/danroodt.asp |title=LitNet: Die mond is nie geheim nie |publisher=Oulitnet.co.za |date= |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Times LIVE]] said that in the 1980s, Roodt was an anti-establishment anarchist, but that now "he is branded a right-wing reactionary" for his "vehement anti-ANC essays". Two of his literary works had been banned by the South African government in 1980, a time of strict censorship.&lt;ref name="a72497"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Censored publications: ID 9905629|url=http://search.beaconforfreedom.org/search/censored_publications/publication.html?id=9905629|publisher=Beacon for Freedom of Expression|accessdate=23 August 2014|quote=Main title: Sonneskyn &amp; Chevrolet, Period of censorship: July 17, 1992 – March 5, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Censored publications: ID 9905677|url=http://search.beaconforfreedom.org/search/censored_publications/publication.html?id=9905677|publisher=Beacon for Freedom of Expression|accessdate=23 August 2014|quote=Main title: Kommas uit'n boomzol, Period of censorship: October 2, 1992 – March 5, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to South Africa in 1992, Roodt worked for Citibank until 1999, and in 2000 he co-founded PRAAG (Pro-Afrikaanse Aksiegroep, or Pro-Afrikaans Action Group),&lt;ref name="a72497"/&gt; which describes itself as an extra-parliamentary movement devoted to the rights of [[Afrikaner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191807/http://www.praag.org/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=category&amp;sectionid=3&amp;id=23&amp;Itemid=117 ]&lt;/ref&gt; PRAAG also has a publishing division, which has published some of his recent works. Roodt has contributed articles to Focus, the journal of the liberal [[Helen Suzman Foundation]], columns to ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a [[white nationalist]] magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amren.com/author/danroodt/ Dan Roodt American Renaissance author page]&lt;/ref&gt; various scientific or academic journals in South Africa as well as a host of articles in South African newspapers. He has also appeared on television and radio talk shows in South Africa.

In May 2011 Roodt stood for the [[Freedom Front Plus]] during the municipal elections as a candidate in Johannesburg, but was not elected.

Roodt is the deputy leader and spokesperson of South African right-wing political party [[Front National (South Africa)|Front Nasionaal]] formed in late 2013 which promotes [[separatism]] and Afrikaner [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roodt|first=Dan|title=Afrikaners moet opstaan vir selfbeskikking|url=http://www.rapport.co.za/Weekliks/Nuus/Afrikaners-moet-opstaan-vir-selfbeskikking-20140221|accessdate=13 March 2014|language=Afrikaans|trans-title=Afrikaners must stand up for self-determination|newspaper=Rapport|date=22 February 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313154529/http://www.rapport.co.za/Weekliks/Nuus/Afrikaners-moet-opstaan-vir-selfbeskikking-20140221|archivedate=13 March 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eckard |first=Lourensa |title=EFF dood as eis nie slaag |url=http://www.beeld.com/nuus/2014-03-05-eff-dood-as-eis-nie-slaag |language=Afrikaans |trans-title=EFF dead if demand fails |accessdate=13 March 2014 |newspaper=Beeld |date=5 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QLguzCQo?url=http://www.beeld.com/nuus/2014-03-05-eff-dood-as-eis-nie-slaag |archivedate=15 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godinho|first1=Thorne|title=Front Nasionaal stokes the embers of the Afrikaner right|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-24-front-nasionaal-stokes-the-embers-of-the-afrikaner-right|accessdate=15 June 2014|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=25 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140615121535/http://mg.co.za/article/2014-04-24-front-nasionaal-stokes-the-embers-of-the-afrikaner-right|archivedate=15 June 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday newspaper Rapport reported on 8 February 2015 that Roodt had been "voted out of the party" without him being aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Roodt uitgestem http://www.netwerk24.com/nuus/2015-02-08-dan-roodtuitgestem&lt;/ref&gt; He was quoted in the article as saying that "he would henceforth be devoting his energy to his publishing company, Praag... I am disillusioned with Afrikaner politics. I am finished with Afrikaner politics."

==Activism==
Roodt has strong views on the preservation of Afrikaans and Afrikaner culture, which has led to some controversy in the South African [[mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="a72497"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mond"/&gt; He maintains a blog and the PRAAG website, commenting on issues in South Africa. Roodt also regularly writes letters regarding political matters to various South African newspapers and the literary [[e-zine]] LitNet.&lt;ref name="Venter, A 2007. pp. 501-502"&gt;Venter, A. 2007. Book Review: ''Aweregs: politieke essays''. ''Tydskrif vir Geesteswetenskappe'', 47(3):pp. 501-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{POV|date=August 2012}}&lt;!-- "Controversy" sections are generally inappropriate, particularly for articles about living people. Notable items should be integrated in appropriate chronological sections. --&gt; 
Roodt caused a controversy after creating an internet site about South African journalist, writer and activist [[Max du Preez]]. Roodt explained that he had set up the site 'so that everyone who has always wanted to say something about "this idiot and prat", but did not have the means, now has the opportunity'.&lt;ref name="nuus1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nuus24.com/Content/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/1479/781e3207a1eb4375ae2eb325f7c643fe/10-01-2010-07-05/Du_Preez,_Roodt_kruis_swaarde |title=Du Preez, Roodt kruis swaarde: Nuus24: Suid-Afrika: Nuus |publisher=Nuus24 |date=10 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted by Afrikaans Sunday newspaper [[Rapport]] for comment, Du Preez replied that 'it only confirms what I suspected: That Dan has a [[Homoeroticism|homo-erotic]] fixation with me'.&lt;ref name="nuus1"/&gt; In May 2011, the domain name in question was seized by the regulator of South African web domain names, and given to Du Preez.&lt;ref name="rapport.co.za"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapport.co.za/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Max-du-Preez-kry-sy-naam-terug-20110528 |title=Max du Preez kry sy naam terug |publisher=Rapport |date=2011-05-28 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge ruled that Roodt had misused Du Preez's name as part of a slanderous campaign against the latter.&lt;ref name="rapport.co.za"/&gt; The website has since been offline.

In March 2010 Roodt advised Afrikaners to support the [[association football|football]] team of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] instead of the [[South Africa national football team|South African team]] in the [[FIFA World Cup]], hosted by South Africa in June and July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.praag.co.za/dan-roodt-magazine-178/7373-afrikaners-behoort-nederlandse-sokkerspan-te-ondersteun.html |title=Afrikaners behoort Nederlandse sokkerspan te ondersteun |publisher=Praag.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327182417/http://www.praag.co.za/dan-roodt-magazine-178/7373-afrikaners-behoort-nederlandse-sokkerspan-te-ondersteun.html |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010 Roodt travelled to Europe where he met with members of the Swedish Resistant Movement ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: [[Svenska Motståndsrörelsen]]) a Scandinavian group which describes itself as a [[National Socialist]] organisation.&lt;ref name="c605"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rapport.co.za/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Roodt-soek-in-Europa-steun-van-neo-Nazis-20100605 |title=Roodt soek in Europa steun van neo-Nazi’s |publisher=Rapport |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patriot.nu/artikel.asp?artikelID=1244 |title=Ödets budbärare &amp;#124; Nordfront.se |publisher=Patriot.nu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roodt was the subject of a report for ''[[The Daily Show]]'' entitled ''The Amazing Racists'' by comedian [[John Oliver]] in June 2010 in which Roodt made a number of prejudiced statements about black South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2010-07-14-dan-roodt-sas-only-slightly-right-of-centre-xxx-intellectual-gets-the-daily-show-treatment/#.V41VVrh96Uk|title=Dan Roodt, SA's only slightly right-of-centre intellectual, gets The Daily Show treatment {{!}} Daily Maverick|website=www.dailymaverick.co.za|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led Oliver to satirically declare Roodt's views as representing “some of the finest examples of vintage bigotry.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/AfriForum-condemns-racist-Dan-Roodt-20141113|title=AfriForum condemns 'racist' Dan Roodt|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roodt stated that producers of the show had edited the interview to portray him in a negative light and threatened to sue the show.  The South African Afrikaans civil rights organisation [[AfriForum]] publicly criticised Roodts statements as racist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2012, the Press Ombudsman ordered the weekly tabloid ''Sondag'' to publish a front page apology to Roodt for publishing a defamatory article about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Newspapers Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/paper-must-apologise-for-sex-site-gaffe-1.1356030 |title=Paper must apologise for sex site gaffe - South Africa &amp;#124; IOL News |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roodt's first novel, ''Sonneskyn en Chevrolet'' (Taurus, 1980), is an anti-establishment commentary on South African society (and specifically Afrikaner society) of that time.&lt;ref name="k608"&gt;Kannemeyer, J.C. 2005. ''Die Afrikaanse literatuur, 1652-2004''. Kaapstad: Human &amp; Rousseau. p.608.&lt;/ref&gt; His only published volume of [[poetry]] to date, ''Kommas uit 'n boomzol'' (Uitgewery Pannevis, 1980), structurally parodies ''Komas uit 'n bamboesstok'' (Human &amp; Rousseau, 1979), a volume of poetry by the Afrikaans poet [[D.J. Opperman]].&lt;ref name="k608"/&gt; Afrikaans [[literary critic]] [[John Christoffel Kannemeyer|John Kannemeyer]] asserts that there is 'no one poem of any intrinsic value' in ''Kommas uit 'n boomzol'', and similarly views Roodt's subsequent prose work ''Twee sinne'' (Taurus, 1985).&lt;ref name="k608"/&gt;

Roodt's first publication after ''Twee sinne'' is a critical [[essay]] on the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) entitled ''Om die Waarheidskommissie te vergeet'' ('Forgetting the Truth Commission', 2001). This would be PRAAG's first publication of one of Roodt's works. In 2004, PRAAG published the novel ''Moltrein'', which is about a promising musician who leaves South Africa during the 1980s to avoid military service in the South African Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;Kannemeyer, J.C. 2005. ''Die Afrikaanse literatuur, 1652-2004''. Kaapstad: Human &amp; Rousseau. p.609.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Roodt released ''The Scourge of the ANC'' (PRAAG), a critique of the ANC, and also of the former South African government under leadership of [[FW de Klerk]].&lt;ref name="a72497"/&gt; The following year, ''Aweregs'' (PRAAG, 2006), another collection of political essays, was released. Regarding ''Aweregs'', Venter notes that if the ultimate aim of the book is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
to demonstrate the author's pessimism regarding Africa, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), "the new" South Africa, and supporters of the idea that Afrikaans can only survive by developing [[multilingualism]] in South Africa, then Roodt's vision succeeds. But it is a limited and distressing vision.&lt;ref name="Venter, A 2007. pp. 501-502"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015, Roodt published an essay ''Raiders of the Lost Empire: South Africa's English Identity'' (PRAAG) in which he "explores the country's 'new' English identity which is founded on the old colonial identity of the nineteenth century when the redcoats invaded the Cape of Good Hope."&lt;ref&gt;Raiders of the lost Empire: South Africa’s ‘English’ identity – by Dan Roodt http://praag.org/?wpsc-product=raiders-of-the-lost-empire-south-africas-english-identity-by-dan-roodt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Roodt currently lives with his wife, Karin (née Bredenkamp), and their three children in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;ref name="a72497"/&gt;

[[File:Philip Doddridge.jpg|thumb|Philip Doddridge's portrait and his [[Coat of arms]]. The motto in the Coat of arms is ''Dum vivimus vivamus''.]]
'''''Dum vivimus vivamus''''' is a Latin phrase that means "While we live, let us live."&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=dum vivimus, vivamus |publisher=Dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dum+vivimus,+vivamus |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dum%20vivimus%20vivamus |title=dum vivimus vivamus |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often taken to be an [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] declaration.&lt;ref name="Dictionary.com"/&gt;

This Latin phrase was the motto of [[Philip Doddridge]]'s coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3XUBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=Philip+Doddridge+motto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eAOjny8yzK&amp;sig=EHwcBZjUaKHHH4TLQA7Tq5FbYqs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ILpxVYr8MMOuswHUkIGoAQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwADgK Orton, Job, Memoirs of the Life, Character and Writings of the Late Reverend Philip Doddridge, p. 145.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
It serves as the motto for [[Porcellian Club]] at Harvard. [[Emily Dickinson]] used the line in a whimsical [[valentine's Day|valentine]] written to William Howland in 1852 and subsequently published in the ''[[Springfield Daily Republican]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odjIKZKYHJQC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;dq=Emily+Dickinson+dum+vivimus+vivamus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z4rwLe0osd&amp;sig=21vPd8Dmltmq6hs3pGzWNIVLCf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U8FxVZnaK8aqsgHEhYHgBg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg Benson Sewall, Richard, The Life of Emily Dickinson, Volumes 1-2, p. 450.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
''[[Sic transit gloria mundi]]
 ''[[Against Idleness and Mischief|How doth the busy bee]],
''Dum vivimus vivamus,
 ''I stay my enemy!
&lt;/poem&gt;

It was also the motto inscribed on the sword of "Oscar" Gordon, the protagonist of [[Robert Heinlein]]'s 1963 book "[[Glory Road]]". And it is the motto of The Knights of Momus, a New Orleans Carnival organization.

'''Durga Charan Mohanty''' ([[Odia language|Odia]]:ଦୁର୍ଗାଚରଣ ମହାନ୍ତି, (1912–1985) was an [[Odia language|Odia]] Indian spiritual writer born in 1912 at [[Biratunga]], a village under block [[Gop (Biratunga)|Gop]], near [[Konark]], [[Odisha]]. The [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for Odia|Odia Sahitya Akademi]] has been awarded to him in 1956–58 due to his active involvement in development of [[Odia language|Odia]] language and literature&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orissasahityaakademi.org/english/website/award-winners/sahitya-award.htm Sahitya Akademi Award Winner, Durga Charan Mohanty].&lt;/ref&gt; Being a disciple of [[Swami Nigamananda]], he wrote many books and translated Nigamananda's own-written [[Bengali language|Bengali]] books to [[Odia language|Odia]] language. He was ପରିଚାଳକ (Secretary/Parichalaka) of ନୀଳାଚଳ ସାରସ୍ୱତ ସଂଘ ([[Nilachala Saraswata Sangha]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsspuri.org/parichalaka.html Durga Charan Mohanty NSS Puri's Secretary/Parichalaka].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSSPuri"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nigamānanda|author2=Disciple of Swami Nigamananda: Shri Durga Charan Mohanty|title=The divine universal gospels of Sri Nigamananda: translation, a lucid word to word rendering to English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXTXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 June 2011|year=1997|publisher=Amitabh Giri}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His father Gunanidhi Mohanty was a [[Jamindar]] and mother ''Sundarmani Mohanty'' was President of Nilachala Saraswata Sangha (Women Association).&lt;ref&gt;[Nilachala Vani] Chapter – ''Utkal Bhakta Parichaya''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual career==
After reading Yogiguru (योगीगुरु) and Premikaguru (प्रेमिकगुरु) respectively, authored by [[Swami Nigamananda]], at Raghunandanan Library, [[Puri]], the ''vigraha''(portrait) of Swami Nigamananda present in the books attracted him very much. At the same time he began worshiping this portrait and considered Nigamananda as his spiritual master and revered God. He began to search Nigamananda and finally met him in [[Nilachala Kutir]] [[Puri]] on 20 March 1930, Thursday. At that time he was only seventeen years old and a student of class IX in [[Puri district]] School. On first meeting he was overwhelmed by his appearance and realised Nigamananda as [[Ishwar]]. Since that day, he became a regular visitor to [[Nilachala Kutir]] for his [[Darśana|darshan]]. He used to note down guru Nigamananda's sayings(upadesh), later he published these "upadesh"(gospels)in books like Nilachala Vani and Nigama Upadesh. Subsequently, he wrote many books for [[Nilachala Saraswata Sangha]] and translated Nigamananda's originally written [[Bengali language|Bengali]] books, ବ୍ରହ୍ମଚର୍ୟ ସାଧନା(Brahamcharya Sadhana), ଯୋଗୀଗୁରୁ(Yogi Guru), ଜ୍ଞାନୀ ଗୁରୁ(Gyani Guru), ତାନ୍ତ୍ରିକ ଗୁରୁ(Tantrika Guru), and ପ୍ରେମିକଗୁରୁ(Premika Guru), into [[Odia language|Odia]] language.&lt;ref name="Padhy1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krushna Singh Padhy|title=The press in India: perspective in development and relevance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v5kAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 June 2011|year=1997|publisher=Kanishka Publishers, Distributors|isbn=978-81-7391-183-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TripathyTripathy2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amulya Kumar Tripathy|author2=P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7418">'''Fatos Tarifa''' (born 1954) is a [[social scientist]] and a former diplomat from [[Albania]].

==Education==
Tarifa has a double doctorate, with a Ph.D. in Sociology from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and a doctorate in Political Science from the [[University of Tirana]]. He has been, inter alia, a lecturer, a researcher and a distinguished visiting fellow since 1981, when he joined the School of Political Science and Law at the University of Tirana. In 1992 he was awarded a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] at the Department of Sociology at UNC [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].

==Career==
Tarifa served as Albanian ambassador to [[the Netherlands]] (1998–2001) and to the [[United States]] (2001–2005). Currently he is Professor of Sociology and International Relations, and Director of the Institute for Studies on Democracy and Development at the [[University of New York Tirana]]. Tarifa has taught and conducted research at the [[University of Tirana]], the [[European University of Tirana]], the [[Institute of Social Studies]] at The Hague, [[Webster University]] (Leiden, the Netherlands), [[Campbell University]], the [[University of North Carolina]] at Chapel Hill, and [[Eastern Michigan University]] and he has delivered lectures at institutions of higher education throughout the world, such as [[Duke University]], [[Stanford University]], [[New York University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Brown University]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of Essex]], [[University of Amsterdam]] etc.

Tarifa has authored, co-authored and edited 45 books and more than 90 journal articles. His books and articles have covered topics ranging from democratic transition and social issues in Eastern Europe to Human development, and current international affairs. In 1998 he became the founding Editor of "Sociological Analysis", an innovative, international scholarly journal published at Chapel Hill, NC, which he edited for 15 years. He serves as a member of the International Advisory Board of the "Journal of Social Sciences" and the "Journal of Applied Social Science".

Dr. Tarifa will probably be best remembered as the leader of a campaign to introduce the discipline of [[sociology]] into higher education in Albania. He is widely considered to be "the founder of sociological studies in Albania, and one of the country's most prominent social scientists". Tarifa has "already earned the title of father of Albanian sociology, a moniker he has generally resisted".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7287">'''Floor area ratio''' ('''FAR''') is the [[ratio]] of a building's total [[Floor area (building)|floor area]] (gross floor area) to the size of the piece of land upon which it is built. The terms can also refer to limits imposed on such a ratio through [[zoning]].

As a formula FAR = (gross floor area) / (area of the plot)

== Terminology ==
Floor Area ratio is sometimes called '''floor space ratio''' ('''FSR'''), '''floor space index''' ('''FSI'''), '''site ratio''' or '''plot ratio'''

The difference between FAR and FSI is that the first is a ratio, while the latter is an index.
Index numbers are values expressed as a percentage of a single base figure. Thus an FAR of 1.5 is translated as an FSI of 150%.

=== Regional variation ===
The terms most commonly used for this measurement vary from one country or region to the next.

In Australia ''floor space ratio'' (FSR) is used in [[New South Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/planningsystem/pdf/pn08_001_slep_height_and_fsr.pdf NSW Department of Planning], retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and ''plot ratio'' in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southperth.wa.gov.au/old/town_plan_info/townplanning/quick_start_guide.htm#P Quick Start Guide to Town Planning in the City of South Perth ], retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]] ''floor space index'' (FSI) and ''floor area ratio'' (FAR) are both used.

In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Hong Kong]] both ''plot ratio'' and ''site ratio'' are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trp.dundee.ac.uk/research/glossary/plotrati.html University of Dundee: Town and Regional planning], retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/tech_doc/hkpsg/sum/ch2/ch2_sum.htm ] [http://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/tech_doc/hkpsg/full/ch2/ch2_tbl_3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Singapore]] the terms ''plot ratio'' add ''gross plot ratio'' (GPR) are more commonly used.

In the [[United States of America|United States]] and [[Canada]], ''floor space ratio'' (FSR) and ''floor area ratio'' (FAR) are both used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/zone/glossary.shtml|title=NYC Zoning - Glossary|work=nyc.gov|accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use ratios are used as a measure of the density of the site being developed. The ratio is generated by dividing the building area by the parcel area, using the same units.

== History ==
One of the purposes of the [[1916 Zoning Resolution|1916 zoning ordinance]] of New York City was to prevent tall buildings from obstructing too much light and air. The 1916 zoning ordinance sought to control building size by regulating height and setback requirements for towers. In 1961, a revision to the zoning ordinance introduced the concept of floor area ratio (FAR). Buildings built before 1961 often have FARs that would be unachievable today, such as the [[Empire State Building]] which has an FAR of 25 - meaning that it earns considerably greater rent than a newer building on the same land could hope for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Willis | first = Carol | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1550360 | title = Form follows finance: The Empire State Building | work = Landscape of Modernity: Essays on New York City, 1900-1940 | date = 1992 | location = New York City | publisher = Russell Sage Foundation | editor1-last = Ward | editor1-first = David | editor2-last = Zunz | editor2-first = Olivier | page = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose and use ==
The floor area ratio (FAR) can be used in [[zoning]] to limit [[urban density]]. While it directly limits building density, indirectly it also limits the number of people that a building can hold, without controlling a building's external shape.

For example, if lot must adhere to a 0.1 FAR, then the total area of all floors in all buildings on the lot must be no more than one-tenth the area of the parcel itself. In other words, if the lot was 10,000 sq. ft, then the total floor area of all floors in all buildings mustn't exceed 1,000 sq. ft.

An architect can plan for either a single-story building consuming the entire allowable area in one floor, or a [[multi-story building]] that rises higher above the plane of the land, but which must consequently result in a smaller footprint than would a single-story building of the same total floor area.  By combining the horizontal and vertical limits into a single figure, some flexibility is permitted in [[building design]], while achieving a hard limit on at least one measure of overall size.  One advantage to fixing this parameter, as opposed to others such as height, width, or length, is that floor area correlates well with other considerations relevant to zoning regulation, such as total parking that would be required for an [[Office|office building]], total number of units that might be available for residential use, total load on [[municipal services]], etc.  The amounts of these things tend to be constant for a given total floor area, regardless of how that area is distributed horizontally and vertically.  Thus, many jurisdictions have found it unnecessary to include hard height limitations when using floor area ratio calculations.

Common exclusions to the total calculation of square footage for the purpose of floor area ratio (FAR) include unoccupied areas such as mechanical equipment floors, basements, stair towers, elevator shafts, and parking garages.

=== Japan ===
Japan has extensively adopted the floor area ratio in the zoning system since 1970.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

=== India ===
In India FAR and FSI are both used. FAR regulations vary from city to city and generally it is from 1.3 to 3.25. In Mumbai 1.33 is the norm but higher FSI is allowed along the Metro rail line and slum areas like [[Dharavi]]. In Bangalore, 40 feet streets allow only an FAR of 1.75 but 100 feet streets allow 3.25 FAR.

== Impact on land value ==
FAR has a major impact on the value of the land. Higher allowable FAR yields higher land value.

== Criticism ==
Andres Duany et al in Suburban Nation, the Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream (2000) note:

# Abdicating to floor area ratios (market forces) is the opposite of aiming a community toward something more than the sum of its parts.  
# FAR, a poor predictor of physical form, should not be used when the objective is to conserve and enhance neighborhood character; whereas traditional design standards (height, lot coverage and setbacks or build-to lines) enable anyone to make reasonably accurate predictions, recognize violations, and feel secure in their investment decisions. 
# If FAR is carelessly combined with traditional setbacks, assembled lots have a considerable advantage over individual lots, which has a negative effect on fine-grained cities and the diversity of ownership.

'''[[French language|French]] [[verb]]s''' are a part of speech in [[French grammar]]. Each verb [[lexeme]] has a collection of [[Finite verb|finite]] and non-finite forms in its [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] scheme.

Finite forms depend on grammatical [[Grammatical tense|tense]] and [[Grammatical person|person]]/number. There are eight simple [[tense–aspect–mood]] forms, categorized into the [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]] [[grammatical mood|mood]]s, with the [[conditional mood]] sometimes viewed as an additional category. The eight simple forms can also be categorized into four tenses (future, present, past, and future-of-the-past), or into two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]] ([[Perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]]).

The three non-finite moods are the [[infinitive]], [[past participle]], and [[present participle]].

There are compound constructions that use more than one verb. These include one for each simple tense with the addition of {{wikt-lang|fr|avoir}} or {{wikt-lang|fr|être}} as an auxiliary verb. There is also a construction which is used to distinguish passive [[grammatical voice|voice]] from active voice.

== Conjugation ==
{{main|French conjugation}}
French verbs are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] by isolating the stem of the verb and adding an ending. In the first and second conjugation, the stem is easily identifiable from the [[infinitive]], and remains essentially constant throughout the paradigm. For example, the stem of {{wikt-lang|fr|parler}} ("speak") is ''parl-'' and the stem of {{wikt-lang|fr|finir}} ("finish") is ''fin-''. In the third group, the relationship between the infinitive form and the stem is less consistent, and several distinct stems are needed to produce all the forms in the paradigm. For example, the verb {{wikt-lang|fr|boire}} ("drink") has the stems ''boi-'', ''boiv-'', ''bu-'', and ''buv-''.

The ending depends on the [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[grammatical voice|voice]] of the verb, as well as on the [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] of its [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. Every conjugation exhibits some degree of [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]], where the same (homophonous, and possibly also homographic) form is used to realize distinct combinations of grammatical features. This is most noticeable for ''-er'' verbs. For instance, the conjugated form ''parle'' can be the 1st or 3rd person singular indicative or subjunctive form of ''parler'', or the singular familiar imperative. Furthermore, the 2nd person singular indicative and subjunctive form ''parles'' and the 3rd person plural form ''parlent'' are pronounced the same way as ''parle'' (except in [[Liaison (linguistics)|liaison]] contexts). The prevalence of syncretism in conjugation paradigms is one functional explanation for the fact that French does not allow [[Null subject language|null subjects]], unlike most of the other Romance languages.

===Classification===
Aside from {{wikt-lang|fr|être}} and {{wikt-lang|fr|avoir}} (considered categories unto themselves), French verbs are traditionally&lt;ref&gt;L. Tasmowski and S. Reinheimer. "Variations dans le radical du verbe roman". In D. Godard (ed), ''Les langues romanes; Problèmes de la phrase simple''. Paris, CNRS Editions, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into three ''conjugation classes'' (''groupes''):
*The first conjugation class consists of all verbs with infinitives ending in ''-er'', except for the irregular verb {{wikt-lang|fr|aller}} (actually être and aller are [[suppletive]] verbs) and (by some accounts) the irregular verbs {{wikt-lang|fr|envoyer}} and {{wikt-lang|fr|renvoyer}};&lt;ref name="1st-group-exceptions"&gt;[http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/questions.html#aller Langue française-Questions courantes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514131914/http://www.academie-francaise.fr/langue/questions.html |date=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the verbs in this conjugation, which together constitute the great majority of French verbs, are all conjugated similarly, though there are a number of subclasses with minor changes arising from orthographical and phonological considerations.
*The second conjugation class consists of all verbs with infinitives in ''-ir'' or ''-ïr'' and present participles in ''-issant'' or ''-ïssant'', as well as the verb {{wikt-lang|fr|maudire}}. There are somewhat over 300 such verbs, all conjugated identically, with some minor exceptions. &lt;!-- such as "haïr" vs. "amuïr", and the infinitive and past participle of "maudire", and one sense of "fleurir" --&gt; The ''-iss-'' or ''-ïss-'' in much of their conjugation is a reflex of the Latin [[inchoative]] infix ''-isc-''/''-esc-'', but does not retain any [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] semantics.
*The third conjugation class consists of all other verbs: ''aller'', arguably ''(r)envoyer'', a number of verbs in ''-ir'' (including all verbs in ''-oir'', which is an etymologically unrelated ending), and all verbs in ''-re''. Nonetheless, this class is very small compared to the other two, though it does contain some of the most common verbs. This class has a few dozen subclasses, often differing substantially; indeed, this class is essentially a catch-all for verbs, besides {{wikt-lang|fr|être}} and {{wikt-lang|fr|avoir}}, that do not fit into the first two classes. There are about 370 verbs in this group, though a much smaller number are still in frequent use.

==Moods==
As with English verbs, French verbs have both [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] moods (''les modes impersonnels''), also called verbals, and [[Finite verb|finite]] ones (''les modes personnels'').

===Finite moods===

The finite moods are the indicative (''l'indicatif''), the imperative (''l'impératif''), and the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (''le subjonctif''). As discussed below, sometimes the conditional is recognized as a fourth mood. While the rules that determine the correct mood are quite complex, they are simplified and summarized in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! indicative
||
*used in most independent [[clause]]s
*used in affirmative and negative statements and questions
*used in dependent clauses that are certainly true
*used when no other mood applies
||
*« Où ''êtes''-vous ? » ("Where ''are'' you?")
*« Je ''suis'' ici. » ("I ''am'' here.")
|-
! subjunctive
||
*used in many dependent clauses
*used to express a doubtful, desired, or requested event
*used to express an event to which the reaction is of most significance
*used to express a third-person imperative
*used much more than in English
||
*« Il se peut qu'il ''vienne'' demain. » ("It may be that he ''will come'' tomorrow.")
*« J'ai demandé qu'il ''parte''. » ("I asked that he ''leave''.")
*« Je suis heureux qu'il ''soit'' venu. » ("I am glad that he ''came''.")
*« ''Vive'' le roi ! » ("Long ''live'' the king!")
|-
! imperative
||
*used in commands and requests
*only possible with first-person plural and second-person singular and plural subject
*the subject is implied
*almost exactly as in English
||
*« ''Fais'' tes devoirs ! » ("''Do'' your homework!")
|}

Many linguists recognize a fourth mood, the [[conditional mood|conditional]] (''le conditionnel''), which is used in almost exactly the same circumstances as the conditional in English. In French, « Je le ''ferais'' si j'avais assez de temps » is "I ''would do'' it if I had enough time" in English. Other linguists consider the conditional to be a tense of the indicative mood. The two camps do not disagree on the rules for when and how to use the conditional.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A third camp recognizes both "conditionnel présent/conditionnel passé" (for use in conditional sentences), and "indicatif futur du passé / indicatif futur antérieur du passé" (for tense concords, "future from a past point of view"), but they recognize also that both are conjugated the same.

===Non-finite moods===

*The '''infinitive''' has a present tense, with a perfect: "faire" means "to do", while "avoir fait" means "to have done".
*There is a '''present [[participle]]''', with a perfect construction: "faisant" means "doing", while "ayant fait" means "having done". As noted above, this participle is not used in forming a continuous aspect. Further, it cannot be used as a noun, in the way that present participles in English have the same form as [[gerund]]s; the only verbal noun is the infinitive.
**There is a ''gérondif'' ("'''gerundive'''", but different from the [[Latin language|Latin]] gerundive), formed with the [[clitic]] ''en'' and the present participle: "en faisant" means "by doing" or "while doing" (it is analogous to the English "in doing", but in English, since "doing" can act as a noun, "in doing" is taken as a prepositional phrase rather than as a separate verb form. That interpretation is not available for "en faisant"). Similarly, "en ayant fait" means "by having done".
*There is a separate '''past participle''': "fait" means "done". As in English, it can be used in the passive voice, in the perfect form, or on its own as an adjective. The past participle has no perfect, except arguably in the special ''surcomposé'' tense.

==Tenses and aspects==

===Tenses and aspects of the indicative mood===

The indicative mood has five "simple" ([[synthetic language|synthetic]]) tense-aspect forms, conveying four tenses (times of action) (future, present, past, and future-of-past) and two aspects (fabrics of time) ([[perfective aspect|perfective]], conveying an action viewed in its entirety without its time frame being considered in more detail, and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]], conveying an action that occurs repetitively or continuously). The tense-aspect forms of the indicative mood in French are called the present (''le présent'': present tense, imperfective aspect), the simple past (''le [[passé simple]]'': past tense, perfective aspect), the [[imperfect]] (''l'imparfait'': past tense, imperfective aspect), the future (''le futur'': future tense, unspecified aspect), and the conditional (''le conditionnel'': future-in-past tense, unspecified aspect). Note that, as discussed above, in some uses the conditional can be considered a separate mood completely, while in other uses it is the future-in-past tense of the indicative. The use of the various tense forms is described in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! present
|
*like in English, used to describe habitual, recurring, and "always" true events
*unlike in English, used to describe ongoing current action
*unlike in English, used to describe events that started in the past and affect the present (i.e., most cases where simple perfect is used in English)
*sometimes used to describe upcoming events
*used in a [[protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] (''if''-clause) when the [[Conditional sentence|apodosis]] (''then''-clause) is in the future tense or imperative mood
|
*« Le mardi, je ''joue'' au tennis. » ("On Tuesdays, I ''play'' tennis.") 
*« En ce moment, je ''joue'' au tennis. » ("At the moment, I ''am playing'' tennis. ")
*« Il ''habite'' à Paris depuis 15 ans . » ("He ''has lived'' /''has been living'' in Paris for 15 years. ")
*« Demain, je ''joue'' au tennis avec Marc. » ("Tomorrow, I ''am playing'' tennis with Marc.")
*« Si je ''joue'' au tennis avec vous mardi, jouerez-vous aux échecs avec moi mercredi ? » ("If I ''play'' tennis with you on Tuesday, will you play chess with me on Wednesday?")
|-
! simple past&lt;br&gt;(past perfective)
|
*used to describe past events in a [[perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[aorist aspect]]; that is, with a sense of completion, with a definite beginning and end
*a literary tense that is rarely used in spoken language
|
*« Et la lumière ''fut''. » ("And there ''was'' light.")
*« Il ''naquit'' en 1930 et ''mourut'' en 1998. » ("He ''was born'' in 1930 and ''died'' in 1998.")
*« Hier, il ''plut''. » ("Yesterday, it ''rained''.")
*« Il ''rangea'' la salle tandis qu'elle faisait la vaisselle. » ("He ''cleaned'' the room while she was washing the dishes.")
|-
! imperfect&lt;br&gt;(past imperfective)
|
*used to describe past events or situations in an [[imperfective aspect]]; that is, ongoing, repetitive, or habitual past events or situations
*often used in conjunction with the simple or compound past to indicate an event that was ongoing while another took place
*used in a contrary-to-fact protasis (with the apodosis in the conditional)
*often analogous to English past continuous ("was doing") or to the construction "used to do"
|
*« Quand j&amp;#39;''étais'' jeune, j&amp;#39;''habitais'' à Paris. » ("When I ''was'' young, I ''lived'' in Paris.")
*« Il rangea la salle tandis qu'elle ''faisait'' la vaisselle. » ("He cleaned the room while she ''was washing'' the dishes.")
*« Si je le ''savais'', je te le dirais. » ("If I ''knew'' [it], I would tell you.")
|-
! simple future
|
*used to describe future events
*mostly the same as in English, except that it is a simple (one-word) tense in French
|
*« Je le ''ferai'' demain. » ("I ''will do'' it tomorrow.")
|-
! conditional (future-in-past)
|
*used in an apodosis when the protasis is contrary to fact (in the imperfect)
*used to describe a past event from the standpoint of an even-earlier event
*mostly the same as in English, except that it is a simple (one-word) tense in French
|
*« Si je le savais, je te le ''dirais''. » ("If I knew it, I ''would tell'' you.")
*« Ils disaient que je ''réussirais''. » ("They said that I ''would succeed''.")
|}

Additionally, the indicative has five compound (two-word) tense-aspect forms, each of which is formed analogously to the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] in languages such as English (e.g., "have done") (though in French this form does not indicate the perfect aspect) as applied to one of the above simple tense forms. These tense forms are used to indicate events before the corresponding simple tense forms; for example, « À ce moment-là, il se souvint de ce qu'il ''avait promis'' » ("At that moment, he remembered what he had promised"). In addition, except in literature or very formal speeches, the present perfect form is used in modern French wherever the simple past would have been used in older or more literary writing. Since this use is much more common than its use as a true present perfect, it is usually called the compound past (''le [[passé composé]]''). Further, where older or more literary French would have used the perfect form of the simple past tense (''le passé antérieur'') for the past-of-the-past, modern non-literary French uses the pluperfect (''le plus-que-parfait''; the perfect of the imperfect), or sometimes a new form called the ''surcomposé'' (literally, "over-compound"), which re-applies the perfect to the compound past, resulting in a structure like « Je l&amp;#39;''ai eu fait'' » (literally, "I it ''have had done''").

Unlike English or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], French does not mark for a [[continuous aspect]]. Thus, "I am doing it" (continuous) and "I do it" both translate to the same sentence in French: « Je le fais. » However, the distinction is often clear from context; and when not, it can be conveyed using [[periphrasis]]; for example, the expression ''être en train de &lt;nowiki&gt;[faire quelque chose]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ("to be in the middle of &lt;nowiki&gt;[doing something]&lt;/nowiki&gt;") is often used to convey the sense of a continuous aspect. (For example, "I am doing it" might be expressed as « Je suis en train de le faire », "I am in the middle of doing it.") In the case of the past tense, neither the simple nor the compound past tense is ever used with a continuous sense; therefore, the imperfect often indicates a continuous sense (though it does have other uses, as discussed above).

Similarly to English, the verb {{wikt-lang|fr|aller}} (''to go'') can be used as an auxiliary verb to create a near-future tense (''le futur proche''). Whereas English uses the continuous aspect (''to be going''), French uses the simple present tense; for example, the English sentence "I am going to do it tomorrow" would in French be « Je ''vais'' le ''faire'' demain ». As in English, this form can generally be replaced by the present or future tense: "I am doing it tomorrow", "I shall do it tomorrow", « Je le ''fais'' demain », « Je le ferai demain ».

===Tenses and aspects of the subjunctive mood===
{{Main|Subjunctive mood#French}}

====Forms====

The subjunctive mood has only two simple tense-aspect forms: a present (''le présent du subjonctif'') and an imperfect (''l'imparfait du subjonctif''). Of these, only the present is used nowadays; like the simple past indicative, the imperfect subjunctive is only found in older and more literary works. When both tense-aspect forms are used, there is no difference in meaning between the two; the present is used in subordinate clauses whose main clauses are in a present or future tense, as well as in the few main clauses that use the subjunctive, and the imperfect is used in subordinate clauses whose main clauses are in a past tense form (other than present perfect). Except in literature and very formal speeches, modern French uses the present subjunctive even where an older or more literary work would use the imperfect subjunctive.

As with the indicative, the subjunctive also has one compound tense form for each simple tense form. The difference between the present perfect subjunctive (''le passé du subjonctif'') and the pluperfect subjunctive (''le plus-que-parfait du subjonctif'') is analogous to the difference between the present subjunctive and imperfect subjunctive; of the two, only the present perfect subjunctive is found in modern French.

====Uses====
The subjunctive in French&lt;ref&gt;Laura K. Lawless, ''About.com Guide'', "French Subjunctive - Subjonctif". [http://french.about.com/od/grammar/ss/subjunctive.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is used almost wherever it would be in English, and in many other situations as well. It is used in ''que'' ("that") clauses to indicate emotion, doubt, possibility, necessity, desire, and so forth. For example, as in English one says

*''J'aime mieux qu'il le '''fasse''''', "I prefer that he it do", "I prefer that he do it"

But also, unlike in English, the subjunctive is used in, for example,

*''Je veux qu'il le '''fasse''''' "I want that he it do", "I want him to do it"
*''Je crains qu'il '''ne parte''''' "I fear that he (subjunctive particle) leave", "I am afraid that he will leave"
*''Je cherche un homme qui '''sache''' la vérité'' "I seek a man who knows the truth", "I am looking for a man who knows the truth"

Sometimes the subjunctive is used in the interrogative and the negative but not in the affirmative:

*''Penses-tu qu'il '''soit''' sympa?'' (subjunctive) "Do you think that he is nice?"
*''Oui, je pense qu'il '''est''' sympa.'' (indicative) "Yes, I think that he is nice."
*''Non, je ne pense pas qu'il '''soit''' sympa.'' (subjunctive) "No, I do not think that he is nice."

In addition to situations of doubt, negatives stated with certainty take the subjunctive:

*''Il n'y a rien que nous '''puissions''' faire.'' "There is nothing that we can do."

Superlatives also can optionally be accompanied by the subjunctive in a ''que'' clause, if the speaker feels doubt:

*''C'est le meilleur livre que j''''aie pu''' trouver.'' "That is the best book that I could find."

Finally, as in English, counterfactual conditions in the past are expressed by backshifting the apparent time reference. In English this backshifted form is called the pluperfect subjunctive, and unless it is expressed in inverted form it is identical in form to the pluperfect indicative; it is called subjunctive because of the change in implied time of action. In French, however, there is a distinction in form between the seldom used pluperfect subjunctive and the pluperfect indicative, which is used in this situation. For example,

*''Si on l''''avait su''' (pluperfect indicative), on aurait pu (conditional perfect) l'empêcher.'' "Had we known (pluperfect subjunctive) it, we would have been able (conditional perfect) to prevent it.

===Tenses and aspects of the imperative mood===

{| class="wikitable"
! imperative
|
* used to give commands
|
« Fais-le. » ("Do it.")
|-
|}

The imperative only has a present tense, with a rarely used perfect: "fais-le" and "aie-le fait" both mean "do it", with the latter implying a certain deadline (somewhat like English "have it done").

==Voice==
Like English, French has two [[Grammatical voice|voices]], the unmarked active voice and the marked passive voice. As in English, the passive voice is formed by using the appropriate form of "to be" (''être'') and the past participle of the main verb.

==Temporal auxiliary verbs==
{{main|Passé composé}}
In French, all compound tense-aspect forms are formed with an auxiliary verb (either {{wikt-lang|fr|être}} "to be" or {{wikt-lang|fr|avoir}} "to have"). Most verbs use ''avoir'' as their auxiliary verb. The exceptions are all [[reflexive verb]]s and a number of verbs of motion or change of state, including some of the most frequently used intransitive verbs of the language:

* {{wikt-lang|fr|aller}} — to go
* {{wikt-lang|fr|arriver}} — to arrive
* {{wikt-lang|fr|décéder}} — to pass away
* {{wikt-lang|fr|descendre}}¹ — to descend
* {{wikt-lang|fr|devenir}} — to become
* {{wikt-lang|fr|entrer}}¹ — to enter
* {{wikt-lang|fr|monter}}¹ — to climb/mount
* {{wikt-lang|fr|mourir}} — to die
* {{wikt-lang|fr|naître}} — to be born
* {{wikt-lang|fr|partir}} — to leave or part
* {{wikt-lang|fr|passer}}¹ — to pass by
* {{wikt-lang|fr|rester}} — to stay
* {{wikt-lang|fr|retourner}}¹ — to return
* {{wikt-lang|fr|sortir}}¹ — to go out
* {{wikt-lang|fr|tomber}}¹ — to fall
* {{wikt-lang|fr|venir}} — to come

Verbs that are derived from these by prefixation may continue to select ''être'', but this is not always the case. For example:
*(with '''être''')
**derived from ''venir'': {{wikt-lang|fr|advenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|intervenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|parvenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|provenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|survenir}}
**prefix ''re-'': {{wikt-lang|fr|redevenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|remonter}}¹, {{wikt-lang|fr|renaître}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|rentrer}}¹, {{wikt-lang|fr|ressortir}}¹, {{wikt-lang|fr|revenir}}, etc.
*(with '''avoir''')
**derived from ''venir'': {{wikt-lang|fr|circonvenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|contrevenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|convenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|prévenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|subvenir}}
**transitive verbs: {{wikt-lang|fr|démonter}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|surmonter}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|dépasser}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|outrepasser}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|surpasser}}, etc.

(The verbs marked with "¹" above combine with ''être'' in their intransitive uses, and ''avoir'' when used transitively.)

A small number of verbs, including some already mentioned above, can in fact be found with either auxiliary ({{wikt-lang|fr|croître}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|monter}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|descendre}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|convenir}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|paraître}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|apparaître}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|trépasser}}). There may be a subtle change of meaning depending on the auxiliary chosen, and one auxiliary is usually more literary or archaic than the other.
&lt;!-- In some other [[Romance language]]s, such as [[Italian language|Italian]], this same distinction is made between the two auxiliary verbs. The semantic basis for it lies in the quality of the subject; where the subject is not an active agent or initiator of the action or change (that is, when it is an [[unaccusative verb]]) the auxiliary ''être'' is used. --&gt;

The distinction between the two auxiliary verbs is important for the correct formation of the compound tense-aspect forms and is essential to the agreement of the past participle.

==Past participle agreement==
The past participle is used in three ways in French: as an adjective, in the passive construction, and in the compound tense-aspect constructions. When it is used as an adjective, it follows all the regular adjective agreement rules. In passive constructions, it always agrees with the passive subject.

In compound tense-aspect forms, more complicated agreement rules apply, reflecting the subtle priority rules between the [[Grammatical modifier|attribute]] meaning (which implies an agreement) and the compound tense construction (which by itself does not imply any agreement).

'''A.''' The auxiliary verb is ''avoir''.
{{ordered list
| If there is no direct object (the verb is intransitive) or the direct object appears after the past participle, then the past participle does not agree (i.e., it takes the default masculine singular form).
{{bulleted list 
| (intransitive) Elles ont '''dormi'''. ("They (fem.) slept.")
| (direct object after verb) Claire a '''vu''' ''deux baleines''. ("Claire saw two whales.")
}}
| If there is a direct object and it appears before the past participle, then the participle must agree with it. Three cases:
{{bulleted list 
| ([[pronoun#French language Pronouns|pronoun]] before the auxiliary) Il y avait deux baleines. Claire ''les'' a '''vues'''. ("There were two whales.  Claire saw them.")
| (clause-initial ''wh''-question element) ''Quelles baleines'' Claire a-t-elle '''vues''' ? ("Which whales did Claire see?")
| (relative clause introduced by ''que'') ''les deux baleines'' que Claire a '''vues''' ("the two whales that Claire saw")
}}
| The above rule is one of the most difficult in French, and even native speakers have trouble with it, and ignore it in colloquial speech. Since, when spoken, for most verbs, the different forms sound the same (for example, ''vu vus vue vues'' "seen" are all pronounced {{IPA|/vy/}}, this is usually not noticeable.  There are however, past participles like ''fait'' "done" and ''mis'' "put" whose feminine forms sound different when spoken, and only the most careful speakers will be heard applying the rule.
}}
'''B.''' The auxiliary is ''être'', and the verb is not reflexive. The past participle agrees with the subject: 
::Elles sont '''arrivées'''. ("They (fem.) arrived.")
'''C.''' The auxiliary is ''être'' and the verb is reflexive. The agreement rules are in fact the same as those for structures with ''avoir'' in '''A''', keeping in mind that the reflexive pronoun corresponds to either the direct object or the indirect object of the verb.
{{ordered list
| There is no direct object, or the direct object appears after the past participle → no agreement. In these cases, the reflexive pronoun expresses the indirect object.
{{bulleted list 
| (no direct object) Elles se sont '''succédé'''. Nous nous sommes '''parlé'''. ("They (fem.) succeeded. We spoke with each other.")
| (direct object after verb) Elles se sont '''posé''' des questions. ("They (fem.) asked each other some questions.")
}}
| There is a direct object and it appears before the past participle. → The past participle agrees with this object.
The first three cases are the same as in '''A'''.2 above (the reflexive pronoun is the indirect object).
{{bulleted list 
| (direct object pronoun) J'ai fait une tarte. Les enfants se ''la'' sont '''partagée'''. ("I made a pie.  The children shared it.")
| (''wh''-question) ''Quelle tarte'' se sont-ils '''partagée''' ? ("Which pie did they share?")
| (''que'' relative) ''la tarte'' que les enfants se sont '''partagée''' ("the pie that the children shared")
}}
The reflexive pronoun can itself be the direct object, in which case the participle agrees with it (and therefore with the subject). This also includes "inherently reflexive" verbs, for which the reflexive pronoun cannot be interpreted semantically as an object (direct or indirect) of the verb.
* (ordinary reflexive) Elles ''se'' sont '''suivies'''. Nous ''nous'' sommes '''salués'''. ("They (fem.) followed each other.  We greeted each other.")
* (inherently reflexive) Ils ''se'' sont '''moqués''' de moi. Nous ''nous'' sommes '''souvenus''' de l'événement.&lt;br&gt; ("They made fun of me.  We remembered the event.") (exception: Elles ''se'' sont '''ri''' du danger. "They (fem.) laughed at the danger.") 
}}

The '''German Reference Corpus''' (original: '''Deutsches Referenzkorpus'''; short: '''DeReKo''') is an electronic archive of [[text corpus|text corpora]] of [[German language|contemporary written German]]. It was first created in 1964 and is hosted at the Institute for the German Language (IDS) in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]]. The corpus archive is continuously updated and expanded. It currently comprises more than 4.0 billion word tokens (as of August 2010) and constitutes the largest linguistically motivated collection of contemporary German texts. Today, it is one of the major resources worldwide for the study of written German.

==Alternative names==

The German Reference Corpus is often referred to by other names, such as ''Mannheim corpora'', ''IDS corpora'', ''COSMAS corpora'' and the corresponding German translations. The name ''Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)'' was originally used for a specific portion of the current archive which was collected between 1999 and 2002 by a number of institutions in a joint project under the same name. Since 2004, ''Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)'' is the official name of the full corpus archive.

==Conception and composition==

The German Reference Corpus comprises fictional and academic texts, a large number of newspaper texts and several other text types. The texts cover the time range from around 1950 to the present.

In contrast to other well-known corpora and corpus archives (such as the [[British National Corpus]]), however, the German Reference Corpus is explicitly not designed as a ''balanced corpus'': The distribution of DeReKo texts across time or text types does not match some predefined percentages.

This conception complies with the fact that whether or not a given corpus constitutes a balanced or even representative language [[sample (statistics)|sample]] may only be assessed with respect to a specific language domain (i.e., the [[statistical population]]). Because different linguistic investigations generally aim at different language domains, the declared purpose of the German Reference Corpus is to serve as a versatile superordinate sample, or ''[[primordial sample]]'' (German: ''Ur-Stichprobe'') of contemporary written German, from which corpus users may draw a specialised subsample (a so-called ''[[virtual corpus]]'') to represent the language domain they wish to investigate.

==Access==

Due to copyright and licence restrictions, the DeReKo archive may not be copied nor offered for download. It can be queried and analyzed free of charge via the system ''COSMAS II'' - end-users are required to register by name and to agree to use the corpus data exclusively for non-commercial, academic purposes. ''COSMAS II'' enables users to compile from DeReKo a ''virtual corpus'' suitable for their specific research questions.

'''Ghari''' (also known as '''Gari''', '''Tangarare''', '''Sughu''', and '''West Guadalcanal''') is an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] spoken on [[Guadalcanal]] island of the [[Solomon Islands]].

The Vaturanga dialect has been used extensively in missionary and liturgical translations, leading linguist [[Arthur Capell]] to describe it as a mission/ecclesiastical language.

'''Home staging''' is the act of preparing a private residence for sale in the [[real estate]] marketplace. The goal of staging is to make a home appealing to the highest number of potential buyers, thereby selling a property more swiftly and for more money. Staging techniques focus on improving a property's appeal by transforming it into a welcoming, attractive product that anyone might want. People usually use arts, painting, accessories, lights, greenery, and carpet to stage the home, to give potential buyers a more attractive first impression of the property.&lt;ref name=KEY&gt;Holmes, Tamara E.: [http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/home-staging-key-to-selling-1.aspx "Home staging key to selling"] Bankrate.com, Real Estate Guide 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Sweden===
In Sweden, professional home staging, known as homestyling, became popular after 2000. Professional home stagers claim homestyling yields around 10% higher pricing compared to just cleaning the home.

===UK===
In Britain, home staging is sometimes referred to as property presentation or property styling. The techniques have been televised by home stylist [[Ann Maurice]] in the show ''[[House Doctor]]'' on [[Five (channel)|Five]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

===U.S.===
[[Image:Family-room-700.jpg|thumb|Home staged for resale - family room, kitchen]]
U.S. research states that home staging can reduce a listing's time on the market by one third to half, and could fetch as much as 6% to 20% more than an empty home or a home not properly staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staged Homes Sell Faster for Higher Prices|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/lifestyles/home-and-garden/staged-homes-sell-faster-for-higher-prices/article_29c2897b-eb12-5b12-8103-06bf7caeb807.html|publisher=nwi.com|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Icing''' on [[ship]]s is a serious hazard where cold [[temperature]]s (below about {{convert|-10|C|F|disp=or}}) combined with high [[wind speed]] (typically force 8 or above on the [[Beaufort scale]]) result in spray blown off the [[sea]] freezing immediately on contact with the ship. If not frequently knocked off, the [[ice]] can soon build up on the ship's superstructure to a sufficient weight to cause the ship to [[capsize]].

It is typically a problem in [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] seas, but can also occur in other seas such as the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], the [[Sea of Japan]], the [[Baltic Sea]], and very rarely, the [[North Sea]].

The '''Iu Mien''' language (Chinese: 勉語 or 勉方言; Thai: [[wikt:ภาษา|ภาษา]][[wikt:อิวเมี่ยน|อิวเมี่ยน]]) is the language spoken by the [[Iu Mien people]] in China (where they are considered a constituent group of the [[Yao people]]s), [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]] and, more recently, the United States in diaspora. Like other [[Hmong-Mien languages]], it is [[tonal language|tonal]] and [[monosyllabic language|monosyllabic]].

Linguists in China consider the dialect spoken in Changdong, [[Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County]], [[Guangxi]] to be the standard. This standard is also spoken by Iu Mien in the West, however, because most are [[refugees]] from [[Laos]], their dialect incorporates influences from the Lao and Thai languages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ium Ethnologue report for language code:ium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iu Mien has 78% [[lexical similarity]] with [[Kim Mun language|Kim Mun]] (Lanten), 70% with [[Biao-Jiao Mien language|Biao-Jiao Mien]], and 61% with [[Dzao Min language|Dzao Min]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

== Geographic distribution ==
In China, Iu Mien is spoken in the following counties (Mao 2004:302-303).&lt;ref&gt;毛宗武, 李云兵 / Mao Zongwu, Li Yunbing. 1997. 巴哼语研究 / Baheng yu yan jiu (A Study of Baheng [Pa-Hng]). Shanghai: 上海远东出版社 / Shanghai yuan dong chu ban she.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 130,000 speakers in [[Hunan province]] (known as the ''Xiangnan'' 湘南 dialect), and 400,000 speakers in Guangxi, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Jiangxi provinces (known as the ''Guangdian'' 广滇 dialect).

== Dialects ==
There are several known dialects of Iu Mien. Dialects vary by clan and geographic location.

In Vietnam, [[Dao people]] belonging to the Đại Bản, Tiểu Bản, Quần Chẹt, Ô Gang, Cóc Ngáng, and Cóc Mùn subgroups speak Iu Mien dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Phan Hữu Dật &amp; Hoàng Hoa Toàn. 1998.

== Phonology ==

=== Consonants ===

There are 31 cited consonant [[phonemes]] in Iu Mien. A distinguishing feature of Iu Mien consonants is the presence of voiceless nasals and laterals.

# The standard spelling system for Iu Mien does not represent the stop sounds in a way that corresponds to the IPA symbols, but instead uses e.g. {{angle bracket|t}}, {{angle bracket|d}}, and {{angle bracket|nd}} to represent {{IPA|/tʰ/, /t/, and /d/}}. This may stem from an attempt to model the Iu Mien spelling system on [[Pinyin]] (used to represent [[Mandarin Chinese]]), where {{angle bracket|t}} and {{angle bracket|d}} represent {{IPA|/tʰ/ and /t/}}.  The Pinyin influence is also seen in the use of {{angle bracket|c}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, and {{angle bracket|nz}} to represent the alveolar affricates {{IPA|/t͡sʰ/, /t͡s/, and /d͡z/}} and {{angle bracket|q}}, {{angle bracket|j}}, and {{angle bracket|nj}} for the postalveolar affricates {{IPA|/t͡ɕʰ/, /t͡ɕ/, and /d͡ʑ/}}.  Note also that the use of {{angle bracket|ng}} to represent the velar nasal {{IPA|/ŋ/}} means that it cannot also be used to represent {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, as would be predicted; instead, {{angle bracket|nq}} is used.
# According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20040821144929/http://crcl.th.net/sealex/Aumann_IuMienDict.pdf Aumann and Chengqian], in a certain Chinese dialect, the [[Voiced postalveolar affricate|postalveolar affricate]]s are instead [[palatal stop]]s (/cʰ/, /c/, /ɟ/).
# According to [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~dwbruhn/dwbruhn_iu-mien.pdf Daniel Bruhn], the voiceless nasals are actually sequences {{IPA|[h̃m], [h̃n], [h̃ŋ], and [h̃ɲ]}} (i.e. a short nasalized /h/ followed by a voiced nasal), while the voiceless lateral is actually a [[voiceless lateral fricative]] {{IPA|[ɬ]}}.
# Bruhn also observed that younger-generation Iu Mien Americans were more likely to substitute the voiceless [[nasal stop|nasals]] and voiceless [[lateral consonant|laterals]] with /h/ and the [[alveolo-palatal]] affricates with their corresponding [[palato-alveolar]] variants.

==== Onset ====
It appears that all single consonant phonemes except /ʔ/ can occur as the [[syllable onset|onset]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mienh.net/language/consonants.html mienh.net online lesson - Initial Consonants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101220225/http://mienh.net/language/consonants.html |date=2005-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhou 2003:259&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coda ====
Unlike [[Hmong language|Hmong]], which generally prohibits [[syllable coda|coda]] consonants, Iu Mien has seven single consonant phonemes that can take the coda position. These consonants are /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, [p̚], [t̚], [k̚], and /ʔ/. Some of the stops can only occur as final consonants when accompanied by certain [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]; for example, /ʔ/ only occurs with the tone {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|v}}.

Iu Mien vowels are represented in the Iu Mien United Script using combinations of the six letters, {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|e}}, {{angle bracket|i}}, {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}}, and {{angle bracket|r}}.

According to [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~dwbruhn/dwbruhn_iu-mien.pdf Bruhn], the [[monophthongs]] are {{angle bracket|i}}, {{angle bracket|u}}, {{angle bracket|e}}, {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|ai}}, {{angle bracket|er}}, {{angle bracket|ae}}, {{angle bracket|a}}, {{angle bracket|aa}}, and {{angle bracket|or}}. The [[diphthongs]] are {{angle bracket|ai}}, {{angle bracket|aai}}, {{angle bracket|au}}, {{angle bracket|aau}}, {{angle bracket|ei}}, {{angle bracket|oi}}, {{angle bracket|ou}}, {{angle bracket|eu}}. Furthermore, additional diphthongs and [[triphthongs]] can be formed from the aforementioned vowels through /i/- or /u/-on-gliding (having /i/ or /u/ before the vowel). Such vowels attested by Bruhn include {{angle bracket|ia}}, {{angle bracket|iaa}}, {{angle bracket|ie}}, {{angle bracket|io}}, {{angle bracket|iu}}, {{angle bracket|ior}}, {{angle bracket|iai}}, {{angle bracket|iaai}}, {{angle bracket|iau}}, {{angle bracket|iaau}}, {{angle bracket|iei}}, {{angle bracket|iou}}, {{angle bracket|ua}}, {{angle bracket|uaa}}, {{angle bracket|uae}}, {{angle bracket|ue}}, {{angle bracket|ui}}, {{angle bracket|uo}}, {{angle bracket|uai}}, {{angle bracket|uaai}}, and {{angle bracket|uei}}.

The dialect studied by Bruhn, and described in the above table, has a phoneme {{IPA|/ɛ/}} that does not have its own spelling, but is represented in various contexts either as {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|ai}} (which are also used for /e/ and {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, respectively).  In all cases where {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is spelled {{angle bracket|e}}, and nearly all cases where it is spelled {{angle bracket|ai}}, it does not contrast with /e/ or {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, respectively, and can be viewed as an allophone of these sounds.  The only potential exception appears to be when occurring as a syllable final by itself, where it has an extremely restricted distribution, occurring only 
after the [[palatal consonant|(alveolo-)palatal]] consonants {{IPA|/tɕ/, /dʑ/, and /ɲ/}}.  The sound {{IPA|/ɛ/}} may be a secondary development from {{IPA|/aɪ/}} in this context, although Bruhn does not discuss this issue.

=== Tones ===
Iu Mien is a [[tonal language]] with six observed [[tonemes]].

In the Iu Mien United Script (the language's most common writing system), tones are not marked with diacritics; rather, a word's tone is indicated by a special marker letter at the end of the word. If a word lacks a marker, then it is to be pronounced with a middle tone.

|-
|| ˨˧ || Low, rising || x || maai'''x''' || nightmare
|-
|| ˨˧/˨˧˨ || Lower, longer, rise-fall || z || maai'''z''' || to buy
|}

== Grammar ==
Iu Mien is an [[analytic language]] and lacks [[inflection]]. It is also a [[monosyllabic language]], with most of its [[lexicon]] consisting of one [[syllable]].

The language follows a [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] word order. Some other [[syntactic]] properties include the following:
* [[Adjectives]] usually follow [[nouns]].
* [[Question words]] like those meaning 'where' generally come at the end of sentences.
* The [[negation (linguistics)|negative word]] ''maiv'' (often shortened to ''mv'') may occur before verbs to negate them.
* A prevalence of [[contraction (grammar)|contractions]]. Some words consist of a contracted syllable followed by an uncontracted second syllable (in IMUS, these syllables are separated by [[apostrophes]]). One such example is ''ga'nyorc'' ("spider"), a contraction of ''gaeng-nyorc'' ("insect-spider").

== Writing system ==
In the past, the lack of an [[alphabet]] caused low rates of [[literacy]] amongst the Iu Mien speakers. It had been written with [[Chinese characters]] in China; however, this is extremely difficult for Iu Mien speakers from other countries such as [[Laos]] and from groups who now live in the West.

In an effort to address this, an Iu Mien Unified Script was created in 1984 using the Latin script, based on an earlier orthography developed in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iumien.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=1&amp;page=2]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Vietnamese language]], this alphabet does not use any diacritics to distinguish tones or different vowel sounds, and only uses the 26 letters of the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]. This orthography distinguishes 30 initials, 128 finals, and eight tones. Hyphens are used to link adjectives with the nouns they modify. The alphabet is similar to the [[Romanized Popular Alphabet|RPA]] used to write the [[Hmong language]] and the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] transcription scheme used for Chinese.

'''Khuzestani Arabic''' is a [[varieties of Arabic|dialect]] of Gelet (Southern) [[Mesopotamian Arabic]] spoken by the [[Iranian Arabs]] in [[Khuzestan Province]] of [[Iran]]. It has had a long history of contact with [[Persian language]], leading to several changes.&lt;ref name=convergence&gt;[http://languagecontact.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/McrLC/casestudies/MS.html Khuzestani Arabic: a case of convergence]&lt;/ref&gt; The main changes are in [[word order]], noun–noun and noun–adjective attribution constructions, definiteness marking, [[Complement (linguistics)|complement clauses]], and discourse markers and connectors.&lt;ref name=convergence/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shabibi&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Shabibi|first=Maryam |url=https://www.librarysearch.manchester.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44MAN_ALMA_DS21145389230001631&amp;context=L&amp;vid=MU_NUI&amp;search_scope=BLENDED&amp;tab=local&amp;lang=en_US|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.529368}}|title=Contact-induced grammatical changes in Khuzestani arabic|publisher=[[University of Manchester]]|year=2006|degree=PhD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khuzestani Arabic is only used in informal situations. It is not taught in school, not even as an optional course, although [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is taught.&lt;ref name=convergence/&gt;

==Phonology==
===Vowels===

===Consonants===

Even in the most formal of conventions, pronunciation depends upon a speaker's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Holes|2004|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the number and phonetic character of most of the 28 consonants has a broad degree of regularity among Arabic-speaking regions. Note that Arabic is particularly rich in [[uvular consonant|uvular]], [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]], and [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] ("[[emphatic consonant|emphatic]]") sounds. The emphatic [[coronal consonant|coronal]]s ({{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{IPA|/dˤ/}}, {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, and {{IPA|/ðˤ/}}) cause [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of emphasis to adjacent non-emphatic coronal consonants.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} The phonemes {{IPA|/p/}} ⟨[[Pe (Persian letter)|پ]]⟩ and {{IPA|/v/}} ⟨[[Ve (Arabic letter)|ڤ]]⟩ (not used by all speakers) are not considered to be part of the phonemic inventory, as they exist only in foreign words and they can be pronounced as {{IPA|/b/}} ⟨[[ب]]⟩ and {{IPA|/f/}} ⟨[[ف]]⟩ respectively depending on the speaker.&lt;ref name="TYA"&gt;Teach Yourself Arabic, by Jack Smart (Author), Frances Altorfer (Author)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wehr&gt;Hans Wehr, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' (transl. of ''Arabisches Wörterbuch für die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart'', 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonetic notes: 

*{{IPAslink|p}} and {{IPAslink|v}} occur mostly in borrowings from Persian, and may be assimilated to {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/f/}} in some speakers.
*{{IPA|/ɡ/}} is pronunciation of /{{IPA|q}}/ in Khuzestani Arabic and the rest of southern Mesopotamian dialects.
*The gemination of the flap /ɾ/ results in a trill /r/.

The '''''lachter''''' (also '''''Berglachter''''') was a common unit of length used in the [[mining]] industry in Europe, usually to measure depth, tunnel driving and the size of mining fields; it was also used for contract work. In most German-speaking mining fields it was the most important unit of length.

A ''lachter'' was roughly equal to the amount which a man could contain within his outstretched arms. It was thus similar to the ''[[klafter]]'' (ca. {{convert|1.8|m|ft|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), but was usually rather larger.

The lachter was - with regional differences - subdivided into ''Achtel'' (also called a ''Spann'', ''Gräpel'' or ''Gröbel''), (''Lachter)Zoll'', ''Primen'' (or ''Prinen'') and ''Sekunden'':

* 1 ''lachter'' = 8 ''Spann'' = 80 (''Lachter)Zoll'' = 800 ''Primen'' = 8,000 ''Sekunden''

In the 19th century a [[decimal|decimal system]] of subdivision was established:

* 1 ''lachter'' = 10 ''Lachterfuß'' = 100 ''Lachterzoll'' = 1,000 ''Lachterlinien''

Like other units of measure, the ''lachter'' varied in length depending on the region, but there could also be differences in length within the same region. In addition there could also be differences between various mining fields within a territory. The specification and use of conversion tables only makes sense if it is known for certain, where and at which times the values were valid. Some examples:

There are between sixty and seventy languages spoken in the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands archipelago]] as opposed to the nation state of [[Solomon Islands]], which covers a smaller area.&lt;ref&gt;''Ples Blong Iumi: Solomon Islands the Past Four Thousand Years'', Hugh Laracy (ed.),  University of the South Pacific, 1989, {{ISBN|982-02-0027-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lingua franca]] is [[Pijin]], and the official language is [[English language|English]].

== Language families ==
Most of the languages in the Solomon Islands are [[Austronesian languages]]. The [[Central Solomon languages]] such as [[Lavukaleve language|Lavukaleve]] constitute an independent family.

Two other language families are represented on [[Bougainville Island#Languages|Bougainville]], which is geographically part of the Solomon Islands, if not within the national boundaries.

The status of the [[Reefs – Santa Cruz languages]] were once thought to be non-Austronesian, but further research found them to be divergent Austronesian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ross &amp; Næss|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighbouring languages of [[Vanikoro languages|Vanikoro]] are also heavily relexified Austronesian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|François|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An indigenous sign language, [[Rennellese Sign Language]], has gone extinct.

The language spoken by the [[Lun Bawang]]s (or ''Lundayeh'') belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian]] family. The first published material written fully in the '''Lun Bawang language''' is a translation of the Bible in 1982, which is called ''Bala Luk Do''.&lt;ref name = "Peter Martin"&gt;

The Lun Bawang language is mainly an oral language. There is very little printed written material in this language that was not written by missionaries or linguists. The oral culture of the Lun Bawang people is changing though, with the accessibility of the Internet and Facebook. "Putoh" is an alternate name in East Kalimantan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasonlobel.com/52-1-Lobel-SouthwestSabahRevisited-OLJune2013-36to68.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahbubul Alam''' (1898–1981), was a [[Bangladesh]]i writer. 

==Early life==
Alam was born in Fatehpur, Chittagong, Bangladesh on May 1, 1898. His father was Moulavi Nasih Uddin and mother was Azimunnessa Begum.  He was the second son of his parents. Alam secured a job with the Government Registration Department and served until retirement in 1955 as an Inspector of Registrations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Alam,_Mahbub-ul|title=Alam, Mahbub-ul - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|access-date=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1917 he joined the 49th Bengali Paltan of British Indian Army, He served in the Signal Corps and Mahbub spent about three years at different stations in Mesopotamia (present day Iraq) before being finally released in 1920, when the Paltan was broken up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Works==
In Bangla prose, Alam is a writer of fiction and historian. His literary works were included in the curriculum of school level, secondary, higher secondary and graduation level [[Bengali Literature]] in Bangladesh.

===Novels=== 

''''''Mofizon''''''(after the name of the heroin): Mahbub Ul Alam can be said to have written one novella, titled ''Mofizon,''and one novel, '''''Momener Jabanbondi'''' '''Mofizon '''is on a theme of the suppressed libidinal instinct in human nature. This short fiction provides a bold treatment of feminine sexual arousal and suppression working simultaneously at a time when Bengali society was not ready for it. It was, therefore, criticised by the conservative section of the Muslim society, but Poet Sufia Kamal, a noted female contemporary writer of Mahbub's wrote very succinctly that everybody blamed ''"Mofizon"''but nobody understood Mofizon's pains. The superstitious male attitude towards marriage and women is also criticised in this novella. 
'''''Momener Jabanbandi'''''Mahbub's most well-known work, translated into English by Lila Roy as ''The Confession of a Believer'' is a novel—as the title suggests, on autobiographical elements—that portrays the central character as having gone through the continuous biting of the conscience mainly on moral grounds. As is Mahbub's habit to approach critical issues, the beginning of the novel contains a fictional discourse run by the child-protagonist about the existence of God. The later part of the novel shows the adult-protagonist as having overcome the temptation of seductive attractions from a married woman. This novel is rich in Mahbub's style of writing in bold, clear and precise sentences.

===Short story collections===
''Tajia'':(the name for the replica of Prophet's two grandsons' graves carried on vans in the streets by the mourning Muslims on the Ashura, 10th Muharram)is a collection of short-stories, which mainly deals with religious bigotry, while'''Pancha Anna'''''(meaning a co-mixture of themes), another volume, which has short stories dealing with supernaturalism, famine, domestic affairs and marriage. After his death, four volumes of humorous short stories were published, which are: ''''Pradhan Otithi and Taza Singhi Macher Jhol''''' (The chief guest and the gravy of the freshly cooked catfish), '''''Rongberong''''' (Varieties, ''"Paltan,"'' (Warfront), and ''Sat Satero'' (multiplicities).

===Other works===
''''''Paltan Jiboner Smriti''''''(Memories of the War Front) is the book with the publication of which in 1935 Mahbub arrived on the literary scene of the undivided Bengal. The book was first serialised in the monthly ''Mohammadi'' published from Kolkata, and it at once caught the attention of the readers for Mahbub's extraordinary verve in storytelling. Recollecting his days of war in Mesopotamia, Mahbub brings to life in bold humorous strokes his encounters with people in the kind of his Scottish boss, a lieutenant general, who presented him with a Robert Burns volume for his honesty, his co-mates and their pranks, cooks and guards of the camp, his sickness, the malaria epidemic in the quarters, and Iraqi date-tree gardens and their women. 
'''Gomf Sandesh''' (news about mustache)is a delightful reading, as all the stories in this book throw a mocking but serene blow at the complicated relationship between  Muslims and Hindus in the Bengal society. This book proves that Mahbub's major forte as writer lies in creating humour at the most unsuspecting moment.

'''Bangalir Muktijudhdher Itibritta''' (the complete history of the Liberation War of the Bengalis) is a mammoth task drawing up a documentary history of the Liberation War that ended in the creation of Bangladesh. A 670-page long 4-volume history, this book, compiled over two years by an elderly Mahbub at the age of 73 to 75, is often considered as the first documented history on the subject. Mahbub visited hundreds of villages all over Bangladesh and interviewed several hundred people to collect information about the guerrilla warfare as well as the conventional war. 
Another book along this line, titled '''Bangaleer Samorik Oitijhya''' (The Military Tradition of the Bengalis), published recently contains unpublished writings of Mahbub as well as old entries from '''Paltan Jiboner Smriti.'''

Besides, under a UNESCO project, Mahbub produced a number of books describing the flora and fauna of the then East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh) and their habitat. These picturesque books on plants, birds and animals of Bangladesh are, unfortunately, not available now.

==Personal life==
While Alam was studying at Chittagong College, he married his distant relative Julekha. She died leaving seven children behind (three of whom died as infants), and Alam then married Rahela Khatoon, who gave birth to eleven children, and survived him by 26 years. On retirement, Mahbub took interest in social welfare and published a weekly newspaper, titled "Zamana" (meaning the current days), which he later on converted into a daily. Mahbub died in his own house at Kazir Dewry, Chittagong on 7 August 1981. His American writer-friend Robert C. Hammock wrote a chapter on Mahbub in his book ''Below the Llano Estakado.''

'''Mlabri''' is a language spoken by the [[Mlabri people]] in the border area between [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]].

It is usually classified as a [[Khmuic languages|Khmuic language]], a subgroup of the [[Austroasiatic languages]]. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[Jørgen Rischel]] has studied the language and described its peculiarities in several works.  He divides the language into three varieties: one spoken by a small group in Laos and previously called ''Yumbri'', and two others spoken by larger groups in Thailand. They differ in [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and in [[lexicon]].

Although it is possible to count up to ten in Mlabri, only the numerals one and two may be used to modify a noun, and the word for 'two' has uses closer to 'pair' or 'couple' in English than a numeral.

==Phonology==
Mlabri distinguishes rounding in its [[back vowel]]s. It does not have the [[register (phonology)|register]] systems of some other Austroasiatic languages.

All vowels occur [[vowel length|long and short]]. /a/ is fronted after palato-alveolar consonants, and may approach {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. There is also a very short vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} that has limited distribution. Schwas occur in pre-tonic syllables, but may be [[epenthetic]]. There are several diphthongs. 

Consonants include the two implosive stops /ɓ/ and /ɗ/, attested in words such as ''ɓuʔ'' 'slow' and ''ɗɤŋ'' 'can'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baetscher|first=Kevin|year=2015|title=Mlabri|url=|journal=The Handbook of Austroasiatic Languages|volume=Volume 2|pages=1003-1030.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These apparent implosive stops could be analyzed as pre-glottalized stops, as pre-glottalization is also a used for sonorants. Consonants also include voiceless sonorants, as in ''m̥ɛʔ'' 'new', ''n̥taʔ'' 'tail', ''ŋ̊uh'' 'sit', ''l̥ak'' '(there is) none', or ''w̥ep'' 'shoulder'. Arguably, these could be analyzed as a sequence of /h/ and a sonorant.

{{IPA|/r̥/}} is only attested in [[minor syllable]]s. 

Mlabri has a different set of consonants which occur at the ends of syllables, including aspirated sonorants {{IPA|/lʰ, rʰ, jʰ/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}{{fix|text=are these voiceless or murmured?}} The second is a trill, and the third more post-alveolar than palatal. Other final consonants are {{IPA|/p t c k ʔ m n ɲ ŋ h l r j w/}}

'''Moravian dialects''' ({{lang-cs|moravská nářečí, moravština}}) are the [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Czech language|Czech]] spoken in [[Moravia]], a historical region in the southeast of the [[Czech Republic]]. There are more forms of the Czech language used in Moravia than in the rest of the Czech Republic. The main four groups of dialects are the Bohemian-Moravian group, the Central Moravian group, the Eastern Moravian group and the Lach (Silesian) group (which is also spoken in [[Czech Silesia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/igstema1.htm Forms of the Czech language (in Czech)] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AgyUUaOb?url=http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/igstema1.htm |date=2012-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the forms are generally viewed as regional variants of Czech, some [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]] (522,474 in the 2011 Census) claim them to be one separate '''Moravian language'''.&lt;ref name="census"/&gt;

Southeastern Moravian dialects form a [[dialect continuum]] with the closely related [[Slovak language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kortmann, Bernd |author2=van der Auwera, Johan |title=The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide|year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110220261|pages=516|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vi_VCm51kpkC&amp;pg=PA516&amp;lpg=PA516#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are thus sometimes viewed as dialects of Slovak rather than Czech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.translation-services-usa.com/czech-dialects.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, the language used in Slavic-speaking areas of Moravia was referred to as “Moravian” or as “Czech”. When regular censuses started in [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1880, the choice of main-communication languages&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang-de|Umgangssprache}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the forms prescribed in [[Cisleithania]] did not include Czech language but included the single item ''Bohemian–Moravian–Slovak''&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{lang-de|Böhmisch-Mährisch-Slowakisch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the others being ''German'', ''Polish'', ''Rusyn'', ''Slovene'', ''Serbo-Croatian'', ''Italian'', ''Romanian'' and ''Hungarian'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bruntal.net/2005061604-slonzaci-a-volkslista&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents who chose Bohemian–Moravian–Slovak as their main communicating language were counted in the Austrian censuses as [[Czechs]].

On the occasion of [[2011 Census of the Czech Republic]], several Moravian organizations (political party [[Moravané]] and [[Moravian National Community]] amongst others) led a campaign to promote the Moravian nationality and language. The [[Czech Statistical Office]] assured the Moravané party that filling in “Moravian” as language would not be treated as ticking off “Czech”, because forms were processed by a computer and superseding Czech for Moravian was technically virtually impossible.&lt;ref&gt;http://moravane.eu/ujisteni-csu-o-scitani-moravskeho-jazyka/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the results of the census, there was a total number of 108,469 native speakers of Moravian in 2011. Of them, 62,908 consider Moravian to be their only native language, and 45,561 are native speakers of both Moravian and Czech.&lt;ref name="census"/&gt;

== Dialects ==
While the former regional dialects of [[Bohemia]] have merged into one interdialect, [[Common Czech]] (with some small exceptions in borderlands), the territory of Moravia is still linguistically diversified. This may be due to absence of a single Moravian cultural and political centre (analogous to Prague in Bohemia) for most of the history,&lt;ref&gt;BLÁHA, Ondřej. Moravský jazykový separatismus: zdroje, cíle, slovanský kontext. In Studia Moravica. Acta Universitatis Palackianae Olomucensis Facultas Philosophica - Moravica. Olomouc : UP v Olomouci, 2005. ISSN 1801-7061. Svazek III.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the fact that both of its major cities—[[Brno]] and [[Olomouc]]—used to be predominantly inhabited by a German-speaking population. The most common classification distinguishes three major groups of Moravian dialects: Central Moravian (Hanakian), Eastern Moravian (Moravian-Slovak) and Silesian (Lach).&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James|title=Moravians in Prague: A Sociolinguistic Study of Dialect Contact in the Czech Republic|date=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some typical phonological differences between the Moravian dialects are shown below on the sentence ''‘Put the flour from the mill in the cart’'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koudela|first=Břetislav|title=Vývoj českého jazyka a dialektologie|year=1964|publisher=Československé státní pedagogické nakladatelství|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Moravian===
[[File:V Prostijově na renko.jpg|thumb|An inscription on the façade of [[Prostějov]] castle showing a poem written in Hanakian dialect]]
Central Moravian dialects, or [[Haná|Hanakian]] dialects (''Hanak dialects'', ''Haná dialects'', {{lang-cs|hanácké nářečí, hanáčtina}}), are spoken in the central part of Moravia around [[Znojmo]], [[Třebíč]], [[Brno]], [[Olomouc]], [[Přerov]], [[Zábřeh]] and [[Šumperk]]. While the Central Moravian group traditionally contained many dialects native to specific microregions, today's spoken language across Central Moravia is moving towards a unified "Common Hanakian dialect" ({{lang-cs|obecná hanáčtina}}).&lt;ref name=skulina&gt;{{cite web|last=Skulina|first=Josef|title=O šíření obecné hanáčtiny|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=5184#_ftn8|work=Naše řeč|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features of this group include

* A prevalence of the vowels ''e'' and ''é'' in place of ''i''/''y'' (''ryba'' &gt; ''reba'', ''život'' &gt; ''ževot''), ''í''/''ý'' (''mlýn'' &gt; ''mlén''), and ''ej'' (''nedělej'' &gt; ''nedělé'').&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Czech Dialects|url=http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/kuldanova/mapka_01.htm|work=2003|publisher=Katedry českého jazyka a literatury s didaktikou|accessdate=3 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201000809/http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/kuldanova/mapka_01.htm|archivedate=1 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''O'' and ''ó'' in place of ''u'' and ''ou'', respectively (''ruka'' &gt; ''roka'', ''mouka'' &gt; ''móka''). By extension, the third person plural ending of verbs which would be ''-í'' in standard Czech, and ''-ej(í)'' or ''-ou'' in Common Czech, is ''-ijó'', or sometimes just ''-ó'' in Central Moravian (''prosí/prosej(í)'' &gt; ''prosijó'', ''hrají/hrajou'' &gt; ''hrajijó/hrajó''). The instrumental ending ''-í'' is also replaced by ''-ó'' (''s naší kočkou'' &gt; ''s našó kočkó'').&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* The ending ''-a'' instead of ''-e'' for feminine nouns and possessive adjectives is retained, as in Slovak (e.g. ''naša slepica'' for Standard Czech ''naše slepice'').&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* The verb “to be” has the 1st person singular present tense form ''su'' rather than ''jsem''.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* In contrast to Common Czech, the ''-l'' on past tense verbs is always retained (''nesl'' and never ''nes'').&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

The dialects spoken in and around [[Brno]] have seen a lot of lexical influence from [[Hantec slang]], a jargon incorporating many German and Yiddish loanwords into the local Central Moravian dialect. Although by the 21st century the slang had greatly declined in use, some vocabulary from Hantec is still used commonly in everyday speech, for example ''šalina'' instead of ''tramvaj'' for “tram”, from German ''elektri'''schelinie'''''.

The Hanakian dialect has a literary presence. Writers who have written in Hanakian dialect include [[Alois Mrštík|Alois]] and [[Vilém Mrštík]], [[Ondřej Přikryl]] and [[Jakub Obrovský]]. Written Hanakian dialect often distinguishes between "wide" or "open" ''ê'' and ''ô'' (as in ''rêba'', ''rôka''), and "closed" ''e'' and ''o'', to reflect dialects which pronounce these two sounds differently.&lt;ref name="skulina"/&gt;

Požádal ji, aby šla za kmotru. Ona se nevymlouvala a hned ho oslovila „kmotříčku“, vzala chlapce na ruce a nesla ho do kostela. Chasníčka pokřtili, jak se patří.}}

Eastern Moravian dialects are transitional dialects between Czech and Slovak.&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web|title=Czech|url=http://lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?menu=004&amp;LangID=39|work=UCLA Language Materials Project|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are spoken in the strip of land extending from [[Břeclav]] to [[Hodonín]], [[Kyjov (Hodonín District)|Kyjov]], [[Uherské Hradiště]], [[Zlín]] and [[Vsetín]]. The Eastern group contains two dialects of specific interest, the [[Moravian Wallachia]]n dialect ({{lang-cs|valašské nářečí, valašština}}) and the [[Moravian Slovakia|Moravian-Slovak]] dialect ({{lang-cs|slovácké nářečí, moravská slovenština}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/igstema1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AgyUUaOb?url=http://www.osu.cz/fpd/kcd/dokumenty/cestinapositi/igstema1.htm |archivedate=2012-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Features of Eastern Moravian dialects include:

* The distinction between soft ''l'' and hard ''ł'' (pronounced [w]) is usually retained (''hlava'', ''dělat'' = ''hłava'', ''děłat''). By extension, the final ''-l'' in past tense verbs is often rendered ''-u''.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* ''aj'' sometimes retained instead of ''ej'' (''vejce'' = ''vajco'', ''dej'' = ''daj'').&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* In contrast to Common Czech, ''-ý-'' always prevails over ''-ej-'' (''dobrý'', ''strýc'' and never ''dobrej'', ''strejc'').&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* Infinitives end in ''-ť'' rather than ''-t'', as in Slovak (''být'' = ''býť'')
* The Moravian-Slovak dialect shares several other features with Slovak, including the use of the long [[ĺ]] and [[ŕ]] (''hloubka'' = ''hĺbka'', ''hrnout'' = ''ohŕňat'').&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* Wallachian dialects preserve the [[transgressive (linguistics)|present transgressive]], which is usually considered archaic in standard Czech aside from in a few arbitrary phrases.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

[[Lach dialects|Lachian dialects]] (''Lach dialects'', {{lang-cs|lašské nářečí, laština}}), spoken in north-eastern Moravia and the adjacent regions of Silesia around [[Opava]], [[Ostrava]], [[Frýdek-Místek]] and [[Frenštát pod Radhoštěm]], are transitional dialects sharing more features of [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref name="hannan lysohorsky"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hannan |first= Kevin |authorlink= Kevin Hannan |date=Winter 1996 |title= The Lachian Literary Language of Óndra Łysohorsky |journal= [[Slavic and East European Journal|The Slavic and East European Journal]] |volume= 40 |issue= 4 |pages= 726–743 |id= |quote= |doi= 10.2307/310109|jstor= 310109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Defining phonological features include loss of distinction between long and short vowels, a feature colloquially known as “krátký zobák” in Czech (“short beak”),&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; stress shifted to the penultimate syllable of the word, as in [[Polish phonology|Polish]], rather than the first syllable,&lt;ref name="hannan lysohorsky" /&gt; alveolar consonants ''d'', ''t'' and ''n'' often shifted to their palatal counterparts, and a distinction between “hard” ([[post-alveolar]] or [[retroflex]]) ''š'', ''ž'', ''č'' and “soft” ([[alveolo-palatal]]) ''ś'', ''ź'', ''ć'', as in Polish.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Silesian dialects also contain many [[German language|German]] loanwords unfamiliar to other Czech dialects. The Lachian dialects are closely related to the [[Cieszyn Silesian dialect]], spoken in the area around [[Karviná]], [[Český Těšín]] and [[Třinec]] as well as on the Polish side of the border.

===Bohemian-Moravian dialects===
Bohemian-Moravian dialects, or South-eastern Bohemian dialects, spoken in the [[Bohemian-Moravian Highlands]] in western Moravia around [[Dačice]], [[Jihlava]] and [[Žďár nad Sázavou]] are a transitional group between dialects of Bohemia and Moravia, sharing some features in common with [[Common Czech]] and others more in common with Central Moravian.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

===Phonology===

Moravian dialects preserve numerous archaic phonological features that are no longer used in contemporary Czech, but can still be found in many other Slavic languages. The following tables list selected cognates, pointing out the archaisms and showing their equivalents in the other languages:

===Grammar===

While Moravian grammar tends to be similar to [[Czech grammar]], there are some defining features. For instance, Moravian dialects apply a uniform pattern to the 3rd person plural ending of class IV ''-it'' verbs, and class III ''-et'' verbs, which in standard Czech traditionally varied in an unintuitive fashion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bermel|first=Neil|title=Linguistic Authority, Language Ideology, and Metaphor: The Czech Orthography Wars|year=2007|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=3110188260|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Standard Czech (infinitive) !! Haná dialect !! Moravian-Slovak dialect !! meaning
|-
| pros'''í''' (inf. prosit) || prosijó || prosijú || they beg
|-
| trp'''í''' (inf. trpět) || trpijó, trpějó || trpijú, trpějú || they suffer 
|-
| sáz'''ejí''' (inf. sázet) || sázijó, sázejó || sázijú, sázejú || they sow 
|}

Moravian dialects also occasionally use [[preposition]]s in a different fashion to Standard and Common Czech, usually mirroring usage in Slovak (e.g. ''něco '''k''' jídlu'' &gt; ''něco '''na''' jídlo'' for "something to eat", {{lang-sk|niečo na jedlo}}) or Polish (e.g. ''pojď '''ke''' mně'' &gt; ''choď '''do''' mě'', for "come to me", {{lang-pl|chodź do mnie}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ertl|first=Václav|title=K smrti, k jídlu, k pláči, k dostání a pod.|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=2227|work=Naše řeč|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standardisation ==
Since the end of the 20th century, the private association Moravian Language Institute (''Ústav jazyka moravského''), founded by waiter and amateur linguist Jan Kozohorský, has made attempts to [[literary standard|standardise]] a literary Moravian language. The movement has been criticised by linguistics professors at [[Masaryk University in Brno]] as controversial and with strong political undertones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brnensky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/moravane-tvori-spisovnou-moravstinu20081112.html|title=Moravané tvoří spisovnou moravštinu|author=|date=12 November 2008|website=denik.cz|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Zealand Sign Language''' or '''NZSL''' ({{lang-mi|Te Reo Rotarota}}) is the main language of the [[Deaf culture|deaf community]] in [[New Zealand]]. It became an [[official language]] of New Zealand in April 2006, alongside [[New Zealand English|English]] and [[Māori language|Māori]]. However, the rights and obligations to use the language are restricted to court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0018/latest/whole.html|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Sign Language has its roots in [[British Sign Language]] (BSL), and may be technically considered a dialect of [[BANZSL|British, Australian and New Zealand Sign Language]] (BANZSL). There are 62.5% similarities found in British Sign Language and NZSL, compared with 33% of NZSL signs found in [[American Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;McKee, D. and G. Kennedy. 2000. "Lexical Comparisons of Signs from American, Australian, British, and New Zealand Sign Languages" In K. Emmorey &amp; H. Lane (eds) The Signs of Language Revisited: An Anthology to Honor Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima , New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other natural [[sign language]]s, it was devised by and for [[deaf]] people, with no linguistic connection to a spoken or [[written language]].

It uses the same [[two-handed manual alphabet]] as BSL (British Sign Language) and [[Auslan]] (Australian Sign Language).

It uses more lip-patterns in conjunction with hand and facial movement to cue signs than BSL, reflecting New Zealand's history of [[oralism|oralist]] education of deaf people. Its [[vocabulary]] includes [[Māori people|Māori]] concepts such as [[marae]] and [[Maori culture|tangi]], and signs for New Zealand placenames. (E.g. [[Rotorua]] - mudpools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rotorua - NZSL Online|url=http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/signs/5385|website=The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language|publisher=Deaf Studies Research Unit, Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wellington]] - windy breeze{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}, [[Auckland]] - [[Sky Tower (Auckland)|Sky Tower]]{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}, [[Christchurch]] - 2 Cs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christchurch - NZSL Online|url=http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/signs/4214|website=The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language|publisher=Deaf Studies Research Unit, Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents ChCh.)

==History==
The first non-Polynesian immigrants to New Zealand were from Britain, and those who were deaf brought [[British Sign Language]] with them. The first known teacher of sign language was Dorcas Mitchell, who taught the children of one family in Charteris Bay, [[Lyttelton Harbour]], from 1868 to 1877. By 1877 she had taught 42 pupils.

When the first school for the deaf (then called the Sumner [[Deaf-mute|Deaf and Dumb]] Institution) was opened at Sumner, south east of Christchurch in 1878, Mitchell applied unsuccessfully for the position of principal. Instead it went to Gerrit Van Asch, who agreed with the Milan congress of deaf educators of 1880 (to which no deaf people were invited) that teaching should be oral only, and that sign language should be forbidden. (He would not even admit pupils who could sign, so only 14 were admitted.) This was the policy of the school until 1979. A [[documentary film]] about the school made in the 1950s makes no mention of sign language. Similar policies were maintained at the schools at Titirangi and Kelston that opened in 1940 and 1958.

Unsurprisingly, the children used sign language secretly and after leaving school, developing NZSL out of British Sign Language largely without adult intervention for over 100 years. The main haven for NZSL was the Deaf Clubs in the main centres. In 1979, "Total Communication" (a "use anything that works" philosophy) was adopted at the Sumner School, but the signing it used was "Australasian Sign Language" an artificial [[signed English|signed form of English]]. As a result, younger signers use a number of Australasian signs in their NZSL, to such an extent that some call traditional NZSL "Old Sign". NZSL was adopted for teaching in 1994.

In 1985, Marianne Ahlgren proved in her [[PhD]] [[thesis]] at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] that NZSL is a fully-fledged
language, with a large vocabulary of signs and a consistent grammar of space.

The New Zealand Sign Language Teachers Association (NZSLTA - formerly known as the New Zealand Sign Language Tutors Association) was set up in 1992. Over the next few years [[adult education]] classes in NZSL began in several centres. In 1997 a Certificate in Deaf Studies programme was started at Victoria University of Wellington, with instruction actually in NZSL, designed to teach deaf people how to competently teach NZSL to the wider public. Also in 1992 an interpreter training programme was established at the Auckland Institute of Technology, now known as [[Auckland University of Technology]]. This programme was first directed and taught by Dr Rachel Locker McKee (hearing) and Dr David McKee (deaf) and came about due to lobbying by the New Zealand Deaf Community and others who recognised the need for safer and more professional interpreting services.  They had as early as 1984 sought support for more research to determine the need for sign language interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;Dugdale, Patricia (2001). Talking Hands, Listening Eyes. Deaf Association of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; Other than a one-off course run in 1985, this was the first time a professional training programme with a qualification was offered in New Zealand. Many of those who have gone on to work as professional NZSL interpreters began their journey in NZSL community classes taught by members of the NZSLTA.

An important step toward the recognition of NZSL was the publication in 1998 of a comprehensive NZSL [[dictionary]] by Victoria University of Wellington and the Deaf Association of NZ. It contains some 4000 signs (which correspond to many more meanings than the same number of English words, because of the way signs can be modulated in space and time), sorted by handshape, not English meaning, and coded in the Hamburg Notational System, [[HamNoSys]], as well as pictorially.  In 2011, Victoria University launched an Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzsl.vuw.ac.nz/|title=The Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language - NZSL Online|website=nzsl.vuw.ac.nz|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the original 1998 work, which includes video clips of each sign with examples and the ability to search for signs based on features of the sign (handshape, location, etc.) as well as the sign's English gloss.

For some years, [[TVNZ]] broadcast a weekly news programme, "News Review", interpreted in NZSL. This was discontinued in 1993 after a joint survey of deaf and [[Hearing impairment|hearing-impaired]] people found a majority favoured captioned programmes. Many Deaf people felt they had been misled by the survey. There has been no regular programming in NZSL since.

Between August 2012 to August 2013 the Human Rights Commission carried out an inquiry into the use and promotion of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). The inquiry has focused on working with key government agencies and the Deaf community around the inquiry's three terms of reference 1) The right to education for Deaf people and potential users of NZSL. 2) The rights of Deaf people, and other potential users of NZSL, to access communication, information and services, and the right to freedom of expression and opinion, through the provision of professional NZSL interpreter services and other NZSL services and resources. 3) The promotion and maintenance of NZSL as an official language of New Zealand. The full report of the inquiry, ''A New Era in the Right to Sign'', was launched in Parliament by the Minister for Disability Issues, Tariana Turia, on 3 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/people-disabilities/our-work/right-sign/|title=Human Rights Commission :: The Right to Sign: New Zealand Sign Language and Human Rights|website=www.hrc.co.nz|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official language status==
NZSL became the third [[Languages of New Zealand|official language of New Zealand]] in April 2006, joining English and Māori.  The parliamentary bill to approve this passed its [[Reading (legislature)|third reading]] on April 6, 2006.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_696482"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/488120/696482 |title=Recognition for sign language |date=6 April 2006 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the first reading in Parliament, on June 22, 2004, the bill was supported by all political parties. It was referred to the Justice and Electoral Committee, which reported back to the House on July 18, 2005. The second reading passed 119 to 2 on February 23, 2006 with only the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party opposing because the government is not providing funding for NZSL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard.parliament.govt.nz/hansard/Final/FINAL_2006_03_23.htm#_Toc131830390 Hansard 20060323] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007223547/http://www.hansard.parliament.govt.nz/hansard/Final/FINAL_2006_03_23.htm |date=2007-10-07 }}. Accessed 2007-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt; It passed the third reading on April 6, 2006 with the same margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansard.parliament.govt.nz/hansard/Final/FINAL_2006_04_06.htm#_Toc137032777 Hansard 20060406] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007223339/http://www.hansard.parliament.govt.nz/hansard/Final/FINAL_2006_04_06.htm |date=2007-10-07 }}. Accessed 2007-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill received [[Royal Assent]], a constitutional formality, on 10 April 2006.&lt;ref name="assent"&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0604/S00186.htm Governor-General gives assent to Sign Language Bill], Press Release: [[Governor-General|Governor General]], 10 April 2006. Retrieved 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand Sign Language became an official language of New Zealand the day after Royal Assent.

The use of NZSL as a valid [[medium of instruction]] has not always been accepted by the Government, the Association of Teachers of the Deaf, or many parents. However, in light of much research into its validity as a language and much advocacy by deaf adults, parents of deaf children (both hearing and deaf) and educationalists, NZSL has since become — in tandem with English — part of the bilingual/bicultural approach used in public schools (including [[Kelston Deaf Education Centre]] and [[Van Asch Deaf Education Centre]]) since 1994.  [[Victoria University of Wellington]] has courses in New Zealand Sign Language, although it has yet to develop a [[Academic major|major]] program for it. AUT teaches a Bachelor course for NZSL interpreting.

==Variants==
Differences in lexicon in New Zealand Sign Language have largely developed through the student communities surrounding five schools for the deaf in New Zealand:
	 
*[[Van Asch Deaf Education Centre]] (former Sumner School for the Deaf), opened 1880 ([[Christchurch]])	
*[[St Dominic's School for the Deaf]], opened 1944 in [[Wellington]], moved to Feilding in 1953
*[[Titirangi School for the Deaf]], opened 1942 and closed in the end of 1959 (when the classes opened at Kelston, Titirangi became a boarding house)
* Mt Wellington School for the Deaf opened (due to overflow at Titirangi) 1952 and closed in the end of 1959 - when the classes opened at Kelston, Mt Wellington became boarding house.
*[[Kelston Deaf Education Centre|Kelston School for the Deaf]], opened 1958 ([[Auckland]]) and Kelston School for the Deaf Children was renamed in 1991 to Kelston Deaf Education Centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6286">'''Nikolai Vladimirovich Nekrasov''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Владимирович Некрасов}}) (18 December 1900—4 October 1938) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Esperanto]] writer, translator, and critic.

== Biography ==

Nekrasov was born in [[Moscow]]. A journalist, he worked in the publishing house ''Moscow worker''. He learned Esperanto in 1915.

=== Esperanto activity, editorial work, and articles ===

In 1918–19, he was president of the ''Tutrusia Ligo de junaj esperantistoj'' (All-Russia League of Young Esperantists), and editor and typesetter of ''Juna Mondo'' (''Young World''). On 1 June 1922 Nekrasov together with [[Gregory Demidyuk]] founded the cultural review ''[[La Nova Epoko]]'' (''The New Epoch''), which became one of the organs of [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda|SAT]]. In 1923 he became a member of the Central Committee of [[Sovetlanda Esperantista Unuiĝo]] (SEU) (ru: Soyuz Esperantistov Sovetskikh Stran), then under the leadership of [[Ernest Drezen]].

He was especially concerned with the history and criticism of Esperanto literature, the ideology of the proletarian revolutionary Esperanto movement, the nationality problem &lt;!-- nation problem --&gt;and [[cosmoglottics]]. In ''La Nova Epoko'' he published several essays on [[Esperanto literature]] (about [[Julio Baghy|Baghy]], [[Hendrik Bulthuis|Bulthuis]], [[Teodor Jung|Jung]], [[Nikolai Hohlov|Hohlov]], [[Evgeny Mikhalski|Mikhalski]], Devkin, Schulhof, and others). His critiques set out mainly from an original sociological viewpoint, but he simultaneously paid much attention to the use of language in the works.

In the early 1930s he actively participated in the compilation and preparation of material on literature for the ''[[Enciklopedio de Esperanto]]''. He also published many of [[L. L. Zamenhof|Zamenhof]]'s letters.

In 1931 he was one of the cofounders of [[IAREV]] (''International Association of Revolutionary Esperanto Writers''), and edited its first newspaper, ''[[La Nova Etapo]]'' (''The New Stage'').

=== Arrest, execution, and rehabilitation ===

Nekrasov was arrested in 1938, and accused of being "an organizer and leader of a fascist, espionage, terrorist organization of Esperantists". For this crime he was shot to death on 4 October 1938. His archive and library were obliterated; presumably many of his unpublished works and translations thus perished.

He was posthumously rehabilitated as innocent on 26 November 1957.

== Works ==

=== Translated poetry ===

*''Kupra rajdanto'' (''Copper rider'') by [[Aleksandr Pushkin|Pushkin]].
*''Eŭgeno Onegin'' (''[[Eugene Onegin]]'') by [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], [[Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda|SAT]], 1931.

*''Tra USSR per Esperanto'' (Through the USSR by means of Esperanto)
* Several essays on Esperanto-literaturo in ''[[La Nova Epoko]]''  (in Esperanto)

Nekrasov believed that in his original poems he followed the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian symbolist poets]], especially [[Valery Bryusov|Bryusov]], and so he took special care with the purity of his language style. It is known that the largest of his original works was the grand poem "Kazanovo" (en:''Casanova'') — which according to the impressions of those who read the manuscript, was at a very high level poetically. At least one copy of the manuscript still existed in the beginning of the 1960s, but later disappeared without a trace.

'''Old Chinese''', also called '''Archaic Chinese''' in older works, is the oldest attested stage of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and the ancestor of all modern [[varieties of Chinese]].{{efn|The time interval assigned to Old Chinese varies between authors.
Some scholars limit it to the early [[Zhou period]], based on the availability of documentary evidence of the phonology.
Many include the whole Zhou period and often the earliest written evidence from the late [[Shang period]], while some also include the Qin, Han and occasionally even later periods.{{sfnp|Tai|Chan|1999|pp=225–233}}
The ancestor of the oldest layer of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects is believed to have split off during the Han period.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=33}}}} The earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on [[oracle bone]]s from around 1250&amp;nbsp;BC, in the late [[Shang dynasty]]. [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze inscriptions]] became plentiful during the following [[Zhou dynasty]]. The latter part of the Zhou period saw a flowering of literature, including [[Four Books and Five Classics|classical works]] such as the ''[[Analects]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', and the ''[[Zuo zhuan|Zuozhuan]]''. These works served as models for [[Literary Chinese]] (or Classical Chinese), which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century, thus preserving the vocabulary and grammar of late Old Chinese.

Old Chinese was written with an early form of [[Chinese characters]], with each character representing a monosyllabic word.
Although the script is not alphabetic, most characters were created by adapting a character for a similar-sounding word.
Scholars have used the phonetic information in the script and the rhyming practice of ancient poetry to reconstruct [[Old Chinese phonology]], corresponding roughly to the [[Western Zhou]] period in the early part of the 1st&amp;nbsp;millennium BC.
Although many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differed from [[Middle Chinese]] in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids. Most recent reconstructions also describe Old Chinese as a language without tones, but having consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, which [[tonogenesis|developed]] into [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] distinctions in Middle Chinese.

Most researchers trace the core vocabulary of Old Chinese to [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], with much early borrowing from neighbouring languages.
During the Zhou period, the originally monosyllabic vocabulary was augmented with polysyllabic words formed by [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] and [[reduplication]]. Several [[derivational affix]]es have also been identified. However the language lacked [[inflection]], and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and [[grammatical particle]]s.

== Classification ==
Middle Chinese and its southern neighbours [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] and the [[Vietic languages|Vietic]] branch of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] have similar tone systems, syllable structure, grammatical features and lack of inflection, but these are believed to be [[areal feature]]s spread by diffusion rather than indicating common descent.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=8–12}}{{sfnp|Enfield|2005|pp=186–193}}
The most widely accepted hypothesis is that Chinese belongs to the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]], together with [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] and many other languages spoken in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Southeast Asian Massif]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=12–13}}
The evidence consists of some hundreds of proposed cognate words,{{sfnp|Coblin|1986|pp=35–164}} including such basic vocabulary as the following:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=13}}

Although the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]].{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=422}}
Although Old Chinese is by far the earliest attested member of the family, its logographic script does not clearly indicate the pronunciation of words.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=14}}
Other difficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact.
In addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, including several sensitive border zones.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=434–436}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=15–16}}

Initial consonants generally correspond regarding [[place of articulation|place]] and [[manner of articulation]], but [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] and [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]] are much less regular, and prefixal elements vary widely between languages.
Some researchers believe that both these phenomena reflect lost [[minor syllable]]s.{{sfnp|Coblin|1986|p=11}}{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=425–426}}
[[Proto-Tibeto-Burman]] as reconstructed by [[Paul K. Benedict|Benedict]] and [[James Matisoff|Matisoff]] lacks an aspiration distinction on initial stops and affricates.
Aspiration in Old Chinese often corresponds to pre-initial consonants in Tibetan and [[Lolo-Burmese]], and is believed to be a Chinese innovation arising from earlier prefixes.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=58–63}}
Proto-Sino-Tibetan is reconstructed with a six-vowel system as in recent reconstructions of Old Chinese, with the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] distinguished by the merger of the mid-central vowel {{IPA|*-ə-}} with {{IPA|*-a-}}.{{sfnp|Gong|1980|pp=476–479}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=2, 105}}
The other vowels are preserved by both, with some alternation between {{IPA|*-e-}} and {{IPA|*-i-}}, and between {{IPA|*-o-}} and {{IPA|*-u-}}.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=110–117}}

The earliest known written records of the Chinese language were found at the [[Yinxu]] site near modern [[Anyang]] identified as the last capital of the [[Shang dynasty]], and date from about 1250&amp;nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=1}} These are the [[oracle bone]]s, short inscriptions carved on tortoise [[plastron]]s and ox [[scapula]]e for divinatory purposes, as well as a few brief [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronze inscriptions]]. The language written is undoubtedly an early form of Chinese, but is difficult to interpret due to the limited subject matter and high proportion of proper names. Only half of the 4,000&amp;nbsp;characters used have been identified with certainty. Little is known about the grammar of this language, but it seems much less reliant on [[grammatical particle]]s than Classical Chinese.{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|pp=88–89}}

From early in the [[Western Zhou]] period, around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, the most important recovered texts are bronze inscriptions, many of considerable length. Even longer pre-Classical texts on a wide range of subjects have also been transmitted through the literary tradition. The oldest parts of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and the ''[[I Ching]]'' also date from the early Zhou period, and closely resemble the bronze inscriptions in vocabulary, syntax, and style.
A greater proportion of this more varied vocabulary has been identified than for the oracular period.{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|p=89}}

The four centuries preceding the unification of China in 221&amp;nbsp;BC (the later [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]]) constitute the Chinese classical period in the strict sense.
There are many bronze inscriptions from this period, but they are vastly outweighed by a rich literature written in ink on [[bamboo and wooden slips]] and (toward the end of the period) silk.
Although these are perishable materials, and many books were destroyed in the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]] in the [[Qin dynasty]], other texts have been transmitted as copies. Such works from this period as the ''[[Analects]]'', the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'' have been admired as models of prose style since the [[Han dynasty]]. The [[Classical Chinese]] of such works formed the basis of Literary Chinese, which remained the written standard until the early twentieth century.{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|p=90}}

{{main article|Chinese characters}}
Each character of the script represented a single Old Chinese word.
Most scholars believe that these words were monosyllabic, though some have recently suggested that a minority of them had [[minor syllable|minor presyllable]]s.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=58}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=50–53}}
The development of these characters follows the same three stages that characterized [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Mesopotamia]]n [[cuneiform script]] and the [[Maya script]].{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=52–72}}{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|p=109}}

Some words could be represented by pictures (later stylized) such as {{linktext|日|lang=zh-Hant}} ''rì'' "sun", {{linktext|人|lang=zh-Hant}} ''rén'' "person" and {{linktext|木|lang=zh-Hant}} ''mù'' "tree, wood", by abstract symbols such as {{linktext|三|lang=zh-Hant}} ''sān'' "three" and {{linktext|上|lang=zh-Hant}} ''shàng'' "up", or by composite symbols such as {{linktext|林|lang=zh-Hant}} ''lín'' "forest" (two trees).
About 1,000 of the oracle bone characters, nearly a quarter of the total, are of this type, though 300 of them have not yet been deciphered.
Though the pictographic origins of these characters are apparent, they have already undergone extensive simplification and conventionalization.
Evolved forms of most of these characters are still in common use today.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=36}}{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=52–57}}

Next, words that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were signified by borrowing characters of pictorial origin representing similar-sounding words (the "[[rebus]] strategy"):{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=59–62}}{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|pp=114–118}}
* The word ''lì'' "tremble" was originally written with the character {{linktext|栗|lang=zh-Hant}} for ''lì'' "chestnut".&lt;ref name="GSR 403"&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 403; {{harvp|Boltz|1999|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pronoun and modal particle ''qí'' was written with the character {{linktext|其|lang=zh-Hant}} originally representing ''jī'' "winnowing basket".&lt;ref name="GSR 952"&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 952; {{harvp|Norman|1988|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with {{linktext|毋|lang=zh-Hant}} ''wú'' "don't", a borrowing of {{linktext|母|lang=zh-Hant}} ''mǔ'' "mother".{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|p=36}}
Later, phonetic loans were systematically disambiguated by the addition of semantic indicators, usually to the less common word:
* The word ''lì'' "tremble" was later written with the character {{linktext|慄|lang=zh-Hant}}, formed by adding the symbol {{linktext|⺖|lang=zh-Hant}}, a variant of {{linktext|心|lang=zh-Hant}} ''xīn'' "heart".&lt;ref name="GSR 403"/&gt;
* The less common original word ''jī'' "winnowing basket" came to be written with the compound {{linktext|箕|lang=zh-Hant}}, obtained by adding the symbol {{linktext|竹|lang=zh-Hant}} ''zhú'' "bamboo" to the character.&lt;ref name="GSR 952"/&gt;
Such phono-semantic compound characters were already used extensively on the oracle bones, and the vast majority of characters created since then have been of this type.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=67–72}}
In the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'', a dictionary compiled in the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century, 82% of the 9,353&amp;nbsp;characters are classified as phono-semantic compounds.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=36–37}}
In the light of the modern understanding of Old Chinese phonology, researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds also have a phonetic nature.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=147–149}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2009|pp=31–32, 35}}

These developments were already present in the oracle bone script,{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|p=110}} possibly implying a significant period of development prior to the extant inscriptions.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=58}}
This may have involved writing on perishable materials, as suggested by the appearance on oracle bones of the character {{linktext|册|lang=zh-Hant}} ''cè'' "records".
The character is thought to depict bamboo or wooden strips tied together with leather thongs, a writing material known from later archaeological finds.{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|p=107}}

Development and simplification of the script continued during the pre-Classical and Classical periods, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=61–62}}
The language developed compound words, so that characters came to represent [[morpheme]]s, though almost all morphemes could be used as independent words.
Hundreds of morphemes of two or more syllables also entered the language, and were written with one phono-semantic compound character per syllable.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=171–172}}
During the [[Warring States period]], writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states.
The most conservative script prevailed in the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], which would later impose its standard on the whole of China.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=62–63}}

==Phonology==
{{main article|Old Chinese phonology|Reconstructions of Old Chinese}}
Old Chinese phonology has been reconstructed using a variety of evidence, including the phonetic components of Chinese characters, rhyming practice in the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and [[Middle Chinese]] reading pronunciations described in such works as the ''[[Qieyun]]'', a [[rhyme dictionary]] published in 601&amp;nbsp;AD.
Although many details are still disputed, recent formulations are in substantial agreement on the core issues.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2009|p=x}}
For example, the Old Chinese initial consonants recognized by [[Li Fang-Kuei]] and [[William H. Baxter|William Baxter]] are given below, with Baxter's (mostly tentative) additions given in parentheses:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Li|1974–1975|p=237}}; {{harvp|Norman|1988|p=46}}; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|pp=188–215}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various initial clusters have been proposed, especially clusters of {{IPA|*s-}} with other consonants, but this area remains unsettled.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=222–232}}

Most scholars posit optional medials {{IPA|*-r-}}, {{IPA|*-j-}} and the combination {{IPA|*-rj-}} as the origin of the retroflex and palatal [[obstruent]]s of Middle Chinese, as well as many of its vowel contrasts.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=235–236}}
However, the palatal medial {{IPA|*-j-}} has been challenged on a number of grounds, and a variety of different realizations for this distinction have been used in recent constructions.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=95}}{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|p=43}}

Reconstructions since the 1980s usually propose six&amp;nbsp;[[vowel]]s:{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=180}}{{efn|The vowel here written as {{IPA|*ə}} is treated as {{IPA|*ɨ}}, {{IPA|*ə}} or {{IPA|*ɯ}} by different authors.}}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 9em; text-align: center;"
| {{IPA|*i}} || {{IPA|*ə}} || {{IPA|*u}}
|-
| {{IPA|*e}} || {{IPA|*a}} || {{IPA|*o}}
|}
which contrasts with the four-vowel system proposed by Li Fang-kuei and maintained by Gong, Ting, and Hwang:{{sfnp|Li|1980}}{{sfnp|Gong|2002}}{{sfnp|Ting|1998}}{{sfnp|Hwang|2012}}
{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; width: 9em; text-align: center;"
| {{IPA|*i}} || || {{IPA|*u}}
|-
|  || {{IPA|*ə}} ||
|-
|  || {{IPA|*a}} || 
|}
Nevertheless, both systems are broadly in agreement once Li's three diphthongs /ia iə ua/ are accounted for.{{sfnp|Gong|1978}}{{sfnp|Handel|1997|p=100}}
Vowels could optionally be followed by the same codas as in Middle Chinese: a glide {{IPA|*-j}} or {{IPA|*-w}}, a nasal {{IPA|*-m}}, {{IPA|*-n}} or {{IPA|*-ŋ}}, or a stop {{IPA|*-p}}, {{IPA|*-t}} or {{IPA|*-k}}.  Some scholars also allow for a labiovelar coda {{IPA|*-kʷ}}.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=291}}
Most scholars now believe that Old Chinese lacked the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s found in later stages of the language, but had optional post-codas {{IPA|*-ʔ}} and {{IPA|*-s}}, which developed into the Middle Chinese rising and departing tones respectively.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=181–183}}

==Grammar==
{{see also|Classical Chinese grammar}}
Little is known of the grammar of the language of the Oracular and pre-Classical periods, as the texts are often  of a ritual or formulaic nature, and much of their vocabulary has not been deciphered. In contrast, the rich literature of the [[Warring States period]] has been extensively analysed.{{sfnp|Herforth|2003|p=59}} Having no [[inflection]], Old Chinese was heavily reliant on word order, [[grammatical particle]]s, and inherent [[word class]]es.{{sfnp|Herforth|2003|p=59}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=12}}

=== Word classes ===
Classifying Old Chinese words is not always straightforward, as words were not marked for function, word classes overlapped, and words of one class could sometimes be used in roles normally reserved for a different class.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=87–88}} The task is more difficult with written texts than it would have been for speakers of Old Chinese, because the derivational morphology is often hidden by the writing system.{{sfnp|Herforth|2003|p=60}}{{sfnp|Aldridge|2013|pp=41–42}} For example, the verb {{IPA|*sək}} "to block" and the derived noun {{IPA|*səks}} "frontier" were both written with the same character {{linktext|塞|lang=zh-Hant}}.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=136}}

[[Personal pronoun]]s exhibit a wide variety of forms in Old Chinese texts, possibly due to dialectal variation.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=89}}
There were two groups of first-person pronouns:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=89}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=76}}
# {{IPA|*ljaʔ}} {{linktext|予|lang=zh-Hant}}, {{IPA|*lja}} {{linktext|余|lang=zh-Hant}}, {{IPA|*ljə}} {{linktext|台|lang=zh-Hant}} and {{IPA|*lrjəmʔ}} {{linktext|朕|lang=zh-Hant}}
# {{IPA|*ŋa}} {{linktext|吾|lang=zh-Hant}} and {{IPA|*ŋajʔ}} {{linktext|我|lang=zh-Hant}}

In the oracle bone inscriptions, the {{IPA|*l-}} pronouns were used by the king to refer to himself, and the {{IPA|*ŋ-}} forms for the Shang people as a whole.
This distinction is largely absent in later texts, and the {{IPA|*l-}} forms disappeared during the classical period.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=76}}
In the post-Han period, {{lang|zh-Hant|我}} came to be used as the general first-person pronoun.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=118}}

Second-person pronouns included {{IPA|*njaʔ}} {{linktext|汝|lang=zh-Hant}}, {{IPA|*njəjʔ}} {{linktext|爾|lang=zh-Hant}}, {{IPA|*njə}} {{linktext|而|lang=zh-Hant}}, {{IPA|*njak}} {{linktext|若|lang=zh-Hant}}.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=77}}
The forms {{lang|zh-Hant|汝}} and {{lang|zh-Hant|爾}} continued to be used interchangeably until their replacement by the northwestern variant {{linktext|你|lang=zh-Hant}} (modern Mandarin ''nǐ'') in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] period.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=118}}
However, in some [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects the second-person pronoun is derived from {{lang|zh-Hant|汝}}.{{sfnp|Sagart|1999|p=143}}

Case distinctions were particularly marked among third-person pronouns.{{sfnp|Aldridge|2013|p=43}}
There was no third-person subject pronoun, but {{IPA|*tjə}} {{linktext|之|lang=zh-Hant}}, originally a distal [[demonstrative]], came to be used as a third-person object pronoun in the classical period.{{sfnp|Aldridge|2013|p=43}}{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=79}}
The possessive pronoun was originally {{IPA|*kjot}} {{linktext|厥|lang=zh-Hant}}, replaced in the classical period by {{IPA|*ɡjə}} {{linktext|其|lang=zh-Hant}}.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=80}}
In the post-Han period, {{lang|zh-Hant|其}} came to be used as the general third-person pronoun.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=118}}
It survives in some [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] dialects, but has been replaced by a variety of forms elsewhere.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=118}}

There were demonstrative and [[interrogative pronoun]]s, but no [[indefinite pronoun]]s with the meanings "something" or "nothing".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=90–91}}
The [[distributive pronoun]]s were formed with a {{IPA|*-k}} suffix:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=91}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=70, 457}}
* {{IPA|*djuk}} {{linktext|孰|lang=zh-Hant}} "which one" from {{IPA|*djuj}} {{linktext|誰|lang=zh-Hant}} "who"
* {{IPA|*kak}} {{linktext|各|lang=zh-Hant}} "each one" from {{IPA|*kjaʔ}} {{linktext|舉|lang=zh-Hant}} "all"
* {{IPA|*wək}} {{linktext|或|lang=zh-Hant}} "someone" from {{IPA|*wjəʔ}} {{linktext|有|lang=zh-Hant}} "there is"
* {{IPA|*mak}} {{linktext|莫|lang=zh-Hant}} "no-one" from {{IPA|*mja}} {{linktext|無|lang=zh-Hant}} "there is no"

As in the modern language, localizers (compass directions, "above", "inside" and the like) could be placed after nouns to indicate relative positions.
They could also precede verbs to indicate the direction of the action.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=91}} Nouns denoting times were another special class (time words); they usually preceded the subject to specify the time of an action.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=91, 94}} However the [[Chinese classifier|classifier]]s so characteristic of Modern Chinese only became common in the [[Han dynasty|Han period]] and the subsequent [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=115–116}}

Old Chinese [[verb]]s, like their modern counterparts, did not show tense or aspect; these could be indicated with adverbs or particles if required. Verbs could be [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive]]. As in the modern language, [[adjective]]s were a special kind of intransitive verb, and a few transitive verbs could also function as [[modal auxiliary|modal auxiliaries]] or as [[preposition]]s.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=91–94}}

[[Adverb]]s described the scope of a statement or various temporal relationships.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=94}} They included two families of negatives starting with {{IPA|*p-}} and {{IPA|*m-}}, such as {{IPA|*pjə}} {{linktext|不|lang=zh-Hant}} and {{IPA|*mja}} {{linktext|無|lang=zh-Hant}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=97–98}} Modern northern varieties derive the usual negative from the first family, while southern varieties preserve the second.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=172–173, 518–519}} The language had no adverbs of degree until late in the Classical period.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=94, 127}}

[[Chinese particle|Particle]]s were [[function word]]s serving a range of purposes. As in the modern language, there were sentence-final particles marking [[imperative mood|imperative]]s and [[yes/no question]]s. Other sentence-final particles expressed a range of connotations, the most important being {{IPA|*ljaj}} {{linktext|也|lang=zh-Hant}}, expressing static factuality, and {{IPA|*ɦjəʔ}} {{linktext|矣|lang=zh-Hant}}, implying a change. Other particles included the subordination marker {{IPA|*tjə}} {{linktext|之|lang=zh-Hant}} and the nominalizing particles {{IPA|*tjaʔ}} {{linktext|者|lang=zh-Hant}} (agent) and {{IPA|*srjaʔ}} {{linktext|所}} (object).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=94, 98–100, 105–106}}
[[Conjunction (grammar)|Conjunction]]s could join nouns or clauses.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=94, 106–108}}

=== Sentence structure ===
As with English and modern Chinese, Old Chinese sentences can be analysed as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (a noun phrase, sometimes understood) followed by a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], which could be of either nominal or verbal type.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|pp=13–14}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=95}}

Before the Classical period, nominal predicates consisted of a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]r particle {{IPA|*wjij}} {{linktext|惟|lang=zh-Hant}} followed by a noun phrase:{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=22}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=14}}
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|ipa2=yes|italics2=no|indent=3
|予 惟 小 子
|*ljaʔ *wjij *sjewʔ *tsjəʔ
|I be small child
|"I am a young person." (''[[Book of Documents]]'' 27, 9){{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=14}}}}
The negated copula {{IPA|*pjə-wjij}} {{linktext|不|惟|lang=zh-Hant}} is attested in oracle bone inscriptions, and later fused as {{IPA|*pjəj}} {{linktext|非|lang=zh-Hant}}.
In the Classical period, nominal predicates were constructed with the sentence-final particle {{IPA|*ljaj}} {{linktext|也|lang=zh-Hant}} instead of the copula {{lang|zh-Hant|惟}}, but {{lang|zh-Hant|非}} was retained as the negative form, with which {{lang|zh-Hant|也}} was optional:{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|pp=16–18, 22}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=232}}
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|ipa2=yes|italics2=no|indent=3
|其 至 爾 力 也 其 中 非 爾 力 也 
|*ɡjə *tjits *njəjʔ *C-rjək *ljajʔ *ɡjə *k-ljuŋ *pjəj *njəjʔ *C-rjək *ljajʔ
|its arrive you strength FP its centre not you strength FP
|(of shooting at a mark a hundred paces distant) "That you reach it is owing to your strength, but that you hit the mark is not owing to your strength." (''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' 10.1/51/13){{sfnp|Herforth|2003|p=60}}}}
The copular verb {{linktext|是|lang=zh-Hant}} (''shì'') of Literary and Modern Chinese dates from the Han period.
In Old Chinese the word was a near [[demonstrative]] ("this").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=125–126}}

As in Modern Chinese, but unlike most Tibeto-Burman languages, the basic word order in a verbal sentence was [[subject–verb–object]]:{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=14}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=10–11, 96}}
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|ipa2=yes|italics2=no|indent=3
|孟子 見 梁 惠 王
|*mraŋs-*tsəjʔ *kens *C-rjaŋ *wets *wjaŋ
|Mencius see Liang Hui king
|"Mencius saw King Hui of Liang." (''Mencius'' 1.1/1/3){{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=13}}}}
Besides inversions for emphasis, there were two exceptions to this rule: a pronoun object of a negated sentence or an interrogative pronoun object would be placed before the verb:{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=14}}
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|ipa2=yes|italics2=no|indent=3
|歲 不 我 與
|*swjats *pjə *ŋajʔ *ljaʔ
|year not me wait
|"The years do not wait for us." (''[[Analects]]'' 17.1/47/23)}}
An additional noun phrase could be placed before the subject to serve as the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]].{{sfnp|Herforth|2003|pp=66–67}} As in the modern language, [[yes/no question]]s were formed by adding a sentence-final particle, and requests for information by substituting an [[interrogative pronoun]] for the requested element.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=90–91, 98–99}}

=== Modification ===
In general, Old Chinese modifiers preceded the words they modified. Thus [[relative clause]]s were placed before the noun, usually marked by the particle {{IPA|*tjə}} {{lang|zh-Hant|之}} (in a role similar to Modern Chinese ''de'' {{lang|zh-Hant|的}}):{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=62}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=104–105}}
{{fs interlinear|lang1=zh-Hant|ipa2=yes|italics2=no|indent=3
|不 忍 人 之 心
|*pjə *njənʔ *njin *tjə *sjəm
|not endure person REL heart
|"... the heart that cannot bear the afflictions of others." (''Mencius'' 3.6/18/4){{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=62}}}}
A common instance of this construction was adjectival modification, since the Old Chinese adjective was a type of verb (as in the modern language), but {{lang|zh-Hant|之}} was usually omitted after monosyllabic adjectives.{{sfnp|Pulleyblank|1996|p=62}}

Similarly, adverbial modifiers, including various forms of negation, usually occurred before the verb.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=105}} As in the modern language, time [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]s occurred either at the start of the sentence or before the verb, depending on their scope, while duration adjuncts were placed after the verb.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=103–104}} Instrumental and place adjuncts were usually placed after the verb phrase. These later moved to a position before the verb, as in the modern language.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=103, 130–131}}

== Vocabulary ==
The improved understanding of Old Chinese [[phonology]] has enabled the study of the origins of Chinese words (rather than the characters with which they are written).
Most researchers trace the core vocabulary to a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] ancestor language, with much early borrowing from other neighbouring languages.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=xi, 1–5, 7–8}}
The traditional view was that Old Chinese was an [[isolating language]], lacking both [[inflection]] and [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]], but it has become clear that words could be formed by derivational affixation, reduplication and compounding.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|1998|pp=35–36}}
Most authors consider only monosyllabic [[root (linguistics)|root]]s, but Baxter and [[Laurent Sagart]] also propose disyllabic roots in which the first syllable is reduced, as in modern [[Khmer language|Khmer]].{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=50–53}}

=== Loanwords ===
During the Old Chinese period, Chinese civilization expanded from a compact area around the lower [[Wei River]] and middle [[Yellow River]] eastwards across the [[North China Plain]] to [[Shandong]] and then south into the valley of the [[Yangtze]]. There are no records of the non-Chinese languages formerly spoken in those areas and subsequently displaced by the Chinese expansion.
However they are believed to have contributed to the vocabulary of Old Chinese, and may be the source of some of the many Chinese words whose origins are still unknown.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=4, 16–17}}{{sfnp|Boltz|1999|pp=75–76}}

[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] and Mei Tsu-lin have identified early [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] loanwords in Old Chinese, possibly from the peoples of the lower [[Yangtze]] basin known to ancient Chinese as the [[Baiyue|Yue]]. For example, the early Chinese name {{IPA|*kroŋ}} ({{linktext|江|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jiāng'') for the Yangtze was later extended to a general word for "river" in south China.
Norman and Mei suggest that the word is cognate with [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''sông'' (from *''krong'') and [[Mon language|Mon]] ''kruŋ'' "river".{{sfnp|Norman|Mei|1976|pp=280–283}}{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=17–18}}{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=573}}

Haudricourt and Strecker have proposed a number of borrowings from the [[Hmong–Mien languages]]. These include terms related to [[rice]] cultivation, which began in the middle Yangtze valley:
* {{IPA|*ʔjaŋ}} ({{linktext|秧|lang=zh-Hant}} ''yāng'') "rice seedling" from [[proto-Hmong–Mien]] {{IPA|*jaŋ}}
* {{IPA|*luʔ}} ({{linktext|稻|lang=zh-Hant}} ''dào'') "unhulled rice" from proto-Hmong–Mien {{IPA|*mblau}}&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Haudricourt|Strecker|1991}}; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=753}}; [[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1078h; {{harvp|Schuessler|2007|pp=207–208, 556}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other words are believed to have been borrowed from languages to the south of the Chinese area, but it is not clear which was the original source, e.g.
* {{IPA|*zjaŋʔ}} ({{linktext|象|lang=zh-Hant}} ''xiàng'') "elephant" can be compared with Mon ''coiŋ'', [[proto-Tai]] {{IPA|*jaŋ&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;}} and Burmese ''chaŋ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Norman|1988|p=19}}; [[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 728a; OC from {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=206}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|*ke}} ({{linktext|雞|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jī'') "chicken" versus proto-Tai {{IPA|*kəi&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;}} proto-Hmong–Mien {{IPA|*kai}} and [[proto-Viet–Muong]] *''r-ka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Schuessler|2007|p=292}}; [[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 876n; OC from {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=578}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, the [[Tarim Basin]] was occupied by speakers of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Tocharian languages]], the source of {{IPA|*mjit}} ({{linktext|蜜|lang=zh-Hant}} ''mì'') "honey", from proto-Tocharian *''ḿət(ə)'' (where *''ḿ'' is [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]]; cf. Tocharian B ''mit''), cognate with English ''{{linktext|mead}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Boltz|1999|p=87}}; {{harvp|Schuessler|2007|p=383}}; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=191}}; [[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 405r; Proto-Tocharian and Tocharian B forms from {{harvp|Peyrot|2008|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Guillaume Jacques|Jacques]] proposed a different, unattested, Tocharian form as the source.{{sfnp|Jacques|2014}}}}
The northern neighbours of Chinese contributed such words as {{IPA|*dok}} ({{linktext|犢|lang=zh-Hant}} ''dú'') "calf" – compare [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] ''tuɣul'' and [[Manchu language|Manchu]] ''tuqšan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Norman|1988|p=18}}; [[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1023l.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affixation ===
Chinese philologists have long noted words with related meanings and similar pronunciations, sometimes written using the same character.{{sfnp|Handel|2015|p=76}}{{sfnp|Sagart|1999|p=1}}
[[Henri Maspero]] attributed some of these alternations to consonant clusters resulting from derivational affixes.{{sfnp|Maspero|1930|pp=323–324}}
Subsequent work has identified several such affixes, some of which appear to have cognates in other Sino-Tibetan languages.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|2014|pp=53–60}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=14–22}}

A common case is "derivation by tone change", in which words in the departing tone appear to be derived from words in other tones.{{sfnp|Downer|1959|pp=258–259}}
If Haudricourt's theory of the origin of the departing tone is accepted, these tonal derivations can be interpreted as the result of a derivational suffix {{IPA|*-s}}.
As Tibetan has a similar suffix, it may be inherited from Sino-Tibetan.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=315–317}}
Examples include:
* {{IPA|*dzjin}} ({{linktext|盡|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jìn'') "to exhaust" and {{IPA|*dzjins}} ({{linktext|燼|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jìn'') "exhausted, consumed, ash"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 381a,c; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=768}}; {{harvp|Schuessler|2007|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|*kit}} ({{linktext|結|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jié'') "to tie" and {{IPA|*kits}} ({{linktext|髻|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jì'') "hair-knot"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 393p,t; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=315}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|*nup}} ({{linktext|納|lang=zh-Hant}} ''nà'') "to bring in" and {{IPA|*nuts}} &lt; {{IPA|*nups}} ({{linktext|內|lang=zh-Hant}} ''nèi'') "inside"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 695h,e; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=315}}; {{harvp|Schuessler|2007|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|*tjək}} ({{linktext|織|lang=zh-Hant}} ''zhī'') "to weave" and {{IPA|*tjəks}} ({{linktext|織|lang=zh-Hant}} ''zhì'') "silk cloth" (compare Written Tibetan ''’thag'' "to weave" and ''thags'' "woven, cloth")&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 920f; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=178}}; {{harvp|Schuessler|2007|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another alternation involves transitive verbs with an unvoiced initial and passive or stative verbs with a voiced initial:{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=49}}
* {{IPA|*kens}} ({{linktext|見|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jiàn'') "to see" and {{IPA|*ɡens}} ({{linktext|現|lang=zh-Hant}} ''xiàn'') "to appear"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 241a,e; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|*kraw}} ({{linktext|交|lang=zh-Hant}} ''jiāo'') "to mix" and {{IPA|*ɡraw}} ({{linktext|殽|lang=zh-Hant}} ''yáo'') "mixed, confused"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 1166a, 1167e; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=801}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|*trjaŋ}} ({{linktext|張|lang=zh-Hant}} ''zhāng'') "to stretch" and {{IPA|*drjaŋ}} ({{linktext|長|lang=zh-Hant}} ''cháng'') "long"&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 721h,a; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=324}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some scholars hold that the transitive verbs with voiceless initials are basic and the voiced initials reflect a de-transitivizing nasal prefix.{{sfnp|Handel|2012|pp=63–64, 68–69}}
Others suggest that the transitive verbs were derived by the addition of a causative prefix {{IPA|*s-}} to a stative verb, causing devoicing of the following voiced initial.{{sfnp|Handel|2012|pp=63–64, 70–71}}
Both postulated prefixes have parallels in other Sino-Tibetan languages, in some of which they are still productive.{{sfnp|Handel|2012|pp=65–68}}{{sfnp|Sun|2014|pp=638–640}}
Several other affixes have been proposed.{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|1998|pp=45–64}}{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|pp=38–50}}

=== Reduplication and compounding ===
Old Chinese morphemes were originally monosyllabic, but during the Western Zhou period many new bisyllabic words entered the language.
For example, over 30% of the vocabulary of the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' is polysyllabic, including 9% proper names, though monosyllabic words occur more frequently, accounting for 80–90% of the text.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2012|pp=22–23}}
Many words, particularly expressive adjectives and adverbs, were formed by varieties of [[reduplication]]:&lt;ref name="Norman:reduplication"&gt;{{harvp|Norman|1988|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* full reduplication, in which the syllable is repeated, as in {{IPA|*ʔjuj-ʔjuj}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|威威}} ''wēiwēi'') "tall and grand" and {{IPA|*ljo-ljo}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|俞俞}} ''yúyú'') "happy and at ease".&lt;ref name="Norman:reduplication"/&gt;
* rhyming semi-reduplication, in which only the final is repeated, as in {{IPA|*ʔiwʔ-liwʔ}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|窈宨}} ''yǎotiǎo'') "elegant, beautiful".&lt;ref name="BS:reduplication"&gt;{{harvp|Baxter|Sagart|1998|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial of the second syllable is often {{IPA|*l-}} or {{IPA|*r-}}.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=24}}
* alliterative semi-reduplication, in which the initial is repeated, as in {{IPA|*tsʰrjum-tsʰrjaj}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|參差}} ''cēncī'') "irregular, uneven".&lt;ref name="BS:reduplication"/&gt;
* vowel alternation, especially of {{IPA|*-e-}} and {{IPA|*-o-}}, as in {{IPA|*tsʰjek-tsʰjok}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|刺促}} ''qìcù'') "busy" and {{IPA|*ɡreʔ-ɡroʔ}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|邂逅}} ''xièhòu'') "carefree and happy".{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|1998|pp=65–66}}
Other bisyllabic morphemes include the famous {{IPA|*ɡa-lep}} ({{linktext|蝴蝶|lang=zh-Hant}} ''húdié'') "butterfly" from the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#{{harvid|Karlgren|1957}}|GSR]] 633h; {{harvp|Baxter|1992|p=411}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
More words, especially nouns, were formed by [[compound (linguistics)|compound]]ing, including:
* qualification of one noun by another (placed in front), as in {{IPA|*mok-kʷra}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|木瓜}} ''mùguā'') "quince" (literally "tree-melon"), and {{IPA|*trjuŋ-njit}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|中日}} ''zhōngrì'') "noon" (literally "middle-day").{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|1998|p=67}}
* verb–object compounds, as in {{IPA|*sjə-mraʔ}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|司馬}} ''sīmǎ'') "master of the household" (literally "manage-horse"), and {{IPA|*tsak-tsʰrek}} ({{lang|zh-Hant|作册}} ''zuòcè'') "scribe" (literally "make-writing").{{sfnp|Baxter|Sagart|1998|p=68}}
However the components of compounds were not [[bound morpheme]]s: they could still be used separately.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=86}}

A number of bimorphemic syllables appeared in the Classical period, resulting from the fusion of words with following unstressed particles or pronouns.
Thus the negatives {{IPA|*pjut}} {{linktext|弗|lang=zh-Hant}} and {{IPA|*mjut}} {{linktext|勿|lang=zh-Hant}} are viewed as fusions of the negators {{IPA|*pjə}} {{linktext|不|lang=zh-Hant}} and {{IPA|*mjo}} {{linktext|毋|lang=zh-Hant}} respectively with a third-person pronoun {{IPA|*tjə}} {{linktext|之|lang=zh-Hant}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=85, 98}}

'''Otuke''' (Otuque) is an extinct language of the [[Macro-Gê]] family, related to [[Bororo language|Bororo]]. Several attested extinct Bororoan varieties were either dialects of Otuku or closely related: Covareca, Curuminaca, Coraveca (Curave), Curucaneca, Tapii.  Mason (1950) says the first four are "separate and very different", but Loukotka (1968) notes that nothing is known of Curave or Curucane (or of Tapii), that only 14 words of Curumina and 19 of Covare have been preserved.

The '''Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act''', commonly referred to as the '''RICO Act''' or simply '''RICO''', is a [[United States federal law]] that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil [[cause of action]] for acts performed as part of an ongoing [[criminal organization]]. The RICO Act focuses specifically on [[racketeering]] and allows the ''leaders'' of a syndicate to be tried for the crimes they ''[[Dirty hands|ordered]]'' others to do [[Enmund v. Florida|or assisted them in doing]], closing a perceived loophole that allowed a person who instructed someone else to, for example, murder, to be exempt from the trial because they did not actually commit the crime personally.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S. Code § 1962(c); see also [http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/rico.pdf Criminal RICO Prosecutors Manual], elaborating that "A Defendant May Be Liable for a RICO Conspiracy Offense Even if the Defendant Did Not Participate In the Operation or Management of the Enterprise"&lt;/ref&gt;

RICO was enacted by section 901(a) of the [[Organized Crime Control Act]] of 1970 ({{USStatute|91|452|84|922|1970|10|15}}) and is codified at {{usctc|18|96}} as {{usc|18|1961|1968}}. [[G. Robert Blakey]], an adviser to the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|United States Senate Government Operations Committee]], drafted the law under the close supervision of the committee's chairman, Senator [[John Little McClellan]].  It was enacted as Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, and signed into law by [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]]. While its original use in the 1970s was to prosecute the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] as well as others who were actively engaged in organized crime, its later application has been more widespread.

Beginning in 1972, 33 states adopted state RICO laws to be able to prosecute similar conduct.

==Summary==
Under RICO, a person who has committed "at least two acts of racketeering activity" drawn from a list of 35 crimes—27 [[Federal crime in the United States|federal crimes]] and 8 [[State law in the United States|state crimes]]—within a 10-year period can be charged with [[racketeering]] if such acts are related in one of four specified ways to an "enterprise". {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Those found guilty of racketeering can be fined up to $25,000 and sentenced to 20 years in prison per racketeering count. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition, the racketeer must forfeit all ill-gotten gains and interest in any business gained through a pattern of "racketeering activity." {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

When the [[U.S. Attorney]] decides to indict someone under RICO, they have the option of seeking a pre-trial [[restraining order]] or injunction to temporarily seize a defendant's assets and prevent the transfer of potentially forfeitable property, as well as require the defendant to put up a [[performance bond]]. This provision was placed in the law because the owners of [[Mafia]]-related [[shell corporation]]s often absconded with the assets. An injunction and/or performance bond ensures that there is something to seize in the event of a guilty verdict.

In many cases, the threat of a RICO indictment can force defendants to plead guilty to lesser charges, in part because the seizure of assets would make it difficult to pay a defense [[Lawyer|attorney]]. Despite its harsh provisions, a RICO-related charge is considered easy to prove in court since it focuses on patterns of behavior as opposed to criminal acts.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958402-1,00.html |title= Law: Showdown At Gucci |last1= Sanders |first1 = Alain |last2= Painton |first2= Priscilla |journal= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= August 21, 1989 |accessdate= September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RICO also permits a private individual "damaged in his business or property" by a "racketeer" to file a [[civil suit]]. The plaintiff must prove the existence of an "enterprise". The defendant(s) are not the enterprise; in other words, the defendant(s) and the enterprise are not one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Anti-Corruption Handbook: How to Protect Your Business in the Global Marketplace |first= William P. |last=Olsen, |publisher= Wiley |location= Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; There must be one of four specified relationships between the defendant(s) and the enterprise: either the defendant(s) invested the proceeds of the pattern of racketeering activity into the enterprise (18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)); or the defendant(s) acquired or maintained an interest in, or control of, the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (b)); or the defendant(s) conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise "through" the pattern of racketeering activity (subsection (c)); or the defendant(s) conspired to do one of the above (subsection (d)).&lt;ref&gt;18 USC § 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the enterprise is either the 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' or 'perpetrator' of the racketeers.&lt;ref&gt;"As the Supreme Court noted in ''National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler'', 510 U.S. 249, 259 n.5 (1994), one commentator has used "the terms 'prize,' 'instrument,' 'victim,' and 'perpetrator' to describe the four separate roles the enterprise may play in § 1962." (citing [[G. Robert Blakey]], The RICO Civil Fraud Action in Context: Reflections on Bennett v. Berg, 58 Notre Dame L. Rev. 237, 307-25 (1982). See page 32 of RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation under the State Racketeering Statutes, John E. Floyd, Section of Antitrust Law, American Bar Association, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 97-70903, {{ISBN|1-57073-396-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A civil RICO action can be filed in state or [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dealer-magazine.com/index.asp?article=481 |journal=Dealer Magazine |title=Can You Be Subject to a RICO Claim? |last=Van Over |first=Gil |accessdate=September 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014073823/http://www.dealer-magazine.com/index.asp?article=481 |archivedate=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the criminal and civil components allow the recovery of [[treble damages]] (damages in triple the amount of actual/compensatory damages).

Although its primary intent was to deal with [[organized crime]], Blakey said that Congress never intended it to merely apply to the Mob. He once told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]],'' "We don't want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels, and another set for those whose collars are white and have [[Ivy League]] diplomas."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

Initially, prosecutors were skeptical of using RICO, mainly because it was unproven. The RICO Act was first used by the US Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York on September 18, 1979, in the United States v. Scotto. Scotto, who was convicted on charges of racketeering, accepting unlawful labor payments, and income tax evasion,  headed the International Longshoreman's Association. During the 1980s and 1990s, federal prosecutors used the law to bring charges against several Mafia figures.  The second major success was the [[Mafia Commission Trial]], which resulted in several top leaders of New York City's [[Five Families]] getting what amounted to life sentences. By the turn of the century, RICO cases resulted in virtually all of the top leaders of the New York Mafia being sent to prison.

==State laws==
Beginning in 1972, 33 states, as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, adopted state RICO laws to cover additional state offenses under a similar scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2012/november_2012/introduction_rico_state_by_state.html |title= Introduction: RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation Under the State Racketeering Statutes, Second Edition |author= Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division |publisher= American Bar Association |accessdate= February 15, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222015455/http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2012/november_2012/introduction_rico_state_by_state.html |archive-date= February 22, 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Any violation of state statutes against [[gambling]], [[murder]], [[kidnapping]], [[extortion]], [[arson]], [[robbery]], [[bribery]], dealing in [[Obscenity|obscene matter]], or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in the [[Controlled Substances Act]]);
*Any act of [[bribery]], [[counterfeiting]], [[theft]], [[embezzlement]], [[fraud]], dealing in obscene matter, [[obstruction of justice]], [[slavery]], [[racketeering]], [[gambling]], [[money laundering]], commission of [[murder-for-hire]], and many other offenses covered under the Federal criminal code ([[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]]);
*[[Embezzlement]] of [[Trade union|union]] funds;
*[[Bankruptcy in the United States|Bankruptcy]] fraud or [[securities fraud]];
*[[Drug trafficking]]; long-term and elaborate drug networks can also be prosecuted using the [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise|Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute]];
*Criminal [[copyright infringement]];
*[[Money laundering]] and related offenses;
*Bringing in, aiding or assisting [[Alien (law)|aliens]] in illegally entering the country (if the action was for financial gain);
*Acts of [[terrorism]].

'''Pattern of racketeering activity''' requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has instructed federal courts to follow the continuity-plus-relationship test in order to determine whether the facts of a specific case give rise to an established pattern. Predicate acts are related if they "have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events." (''[[H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co.]]'') Continuity is both a closed and open ended concept, referring to either a closed period of conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.

==Application of RICO laws==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2009}}
Although some of the RICO predicate acts are [[extortion]] and [[blackmail]], one of the most successful applications of the RICO laws has been the ability to indict and or sanction individuals for their behavior and actions committed against witnesses and victims in alleged retaliation or retribution for cooperating with federal law enforcement or intelligence agencies.

Violations of the RICO laws can be alleged in civil lawsuit cases or for criminal charges. In these instances, charges can be brought against individuals or corporations in retaliation for said individuals or corporations working with law enforcement. Further, charges can also be brought against individuals or corporations who have sued or filed criminal charges against a defendant.

Anti-SLAPP ([[strategic lawsuit against public participation]]) laws can be applied in an attempt to curb alleged [[Barratry (common law)|abuses of the legal system]] by individuals or corporations who use the courts as a weapon to retaliate against [[whistle blowers]] or victims or to silence another's speech. RICO could be alleged if it can be shown that lawyers and/or their clients conspired and collaborated to concoct fictitious legal complaints solely in retribution and retaliation for themselves having been brought before the courts.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Although the RICO laws may cover drug trafficking crimes in addition to other more traditional RICO predicate acts such as extortion, blackmail, and racketeering, large-scale and organized drug networks are now commonly prosecuted under the [[Continuing Criminal Enterprise|Continuing Criminal Enterprise Statute]], also known as the "Kingpin Statute". The CCE laws target only traffickers who are responsible for long-term and elaborate conspiracies, whereas the RICO law covers a variety of organized criminal behaviors.&lt;ref name="NCJRS"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Carlson |first= K |year= 1993 |title= Prosecuting Criminal Enterprises |journal= National Criminal Justice Reference Series |publisher= Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report |location= United States |page= 12 |url= http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=142524 |accessdate= December 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Provisions===
The RICO statute contains a provision that allows for the commencement of a [[civil action]] by a private party to recover damages sustained as a result of the commission of a RICO predicate offense.&lt;ref&gt;Title 18, United States Code, Section 1964(c) (18 U.S.C. 1964[c])- https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1964&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/rico/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous cases==

===Nine Trey Gangsters===
In November 2018, rapper [[6ix9ine]], birth name Daniel Hernandez, and four members of the [[Nine Trey Gangsters]] were charged with racketeering related to operating a criminal enterprise, conspiracy to murder, robbery, extortion and drug distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brooklyn rapper 6ix9ine arrested on racketeering charges |url=https://www.apnews.com/2ae2d334712a4f5792420084bc1e39f6 |website=APNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hells Angels Motorcycle Club===
In 1979, the United States Federal Government went after [[Sonny Barger]] and several members and associates of the [[Oakland]] chapter of the [[Hells Angels]] using RICO. In ''United States vs. Barger'', the prosecution team attempted to demonstrate a pattern of behavior to convict Barger and other members of the club of RICO offenses related to guns and illegal drugs. The jury acquitted Barger on the RICO charges with a [[hung jury]] on the predicate acts: "There was no proof it was part of club policy, and as much as they tried, the government could not come up with any incriminating minutes from any of our meetings mentioning drugs and guns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club |first1= Ralph 'Sonny' |last1= Barger |first2= Keith |last2= Zimmerman |first3= Kent |last3= Zimmerman |year= 2000}}{{full citation needed|date= October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.organized-crime.de/revbar01sonnybarger.htm| title=Organized Crime Research| publisher=Klaus von Lampe| year=2000| accessdate=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin Kings===
On August 20, 2006, in [[Tampa, Florida]], most of the state leadership members of [[street gang]] the [[Latin Kings (gang)|Latin Kings]] were arrested in connection with RICO conspiracy charges to engage in racketeering and currently await trial. The operation, called "Broken Crown", targeted statewide leadership of the Latin Kings. The raid occurred at the Caribbean American Club. Along with [[Hillsborough County, Florida Sheriff's Office|Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office]], [[Tampa Police Department]], the State Attorney's Office, the [[FBI]], [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], and the federal [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] were involved in the operation. Included in the arrest were leader Gilberto Santana from Brooklyn NY, Captain Luis Hernandez from Miami FL, Affiliate Celina Hernandez, Affiliate Michael Rocca, Affiliate Jessica Ramirez, Affiliate Reinaldo Arroyo, Affiliate Samual Alvarado, Omari Tolbert, Edwin DeLeon, and many others, totaling 39.

===Catholic sex abuse cases===
In some jurisdictions, RICO suits have been filed against Catholic [[diocese]]s, using anti-racketeering laws to prosecute the highers-up in the [[episcopacy]] for abuses committed by those under their authority.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} E.g. a Cleveland grand jury cleared two bishops of racketeering charges, finding that their mishandling of sex abuse claims did not amount to criminal racketeering.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Notably, a similar suit was not filed against Cardinal [[Bernard Law]], then Archbishop/Emeritus of Boston, prior to his assignment to [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2075831/ |title=But Why Isn't Bernard Law in Jail?

===Gil Dozier===

[[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry|Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry]] [[Gil Dozier]], in office from 1976 to 1980, faced [[indictment]] with violations of both the [[Hobbs Act|Hobbs]] and the RICO laws. He was accused of compelling companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. On September 23, 1980, the [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]-based [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana]] convicted Dozier of five counts of [[extortion]] and [[racketeering]]. The sentence of ten years imprisonment, later upgraded to eighteen when other offenses were determined, and a $25,000 fine was suspended pending appeal, and Dozier remained free on [[bail]].&lt;ref name=justia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/707/862/230224/|title=707 F.2d 862: United States vs. Dozier |publisher=law.justia.com|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually served nearly four years until a presidential [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] freed him in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Gilbert&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Dozier&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=79&amp;x=120&amp;y=15

===Key West, Florida Police Department===
Around June 1984, the [[Key West Police Department]] located in [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], Florida, was declared a criminal enterprise under the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] RICO statutes after a lengthy [[United States Department of Justice]] investigation. Several high-ranking officers of the department, including Deputy Police Chief Raymond Cassamayor, were arrested on federal charges of running a [[protection racket]] for illegal [[cocaine]] smugglers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E4D71539F932A35754C0A962948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fF%2fFederal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20 | title= Key West Police Department Called a 'Criminal Enterprise'|work= The New York Times | date=July 1, 1984 |accessdate=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[trial]], a witness testified he routinely delivered bags of cocaine to the Deputy Chief's office at City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livableoldtown.com/from_wrecking_to_smuggling_to_de.htm|title=From wrecking to smuggling to development, corruption, investigations have long history|last=Klingener|first=Nancy|date=May 22, 2005|work=Key West Citizen|accessdate=September 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320075248/http://www.livableoldtown.com/from_wrecking_to_smuggling_to_de.htm|archivedate=March 20, 2007}}&lt;!-- Actual Key West Citizen URL requires a fee to get to the article [http://secure.floridakeys.com/keysnews/archives/index.cfm?searchtext=NANCY%20KLINGENER&amp;searchtype=basic&amp;searchbool=ALL&amp;searchstory=1&amp;searchtitle=1&amp;startdate=0&amp;enddate=0&amp;orderby=0&amp;searchpub=0&amp;searchauth=&amp;preview=1&amp;page=16&amp;displayrows=10&amp;cache=1] and [javascript:ClickThru('article.cfm?article_id=39990&amp;searchtext=NANCY%20KLINGENER&amp;searchtype=basic&amp;searchbool=ALL&amp;searchstory=1&amp;searchtitle=1&amp;startdate=0&amp;enddate=0&amp;orderby=0&amp;searchpub=0&amp;searchauth=&amp;preview=1&amp;page=16&amp;displayrows=10&amp;cache=1')] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Milken===
On 29 March 1989 [[United States|American]] financier [[Michael Milken]] was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud relating to an investigation into an allegation of [[insider trading]] and other offenses. Milken was accused of using a wide-ranging network of contacts to manipulate stock and bond prices. It was one of the first occasions that a RICO indictment was brought against an individual with no ties to organized crime. Milken pleaded guilty to six lesser felonies of securities fraud and tax evasion rather than risk spending the rest of his life in prison and ended up serving 22 months in prison. Milken was also ordered banned for life from the securities industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerber|first=Jurg |last2= Jensen|first2=Eric L.|date=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of White-collar Crime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tumxfktlYFAC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=March+29,+1989+michael+milken&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YL2UU1JVZu&amp;sig=_Kt8Je-B1nFMrYrcfM91o9xLtsI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2YjvU7-xC8X-yQT8_YLYCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=March%2029%2C%201989%20michael%20milken&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |page= |isbn=9780313335242|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1988, Milken's employer, [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]], was threatened with RICO charges ''[[respondeat superior]]'', the legal doctrine that corporations are responsible for their employees' crimes. Drexel avoided RICO charges by entering an [[Alford plea]] to lesser felonies of stock parking and stock manipulation. In a carefully worded plea, Drexel said it was "not in a position to dispute the allegations" made by the Government. If Drexel had been indicted under RICO statutes, it would have had to post a performance bond of up to $1 billion to avoid having its assets frozen. This would have taken precedence over all of the firm's other obligations—including the loans that provided 96 percent of its capital base. If the bond ever had to be paid, its shareholders would have been practically wiped out. Since banks will not extend credit to a firm indicted under RICO, an indictment would have likely put Drexel out of business.&lt;ref name="April Fools"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stone |first=Dan G. |title=April Fools:  An Insider's Account of the Rise and Collapse of Drexel Burnham |year=1990 |publisher=Donald I.

===Major League Baseball===
In 2002, the former minority owners of the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball team filed charges under the RICO Act against [[Major League Baseball]] commissioner [[Bud Selig]] and former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]], claiming that Selig and Loria deliberately conspired to [[devalue]] the team for personal benefit in preparation for a move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/sports/baseball-a-group-s-racketeering-suit-brings-baseball-to-full-bristle.html |last = Chass | first = Murray |work = The New York Times | date=July 17, 2002 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | title = Baseball: A Group's Racketeering Suit Brings Baseball to Full Bristle}}&lt;/ref&gt; If found liable, Major League Baseball could have been responsible for up to $300 million in [[punitive damages]]. The case lasted two years, successfully stalling the Expos' move to [[Washington Nationals|Washington]] or contraction during that time. It was eventually sent to [[arbitration]], where the arbiters ruled in favor of Major League Baseball,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1923417 | title = Ruling clears way for move to D.C. | date =January 15, 2004 | accessdate = September 30, 2009 | publisher = ESPN.com |agency= [[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; permitting the move to Washington to take place.

===Pro-life activists===
RICO laws were successfully cited in ''[[NOW v. Scheidler]]'', 510 U.S. 249, 114 S. Ct. 798, 127 L.Ed. 2d 99 (1994), a suit in which certain parties, including the [[National Organization for Women]], sought damages and an injunction against pro-life activists who physically block access to [[abortion]] clinics. The Court held that a RICO enterprise does not need an economic motive and that the Pro-Life Action Network could therefore qualify as a RICO enterprise. The Court remanded for consideration of whether PLAN committed the requisite acts in a pattern of racketeering activity.

===Los Angeles Police Department===
In April 2000, federal judge William J. Rea in Los Angeles, ruling in one [[Rampart scandal]] case, said that the plaintiffs could pursue RICO claims against the LAPD, an unprecedented finding. The idea that a police organization could be characterized as a racketeering enterprise shook up City Hall and further damaged the already-tarnished image of the LAPD. However, in July 2001, US District Judge Gary A. Feess said that the plaintiffs do not have standing to sue the LAPD under RICO because they are alleging personal injuries rather than economic or property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/13/local/me-21842|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Use of RICO Law in Rampart Cases Weakened|last=Weinstein|first= Henry|date=July 13, 2001|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mohawk Industries===
On April 26, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] heard ''Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Williams'', {{ussc|547|516|2006|docket=05-465}}, which concerned what sort of corporations fell under the scope of RICO. Mohawk Industries had allegedly hired [[illegal aliens]], in violation of RICO. The court was asked to decide whether Mohawk Industries, along with recruiting agencies, constitutes an "enterprise" that can be prosecuted under RICO, but in June of that year dismissed the case and remanded it to Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/05pdf/05-465.pdf|title=Mohawk Industries, Inc. v.

===Gambino crime family===
Also in Tampa, on October 16, 2006, four members of the [[Gambino crime family]] ([[Caporegime|Capo]] [[Ronnie Trucchio|Ronald Trucchio]], Terry Scaglione, Steven Catallono, and Anthony Mucciarone and associate Kevin McMahon) were tried under RICO statutes, found guilty, and sentenced to [[life in prison]].

===Lucchese Crime Family===
In the mid-1990s, prosecuting attorneys [[Gregory O'Connell]] and Charles Rose used RICO charges to bring down the [[Lucchese family]] within an 18-month period. Dismantling the Lucchese family had a profound financial impact on previously Mafia held businesses such as construction, garment, and garbage hauling. Here they dominated and extorted money through taxes, dues, and fees. An example of this extortion was through the garbage business. Hauling of garbage from the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] cost the building owners $1.2 million per year to be removed when the Mafia monopolized the business, as compared to $150,000 per year when competitive bids could be sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Volkman|first=Ernest|title=Gangbusters: The Destruction of America's Last Mafia Dynasty|year=1998|publisher=Faber and Faber, Inc.|location=53 Shore Road, Winchester, MA 01890|isbn=0-571-19942-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International equivalents to RICO==
The US RICO legislation has other equivalents in the rest of the world. In spite of [[Interpol]] having a standardized definition of RICO-like crimes, the interpretation and national implementation in legislation (and enforcement) widely varies. Most nations cooperate with the US on RICO enforcement only where their own related laws are specifically broken, but this is in line with the Interpol protocols for such matters.

By nation, alphabetically:
* In Australia the [[Australian Crime Commission]] has powers based on similar legislation and regulations.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
* In Canada, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions]] enforce rules and regulations{{which|date=September 2016}} that cumulatively are equivalent to RICO.
* In Ireland the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]] has powers to seize assets likely to have been the proceeds of criminality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |chapter=  |page=21 |title=The Confiscation of Criminal Assets: Tackling Organised Crime Through a 'Middleground' System of Justice |type= Ph.D. |last=King |accessdate=9 November 2018 |url=http://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/1614/2010_King%2cC.pdf?sequence=6 |date=June 2010 |publisher=[[University of Limerick]] |first=Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Jamaica, the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency (MOCA) was founded in 2012 to combat organised financial crimes and bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://moca.gov.jm|title=Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency|publisher=MOCA|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.moca.gov.jm/publications/message-minister-national-security-extracted-mocas-corporate-strategy|title=Message from the Minister of National Security|publisher=MOCA|accessdate=August 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913175518/http://www.moca.gov.jm/publications/message-minister-national-security-extracted-mocas-corporate-strategy|archive-date=September 13, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New Zealand has a similar arrangement and commission to Australia, in the form of the [[Organised and Financial Crime Agency of New Zealand]] (OFCANZ).
Without other nations enforcing similar legislation to RICO, many cross border RICO cases would not be possible. In the overall body of RICO cases that went to trial, at least 50% have had some non-US enforcement component to them. The offshoring of money away from the US finance system as part racketeering (and especially money laundering) is typically a major contributing factor to this.

However, other countries have laws that enable the government to seize property with unlawful origins. Colombia and Mexico both have specific laws that define the participation in criminal organizations as a separate crime&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title= Ley Federal contra la Delincuencia Organizada|number= |language= Spanish|date= 28 October 1996|article= |url= http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/101.pdf|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801120008/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/101.pdf|archivedate= August 1, 2010|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as separate laws that allow the seizure of goods related to these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|title= Ley de Extinción de Dominio|number= |language= Spanish|date= 30 April 2009|article= |url= http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFED.pdf|accessdate= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091229152411/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/LFED.pdf|archivedate= December 29, 2009|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter provides a specific chapter titled "International Cooperation", which instructs Mexican authorities to cooperate with foreign authorities with respect to organized crime assets within Mexico, and provides the framework by which Mexican authorities may politely request the cooperation of foreign authorities with respect to assets located outside of Mexico, in terms of any international instruments they may be party to.

Arguably, this may be construed as allowing the application of the RICO Act in Mexico, provided the relevant international agreements exist among Mexico and countries with RICO or RICO-equivalent provisions.

'''Ravindra Kelekar''' (7 March 1925&amp;nbsp;– 27 August 2010) was a noted Indian author who wrote primarily in the [[Konkani language]], though he also wrote in [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; A [[Gandhian]] activist, freedom fighter and a pioneer in the modern Konkani movement, he is a well known Konkani scholar, [[linguist]], and creative thinker. Kelkar was a participant in the [[Indian freedom movement]], [[Goa's liberation movement]], and later the campaign against the merger of the newly formed [[Goa]] with [[Maharashtra]]. He played a key role in the founding of the ''Konkani Bhasha Mandal'', which lead the literary campaign for the recognition of Konkani as a full-fledged language, and its reinstatement as the state language of Goa.&lt;ref name="tto"/&gt; He authored nearly 100 books in the Konkani language, including ''Amchi Bhas Konkaneech'', ''Shalent Konkani Kityak'', ''Bahu-bhashik Bharatant Bhashenche Samajshastra'' and ''Himalayant'', and also edited ''Jaag'' magazine for more than two decades.

Kelekar died at Apollo Hospital at Margao, Goa at around 11.30 am on Friday 27 August. He was 85.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{Cite news

==Early life and education==
Kelekar was born on 7 March 1925, in the city of [[Cuncolim]] in [[South Goa]].&lt;ref name="jn"/&gt; His father, Dr Rajaram Kelekar, was a physician who later became renowned for his Portuguese translation of the ''[[Bhagwad Gita]]''.&lt;ref name="pa"/&gt; While still a student at the Lyceum High School in [[Panaji]], Kelekar joined the [[Goa liberation movement]] in 1946. This brought him in close contact with several local and national leaders, including [[Ram Manohar Lohia]], under whose influence he was able to recognise the power of language to mobilise the local populace. Later, he saw the potential in his native Konkani language, which became his lifelong work.&lt;ref name=pa/&gt;

==Career==
Already deeply influenced by [[Gandhian]] philosophy, in 1949 Kelekar left his native Goa for [[Wardha]], to be with noted Gandhian and writer [[Kakasaheb Kalelkar]]. Kelekar stayed under Kalelkar's tutelage until 1955, when he was appointed librarian of the [[Gandhi Memorial Museum]] in New Delhi. This turned out to be short-lived, as only a year later he plunged back into the Goa freedom movement. With a mission to reconnect the Goan [[diaspora]] all over the world, he started the weekly, ''Gomant Bharati'' (1956–60),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

published in the [[Latin script]] in Bombay. Soon after, being an active participant in Goa's struggle for freedom, he was imprisoned by the Portuguese. He was released when the [[Indian Army]] [[1961 Indian Annexation of Goa|invaded and annexed Goa]] in 1961.

He joined the socio-political campaign against the merger of Goa into the neighbouring Maharashtra state, which ended after the [[plebiscite]] of 1967, with Goa retaining its separate identity albeit as a [[union territory]]. Goa retained this status until 1987, when it was declared a separate state.

After Goa's independence, Kelekar took to literary activism, in the form of getting his native Konkani language its due status as an independent language, rather than as just a [[dialect]] of Marathi. He was compared favourably with pioneers in the Konkani literary movement, such as [[Shenoi Goembab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

During this period, he wrote some of his most important works promoting the Konkani language, including ''Aamchi Bhas Konkanich'' (1962), a dialogue revealing the importance of Konkani to the common man on the street; ''Shallent Konkani Kityaak'' (1962), highlighting the significance of having Konkani medium schools in Goa; and  ''A Bibliography of Konkani Literature in Devanagari, Roman and Kannada characters'' (1963).&lt;ref name="tto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Ravindra Kelekar (7 March 1925 – 27 August 2010) was a noted Indian author who wrote primarily in the Konkani language, though he also wrote in Marathi and Hindi.[3] A Gandhian activist, freedom fighter and a pioneer in the modern Konkani movement, he is a well known Konkani scholar, linguist, and creative thinker. Kelkar was a participant in the Indian freedom movement, Goa's liberation movement, and later the campaign against the merger of the newly formed Goa with Maharashtra. He played a key role in the founding of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal, which lead the literary campaign for the recognition of Konkani as a full-fledged language, and its reinstatement as the state language of Goa.[4] He authored nearly 100 books in the Konkani language, including Amchi Bhas Konkaneech, Shalent Konkani Kityak, Bahu-bhashik Bharatant Bhashenche Samajshastra and Himalayant, and also edited Jaag magazine for more than two decades.

Kelekar died at Apollo Hospital at Margao, Goa at around 11.30 am on Friday 27 August. He was 85.[3][5][not in citation given] His remains were cremated with State honours at his native village of Priol.[2]

Kelekar received the Padma Bhushan (2008),[6][7] the Gomant Sharada Award of Kala Academy,[7] the Sahitya Akademi Award (1976),[8] and the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship (2007)—the highest award of the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters.[9] He also received the 2006 Jnanpith Award,[10] the first ever awarded to an author writing in the Konkani language,[1] which was presented in July 2010.[11]

Early life and education
Kelekar was born on 7 March 1925, in the city of Cuncolim in South Goa.[1] His father, Dr Rajaram Kelekar, was a physician who later became renowned for his Portuguese translation of the Bhagwad Gita.[7] While still a student at the Lyceum High School in Panaji, Kelekar joined the Goa liberation movement in 1946. This brought him in close contact with several local and national leaders, including Ram Manohar Lohia, under whose influence he was able to recognise the power of language to mobilise the local populace. Later, he saw the potential in his native Konkani language, which became his lifelong work.[7]

Career
Already deeply influenced by Gandhian philosophy, in 1949 Kelekar left his native Goa for Wardha, to be with noted Gandhian and writer Kakasaheb Kalelkar. Kelekar stayed under Kalelkar's tutelage until 1955, when he was appointed librarian of the Gandhi Memorial Museum in New Delhi. This turned out to be short-lived, as only a year later he plunged back into the Goa freedom movement. With a mission to reconnect the Goan diaspora all over the world, he started the weekly, Gomant Bharati (1956–60),[12] published in the Latin script in Bombay. Soon after, being an active participant in Goa's struggle for freedom, he was imprisoned by the Portuguese. He was released when the Indian Army invaded and annexed Goa in 1961.

He joined the socio-political campaign against the merger of Goa into the neighbouring Maharashtra state, which ended after the plebiscite of 1967, with Goa retaining its separate identity albeit as a union territory. Goa retained this status until 1987, when it was declared a separate state.

After Goa's independence, Kelekar took to literary activism, in the form of getting his native Konkani language its due status as an independent language, rather than as just a dialect of Marathi. He was compared favourably with pioneers in the Konkani literary movement, such as Shenoi Goembab.[13] During this period, he wrote some of his most important works promoting the Konkani language, including Aamchi Bhas Konkanich (1962), a dialogue revealing the importance of Konkani to the common man on the street; Shallent Konkani Kityaak (1962), highlighting the significance of having Konkani medium schools in Goa; and A Bibliography of Konkani Literature in Devanagari, Roman and Kannada characters (1963).[4][14] In February 1987, the Goa Legislative Assembly had passed the Official Language Bill making Konkani the Official Language of Goa.[15] The struggle ended in 1992, when Konkani was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution as an official language.[16] With life's mission completed, Kelkar retired from public life, focusing mainly of his writing.[7]

On 26 February 1975, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, recognised Konkani as an independent language.[citation needed] The first Sahitya Akademi Award for a work in Konkani was won by Kelekar for his travelogue, Himalayant, in 1977.[17][18][19] The Akademi's first Translation Award in Konkani also went to Kelekar in 1990 for Ami Taankan Manshant Haadle, a Konkani translation of a collection of essays in Gujarati, Mansaeena Diva, by Jhaverchand Meghani.[20] He received the 2006 Jnanpith Award, which was the first given to a Konkani-language writer.[10] The pinnacle of his career came with the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement in 2007.[9] A lifelong proponent of regional languages, in his acceptance speech for the Jnanpith award, he said, "People have stopped reading books in regional languages. On the other hand, through English, we have created Bonsai intellectuals, Bonsai writers and Bonsai readers."[21]

When the Vishwa Konkani Sahitya Academy, an offshoot of the Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation, was set up in 2006, the first work it took up for translation was Velavaylo Dhulo, a collection of Kelekar's essays.[22] His books have been translated into Hindi and other North Indian languages, and are used by universities.[23]

'''Religism''' is the tendency to believe in [[religious]] [[ideologies]] as opposed to [[Rationality|rational]] facts.
In many [[country|countries]] religism is preventing development towards a more modern society in either [[Human Development Index|material living conditions]] or [[human freedom]].
To the extreme religism can result in death by refusing a [[medical treatment]] to a patient because of religious beliefs.
Religism can also prevent people from choosing a loved partner or impede them access to a profession or an activity they would like to do.
Sometimes it also bars access to certain [[food]] types even in case of hunger.
Religism is often associated to an extreme grip of traditions and usually put a religion above rational thinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">In [[mathematics]], '''Serre's multiplicity conjectures''', named after [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], are certain purely algebraic problems, in [[commutative algebra]], motivated by the needs of [[algebraic geometry]]. Since [[André Weil]]'s initial definition of [[intersection number]]s, around 1949, there had been a question of how to provide a more flexible and computable theory.

Let ''R'' be a (Noetherian, commutative) [[regular local ring]] and ''P'' and ''Q'' be [[prime ideal]]s of ''R''. In 1958, Serre realized that classical algebraic-geometric ideas of multiplicity could be generalized using the concepts of [[homological algebra]]. Serre defined the [[intersection multiplicity]] of ''R/P'' and ''R/Q'' by means of the [[Tor functor]]s of [[homological algebra]], as

:&lt;math&gt;
\chi (R/P,R/Q):=\sum _{i=0}^{\infty}(-1)^i\ell_R (\mathrm{Tor} ^R_i(R/P,R/Q)).
&lt;/math&gt;

This requires the concept of the [[length of a module]], denoted here by &lt;math&gt;\ell_R&lt;/math&gt;, and the assumption that

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell _R((R/P)\otimes(R/Q)) &lt; \infty.
&lt;/math&gt;

If this idea were to work, however, certain classical relationships would presumably have to continue to hold. Serre singled out four important properties. These then became conjectures, challenging in the general case. (There are more general statements of these conjectures where ''R/P'' and ''R/Q'' are replaced by finitely generated modules: see Serre's Local Algebra for more details.)

==Dimension inequality==

: &lt;math&gt;\dim(R/P) + \dim(R/Q) \le \dim(R)&lt;/math&gt;

Serre proved this for all regular local rings. He established the following three properties when ''R'' is either of equal characteristic or of mixed characteristic and unramified (which in this case means that characteristic of the [[residue field]] is not an element of the square of the maximal ideal of the local ring), and conjectured that they hold in general.

==Nonnegativity==

: &lt;math&gt;\chi (R/P,R/Q) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;

This was proven by [[Ofer Gabber]] in 1995.

==Vanishing==

If

: &lt;math&gt;\dim (R/P) + \dim (R/Q) &lt; \dim (R)\ &lt;/math&gt;

then

: &lt;math&gt;\chi (R/P,R/Q) = 0.\ &lt;/math&gt;

This was proven in 1985 by [[Paul C. Roberts]], and independently by [[Henri Gillet]] and [[Christophe Soulé]].

==Positivity==

If

: &lt;math&gt;\dim (R/P) + \dim (R/Q) = \dim (R)\ &lt;/math&gt;

then

: &lt;math&gt;\chi (R/P,R/Q) &gt; 0.\ &lt;/math&gt;

This remains open.

'''Session wrestlers''', also known as "private wrestlers", wrestle an opponent as a service, for money, in a private setting. Typically, the service provider is a [[professional wrestler|professional (ring) wrestler]], [[amateur wrestler]], or [[bodybuilder]]. Session wrestlers most commonly are men who cater to a male clientele, but there are also women who provide the service, as well as female clients.

Some clients partake in private wrestling matches for the athletic challenge, but for most clients, engaging a private wrestler is a form of [[sexual fantasy]], fulfilling a desire for [[domination and submission (BDSM)|domination and submission]]. The sessions usually includes wrestling or fighting in which the provider is stronger or more skilled than their opponent. The fantasy may also have an intellectual or emotional component, with the client trying to (or pretending to try to) take control, but failing. Session wrestling rarely involves sex, or sex acts, though it may include nudity. The sessions also frequently involve [[muscle worship]].

The nature of the session is usually discussed and agreed to in the matchmaking stage. Also, discussed at this stage is the fee, location, rules, duration, and attire. The matches are commonly categorized into several types:

*'''Fantasy''' matches involve the acting out of a specific fantasy the client may have. This may include specific holds, attire, locations or [[roleplaying]]. Frequently the activities are agreed to in advance. The client typically makes no effort to win the match. Opponents are in this for the sexual overtone aspects of fantasy sessions.
*'''Semi-competitive''' matches allow the client to provide some resistance, but not to take enough initiative to try to win the match. The service provider may also "wrestle down" to the level of the client to make the match more interesting. The physical contact and holds are more important than who wins the match. This style of match may also allow the client to test the strength or skills of the provider without the intensity or injury risk of a competitive match.
*'''Competitive''' matches are an all-out attempt (though without attempting to injure) to win by both parties. A match of this type usually requires a proper facility with mats and sufficient space. Many female session providers avoid these matches due to the relatively high risk of injury.

==Mixed Wrestling==
'''[[Intergender wrestling|Mixed wrestling]]''' is a private session wrestling match between a woman and a man.  Many [[Female bodybuilding|female bodybuilders]] take part in mixed wrestling matches.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Commonly, these are fantasy matches taking place in apartments or hotel/motel rooms; the male opponent makes little effort to fight back, preferring to let the woman pin him down to enjoy the sexual fantasy of the experience.  Often the woman wears very little to no clothes.

[[File:Mumler (Lincoln).jpg|thumb|200px|One of Mumler's most famous images, purportedly showing [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] with the ghost of her husband, [[Abraham Lincoln]].]]

'''Spirit photography''' is a type of [[photography]] whose primary attempt is to capture images of [[ghosts]] and other [[spirit]]ual [[entities]], especially in [[ghost hunting]] and has a strong history dating back to the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Ogden"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ghosts and Hauntings|last= Ogden|first= Tom|year= 1999|publisher= [[Alpha Books]]|isbn= 978-0-02-863659-7|pages= 107–108|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CJ3jnDYzTF0C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=%22spirit+photography%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U38YJIiPr9Q8HPkllOLbX-T3yIhCw#PPA108,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Spirit photography was first used by [[William H. Mumler]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Ogden"/&gt; Mumler discovered the technique by accident, after he saw a second person in a photograph he took of himself, which he found was actually a [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]]. Seeing there was a market for it, Mumler started working as a [[mediumship|medium]], taking people's pictures and doctoring the negatives to add lost loved ones into them (mostly using other photographs as basis). Mumler's fraud was discovered after he put identifiable living Boston residents in the photos as spirits.

[[File:Williamhopehoax4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A spirit photograph taken by [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]]]]

Other spirit photographers also started to sell photographs. A later spirit photographer was [[Frederick Hudson (photographer)|Fred A. Hudson]], who took many spirit photographs for spiritualists in 1872. Through the 1880s into the early 20th century spirit photography remained popular, with notable proponents such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[William Crookes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah A. Willburn. (2006). ''Possessed Victorians: extra spheres in nineteenth-century mystical writings''. pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Tucker. (2005). ''Nature exposed: photography as eyewitness in Victorian science''. p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Stainton Moses]], another spiritualist, claimed that spirit photography operated by means of a fluid substance called [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]], in which the spirits take form.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1926). ''The History of Spiritualism, Volume 1''. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Some spiritualists authored books supporting spirit photography. Georgiana Houghton wrote ''Chronicles of the Photographs of Spiritual Beings and Phenomena Invisible to the Material Eye'' (1892) and James Coates wrote ''Photographing the Invisible'' (1911).

One of the later spirit photographers was [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]] (1863–1933). The psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] revealed that the photographs of Hope were frauds. Price secretly marked Hope's photographic plates, and provided him with a packet of additional plates that had been covertly etched with the brand image of the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd. in the knowledge that the logo would be transferred to any images created with them. Unaware that Price had tampered with his supplies, Hope then attempted to produce a number of Spirit photographs. Although Hope produced several images of spirits, none of his materials contained the Imperial Dry Plate Co. Ltd logo, or the marks that Price had put on Hope's original equipment, showing that he had exchanged prepared materials containing fake spirit images for the provided materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1933). ''Leaves from a psychist's case-book''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Polidoro. [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/photos_of_ghosts_the_burden_of_believing_the_unbelievable Photos of Ghosts: "The Burden of Believing the Unbelievable"]. Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hope still retained a noted following from spiritualists such as Charles Lakeman Tweedale author of ''Man's Survival After Death'' (1920) as well as the author and [[spiritualist]] [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who refused to accept any evidence that Hope was a fraud and went to great lengths to clear his name, including writing a book supporting spirit photography, ''The Case for Spirit Photography'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1922). ''The Case for Spirit Photography''.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research'', Price listed many spirit photographers who had been exposed as frauds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (2003). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Price who had spent most of his life studying psychical phenomena wrote that "There is ''no'' good evidence that a spirit photograph has ever been produced"&lt;ref&gt;[[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]]. (1975). ''Beware Familiar Spirits''. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;, which is also the view of most [[Parapsychologists|psychical researchers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence]]. (2011). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''. Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other spirit photographers exposed as frauds include [[David Duguid]] and [[Edward Wyllie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell]]. (2001). ''Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal''. The University Press of Kentucky. pp. 260–261. Also see [[Joe Nickell]]. (2005). ''Camera Clues: A Handbook for Photographic Investigation''. The University Press of Kentucky. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Pearsall]] exposed the tricks of spirit photography in his book ''The Table-Rappers'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Pearsall]]. (1972). ''The Table-Rappers''. Book Club Associates. pp. 118–125&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Orbs"==
[[File:House Dust Orbs.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Light reflecting off dust particles]]
According to [[University of Westminster]] professor Annette Hill, unusual light sources were often interpreted as "ghost lights" in spirit photography. Hill says that with the advent of [[digital photography]], "the ghost light is re-imagined as an orb", and many paranormal-themed websites show pictures containing visual artifacts they refer to as "orbs" that are claimed and debated as evidence of spirit presence, especially among [[ghost hunting|ghost hunters]].&lt;ref name="Hill2010"&gt;Annette Hill.

The '''Swazi''', '''Swati''' or '''siSwati''' language ({{small|Swazi:}} ''siSwati'' {{IPA-zu|siswatʼi|}}) is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] of the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] group spoken in [[Swaziland]] (officially the Kingdom of Eswatini) and [[South Africa]] by the [[Swazi people]]. The number of speakers is estimated to be in the region of 12 million. The language is taught in Swaziland and some South African schools in [[Mpumalanga]], particularly former [[KaNgwane]] areas. Swazi is an official language of Swaziland (along with English), and is also one of the eleven official languages of South Africa.

Although the preferred term is "Swati" among native speakers, in English it is generally referred to as ''Swa'''z'''i''. Swazi is most closely related to the other "Tekela" [[Nguni languages]], like [[Phuthi]] and [[Northern Transvaal]] (Sumayela) Ndebele, but is also very close to the "Zunda" Nguni languages: [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Southern Ndebele language|Southern Ndebele]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]].

==Dialects==
Swazi spoken in Swaziland can be divided into four dialects corresponding to the four administrative regions of the country: [[Hhohho]], [[Lubombo District|Lubombo]], [[Manzini, Swaziland|Manzini]], and [[Shiselweni]].

Swazi has at least two varieties: the standard, prestige variety spoken mainly in the north, centre and southwest of the country, and a less prestigious variety spoken elsewhere.

In the far south, especially in towns such as [[Nhlangano]] and [[Hlatikhulu]], the variety of the language spoken is significantly influenced by isiZulu. Many Swazis (plural ''emaSwati,'' singular ''liSwati''), including those in the south who speak this variety, do not regard it as 'proper' Swazi. This is what may be referred to as the second dialect in the country. The sizeable number of Swazi speakers in South Africa (mainly in the [[Mpumalanga]] province, and in [[Soweto]]) are considered by Swaziland Swazi speakers to speak a non-standard form of the language.

Unlike the variant in the south of Swaziland, the Mpumalanga variety appears to be less influenced by Zulu, and is thus considered closer to standard Swazi. However, this Mpumalanga variety is distinguishable by distinct [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], and perhaps distinct [[tone (Linguistics)|tone]] patterns. Intonation patterns (and informal perceptions of 'stress') in Mpumalanga Swazi are often considered discordant to the Swazi ear. This South African variety of Swazi is considered to exhibit influence from other South African languages spoken close to Swazi.

A feature of the standard prestige variety of Swazi (spoken in the north and centre of Swaziland) is the royal style of slow, heavily stressed enunciation, which is anecdotally claimed to have a 'mellifluous' feel to its hearers.

Swazi does not distinguish between places of articulation in its clicks. They are [[dental click|dental]] (as {{IPA|[ǀ]}}) or might also be [[Alveolar click|alveolar]] (as {{IPA|[ǃ]}}). It does, however, distinguish five or six manners of articulation and of manner, including tenuis, aspirated, voiced, breathy voiced, nasal, and breathy-voiced nasal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Taljaard, Khumalo, Bosch, van Schaik (1991) ''Handbook of SiSwati''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

The Swazi noun (''{{lang|ss|libito}}'') consists of two essential parts, the prefix (''{{lang|ss|sicalo}}'') and the stem (''{{lang|ss|umsuka}}''). Using the prefixes, nouns can be grouped into noun classes, which are numbered consecutively, to ease comparison with other [[Bantu languages]].

The following table gives an overview of Swazi noun classes, arranged according to singular-plural pairs.

{| class="wikitable"

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; '''umu-''' replaces '''um-''' before monosyllabic stems, e. g. '''&lt;u&gt;umu&lt;/u&gt;ntfu''' (person).

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''s-''' and '''t-''' replace '''si-''' and '''ti-''' respectively before stems beginning with a vowel, e.g. '''&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;andla'''/'''&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;andla''' (hand/hands).

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The placeholder '''N''' in the prefixes '''iN-''' and '''tiN-''' for '''m''', '''n''' or no letter at all.
