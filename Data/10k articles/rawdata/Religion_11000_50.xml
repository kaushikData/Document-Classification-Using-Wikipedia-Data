'''''Apologia Pro Vita Sua''''' ([[Latin]]: ''A defence of one's own life'') is [[John Henry Newman]]'s defence of his religious opinions, published in 1864 in response to [[Charles Kingsley]] of the Church of England after Newman quit his position as the Anglican vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford.

==Description==
John Henry Newman was regarded as a premier religious figure even before writing this definitive essay. The backdrop for the essay was a mid-century Anglican theological controversy in which Newman and other Anglicans were calling for a return to a former more disciplined and traditional authoritarian hierarchy.

Friction during the years from 1833 to 1841 led Newman and his allies in the Oxford Movement to publish a statement, the ''Tracts for the Times'', to which Newman was a contributor. The tensions culminated in Newman's 1845 resignation as Anglican vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford and his departure from the Anglican church seeking the Roman Catholics.&lt;sup&gt;[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

One of Newman's rivals was Anglican [[Charles Kingsley]] of the [[broad church]] party, who responded to Newman's departure with attacks impeaching his truthfulness and honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmanreader.org/works/apologia65/index.html|title=Apologia pro Vita Sua|last=Newman|first=John Henry|date=|website=newmanreader.org|publisher=|access-date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowing, almost poetic prose of the Apologia Pro Vita Sua was a spiritual autobiographical defense to Kingsley's attacks.

Newman's book was influential with both churches and Newman was ultimately ordained by the Roman Catholics, where he soon became established as one of the foremost exponents of [[Catholicism]] in England.&lt;sup&gt;[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The book was very well received and became a bestseller, remaining in print today. A revised version of the ''Apologia Pro Vita Sua'' with many passages rewritten and some parts omitted, was published in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Svaglic, Martin J. (1952).

'''Apostasy in Islam''' ({{lang-ar|ردة}} ''{{transl|ar|riddah}}'' or {{lang|ar|ارتداد}} ''{{transl|ar|irtidād}}'') is commonly defined as the conscious abandonment of [[Islam]] by a [[Muslim]] in word or through deed.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Griffel, Apostasy, in (Editor: Gerhard Bowering et al.)

[[Apostasy]] in Islam includes within its scope not only the wilful renunciation of Islam by a Muslim through a declaration of renunciation of the Islamic faith (whether for another religion or [[irreligious|irreligiosity]]), or (in the absence of a declaration) by specific deed of undergoing the rites of conversion into another religion, but also even denying, or merely questioning, any "fundamental tenet or [[Aqidah (Islamic theology)|creed]]" of Islam, such as the divinity of [[God in Islam|God]], prophethood of Muhammad, or mocking God, or worshipping one or more [[Shirk (Islam)|idols]].&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;&lt;ref name=rottrav/&gt; Different Muslim denominations and schools of thought may hold different additional views of what each considers a fundamental tenet of the faith. It does not include individuals who were forced to embrace Islam under conditions of duress, or acts against Islam or conversion to another religion that is involuntary, forced or done as concealment out of fear of [[Persecution of Muslims|persecution]] or during [[War in Islam|war]] ([[Taqiya|Taqiyya]] or [[Kitman]]).&lt;ref name="R.

Until the late 19th century, the vast majority of Islamic scholars in [[Madh'hab|Madh'hab (Sunni)]] and [[Imamah|Imamah (Shia)]] schools of [[jurisprudence]] held that for adult men, apostasy from Islam was a crime as well as a sin, an act of treason punishable with the [[death penalty]],&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis-1995-229"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Lewis|first1= Bernard|title= The Middle East, a Brief History of the Last 2000 Years|date= 1995|publisher= Touchstone Books|isbn= 978-0684807126|page= 229|url= https://books.google.com/?id=1ajwK7ejowwC&amp;pg=PT234&amp;lpg=PT234&amp;dq=%22crime+as+well+as+a+sin%22+lewis|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically after a waiting period to allow the apostate time to repent and to return to Islam.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;&lt;ref name=aromar/&gt;&lt;ref name="KEY"&gt;{{cite book|author1= Kecia Ali|author2= Oliver Leaman|title= Islam: the key concepts|publisher= Routledge|year= 2008|page= 10|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H5-CdzqmuXsC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate= 2013-11-29|isbn= 9780415396387|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131212074154/http://books.google.com/books?id=H5-CdzqmuXsC&amp;pg=PA10|archivedate= 12 December 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnesposito&gt;{{cite book|author= John L.

[[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0199730938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wael Hallaq]] states that "[in] a culture whose lynchpin is religion, religious principles and religious morality, apostasy is in some way equivalent to high treason in the modern nation-state".&lt;ref name="waelhallaq"&gt;{{cite book|last1= [[Wael Hallaq|Wael]]|first1= [[Wael Hallaq|B.

These institutions set the standard for what counts as apostasy from Islam so high that at least prior to the 11th century practically no judgment of apostasy could be passed.&lt;ref name="Princeton.Enc.2013"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Gerhard Bowering|others=associate editors Patricia Crone, Wadid Kadi, Devin J.

In the late 19th century, the use of criminal penalties for apostasy fell into disuse, although civil penalties were still applied.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;

According to Abdul Rashied Omar, the majority of modern Islamic jurists continue to regard apostasy as a crime deserving the [[Capital and corporal punishment in Islam|death penalty]].&lt;ref name=aromar&gt;{{cite book|last= Omar|first= Abdul Rashied|editor1= Mohammed Abu-Nimer|editor2= David Augsburger|title= Peace-Building by, between, and beyond Muslims and Evangelical Christians|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HvrDWka4iRgC&amp;pg=186|date= 16 February 2009|publisher= Lexington Books|chapter= The Right to religious conversion: Between apostasy and proselytization|isbn= 978-0-7391-3523-5|pages= 179–94|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160111010040/https://books.google.com/books?id=HvrDWka4iRgC&amp;pg=186|archivedate= 11 January 2016|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard apostasy in Islam as a form of religious crime, although others do not.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcsudan&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27424064 Sudan woman faces death for apostasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519054610/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27424064 |date=19 May 2014 }} BBC News (15 May 2014); Quote "There is a long-running debate in Islam over whether apostasy is a crime.

===Hadith===
{{See also|Malik ibn Nuwayrah|Criticism of Hadith}}
In contrast to the Qur'an, [[hadith]] literature gives contradictory statements about punishments for apostasy.&lt;ref name=smz&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zwemer |first1=Samuel M. |title=The Law of Apostasy |journal= The Muslim World |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages= 36–37, chapter 2 |issn= 0027-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Griffel (2007), ''Apostasy'', in Encyclopedia of Islam, 3rd Edition, Leiden: Brill, Eds: Gudrun Kramer et al, Vol. 1, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], the most important book in Sunni Islam after the [[Quran]], and [[Sahih Muslim]] punishments for apostasy are described as follows:&lt;ref name=sherazadhamit&gt;Sherazad Hamit (2006), Apostasy and the Notion of Religious Freedom in Islam, Macalester Islam Journal, Volume 1, Spring 2006 Issue 2, pp. 32–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Forte (1994), Apostasy and Blasphemy in Pakistan, Conn.

{{quotation|Allah's Apostle said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims." |{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|17}}, see also {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|16|4152}}, {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|16|4154}}}}

On the other hand, there are hadiths stating apostates were not sentenced to death:

{{quotation|A man from among the Ansar accepted Islam, then he apostatized and went back to Shirk. Then he regretted that, and sent word to his people (saying): 'Ask the Messenger of Allah [SAW], is there any repentance for me?' His people came to the Messenger of Allah [SAW] and said: 'So and so regrets (what he did), and he has told us to ask you if there is any repentance for him?' Then the Verses: 'How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their Belief up to His saying: Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful' was revealed.

{{quotation|There was a Christian who became Muslim and read the Baqarah and the Al Imran, and he used to write for the Prophet.

Allah's Apostle said: "Medina is like a pair of bellows (furnace): It expels its impurities and brightens and clears its good." |{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|89|316}}}}

This is also sometimes cited as an example of open apostasy that was left unpunished.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. M. E. Subhani (2005), ''Apostasy in Islam'', pp. 23–24. New Delhi, India: Global Media Publications. Quote: "This was an open case of apostasy. But the Prophet neither punished the Bedouin nor asked anyone to do it. He allowed him to leave Madina. Nobody harmed him."&lt;/ref&gt;

And in the [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]] of [[Malik ibn Anas|Imam Malik]] one finds:

{{quotation|Malik related to me from Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abd al-Qari that his father said, "A man came to Umar ibn al-Khattab from Abu Musa al-Ashari. Umar asked after various people, and he informed him. Then Umar inquired, 'Do you have any recent news?' He said, 'Yes. A man has become a kafir after his Islam.' Umar asked, 'What have you done with him?' He said, 'We let him approach and struck off his head.' Umar said, 'Didn't you imprison him for three days and feed him a loaf of bread every day and call on him to tawba that he might turn in tawba and return to the command of Allah?' Then Umar said, 'O Allah! I was not present and I did not order it and I am not pleased since it has come to me!'|{{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|36|18|16}}}}

According to the [[Fiqh Council of North America]], the above hadith are often misunderstood as justifying the killing of people for changes in belief, when the people cited in the hadith were actually guilty of changing their allegiances to the armies fighting the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiqhcouncil.org/node/34|title=Is Apostasy a Capital Crime in Islam?|last=Badawi|first=Dr. Jamal|publisher=[[Fiqh Council of North America]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322112530/http://www.fiqhcouncil.org/node/34|archivedate=22 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They point this out by showing the differences in the oft-cited hadith to justify punishment of apostates from different books of the [[Kutub al-Sittah|six most important collections of hadith]] for Sunni Muslims. For example, here the phrase "one who reverts from Islam and leaves the Muslims" is changed to "one who goes forth to fight Allah and His Apostle":

{{quotation|Allah's Apostle said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims." |{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|9|83|17}}}}

{{quotation|Allah's Apostle said: "The blood of a Muslim man who testifies that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is Allah's Apostle should not lawfully be shed except only for one of three reasons: a man who committed fornication after marriage, in which case he should be stoned; one who goes forth to fight Allah and His Apostle, in which case he should be killed or crucified or exiled from the land; or one who commits murder for which he is killed." |{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|38|4339}}}}

==What constitutes apostasy in Islam==
Apostasy is called ''irtidād'' (which literally means relapse or regress) or ''ridda'' in Islamic literature; an apostate is called ''murtadd'', which means 'one who turns back' from Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Heffening, W. (2012), "Murtadd." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs; Brill&lt;/ref&gt; According to some, someone born to a Muslim parent or one who has previously converted to Islam becomes a ''murtadd'' if he or she verbally denies any principle of belief prescribed by Qur'an or a Hadith, deviates from approved Islamic tenets (''ilhad''), or if he or she commits a [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemy]] such as treating a copy of the Qurʾan with disrespect.&lt;ref name="Morgan 2010 p.183"&gt;{{cite book | last=Morgan | first=Diane | title=Essential Islam : a comprehensive guide to belief and practice | publisher=Praeger | location=Santa Barbara, USA | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-313-36025-1 | pages=183–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt, W.

The jurist Imam Ibnul Humam (d. 681 [[Hijri year|AH]]) wrote in his book ''Fathul Qadir'':

{{Quotation|The reason to kill an apostate is only with the intent to eliminate the danger of war, and not for the reason of his disbelief. The punishment of disbelief is far greater with God. Therefore, only such an apostate shall be killed who is actively engaged in war; and usually it is a man, and not a woman. For the same reason, the Holy Prophet has forbidden to kill women. And for this very reason, an apostate female could be killed if she in fact instigates and causes war by her influence and armed force at her disposal. She is not killed because of her apostasy, but for her creating disorder (through war) on earth.|Imam Ibnul Humam&lt;ref name="ahmad-2005-139"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wnHnLcw_OQsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Ibnul+Humam++%27%27Fathul+Qadir%27%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f-3FVBI0Rh&amp;sig=LpRMa0gA8pdPsSBEdmuqX1xA2m4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR9NON2KzJAhUIXB4KHVH_C2sQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Truth about the Alleged Punishment for Apostasy in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111010039/https://books.google.com/books?id=wnHnLcw_OQsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Ibnul+Humam++%27%27Fathul+Qadir%27%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f-3FVBI0Rh&amp;sig=LpRMa0gA8pdPsSBEdmuqX1xA2m4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR9NON2KzJAhUIXB4KHVH_C2sQ6AEIMjAD |date=11 January 2016 }}, Mirza Tahir Ahmad, Islam International Publications, 2005, pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A person is considered apostate if he or she converts from Islam to another religion.&lt;ref name="Morgan 2010 p.183"/&gt; Apostasy can occur even if one does not formally renounce Islam.&lt;ref name="Morgan 2010 p.183"/&gt; Those who were forced to denounce Islam under conditions of duress or out of fear of [[Persecution of Muslims|persecution]] or during [[War in Islam|war]] ([[Taqiya|Taqiyya]] or [[Kitman]]) are not considered apostates.&lt;ref name="R. Ibrahim 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J.T. Munroe 2004"/&gt;

Evidence of apostasy in Islam, according to [[Reliance of the Traveller]], a 14th-century manual of the [[Shafi'i]] school of jurisprudence ([[Fiqh]]), includes:&lt;ref name=rottrav/&gt;

{{quote|
(a) bowing before sun, moon, objects of nature, idols, cross or any images symbolically representing God whether in mere contrariness, sarcastically or with conviction;

(b) intention to commit unbelief, even if one hesitates to do so;

(c) speak words that imply unbelief such as "Allah is the third of three" or "I am Allah";

(d) revile, question, wonder, doubt, mock or deny the existence of God or Prophet of Islam or that the Prophet was sent by God;

(e) revile, deny, or mock any verse of the Quran, or the religion of Islam;

(f) to deny the obligatory character of something considered obligatory by [[Ijma]] (consensus of Muslims);

(g) believe that things in themselves or by their nature have cause independent of the will of God;
}}

Al-Ghazali held that apostasy occurs when a Muslim denies the essential dogmas: monotheism, Muhammad's prophecy, and the Last Judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ess | first=Josef | title=The flowering of Muslim theology | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-674-02208-9 | quote=But, added al-Ghazali, that applies only to Muslim apostates, and one commits apostasy only when one denies the essential dogmas: monotheism, Muhammad's prophecy, and the Last Judgment. | page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early Islamic history, after Muhammad's death, the declaration of Prophethood by anyone was automatically deemed to be proof of apostasy.&lt;ref name="Siddiq 1995 pp. 275-328"/&gt; This view has continued to the modern age in the rejection of the [[Persecution of Ahmadis|Ahmadiyya]] sect of Islam as apostates by mainstream Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, because Ahmadis consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as a modern-day Prophet.&lt;ref name="Siddiq 1995 pp. 275-328"&gt;Siddiq &amp; Ahmad (1995), Enforced Apostasy: Zaheeruddin v.

There are disagreements among Islamic scholars, and Islamic schools of jurisprudence, as to who can be judged for the crime of apostasy in Islam. Some in Shafi'i fiqh such as Nawawi and al-Misri state that the apostasy code applies to a Muslim who 
:(a) has understood and professed that "there is no God but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God" ([[shahada]]), 
:(b) knows the shariah necessarily known by all Muslims,

In the contemporary [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]], at least one conservative jurist, Ayatollah [[Mohsen Araki]], has attempted to reconcile following the traditional doctrine while addressing the principle of freedom of religion enshrined in the Islamic Republic's constitution. At a 2009 human rights conference at Mofid University in [[Qom]], Araki stated that "if an individual doubts Islam, he does not become the subject of punishment, but if the doubt is openly ''expressed'', this is not permissible." As one observer ([[Sadakat Kadri]]) noted, this "freedom" has the advantage that "state officials could not punish an unmanifested belief even if they wanted to".&lt;ref name="kadri-249"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ..|date=2012 |publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277 |page=249 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Muslim converts to Christianity, Duane Alexander Miller (2016) identified two different categories:
#'Muslims followers of Jesus Christ', 'Jesus Muslims' or 'Messianic Muslims' (analogous to [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jews]]), who continue to self-identify as 'Muslims', or at least say Islam is (part of) their 'culture' rather than religion, but "understand themselves to be following Jesus as he is portrayed in the Bible".
#'Christians from a Muslim background' (abbreviated CMBs), also known as 'ex-Muslim Christians', who have completely abandoned Islam in favour of Christianity.
Miller introduced the term 'Muslim-background believers' (MBBs) to encompass both groups, adding that the latter group are generally regarded as apostates from Islam, but orthodox Muslims' opinions on the former group is more mixed (either that 'Muslim followers of Jesus' are '[[heterodoxy|heterodox]] Muslims', '[[heresy|heretical]] Muslims' or '[[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christian]] liars').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=Duane Alexander |date=2016 |title=Living among the Breakage: Contextual Theology-Making and Ex-Muslim Christians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeE3DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 |location=9781498284165 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |pages=49–52 |isbn=9781498284165 |accessdate=16 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320224424/https://books.google.com/books?id=WeE3DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 |archivedate=20 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law (sharia), the view among the majority of medieval [[Faqīh|jurists]] was that a male apostate must be put to death unless he suffers from a [[mental disorder]] or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni Hanafi school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1993|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|volume=7|pages=635–6|isbn=978-90-04-09419-2|author=Heffening, W.|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|article=Murtadd|editor1=C.E.

Many Islamic scholars have viewed apostasy as a ''[[hadd]]'' (pl. ''hudud'') crime, i.e. a crime with a scripturally prescribed punishment,&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;&lt;ref name=meap168&gt;Mohamed El-Awa (1993), Punishment in Islamic Law, American Trust Publications, {{ISBN|978-0892591428}}, pp. 53–54, 1–68&lt;/ref&gt; although this classification has been contested by Hanafi and Shafi'i jurists,&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt; as well as by some notable scholars of other schools, such as the Malikite [[Abu al-Walid al-Baji]] and Hanbalite [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].&lt;ref name=Kamali/&gt;

Under traditional Islamic law an apostate may be given a waiting period while in incarceration to repent and accept Islam again and if not the apostate is to be killed without any reservations.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt; This traditional view of Sunni and Shia Islamic [[fiqh]]s, or schools of jurisprudence ([[Madhhab|maḏāhib]]) each with their own interpretation of Sharia, varies as follows:&lt;ref name=fgriffel&gt;Frank Griffel (2001), Toleration and exclusion: al-Shafi 'i and al-Ghazali on the treatment of apostates, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 64(03), pp. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zwemer|first1=Samuel M.|title=The Law of Apostasy|journal=The Muslim World|volume=14|issue=4|pages=41–42, Chapter 2|issn=0027-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dforte&gt;David F Forte (2011), [http://www.cepos.eu/pdf/revista%20de%20stiinte%20politice%20nr%2029.pdf Islam’s Trajectory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903101606/http://www.cepos.eu/pdf/revista%20de%20stiinte%20politice%20nr%2029.pdf |date=3 September 2014 }}, Revue des Sciences Politiques, No. 29, pp. 93, 97–98, 92–101&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to legal historian [[Sadakat Kadri]], while apostasy was traditionally punished by death, executions were rare because "it was widely believed" that any accused apostate "who repented by articulating the ''[[shahada]]''" (''LA ILAHA ILLALLAH'' "There is no God but God") "had to be forgiven" and their punishment delayed until after Judgement Day. This principle was upheld "even in extreme situations", such as when an offender adopts Islam "only for fear of death", based on the hadith that Muhammad had upbraided a follower for killing a raider who had uttered the shahada.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad had been unimpressed by claims that the dead man had adopted Islam only for fear of death. `Who will absolve you, Usama,` he asked the killer repeatedly, for ignoring the confession of faith?`"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnah.org/aqida/forty_hadith_merits_tahlil.htm#_ftnref28 Forty Hadiths on the Merit of Saying La Ilaha Illallah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904045814/http://www.sunnah.org/aqida/forty_hadith_merits_tahlil.htm |date=4 September 2015 }}| Compiled by Dr. G.F.

===Civil liabilities===
In Islam, apostasy has been traditionally considered both a religious crime and a civil liability; the punishment for the former includes death or prison, while the latter leads to civil penalties.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Emon | first=Anver | title=Islamic law and international human rights law | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-19-964144-4 | pages=229–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in all [[madhhab]]s of Islam, (a) the property of the apostate is seized and distributed to his or her Muslim relatives; (b) his or her marriage [[Annulment|annulled]] (''faskh''); (c) any children removed and considered ward of the Islamic state.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt; In case the entire family has left Islam, or there are no surviving Muslim relatives recognized by Sharia, the apostate's property is liquidated by the Islamic state (part of ''fay'', الْفيء). In case the apostate is not executed, such as in case of women apostates in Hanafi school, the person also loses all inheritance rights.&lt;ref name=smz/&gt;&lt;ref name=fkazemi&gt;Kazemi F. (2000), [https://web.archive.org/web/20020909222846/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/HST451/Readings/Kazemi1.html Gender, Islam, and politics], Social Research, Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 453-74&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=November 2015}} Hanafi Sunni school of jurisprudence allows waiting till execution, before children and property are seized; other schools do not consider this wait as mandatory.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;

===Other views on punishment===
Various early Muslim scholars did not agree with the death penalty, among them Ibrahim al-Nakha'i (d. 715) and [[Sufyan al-Thawri]] and their followers, who rejected the death penalty and prescribed indefinite imprisonment until repentance. The Hanafi jurist [[Sarakhsi]] also called for different punishments between the non-seditious religious apostasy and that of seditious and political nature, or [[high treason]].&lt;ref name=Saeed&gt;{{Cite book| publisher= Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn = 978-0-7546-3083-8| last = Saeed| first = Abdullah| author2 = Hassan Saeed| title = Freedom of religion, apostasy and Islam| year = 2004|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QAE&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| edition = 1st| last=Saeed | first=Abdullah |publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-415-77529-8| others = Oliver Leaman  et al.

Medieval Islamic scholars also differed on the punishment of a female apostate: death, enslavement, or imprisonment until repentance. [[Abu Hanifa]] and his followers refused the death penalty for female apostates, supporting imprisonment until they re-embrace Islam. Hanafi scholars maintain that a female apostate should not be killed because it was forbidden to kill women under Sharia.&lt;ref name=QAE /&gt; In contrast, Maliki, Shafii, Hanbali and Ja'fari scholars interpreted other parts of Sharia to permit death as possible punishment for Muslim apostate women, in addition to confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zwemer|first1=Samuel M.|title=The Law of Apostasy|journal=The Muslim World|volume=14|issue=4|pages=42–43, Chapter 2|issn=0027-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to execution===

Over the centuries a number of prominent [[ulema]], including the Maliki jurist [[Abu al-Walid al-Baji]] (d. 474 [[Hijri year|AH]]) and [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263–1328), held that apostasy is not a [[hadd]] crime and thus is liable only to a discretionary punishment (''[[Tazir|ta'zir]]'').&lt;ref name=Kamali&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1163/026805598125826102 |jstor=3382008 |title=Punishment in Islamic Law: a Critique of The Hudud Bill of Kelantan, Malaysia |year=1998 |last1=Kamali |first1=Mohammad Hashim |authorlink=Mohammad Hashim Kamali |journal=[[Arab Law Quarterly]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early authorities, such as [[Ibrahim al-Nakhai]] and [[Sufyan al-Thawri]], as well as the Hanafi jurist [[Sarakhsi]] (d. 1090), believed that an apostate should be asked to repent indefinitely and never condemned to death.&lt;ref name=Kamali/&gt;&lt;ref name=Saeed122&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| isbn = 978-0-7546-3083-8| last = Saeed| first = Abdullah| author2 = Hassan Saeed| title = Freedom of religion, apostasy and Islam| year = 2004| page = 122| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MrhBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT122| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180320224424/https://books.google.com/books?id=MrhBDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT122| archivedate = 20 March 2018| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarakhsi, apostasy from Islam is a great offense, but its punishment is postponed until the Day of Judgement.&lt;ref name=Saeed122/&gt; The view that the Quran speaks only of otherworldly punishment for apostasy was also held by the [[Grand Imam of Al-Azhar]] (1958-1963) [[Mahmud Shaltut]], who held that the prescription of death penalty for apostasy found in hadith was aimed at prevention of aggression against Muslims and sedition against the state.&lt;ref name=Kamali/&gt; Contemporary scholar [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] quotes a number of [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]] or early Islamic scholars (Ibn al-Humam, [[al-Marghinani]], [[Ibn Abbas]], Sarakhsi, Ibrahim al-Nakh'i) to argue that there was not a ''[[ijma]]'' (consensus among scholars or community) in favor of execution of murtadd in early Islam.&lt;ref name="ahmad-2005-139-142"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wnHnLcw_OQsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Ibnul+Humam++%27%27Fathul+Qadir%27%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f-3FVBI0Rh&amp;sig=LpRMa0gA8pdPsSBEdmuqX1xA2m4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR9NON2KzJAhUIXB4KHVH_C2sQ6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Truth about the Alleged Punishment for Apostasy in Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111010039/https://books.google.com/books?id=wnHnLcw_OQsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Ibnul+Humam++%27%27Fathul+Qadir%27%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f-3FVBI0Rh&amp;sig=LpRMa0gA8pdPsSBEdmuqX1xA2m4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR9NON2KzJAhUIXB4KHVH_C2sQ6AEIMjAD |date=11 January 2016 }}, Mirza Tahir Ahmad, Islam International Publications, 2005, pp. 139–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tariq Ramadan]] states that given "the way the Prophet behaved with the people who left Islam (like Hishâm and 'Ayyash) or who converted to Christianity (such as Ubaydallah ibn Jahsh), it should be stated that one who changes her/his religion should not be killed". He further states that "there can be no compulsion or coercion in matters of faith not only because it is explicitly forbidden in the Qur'an but also because free conscious and choice and willing submission are foundational to the first pillar (declaration of faith) and essential to the very definition of Islam. Therefore, someone leaving Islam or converting to another religion must be free to do so and her/his choice must be respected."&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/tariq-ramadan-on-apostasy Tariq Ramadan on Apostasy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615020040/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/tariq-ramadan-on-apostasy |date=15 June 2015 }} (25 July 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reza Aslan]] argues that the idea that apostasy is treason rather than exercise of freedom of religion is not so much part of Islam, as part of the pre-modern era when classical Islamic ''[[fiqh]]'' was developed, and when "''every'' religion was a `religion of the sword`".&lt;ref name="Aslan-81"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aslan|first1=Reza|title=No god but God (Updated Edition): The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam|date=2011|publisher=Random House|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VRmSGOjiE2oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=aslan++%60religion+of+the+sword.%60#v=snippet&amp;q=%20%60religion%20of%20the%20sword.%60&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111010040/https://books.google.com/books?id=VRmSGOjiE2oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=aslan++%60religion+of+the+sword.%60&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj19u_4s6zJAhWCNT4KHfscCkYQ6AEINzAD#v=snippet&amp;q=%20%60religion%20of%20the%20sword.%60&amp;f=false|archivedate=11 January 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780679643777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was also an era in which religion and the state were one unified entity. ... no Jew, Christian, Zoroastrian, or Muslim of this time would have considered his or her religion to be rooted in the personal confessional experiences of individuals. ... Your religion was your ethnicity, your culture, and your social identity... your religion was your citizenship.&lt;ref name="Aslan-81"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The [[Sasanian Empire]] had its officially sanctioned and legally enforced version of [[Zoroastrianism]].

The [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]], a minority sect found in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]], rejects any form of punishment for apostasy whatsoever in this world, citing hadith, Quran, and the opinions of classical Islamic [[faqih|jurists]] to justify its views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alislam.org/books/apostacy/index.html |title=Punishment of Apostacy in Islam |publisher=Alislam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112040331/http://www.alislam.org/books/apostacy/index.html |archivedate=12 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ahmadiyya Muslims are widely considered as non-Muslim apostates and [[Persecution of Ahmadis|persecuted]] by mainstream Islam, because of their beliefs.&lt;ref name="Siddiq 1995 pp. 275-328"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burhani A.

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] explains that "According to all the theories of language elaborated by Muslim legal scholars, the Qur'anic proclamation that 'There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has been distinguished from error' is as absolute and universal a statement as one finds. The truth had been made clear, and now, 'Whoever wants, let him believe, and whoever wants, let him disbelieve,'  the holy book continues (2:256, 18:29).

[[Khaled Abou El Fadl]] claims that the verses (88:21–22) emphasizes that even Muhammad does not have the right to think of himself as a warden who has the power to coerce people. This is reaffirmed by many of the historical reports regarding the Qur'anic revelation that emphasize that belief and conviction cannot be coerced. He further states that moderates consider the verse (2:256) to be enunciating a general, overriding principle that cannot be contradicted by isolated traditions attributed to the Prophet. He concludes that moderates do not believe that there is any punishment that attaches to apostasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Abou El Fadl]]|first1=[[Khaled Abou El Fadl|Khaled]]|title=The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists|date=23 January 2007|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0061189036|pages=158–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmet Albayrak explains in ''The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia'' that regarding apostasy as a wrongdoing is not a sign of intolerance of other religions, and is not aimed at one's freedom to choose a religion or to leave Islam and embrace another faith, but that on the contrary, it is more correct to say that the punishment is enforced as a safety precaution when warranted if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder (''fitna''). At this point, what is punished is the action of ridiculing the high moral flavour of Islam and posing a threat to public order. Otherwise, Islam prohibits spying on people and investigating their private lives, beliefs and personal opinions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated526"/&gt;

[[Enayatullah Subhani]] argues that death penalty mentioned in the Hadith is not for the apostates, rather it is the punishment of collective conspiracy and treason against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Subhani|first1=M E Asad|title=apostasy in islam|date=2005|publisher=Global Media|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8188869114|pages=65|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K9awNGOO9QoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=apostasy+in+Islam+by+subhani+global+media%27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210181007/https://books.google.com.my/books?id=K9awNGOO9QoC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=apostasy+in+Islam+by+subhani+global+media%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8u9wbU7NR9&amp;sig=9wva_12xvf9CGQNl5xDaXU1Mrbw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpqOKb5JrZAhVHLI8KHZ1-BiIQ6AEIQzAF|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hadiths====
{{See also|Abdullah ibn Saad|Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh}}
Writing in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', Heffening holds that contrary to the Qur'an, "in traditions [i.e. hadith], there is little echo of these punishments in the next world... and instead, we have in many traditions a new element, the death penalty."&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;W. Heffening, in ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} [[Wael Hallaq]] states the death penalty reflects a later reality and does not stand in accord with the deeds of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="EoQ" /&gt;

[[Hussein-Ali Montazeri|Ayatollah Montazeri]] holds that it is probable that the punishment was prescribed by Muhammad during early Islam to combat political conspiracies against Islam and Muslims, and is not intended for those who simply change their belief or express a change in belief. Montazeri defines different types of apostasy; he argues that capital punishment should be reserved for those who desert Islam out of malice and enmity towards the Muslim community, and not those who convert to another religion after investigation and research.&lt;ref name=Jami/&gt;

==Historic impact==
The charge of apostasy is often used by religious authorities to condemn and punish skeptics, dissidents, and minorities in their communities.&lt;ref name=juancampo/&gt; From the earliest history of Islam, the crime of apostasy and execution for apostasy has driven major events in Islam. For example, the [[Ridda wars]] (civil wars of apostasy) shook the Muslim community in 632-633 AD, immediately after the death of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=juancampo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, A. L. (2002), Just War, jihad, and terrorism: a comparison of Western and Islamic norms for the use of political violence, Journal Ch. &amp; State, 44, pp. 73–89&lt;/ref&gt; These apostasy wars [[History of Shia Islam|split the two major sects of Islam]] – [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]], and caused numerous deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Wilferd Madelung, The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521646963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Rogerson (2007), The Heirs of Muhammad: Islam's First Century and the Origins of the Sunni-Shia Split, {{ISBN|978-1585678969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sunni and Shia sects of Islam have long called each other as apostates of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Hazleton, After the Prophet: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam, {{ISBN|978-0385523943}}, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Zindīq]]'' refers to a [[freethought|freethinker]], atheist or a heretic. Originally it referred to a dualist and also the [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]], whose religion for a time threatened to become the dominant religion of the educated class and who experienced a wave of persecutions from 779 to 786. A history of those times states:&lt;ref name=Glasse/&gt;

{{blockquote|"Tolerance is laudable", the Spiller (the Caliph [[As-Saffah|Abu al-Abbās]]) had once said, "except in matters dangerous to religious beliefs, or to the Sovereign's dignity."&lt;ref name=Glasse/&gt;

[[Al-Mahdi|Mahdi]] (d. 169/785) persecuted Freethinkers, and executed them in large numbers. He was the first Caliph to order composition of polemical works to in refutation of Freethinkers and other heretics; and for years he tried to exterminate them absolutely, hunting them down throughout all provinces and putting accused persons to death on mere suspicion.&lt;ref name=Glasse/&gt;}}

''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' states that after the early period, with some notable exceptions, the practice in Islam regarding atheism or various forms of heresy, grew more tolerant as long as it was a private matter. However heresy and atheism expressed in public may well be considered a scandal and a menace to a society; in some societies they are punishable, at least to the extent the perpetrator is silenced. In particular, blasphemy against God and insulting [[Muhammad]] are major crimes.&lt;ref name=Glasse&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA492|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|author1=Cyril Glassé|author2=[[Huston Smith]]|publisher=[[Rowman Altamira]]|page=492|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320224424/https://books.google.com/books?id=focLrox-frUC&amp;pg=PA492|archivedate=20 March 2018|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780759101906|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century through the 18th century, atheists, materialists, Sufi, and Shii sects were accused and executed for apostasy in Islam. In the 8th century, apostates of Islam were killed in [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[Sindh|Sind]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cook (2006), Apostasy from Islam – A Historical Perspective, J Studies Arabic Islam, 31, pp. 254–55, 267–68, 277, 248–79&lt;/ref&gt; 10th-century Iraq, Sufi mystic [[Mansur Al-Hallaj|Al-Hallaj]] was executed for apostasy; in 12th-century Iran, [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|al-Suhrawardi]] along with followers of Ismaili sect of Islam were killed on charges of being apostates;&lt;ref name=juancampo/&gt; in 14th-century Syria, [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] declared Central Asian Turko-Mongol Muslims as apostates due to the invasion of Ghazan Khan;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burns (2011), Christianity, Islam, and the West, University Press, {{ISBN|978-0761855590}}, pp. 61–67&lt;/ref&gt; in 17th-century India, [[Dara Shikoh]] and other sons of [[Shah Jahan]] were captured and executed on charges of apostasy from Islam by his brother [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=183|isbn=978-0816054541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources say that executions of apostates have been "rare in Islamic history".&lt;ref name="ELLIOTT-3-26-2006"/&gt; While Al-Hallaj was officially executed for possessing a heretical document suggesting [[hajj]] pilgrimage was not required of a pure Muslim, it is thought he would have been spared execution except that the [[Caliph]] at the time [[Al-Muqtadir]] wished to discredit "certain figures who had associated themselves" with al-Hallaj.&lt;ref name="kadri-237"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ..|date=2012|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202174508/https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|archivedate=2 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Previously al-Hallaj had been punished for talking about being at one with God by being shaved, pilloried and beaten with the flat of a sword. He was not executed because the [[Shafi'i]]te judge had ruled that his words were not "proof of disbelief."&lt;ref name="kadri-237"/&gt;) According to historian [[Bernard Lewis]], in the "early times" of Islam, "charges of apostasy were not unusual, and ... the terms `unbeliever` and `apostate` were commonly used in religious polemic ... in fact such accusations had little practical effect. The accused were for the most part unmolested, and some even held high offices in the Muslim state. As the rules and penalties of the Muslim law were systematized and more regularly enforced, charges of apostasy became rarer."&lt;ref name="Lewis-229"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Middle East: a Brief History of the Last 2000 Years|date=1995|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0684832807|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; When action was taken against an alleged apostate, it was much more likely to be "quarantine" than execution, unless the innovation was "extreme, persistent and aggressive".&lt;ref name="Lewis-229"/&gt;

During the colonial era, death for apostasy was abolished in many Muslim-majority colonies. Similarly, under intense European pressure, death sentence for apostasy from Islam was abolished by the [[Edict of Toleration 1844|Edict of Toleration]], and substituted with other forms of punishment by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government in 1844; the implementation of this ban was resisted by religious officials and proved difficult.&lt;ref name=selimderingi&gt;Selim Deringi (2012), Conversion and Apostasy in the Late Ottoman Empire, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107004559}}, Chapter 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Cyril |last=Glassé |year=2001 |title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=AltaMira |page=54 |location=[[Walnut Creek, California]] |isbn=978-0-7591-0189-0 |oclc=48553252}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of edicts followed during Ottoman's [[Tanzimat]] period, such as the [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856|1856 Reform Edict]].

== Apostasy in the recent past ==
[[File:Apostasy laws in 2013.SVG|thumb|Penalties (actual or proposed) for apostasy in some Muslim-majority countries as of 2013.]]

=== Background ===
More than 20 Muslim-majority states have laws that declare apostasy by Muslims to be a crime.&lt;ref name=locapo/&gt; As of 2014, apostasy was a capital offense in Afghanistan, Brunei, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.&lt;ref name=locapo/&gt; Executions for religious conversion have been infrequent in recent times, with four cases reported since 1985: one in Sudan in 1985; two in Iran, in 1989 and 1998; and one in Saudi Arabia in 1992.&lt;ref name=locapo/&gt;&lt;ref name="ELLIOTT-3-26-2006"/&gt; In Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Yemen apostasy laws have been used to charge persons for acts other than conversion.&lt;ref name=locapo/&gt; In addition, some predominantly Islamic countries without laws specifically addressing apostasy have prosecuted individuals or minorities for apostasy using broadly-defined blasphemy laws.&lt;ref name="pewresearch.org"&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/28/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/ Which countries still outlaw apostasy and blasphemy?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006183139/http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/05/28/which-countries-still-outlaw-apostasy-and-blasphemy/ |date=6 October 2014 }} Pew Research Center, United States (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In many nations, the [[Hisbah]] doctrine of Islam has traditionally allowed any Muslim to accuse another Muslim or ex-Muslim for beliefs that may harm Islamic society. This principle has been used in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and others to bring blasphemy charges against apostates.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Gallagher (2005), Apostasy, Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics, Editors: Suad Joseph and Afsāna Naǧmābādī, {{ISBN|978-9004128187}}, pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The violence or threats of violence against apostates in the Muslim world in recent years has derived primarily not from government authorities but from other individuals or groups operating unrestricted by the government.&lt;ref name=marshall20080410&gt;Paul Marshall and Nina Shea (2011), Silenced: How Apostasy and Blasphemy codes are choking freedom worldwide, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-981228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=November 2015}}  There has also been social persecution for Muslims converting to Christianity. For example, the Christian organisation [[Barnabas Fund]] reports:
{{Quote|The field of apostasy and blasphemy and related "crimes" is thus obviously a complex syndrome within all Muslim societies which touches a raw nerve and always arouses great emotional outbursts against the perceived acts of treason, betrayal and attacks on Islam and its honour. While there are a few brave dissenting voices within Muslim societies, the threat of the application of the apostasy and blasphemy laws against any who criticize its application is an efficient weapon used to intimidate opponents, silence criticism, punish rivals, reject innovations and reform, and keep non-Muslim communities in their place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Barnabas Fund]] |title=The Application of the Apostasy Law in the World Today |url=http://barnabasfund.org/US/News/Archives/The-Application-of-the-Apostasy-Law-in-the-World-Today.html |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028161516/http://barnabasfund.org/US/News/Archives/The-Application-of-the-Apostasy-Law-in-the-World-Today.html |archivedate=28 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Public opinion ===
A survey based on face-to-face interviews conducted in 80 languages by the [[Pew Research Center]] between 2008 and 2012 among thousands of Muslims in many countries, found varied views on the death penalty for those who leave Islam to become an atheist or to convert to another religion.&lt;ref name=pew2013apo/&gt; In this survey, Muslims who favored making [[Sharia]] the law of the land were asked for their views on the death penalty for apostasy from Islam.&lt;ref name=pew2013apo/&gt; The results are summarized in the table below. Note that values for ''Group C'' have been derived from the values for the other two groups and are not part of the Pew report.&lt;ref name=pew2013apo/&gt; These values do not include Muslims who may not support sharia but do support the death penalty for apostasy.

Article 130 of the [[Constitution of Afghanistan|Afghan Constitution]] requires its courts to apply provisions of Hanafi Sunni fiqh for crimes of apostasy in Islam. Article 1 of the [[Law of Afghanistan|Afghan Penal Code]] requires [[hudud]] crimes be punished per Hanafi religious jurisprudence. Prevailing Hanafi jurisprudence, per consensus of its school of Islamic scholars, prescribes death penalty for the crime of apostasy. The apostate can avoid prosecution and/or punishment if he or she confesses of having made a mistake of apostasy and rejoins Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/index.php#afghanistan Afghanistan - Laws Criminalizing Apostasy] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171231144725/https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/index.php |date=31 December 2017 }} Library of Congress (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 2014 it was translated to [[Pashto]] by powerful warlord [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s son-in-law, this led to an uproar on social media with many accusations of apostasy and death threats directed at Javeed, and a large public demonstration in [[Kabul]] calling for his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.human.nl/2doc/2016/ongelovig.html |title=Non-believers: Freethinkers on the Run |author=Dorothée Forma |work=Human |date=2 September 2015 |accessdate=3 October 2017 |language=nl |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019020022/https://www.human.nl/2doc/2016/ongelovig.html |archivedate=19 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, 21-year-old student and ex-Muslim atheist Morid Aziz had a religious argument with his girlfriend Shogofa, once a liberal Muslim, but radicalised whilst studying Sharia. She secretly recorded the conversation, during which he criticised Islam, and begged her to 'forsake the darkness and embrace science', but she called him a ''kafir'' and said he would burn in hell. The next day, she played the recording at the Friday prayer in a full mosque. Aziz was inundated with questions from relatives about how he had dared to say what he said, and he quickly went into hiding just before angry men armed with [[Kalashnikov rifle|Kalashnikovs]] showed up at his house. 23 days later, he fled across several countries and ended up in the [[Netherlands]], where he obtained [[permanent residency]] on 30 May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/buitenland/morid-twijfelde-over-zijn-geloof-zijn-vriendin-verlinkte-hem-in-een-volle-moskee-in-afghanistan~a4543276/ |title=Morid twijfelde over zijn geloof, zijn vriendin verlinkte hem in een volle moskee in Afghanistan |author=Janny Groen |work=de Volkskrant |date=5 December 2017 |accessdate=8 December 2017 |language=nl |quote=We hadden een heftig gesprek.

People without religious affiliation tend to be particularly numerous in [[Kabylie]] (a [[Kabyle language|Kabyle-speaking]] area) where they are generally tolerated and sometimes supported.&lt;ref name="FOTR17dz"/&gt; Notably, Berber civil rights, human rights and secular activist and musician [[Lounès Matoub]] (assassinated in 1998) is widely seen as a hero among [[Kabyle people|Kabyles]], despite (or because of) his lack of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bullivant |first1=Stephen |last2=Ruse |first2=Michael |date=2013 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93VoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA722 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=722 |isbn=9780191667398 |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most other areas of the country, the non-religious tend to be more discreet, and often pretend to be pious Muslims to avoid violence and lynching.&lt;ref name="FOTR17dz"/&gt;

The majority of cases of harassment and security threats against non-Muslims come from the now nearly destroyed [[Armed Islamic Group]], an organization fighting the government who are determined to rid the country of those who do not share their extremist interpretation of Islam.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} However, a majority of the population subscribes to Islamic precepts of tolerance in religious beliefs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moderate Islamist religious and political leaders{{Who|date=November 2017}} have criticized publicly acts of violence committed in the name of Islam.

The "blasphemy" law is stringent and widely enforced. The non-religious are largely invisible in the public sphere, and although not specifically targeted through legislation, significant prejudice towards non-Muslim religions can be presumed to apply equally if not more so to non-believers.&lt;ref name="FOTR17dz"/&gt; The crime of "blasphemy" carries a maximum of five years in prison and the laws are interpreted widely. For example, several arrests have been made under the blasphemy laws in the last few years for failure to fast during Ramadan, even though this is not a requirement under Algerian law. Non-fasting persons ("non-jeûneurs") repeatedly face harassment by the police and civil society.&lt;ref name="FOTR17dz"/&gt; Eating in public during [[Ramadan]] (particularly for people who "look Muslim") is legal, but attracts public hostility in most areas, except for some areas of [[Kabylie]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Most restaurants close during Ramadan.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In general, non-citizens who practice faiths other than Islam enjoy a high level of tolerance within society; however, citizens who renounce Islam generally are ostracized by their families and shunned by their neighbors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those who "renounce" Islam may be imprisoned, fined, or co-erced to re-convert.&lt;ref name="FOTR17dz"/&gt; The Government generally does not become involved in such disputes.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Converts also expose themselves to the risk of attack by radical extremists.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
{{Main|Religion in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish Muslim rule]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1463–1878), a large minority of the Southern Slavic-speaking inhabitants converted to Islam for various reasons, whilst others remained Roman Catholics (later known as Croats) or Orthodox Christians (later known as Serbs). These converts and their descendants were simply known as "Bosnian Muslims" or just "Muslims", until the term [[Bosniaks]] was adopted in 1993. Not all Bosniaks (still) practice Islam nowadays; some may just be "Muslim" by name or cultural background, but not by conviction, profession or practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bideleux |first1=Robert |last2=Jeffries |first2=Ian |date=2007 |title=The Balkans: A Post-Communist History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6iBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |pages=330–331 |isbn=9781134583287 |accessdate=2 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019155238/https://books.google.com/books?id=G6iBAgAAQBAJ |archivedate=19 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1998 public opinion poll, just 78.3% of Bosniaks in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared themselves to be religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Religious separation and political intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina|last1=Velikonja|first1=Mitja|authorlink=|year=2003|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|location=|isbn=978-1-58544-226-3|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf8P-7ExoKYC&amp;pg=PA261|accessdate=6 January 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530042237/http://books.google.com/books?id=Rf8P-7ExoKYC&amp;pg=PA261|archivedate=30 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans punished apostasy from Islam with the death penalty until the [[Edict of Toleration 1844]]; subsequently, apostates could be imprisoned or deported instead.&lt;ref name="Duijzings 2000 86–99"&gt;{{cite book|last=Duijzings|first=Ger|title=Religion and the Politics of Identity in Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJRYkzl5YC4C|year=2000|publisher=C.

The Austrian government held that any mature citizen was free to convert to another religion without having to fear any legal penalty, and issued a directive to its officials to keep their involvement in religious matters to a minimum. This clashed with the rigorous hostility to conversion exhibited by traditional Bosnian Muslims, who perceived it as a threat to the survival of Islam. During the four decades of Habsburg rule, several apostasy controversies occurred, most often involving young women with a low socio-economic status who sought to convert to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Pinson |first=Mark |date=1996 |title=The Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina: Their Historic Development from the Middle Ages to the Dissolution of Yugoslavia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl3TAkJmztYC&amp;pg=PA99 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard CMES |pages=99–101 |isbn=9780932885128 |accessdate=4 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518060654/https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl3TAkJmztYC |archivedate=18 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1890, during the [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a sixteen-year-old Bosnian girl called Uzeifa Delahmatović claimed to have voluntarily converted from Islam to Catholicism, the Habsburg state's official and majority religion. This stirred up controversy about whether she was forced, or whether a Muslim was even allowed to change her or his religion. Subsequent debates resulted in the Austrian Conversion Ordinance of 1891, which made religious conversion of subjects a matter of state. A strict procedure required the convert to be an adult and mentally healthy, and the conversion should be recognised by all parties involved; if not, the state would intervene and set up a commission for arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Deringi (2012), p. 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, religion became highly politicised in Bosnia, and the basis for most citizens' national identity and political loyalty, leading to numerous conflicts culminating in the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–5). The resulting violence and misery has caused a group of Bosnians to reject religion (and nationalism) altogether. This atheist community faces discrimination, and is frequently verbally attacked by religious leaders as "corrupt people without morals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dubensky |first=Joyce S. |date=2016 |title=Peacemakers in Action: Profiles in Religious Peacebuilding |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stb4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA391 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=391 |isbn=9781107152960 |accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Islamist]] militants gunned down [[Secularism in Egypt|Egyptian secularist]] and [[Sharia#Criticism|sharia law opponent]] [[Farag Foda]]. Before his death he had been declared an apostate and foe of Islam by the ulama at [[Al Azhar]].

In 1993, a [[Liberal Muslim movements|liberal Islamic]] [[Schools of Islamic theology|theologian]], [[Nasr Abu Zayd]] was denied promotion at [[Cairo University]] after a court decision of apostasy against him.  Following this an Islamist lawyer filed a lawsuit before the Giza Lower Personal Status Court demanding the [[Divorce in Islam|divorce]] of Abu Zayd from his wife, Dr. Ibtihal Younis, on the grounds that a Muslim woman cannot be married to an apostate – notwithstanding the fact his wife wished to remain married to him. The case went to the Cairo Appeals Court where his marriage was declared null and void in 1995.&lt;ref name="obit-abuzaid"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-nasr-hamed-abu-zaid-modernist-islamic-philosopher-who-was-forced-into-exile-by-fundamentalists-2025754.html Professor Nasr Hamed Abu Zaid: Modernist islamic philosopher who was forced into exile by fundamentalists ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925115825/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-nasr-hamed-abu-zaid-modernist-islamic-philosopher-who-was-forced-into-exile-by-fundamentalists-2025754.html |date=25 September 2015 }}|By Adel Darwish | 14 July 2010 |The Independent&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict, the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] organization (which had assassinated Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in 1981) declared Abu Zayd should be killed for abandoning his Muslim faith.

In 2007 [[Mohammed Hegazy]], a Muslim-born Egyptian who had converted to Christianity based on "readings and comparative studies in religions", sued the Egyptian court to change his religion from "Islam" to "Christianity" on his national identification card.  His case caused considerable public uproar,  with not only Muslim clerics, but his own father and wife's father calling for his death. Two lawyers he had hired or agreed to hire both quit his case, and two Christian human rights workers thought to be involved in his case were arrested. As of 2007, he and his wife were in hiding. In 2008, the judge trying his case ruled that according to sharia, Islam is the final and most complete religion and therefore Muslims already practice full freedom of religion and cannot convert to an older belief.&lt;ref name=KUWAIT&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian Christian convert goes into hiding amid death threats |publisher=Kuwait Times |url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MTAxNzY2OTk2MA== |date=2007-08-11 |accessdate=2007-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901194650/http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MTAxNzY2OTk2MA%3D%3D |archivedate=1 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;{{cite news | title = Muslim converts to Christianity foments sectarian antagonism | agency = Associated Press | date = 2007-08-11 | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/11/africa/ME-GEN-Egypt-Muslim-Convert.php | publisher = International Herald Tribune | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070814230341/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/11/africa/ME-GEN-Egypt-Muslim-Convert.php | archivedate = 14 August 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080203/egypt-rules-christian-convert-must-remain-legally-muslim/index.html |title=Egypt Rules Christian Convert Must Remain Legally Muslim |work=The Christian Post |date=3 February 2008 |accessdate=2010-04-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20100118204943/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080203/egypt%2Drules%2Dchristian%2Dconvert%2Dmust%2Dremain%2Dlegally%2Dmuslim/index.html |archivedate=18 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegazy kept trying to officially change his religion until he was arrested in 2013 for "spreading false rumours and incitement".

In February 2009, another case of a convert to Christianity (Maher Ahmad El-Mo'otahssem Bellah El-Gohary), came to court. El-Gohary's effort to officially convert to Christianity triggered state prosecutors charging him of "apostasy," or leaving Islam, and seeking a sentence of death penalty.

On 21 October 2014, ex-Muslim atheist activist [[Ahmed Harqan]] featured in a debate on the popular Egyptian talk show ''Taht al Koubry'' ("Under the Bridge"). He explained why he had become an atheist and said that Islam is a "harsh religion", which was being implemented by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] (ISIS) and [[Boko Haram]].

In July 2017, an activist group that spread atheistic articles and books Iranian universities, published a video on YouTube titled "Why we must deny the existence of God", featuring famous atheist thinkers Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett. An hour before the group would meet to discuss the production of a new video, their office was raided by the police.

Although the Constitution of Iraq recognizes [[Islam]] as the official religion and states that no law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of Islam, it also guarantees freedom of thought, conscience, and religious belief and practice. While the Government generally endorses these rights, unsettled conditions have prevented effective governance in parts of the country, and the Government's ability to protect religious freedoms has been handicapped by insurgency, terrorism, and [[sectarian]] violence. Since 2003, when the government of [[Saddam Hussein]] fell, the Iraqi government has generally not engaged in state-sponsored persecution of any religious group, calling instead for tolerance and acceptance of all religious minorities.

In October 2013, 15-year-old Ahmad Sherwan from Erbil said he no longer believed in God and was proud to be an atheist to his father, who had the police arrest him. He was imprisoned for 13 days and tortured several times, before being released on bail; he faced life imprisonment for disbelief in God. Sherwan tried to contact the media for seven months, but all refused to run his story until the private newspaper ''Awene'' published it in May 2014. It went viral, and human rights activists came to his aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/interview-with-persecuted-young-atheist-in-erbil_23918 |title=Interview with persecuted young atheist in Erbil |author=Rozh Ahmad |work=Your Middle East |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=13 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913232600/http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/interview-with-persecuted-young-atheist-in-erbil_23918 |archivedate=13 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s, an increasing number of Iraqis, especially young people in the capital city of [[Baghdad]] and the [[Kurdistan Region]], were leaving Islam for a variety of reasons. Some cite the lack of women's rights in Islam, others the political climate, which is dominated by conflicts between Shia Muslim parties who seek to expand their power more than they try to improve citizens' living conditions. Many young ex-Muslims sought refuge in the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], and advocated for secularism from within its ranks. The sale of books on atheism by authors such as [[Abdullah al-Qasemi]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] has risen in Baghdad. In Iraqi Kurdistan, a 2011 AK-News survey asking whether respondents believed God existed, resulted in 67% replying 'yes', 21% 'probably', 4% 'probably not', 7% 'no' and 1% had no answer. The subsequent harsh battle against Islamic State and its literalist implementation of Sharia caused numerous youths to dissociate themselves from Islam altogether, either by adopting [[Zoroastrianism]] or secretly embracing atheism.&lt;ref name="Neurink"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.trouw.nl/religie-en-filosofie/in-irak-keren-jongeren-de-islam-de-rug-toe~ab5f8303/ |title=In Irak keren jongeren de islam de rug toe |author=Judit Neurink |work=[[Trouw]] |date=12 September 2017 |accessdate=13 September 2017 |language=nl |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912193738/https://www.trouw.nl/religie-en-filosofie/in-irak-keren-jongeren-de-islam-de-rug-toe~ab5f8303/ |archivedate=12 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sadr al-Din learned about [[natural selection]] in school, he began questioning the [[Islamic attitudes towards science|relationship between Islam and science]], studying the history of Islam, and asking people's opinions on both topics. At the age of 20, he changed his first name to Daniel, after atheist philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]. He came into conflict with his family, who threatened him with death, and after his father found books in his room denying the existence of God and miracles, he tried to shoot his son. Daniel fled Iraq, and obtained asylum in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Breggen"/&gt;

[[Kosovo]] was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] along with the other [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|remnants of the Serbian Empire]] in the period following the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389). Although the Ottomans didn't force the Catholic and Orthodox Christian population to convert to Islam, there was strong social pressure (such as not having to pay the [[jizya]]) as well as political expediency to do so, which ethnic Albanians did in far greater numbers (including the entire nobility) than Serbs, Greeks and others in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Albanië. §6. Geschiedenis".

Whilst many of these converts stayed crypto-Catholics to a certain extent, often helped by pragmatic lower clerics, the higher Catholic clergy ordered them to be denied [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|the sacraments]] for their heresy.&lt;ref name="Duijzings 2000 86–99"/&gt; Efforts to convert the [[Laramans|laraman community]] of [[Vitina|Letnica]] back to Catholicism began in 1837, but the effort was violently suppressed – the local Ottoman governor put laramans in jail.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=92}} After the Ottoman Empire abolished the death penalty for apostasy from Islam by the [[Edict of Toleration 1844]], several groups of crypto-Catholics in [[Prizren]], [[Peć|Peja]] and [[Gjakova]] were recognised as Catholics by the Ottoman Grand Vizier in 1845. When the laramans of Letnica asked the district governor and judge in [[Gjilan]] to recognise them as Catholics, they were refused however, and subsequently imprisoned, and then deported to [[Anatolia]],{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=93}} from where they returned in November 1848 following diplomatic intervention.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=94}} In 1856, a further [[Tanzimat]] [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856|reform]] improved the situation, and no further serious abuse was reported.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=96}} The bulk of conversion of laramans, almost exclusively newly-borns, took place between 1872 and 1924.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=99}}

National laws of Malaysia require Muslim apostates who seek to convert from Islam to another religion to first obtain approval from a sharia court. The procedure demands that anyone born to a Muslim parent, or who previously converted to Islam, must declare himself apostate of Islam before a Sharia court if he or she wants to convert. The Sharia courts have the power to impose penalties such as jail, caning and enforced "rehabilitation" on apostates – which is the typical practice. In the states of Perak, Malacca, Sabah, and Pahang, apostates of Islam face jail term; in Pahang, caning; others, confinement with rehabilitation process.&lt;ref name=malaysiaapo/&gt;

The state laws of Malaysia allow apostates of other religion to become Muslim without any equivalent review or process. The state laws of [[Perak]], [[Kedah]], [[Negeri Sembilan]], [[Sarawak]], and [[Malacca]] allow one parent to convert children to Islam even if the other parent does not consent to his or her child's conversion to Islam.&lt;ref name=malaysiaapo/&gt;

The [[Constitution of the Maldives|Constitution]] of the [[Maldives]] designates [[Islam]] as the official [[state religion]], and the government and many citizens at all levels interpret this provision to impose a requirement that all citizens must be Muslims. The Constitution states the president must be a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]].

On 27 April 2014, the Maldives ratified a new regulation that revived the [[death penalty]] (abolished in 1953, when the last execution took place) for a number of ''[[hudud]]'' offences, including apostasy for persons from the age of 7 and older. The new regulation was strongly criticised by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] and the [[European Union|EU]]'s [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]], pointing out that they violated the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which the Maldives have ratified, that ban the execution of anyone for offences committed before the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/04/maldives-enacts-regulation-death-penalty-2014430214541593659.html |title=Maldives enacts regulation for death penalty |work=Al Jazeera English |date=1 May 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003356/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/04/maldives-enacts-regulation-death-penalty-2014430214541593659.html |archivedate=13 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47680#.WgeIfWjWyUl |title=Maldives should repeal new regulation providing for death penalty, says UN rights office |work=UN News Centre |publisher=United Nations |date=29 April 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185642/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47680#.WgeIfWjWyUl |archivedate=12 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The penal code of [[Morocco]] does not impose the death penalty for apostasy. However, Islam is the official state religion of Morocco under its constitution.

In the [[Netherlands]], a country in Western Europe, [[Islam in the Netherlands|Muslims made up]] about 4.9% of the total population as of 2015; the rest of its inhabitants were either non-religious (50.1%), Christian (39.2%) or adherents of various other religions (5.7%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/51/helft-nederlanders-is-kerkelijk-of-religieus |title=Helft Nederlanders is kerkelijk of religieus |publisher=[[Statistics Netherlands]] |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=9 December 2017 |language=nl |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017201934/https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/51/helft-nederlanders-is-kerkelijk-of-religieus |archivedate=17 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the freedom of expression, thought and religion is guaranteed by law in the Netherlands, there is doubt concerning the reality of this individual freedom within the small orthodox Christian minorities and within Muslim communities. The social and cultural pressure for those raised in a conservative religious family not to change or 'lose' religion can be high. This lack of 'horizontal' freedom (the freedom in relation to family, friends and neighborhood) remains a concern. Ex-Muslims often keep their views hidden from family, friends and the wider community.&lt;ref name="FOTR17nl"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/europe-western-europe/netherlands/ |title=Netherlands |work=Freedom of Thought Report 2017 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union |date=4 December 2017 |accessdate=9 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210071828/http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/europe-western-europe/netherlands/ |archivedate=10 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nigeria]], there is no federal law that explicitly makes apostasy a crime. The [[Constitution of Nigeria|Federal Constitution]] protects freedom of religion and allows religious conversion. Section 10 of the constitution states, 'The Government of the Federation of a State shall not adopt any religion as State Religion.'.&lt;ref name="FOTR17ng"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/africa-western-africa/nigeria/ |title=Nigeria |work=Freedom of Thought Report 2017 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union |date=4 December 2017 |accessdate=11 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212084353/http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/africa-western-africa/nigeria/ |archivedate=12 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, 12 Muslim-majority states in northern Nigeria have laws invoking Sharia, which have been used to persecute Muslim apostates, particularly Muslims who have converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Ikenga Oraebunam (2012), ''Islamic Law, Religious Freedom and Human Rights in Nigeria'', African Journal of Law and Criminology, Volume 2 Number 1, pp. 1–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/50068bbf2.html |title=Nigeria: Recent reports regarding the treatment of persons who convert from Islam to Christianity.

Governor [[Ahmad Sani Yerima]] of [[Zamfara State]], the first Nigerian Muslim-majority state to introduce Sharia in 2000, stated that because capital punishment for apostasy was unconstitutional, citizens themselves should do the killing, effectively undermining the [[rule of law]]:&lt;ref name="Harnisch106"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you change your religion from Islam, the penalty is death. We know it. And we didn't put it in our penal code because it is against the constitutional provision. It is the law of Allah, which now is a culture for the entire society. So if a Muslim changes his faith or religion, it is the duty of the society or family to administer that part of the justice to him.&lt;ref name="Harnisch106"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sani further added that whoever opposed 'the divine rules and regulations (...) is not a Muslim',&lt;ref name="Harnisch106"/&gt; confirmed by Secretary-General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs [[Lateef Adegbite]], who was quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once you reject sharia, you reject Islam. So, any Muslim that protests the application of sharia is virtually declaring himself non-Muslim.&lt;ref name="Harnisch106"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Oman]] does not have an apostasy law.

The [[State of Palestine]] does not have a constitution; however, the Basic Law provides for religious freedom. The Basic Law was approved in 2002 by the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) and signed by then-President [[Yasir Arafat]]. The Basic Law states that Islam is the official religion, but also calls for respect and sanctity for other "heavenly" religions (such as Judaism and Christianity) and that the principles of Shari'a (Islamic law) shall be the main source of legislation.&lt;ref name="FOTRPalestine"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/asia-western-asia/palestine/ |title=Palestine |work=Freedom of Thought Report |publisher=[[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] |date=2016 |accessdate=14 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914043027/http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/asia-western-asia/palestine/ |archivedate=14 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palestinian Authority (PA) requires Palestinians to declare their religious affiliation on identification papers. Either Islamic or Christian ecclesiastical courts handle legal matters relating to personal status. Inheritance, marriage, and divorce are handled by such courts, which exist for Muslim and Christians.&lt;ref name="FOTRPalestine"/&gt;

Citizens living in the West Bank found to be guilty of 'defaming religion' under the old Jordanian law, run the risk of years of imprisonment, up to for life. This happened to 26-year-old blogger [[Waleed Al-Husseini]] in October 2010, who was arrested and charged with defaming religion after openly declaring himself an atheist and criticising religion online.&lt;ref name="FOTRPalestine"/&gt; He was detained for ten months. After being released, he eventually fled to France, as the PA continued to harass him, and citizens called for him to be lynched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.de/when-muslims-renounce-their-faith/a-17574172 |title=When Muslims renounce their faith |author=Naomi Conrad |newspaper=Deutsche Welle |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=14 September 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530001937/http://www.dw.de/when-muslims-renounce-their-faith/a-17574172 |archivedate=30 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later found out he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in absentia.

Article 126.2 of the Penal Code of [[Sudan]] (1991) reads,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever is guilty of apostasy is invited to repent over a period to be determined by the tribunal. If he persists in his apostasy and was not recently converted to Islam, he will be put to death.&lt;ref name="Ibn Warraq"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some notable cases of apostasy in Sudan include: [[Mahmoud Mohammed Taha]], a Sudanese religious thinker, leader, and trained engineer, who was executed for "sedition and apostasy" in 1985 at the age of 76 by the regime of [[Gaafar Nimeiry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061003184013/http://www.iheu.org/node/1307 Apostacy – International Humanist and Ethical Union]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=packer&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/11/060911fa_fact1 The Moderate Martyr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407015421/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/11/060911fa_fact1 |date=7 April 2014 }}: A radically peaceful vision of Islam| by George Packer| 11 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Meriam Ibrahim]], a 27-year-old Christian Sudanese woman was sentenced to death for apostasy in May 2014, but allowed to leave the country in July after an international outcry.&lt;ref name=tran&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tran|first1=Mark|title=Sudanese woman spared death sentence for apostasy arrives in Italy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/sudanese-woman-meriam-ibrahim-spared-death-sentence-apostasy-italy|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801094956/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/24/sudanese-woman-meriam-ibrahim-spared-death-sentence-apostasy-italy|archivedate=1 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudanese ex-Muslim and human rights activist [[Nahla Mahmoud]] has estimated that during the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, there have been between 120 and 170 Sudanese citizens who have been convicted for apostasy, most of whom repented to avoid a death sentence.&lt;ref name="Garçon"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.slateafrique.com/103275/religions-afrique-tuera-dieu |title=L'Afrique tuera-t-elle Dieu? |author=Lou Garçon |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate Afrique]] |date=27 October 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were prosecuted for expressing their views on Islam, the Quran and Muhammad on Facebook, blogs and in online books, which allegedly 'violated public order and morality'.

{{See also|Freedom of religion in Turkey}}
Although there is no punishment for apostasy from Islam in Turkey, there are several formal and informal mechanisms in place that make it hard for citizens not to be Muslim. Non-Muslims, especially non-religious people, are discriminated against in a variety of ways. Article 216 of the penal code outlaws insulting religious belief, a de facto blasphemy law obstructing citizens from expressing irreligious views, or views critical of religions. A well-known example is that of pianist [[Fazıl Say]] in 2012, who was charged with insulting religion for publicly declaring his atheism. Irreligious Turks are also often discriminated against in the workplace, because people are assumed to be Muslim by birth, and terms such as 'atheist' or 'nonbeliever' are frequently used insults in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="FOTR17tr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://freethoughtreport.com/countries/asia-western-asia/turkey/ |title=Turkey |work=Freedom of Thought Report 2017 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union |date=4 December 2017 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Turkish atheist association [[Ateizm Derneği]] was founded for nonreligious citizens, many of whom have left Islam. The association won the [[International League of non-religious and atheists]]'s Sapio Award 2017 for being the first officially recognised organisation in the Middle East defending the rights of atheists.&lt;ref name="Wakonigg"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://hpd.de/artikel/es-sollte-keinen-mut-erfordern-muessen-atheist-sein-14538 |title="Es sollte keinen Mut erfordern müssen, Atheist zu sein" |author=Daniela Wakonigg |work=Diesseits |publisher=Humanistischer Pressedienst |date=17 June 2017 |accessdate=19 April 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early April 2018 report of the Turkish Ministry of Education, titled "The Youth is Sliding to Deism", observed that an increasing number of pupils in [[İmam Hatip school]]s was abandoning Islam in favour of [[deism]]. The report's publication generated large-scale controversy amongst conservative Muslim groups in Turkish society. Progressive Islamic theologian Mustafa Ozturk noted the deist trend a year earlier, arguing that the "very archaic, dogmatic notion of religion" held by the majority of those claiming to represent Islam was causing "the new generations [to get] indifferent, even distant, to the Islamic worldview." Despite lacking reliable statistical data, numerous anecdotes appear to point in this direction. Although some commentators claim the secularisation is merely a result of Western influence or even a "conspiracy", most commentators, even some pro-government ones, have come to conclude that "the real reason for the loss of faith in Islam is not the West but Turkey itself: It is a reaction to all the corruption, arrogance, narrow-mindedness, bigotry, cruelty and crudeness displayed in the name of Islam." Especially when the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] Islamists are in power to enforce Islam upon society, this is making citizens turn their back on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/turkey-why-so-many-turks-are-losing-faith-in-islam.html |title=Why so many Turks are losing faith in Islam |author=[[Mustafa Akyol]] |work=[[Al-Monitor]] |date=16 April 2018 |accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain]] (CEMB) is the British branch of the [[Central Council of Ex-Muslims]], who represent former [[Muslim]]s who fear for their lives because they have renounced Islam. It was launched in [[Westminster]] on 22 June 2007. The Council protests against Islamic states that still punish Muslim apostates with death under the Sharia law.

In November 2015, the CEMB launched the social media campaign #ExMuslimBecause, encouraging ex-Muslims to [[coming out|come out]] as apostates, and explain why they left Islam. Within two weeks, the hashtag had been used over a 100,000 times. Proponents argued that it should be possible to freely question and criticise Islam, opponents claimed the campaign was amongst other things 'hateful', and said the extremist excrescences of Islam were unfairly equated with the religion as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34975848 |title=Ex-Muslims give reasons they left the faith, using a hashtag |author1=Anne-Marie Tomchak |author2=Greg Brosnan |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[BBC News]] |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=21 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224022338/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-34975848 |archivedate=24 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are no known instances of converts from Islam to Christianity who have been killed in the United States for their decision to leave their faith."&lt;ref name="WashTimes"/&gt; [[Ibn Warraq]], author of ''[[Why I Am Not a Muslim]]'' (1995) and ''[[Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out]]'' (2003), stressed the importance of this fact as a reason for 'not exaggerating' the fate of former Muslims in America, noting however: "They are threatened. They are attacked physically. I cite [in ''Leaving Islam''] instances of young students who have converted and who were attacked but were rescued just in time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?155377-1/leaving-islam-apostates-speak-out&amp;start=1201 |title=Leaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out, Jun 24 2003 |author=[[Ibn Warraq]] |work=[[C-SPAN]] |date=24 June 2003 |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|at=19:36}}

Apostasy is a crime in [[Yemen]]. Articles 12 and 259 of the Yemen Penal Code address apostasy, the former requires Sharia sentence be used for apostasy and the latter specifies death penalty for apostates of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/index.php#yemen Yemen – Laws Criminalizing Apostasy] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20171231144725/https://www.loc.gov/law/help/apostasy/index.php |date=31 December 2017 }} Library of Congress (May 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Yemeni law waives the punishment to an apostate if he or she recants, repents and returns to Islam while denouncing his or her new faith.

In 2012, Yemeni citizen Ali Qasim Al-Saeedi was arrested and charged with apostasy by Yemeni law enforcement agency after he posted his personal views questioning the teachings of Islam, on a Yemeni blogging site and his Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/repent-or-die-yemen "Repent or die" in Yemen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903105340/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/repent-or-die-yemen |date=3 September 2014 }} Radio Netherlands Worldwide (21 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic scholars such as Muhammad Rashid Rida in Tafsir al-Minar, argue that the "freedom to apostatize", is different from freedom of religion on the grounds that apostasy from Islam infringes on the freedom of others and the respect due the religion of Islamic states.&lt;ref name=jstor-1570336/&gt;

The '''''Asceticon''''' ("ascetic discourses") by Abba Isaiah of Scetes is a diverse anthology of essays by an Egyptian Christian monk who left Scetes around 450 AD. Originally composed in Greek, the ''Asceticon'' consists of 30 essays ("''logos''") on subjects including: advice for novice monks; precepts for those who have renounced the world; sayings and stories by Abba Isaiah; various letters, sermons, and sayings. Logos 30 includes several sayings that were also included in the ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''), but in a different form, giving scholars some evidence on how those sayings evolved into their final form in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. Abba Isaiah was also influential in bringing Christianity to Palestine.&lt;ref name="Harmless"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harmless|first=William|title=Desert Christians: An Introduction to the Literature of Early Monasticism|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |date=2004|pages=265-267|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zn2ml4g79WcC&amp;pg=PA265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early days ==

=== Before 1900 ===

A French agent working in Persia reported briefly on the [[Bábism|Bábís]], a predecessor religion to the Bahá'í Faith, in the 1840s after it originated in 1844.&lt;ref name="Early West"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_western_accounts Early Western Accounts of the Babi and Bahá'í Faiths] by Moojan Momen&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in no way espousing his beliefs, [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s know [[Arthur de Gobineau]] as the person who obtained the only complete manuscript of the early history of the [[Bábism|Bábí]] religious movement of [[Persian Empire|Persia]], written by Haji Mírzá Jân of [[Kashan]],{{ref}} who was put to death by the Persian authorities about 1852. The manuscript now is in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] at [[Paris]]. He is also known to students of the [[Bábism|Bábí Faith]] for having written the first and most influential account of the movement, displaying a fairly accurate knowledge of its history in ''Religions et philosophies dans l'Asie centrale''. An addendum to that work is a bad translation of the Báb's Bayan al-'Arabi, the first Bábí text to be translated into a European language.&lt;ref name="heart" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Early West" /&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], founder of the Bahá'í Faith in the 19th century, addressed a number of items to French officials or in circumstances related to France from circa the 1870s. There were two Tablets to Emperor [[Napoleon III]] incorporated into major works of the literature of the Bahá'í Faith: the [[Súriy-i-Mulúk]] and the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]. In the first it said the sincerity of the Emperor's claims on behalf of the oppressed and the helpless were tested.

However, Bahá'u'lláh's tablets had little attention if any in France itself. Instead the French were still occupied much more with the Báb's dramatic life and the persecution his religion and life were subject to. French writer [[Henri Antoine Jules-Bois]] says that: "among the littérateurs of my generation, in the Paris of 1890, the martyrdom of the Báb was still as fresh a topic as had been the first news of his death. We wrote poems about him. [[Sarah Bernhardt]] entreated [[Catulle Mendès]] for a play on the theme of this historic tragedy."&lt;ref name="Early West" /&gt; The French writer A. de Saint-Quentin also mentioned the religion in a book published in 1891.&lt;ref name="Early West" /&gt; For all the attention, little penetrated to understanding the religion itself.&lt;ref name="Linard"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/linard_bibliographie_francais_1844-1944 Bibliographie des ouvrages de langue française mentionnant les religions babie ou baha’ie (1844–1944)] compiled by Thomas Linard, published in Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Bahá'í Studies, 3, 1997–06&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897 May lost both her grandmother and cousin whom she was very close to. At age 27, May became obsessed with mortality and became bedridden leading to many of her family members believing she was going to die.&lt;ref name="Nakhjavani "&gt;{{Cite book |author=Nakhjavani, Violette |year=1996 |title=Maxwells of Montreal, The |publisher= George Ronald |isbn=978-0-85398-551-8 |pages=52, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1898 family friend [[Phoebe Hearst]], with [[Lua Getsinger]] and others, stopped off at Paris. Hearst was shocked to see 28-year-old May bedridden with the chronic malady which had afflicted her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Hogenson |first1=Kathryn J. |year=2010 |title= Lighting the Western Sky: The Hearst Pilgrimage &amp; Establishment of the Baha'i Faith in the West |publisher= George Ronald |isbn= 978-0-85398-543-3 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; She invited May to sojourn to the East with her, believing the change of air to be conducive to her health. Getsinger also disclosed to May the purpose of the journey: a pilgrimage to visit the then head of the Bahá’í Faith: [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]].&lt;ref name="Nakhjavani " /&gt; They arrived in early December. Transformed by the trip in just a few days, May returned to Paris about late-December where she stayed for some time, at the request of `Abdu'l-Bahá, living as a confirmed Bahá'í and began teaching her new faith.

1898 is considered as the first presence of the religion in France and the beginnings of the first Bahá'í community in Europe.&lt;ref name="Linard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InWest"&gt;{{cite book |last=Warburg |first=Margit | editor = Peter Smith |title= Bahá'ís in the West | publisher= Kalimat Press |year=2004 |pages= 5, 10, 12, 15, 22, 36, 37, 79, 187, 188, 229 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=hlmFDBtqxOwDtX3by7wn6EYCqec#PPA233,M1 | isbn = 1-890688-11-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is also the year the French [[Nouveau Larousse illustré|''Encyclopaedia of Larousse'']] contained an entry on the Bábí religion.&lt;ref name="Linard-Baha'i" /&gt;

=== From 1900 to World War I ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:May Maxwell.jpg|thumb|right|210px|May Maxwell, 1923 in Egypt with her daughter Mary.]] --&gt;
About 1900 Frenchman {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus|fr|3=Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney}} and American [[Laura Clifford Barney]] learned of the religion in Paris from Bolles.&lt;ref name="laura-bio"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/dreyfus-barney_biography_hippolyte_dreyfus-barney Biography of Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney] by Laura C. Dreyfus-Barney and Shoghi Effendi, edited by Thomas Linard, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Dreyfus would be the first French Bahá'í and the couple would marry a decade later.&lt;ref name="InWest" /&gt;

Barney went to Egypt in the spring of 1901 to see [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and returned with [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]] Gulpáygání, one of the most erudite scholars of the religion, to Paris, where Anton Haddad translated for him. At the time, Paris had the most important Bahá'í community in Europe and many of those who were becoming Bahá'ís there would in later years would be famous in the religion. During Gulpaygani's time there, more than thirty became Bahá'ís. From Paris Gulpaygani went to America in the autumn of 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_abul-fadl_gulpayganiGulpáygání, Mirza Abu'l-Fadl] by Moojan Momen&lt;/ref&gt;

At almost the same time Englishman [[Thomas Breakwell]] was also taught the religion by Bolles in the summer of 1901 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hainsworth, ‘Breakwell, Thomas (1872–1902)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52579, accessed 21 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of `Abdu'l-Bahá, Breakwell also took up permanent residence in Paris, where he worked enthusiastically to teach the religion and help develop the first Paris Bahá’í community. Breakwell regularly corresponded with `Abdu’l-Bahá‘s secretary and translator Yúnis Khán and was the first western Bahá’í to give the [[Huqúqu’lláh]], a voluntary payment based on any wealth in excess of what is necessary to live comfortably. Breakwell died of tuberculosis on 13 June 1902, barely a year after joining the religion though his father followed him into the religion.

After learning of the Bahá'í Faith in Washington DC near 1898 [[Juliet Thompson]] traveled to Paris at the invitation of Barney's mother.&lt;ref name="memorial"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Early American Bahá'ís Honor Juliet Thompson at Memorial Service in House of Worship |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1957 | number = 313 |pages=10–11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1901 in Paris she met Breakwell who gave her Gobineau's description in French of the [[Execution of the Báb]] which confirmed her faith. Turn of the century Paris is also where [[Charles Mason Remey]] first met Thompson when she was taking classes on the religion from Gulpáygání.

Bolles also introduced the religion to French-American Edith MacKaye who then moved from Paris to [[Sion, Switzerland]] in 1903 as the first Bahá'í to live in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Vader | first =John-Paul | title =Selected episodes from the early history of the Bahá’í Faith in Switzerland | journal =Ezri Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies, University of Haifa | date =27 October 2009 | url =http://bahai-library.com/pdf/2011_09/vader_history_bahai_switzerland.pdf | accessdate = 2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolles would later leave France, being married in London and moved to Canada.&lt;ref name="laura-bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanden"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Van den Hoonaard | first = Will C. | title = The Origins of the Bahá'í Community of Canada; 1898–1948 | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 1996 | location = Canada | pages = 185, 273| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=znXIbkNA1nQC&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;ots=9DqlD6REsD&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-88920-272-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 Dreyfus went with [[Lua Getsinger]] and Edith Sanderson to see `Abdu'l-Bahá. Over following decades Dreyfus would translate many Bahá'í writings and serve in delegations to the Shah of Persia protesting the treatment of Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="laura-bio" /&gt;

Modern Iranian government [[Allegations of Bahá'í involvement with other powers|allegations]] against Bahá'ís claim the early 20th century French Ambassador confessed that the Bahá'í Faith was a tool of colonial expansion. Bahá'í sources indicate that the French Ambassador in Tehran, greatly impressed by the teachings of the religion and by their effect upon the people who embraced them, suggested that Bahá'ís might go to [[Tunisia]] and teach their religion there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = BIC rebuts Iran's anti-Baha'i document |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1983 | number = 626 |pages=1–5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Dreyfus that sought out permission from the French authorities for the religion to be promulgated in Tunisia.&lt;ref name="laura-bio" /&gt; Indeed, the Bahá‘í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation or Euro-American assimilation&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Addison | first = Donald Francis | last2 = Buck | first2 = Christopher | title = Messengers of God in North America Revisited: An Exegesis of `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablet to Amír Khán | journal = Online Journal of Bahá‘í Studies | volume = 01 | pages = 180–270 | publisher = Association for Bahá'í Studies English-Speaking Europe |location = London | year = 2007 | url =http://bahaistudies.net/onlinejournal/OJBS_1_Buck_Addison_MessengersofGod.pdf |ISSN= 1177-8547 |accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a stance supported by anthropologist [[Alice Beck Kehoe]], a well known researcher of Native Americans, who observed that the Bahá‘í Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even its country of origin.&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck" /&gt; This has been examined in issues related to Native Americans, Latin Americans&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 |number = 493 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sub-Saharan Africans&lt;ref name="BN283"&gt;{{cite magazine |title = United States Africa Teaching Committee; Goals for this year |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1954 | number = 283 |pages=10–11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; affirming this approach in Bahá'í activities.

Among the translations done by Dreyfus of Bahá'u'lláh's works are the [[Kitab-i-Iqan]], [[The Hidden Words]] and [[Epistle to the Son of the Wolf]]. Over the same period [[A.L.M. Nicholas]] was inspired to study the [[Bábism|Bábí Faith]] because of Gobineau though Nicholas was critical of his work and even reached to the point of calling himself a Bábí.&lt;ref name="7proofs"&gt;{{cite web| last =The Báb | authorlink =Báb |others=A.

On learning with clarity of the independent status as a greater prophet acknowledged for the Báb late in his life he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not know how to thank you nor how to express the joy that floods my heart. So it is necessary not only to admit but to love and admire the Báb. Poor great Prophet, born in the heart of Persia, without any means of instruction, and who, alone in the world, encircled by enemies, succeeds by the force of his genius in creating a universal and wise religion. That Bahá'u'lláh succeeded Him eventually may be, but I want people to admire the sublimity of the Báb, who has, moreover, paid with his life, with his blood, for the reforms he preached. Cite me another similar example. At last, I can die in peace. Glory be to Shoghi Effendi who has calmed my torment and my anxieties, glory be to him who recognizes the worth of Siyyid 'Alí-Mu&lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;ammad, the Báb. I am so happy that I kiss your hands that have written my address on the envelope which carried Shoghi's message. Thank you, Mademoiselle; thank you from the depths of my heart.&lt;ref name="7proofs" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Barney and Dreyfus worked together on the editing and translation of [[Some Answered Questions]].&lt;ref&gt;''al-Nūr al-abhā fīmofāważāt `Abdu'l-Bahá'', Leiden, 1908; tr. L. C. Barney and H.

Circa 1900–1908 [[Marion Jack]], who would go on to be well known for her work in promulgating the religion, learned of the religion in Paris from Mason Remey when she was a student studying painting and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Memorial at Temple to Marion Jack|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1954 |number = 282 |pages=4–5 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European trip after leaving Acre Palestine spanned from August to December 1911, at which time he returned to Egypt for the winter. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bahá'í communities in the West and to further spread his father's teachings.&lt;ref name="b_end" /&gt;

When `Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Marseille, he was greeted by Dreyfus.&lt;ref name="hd"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hippolyte Dreyfus, apôtre d`Abdu'l-Bahá; Premier bahá'í français | work = Qui est `Abdu'l-Bahá ? |publisher = Assemblée Spirituelle Nationale des Bahá'ís de France | date = 9 July 2000 |url =http://www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-doc/ouvrage/dreyfus/dreyfus_12.htm | accessdate = 14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreyfus accompanied `Abdu'l-Bahá to [[Thonon-les-Bains]] on [[Lake Geneva]] that straddles France and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="hd" /&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in France for a few days before going to [[Vevey]] in Switzerland. While in Thonon-les-Bains, `Abdu'l-Bahá met [[Mass'oud Mirza Zell-e Soltan]], who had asked to meet `Abdu'l-Bahá. Soltan, who had ordered the execution of [[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King and Beloved of martyrs]], was the eldest grandson of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] who had ordered the [[Execution of the Báb]] himself. Juliet Thompson, an American Bahá'í who had also come to visit `Abdu'l-Bahá while still in this early phase of his journeys, recorded comments of Dreyfus who heard Soltan's stammering apology for past wrongs. `Abdu'l-Bahá embraced him and invited his sons to lunch.&lt;ref name="JT"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson| first = Juliet |author2=Marzieh Gail | title = The diary of Juliet Thompson | publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 1983 | pages = 147–223; Chapter ''With `Abdu'l-Bahá in Thonon, Vevey, and Geneva'' | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/thompson/3.html | isbn = 978-0-933770-27-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Bahram Mírzá Sardar Mass'oud and [[Akbar Mass’oud]], another grandson of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, met with the Bahá'ís, and apparently Akbar Mass’oud was greatly affected by meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Honnold | first = Annamarie | title = Vignettes from the Life of `Abdu'l-Bahá | publisher = George Ronald | year = 2010 |location = UK | url =http://www.georgeronald.com/show_book.php?book_id=217 | isbn = 978-0-85398-129-9 | ref = harv |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then he went to Great Britain.

On return from Great Britain `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Paris for nine weeks, during which time he stayed at a residence at 4 Avenue de Camoens, and during his time there he was helped by Dreyfus, Barney, and [[Lady Blomfield]] who had come from London. `Abdu'l-Bahá's first talk in Paris was on 16 October,&lt;ref name="Oct16" /&gt; and later that same day guests gathered in a poor quarter outside Paris at a home for orphans by Mr and Mrs. Ponsonaille which was much praised by `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Beede | first = Alice R.|title = A Glimpse of Abdul-Baha in Paris| journal = Star of the West | volume = 02 | issue = 18 | pages = 6, 7, 12 | date = 7 February 1912 | publisher = Bahá'í News Service | location = Chicago, USA | editor-last = Windust | editor-first = Albert R | editor2-last = Buikema | editor2-first = Gertrude | url =http://bahai-library.com/beede_glimpse_abdulbaha_paris | accessdate = 15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Second =====

`Abdu'l-Bahá arrived in Paris as part of the second journey on 22 January 1913; the visit would last for a couple months. During his stay in the city, he continued his public talks, as well as meeting with Bahá'ís, including locals, those from Germany, and those who had come from the East specifically to meet with him. During this stay in Paris, `Abdu'l-Bahá's stayed at an apartment at 30 Rue St Didier which was rented for him by (the now married) Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney.&lt;ref name="b_end" /&gt;

Some of the notables that `Abdu'l-Bahá met while in Paris include the Persian minister in Paris, several prominent Ottomans from the previous regime, professor 'Inayatu'llah Khan, and British Orientalist [[E.G. Browne]].&lt;ref name="b_end" /&gt; He also gave a talk on the evening of the 12th to the [[Esperanto|Esperantists]], and on the next evening gave a talk to the Theosophists at the Hotel Moderne. He had met with a group of professors and theological students at Pasteur Henri Monneir's Theological Seminary; Pasteur Monnier was a distinguished Protestant theologian, vice-president of the [[Protestant Federation of France]] and professor of Protestant theology in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Fazel | first = Seena | title = 'Abdu'l-Bahá on Christ and Christianity | journal = Bahá'í Studies Review | volume = 03 | issue = 01 | publisher = |year = 1993 | url =http://bahai-library.com/fazel_abdulbaha_christ_christianity | accessdate = 3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tablets of the Divine Plan ====

Later `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916–1917 suggesting Bahá'ís take the religion to many lands, including these. These letters were compiled in the book titled "''[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]''", but its publication was delayed owing to World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. They were translated and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|''Star of the West'']] magazine on 12 December 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbas |first= 'Abdu'l-Bahá |translator=Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab |title= Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url= http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; One tablet says in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world, the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace.

== Development and trials ==

=== Period around the World Wars ===

[[Agnes Alexander]], who had been through Paris October 1900 but encountered the religion elsewhere, was back near France as World War I broke. She was in Europe seeking passage to Japan because of directions from `Abdu'l-Bahá. She found opportunity as she passed through France riding in a third class coach with two wounded soldiers and arriving safely at Marseilles substituting on a ticket of a German woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Agnes Alexander: 70 years of service |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1983 | number = 631 |pages=6–11 | url = |ISSN=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis Kelsey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = CABLEGRAM RECEIVED FROM HAIFA, ISRAEL |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1970 | number = 469 | page =12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard St. Barbe Baker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Richard St. Barbe Baker: 1889–1982|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1982 | number = 469 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; were or would become Bahá'ís who served in France during the First World War. [[Edna M. True]], a Bahá'í since 1903 and daughter of (later named Hand of the Cause) [[Corinne True]], was a member of the [[Smith College]] Relief Unit serving in France ministering to the needs of U.S. servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Edna M. True: 1888–1988|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1988 | number =94 |pages=2–3 | url = | ISSN=0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of Paris was elected.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bahá'í World: A Biennial International Record, Volume II, 1926–1928'' (New York City: Bahá'í Publishing Trust, 1928), 182–85.&lt;/ref&gt; That winter Hippolyte Drefus-Barney died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Distinguished, beloved servant passes away |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1929 | number = 29 |pages=2–3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral services included Mountfort Mills as a representative of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and conveyed that local assemblies in the US were holding memorial services for him. In 1929–30 the first annual conference of ''Bahá'í Students in Paris'' was held.&lt;ref name="BW"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/may_ellis_maxwell_bw May Ellis Maxwell], compiled by Universal House of Justice, published in A Compendium of Volumes of the Bahá'í World I-XII, 1925–1954, pp. 516–28&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 a Frenchman Gaston Hesse is noted as a staff editor of volume IV of the annual [[Bahá'í literature#Periodicals|Bahá'í World]] periodical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Bahá'í World (Volume Four) |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1931 | number = 51 | page =13 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of Persian students traveled to France in part to review the places `Abdu'l-Bahá visited during breaks in their studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Bahá'í activities in other countries; France |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1931 | number = 55 | page =6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; until developments in 1938–39 brought that project to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = News of East and West |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1940 | number = 139 |page =11 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 May Maxwell (formerly Bolles) held meetings on the religion in [[Lyon]] along with Persian Mírzá Ezzatollah Zabih.&lt;ref name="BW" /&gt; David Hoffman, later a member of the [[Universal House of Justice]] was able to visit Bahá'ís in France in 1945. He conveyed oral reports that the [[Gestapo]] had questioned the Bahá'ís of Paris. He reported the Bahá'ís were able to retain some literature because they could report their office had been hit by a bomb destroying materials there but left unsaid that materials stored elsewhere were untouched. Some members of the community were still present, some had died, and some had disappeared: Miss Sanderson, Mrs. Scott, Madame Hess and Mr. Kennedy were among the living, Mrs. Kennedy died, Mlle. Alcan was killed in an air-raid, Mrs. Stannard died of cancer, and Mme Monteglore was known to have been taken to a concentration camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = News from other lands; France |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1944 | number = 176 |pages=17–18 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some meetings were still able to be held during the occupation. French Bahá'ís also assisted in the mechanics of publishing a number of translations of Bahá'í volumes by [[Lidia Zamenhof]] in Poland, Anne Lynch in Switzerland, and others in the 1930s and 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Memorial services honor Mrs. Anne Lynch |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1967 | number = 430 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After World War II ===

The French Bahá'í community was one of the few to remain organized in Europe coming out of WWII.&lt;ref name="Neth" /&gt; The European Teaching Committee did not cover France as part of its responsibilities for reestablishing the religion in the countries of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = News from other lands; France |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1947 | number = 194 | page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, events noting its relative health include a new Bahá'í convert, Mme. E. Schmitt of [[Nancy, France]], in February 1946&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = European survey; France |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1946 | number = 180 | page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US national assembly establishing a bureau for international news on the religion in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Distribution of Bahá'í News|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1946 | number = 180 | page =2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Duncan McAlear shared news of conditions in France at the US national convention from which a decision was reached to set up a relief committee, in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Highlights of the Convention |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1946 | number = 180 |pages=4–6 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the Bahá'ís of the southern states of America and eastern Canada coordinated relief packages for southern France (noting Marselles, Lyon, Hyeres and Toulouse) while the eastern states and again eastern Canada extended aid to the rest of France, Germany and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = International Relief; What and Where to send|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1946 | number = 185| page =10 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen contacts in Paris, three in Hyeres, two in Lyon, and one each in Marseille and Toulouse, were noted for relief shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = National Committees; France|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1946 | number = 186|pages=3–5| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marion Little pioneered to France from the US in 1947 and aided the formation of a publishing trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Passing of Pioneer Mrs. Marion Little|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1973 | number = 506|page =13| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six French Bahá'ís are noted as still being prisoners of war in Germany where the National Spiritual Assembly of Germany petitioned for their release along with other nationals of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Excerpts from "Geneva Exchange"|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1947 | number = 186| page =4 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French community was summarized as elderly and relatively few in number to compare with efforts of Bahá'ís in other countries then underway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Mildred Mottahedeh visits ten European countries|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1947 | number = 200| page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is also the oldest and continually functioning community on the continent of Europe with new converts in Lyon.

See for example [[Bahá'í Faith in Laos]], [[Bahá'í Faith in New Caledonia]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Senegal]]. However the Bahá'ís in France remained relatively small and did not penetrate into French society&lt;ref name="InWest" /&gt; though Bahá'ís like [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]] traveled to Paris and Lyon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = European enrollments increase |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1948 | number = 205| page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucienne Migette was noted in particular in Lyon as being very active in promulgating the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = A view of pioneering |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1948 | number = 205|pages=9–10, 12 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Baker's trip signalized an engagement of French Bahá'ís and others in progress of the religion following the troubled limits of war. French Bahá'ís were in attendance at the first European Teaching Conference on  22–26 May 1948 held in Geneva which including public talks in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = European Bahá'ís hold first Teaching Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1948 | number = 209| page =1 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second such conference, held  5–7 August 1948 in Brussels, had Migette of Lyon as one of the speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Second European Teaching Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1949 | number = 209|page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 the Bahá'ís of Paris opened a Bahá'í center open 3 days of week to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; France|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1951 | number = 243| page =8 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 fourteen Bahá'ís from across Europe attended the regional conference of NGOs for the Department of Public Information of the United Nations Organizations which was held in Paris – the largest group at the conference were the Bahá'ís and Bahá'í [[Ugo Giachery]] was elected chairman of one of its committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = U.N Regional Conference in Paris|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1952 | number = 252|pages=13–14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1953 the first French Bahá'í conference on the promulgation of the religion was held in Lyon at which Ugo Giachery attended as well as Persians and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News; France|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1953 | number = 269|pages=13–14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Ten Year Crusade]] Sara Kenney of France became a [[Knight of Bahá'u'lláh]] for pioneering to [[Medeira]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/mbw/sec-77.html Triple Announcement on Conclusion of Holy Year] Messages to the Bahá'í World: 1950–1957, pp. 169–171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title = The Passing of two Knighs of Bahá'u'lláh|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1968 | number = 452| page =3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few years she would return and serve on the National Spiritual Assembly of France.

In December 1961 the 50th anniversary of Abdu'l-Bahá's first trip to France was commemorated at [[Hôtel Lutetia]] with an updated translation of [[Paris Talks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = Abdu'l-Bahá's first visit to Europe Commemorated in Paris |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1962 | number = 372| page =2| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national assembly established the French Language Publishing Trust in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = French Language Publishing Trust Has New Headquarters |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972| number = 492| page =24 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963 the members of national assemblies around the world acted as delegates to the international convention to elect the [[Universal House of Justice]] for the first time. The members of the French national assembly were: Chahab Alai, Florence Bagley, Dr. A.M. Barafroukhteh, Sara Kenny, Lucien McComb, Lucienne Migette, Yadullah Rafaat, Henriette Samimy, and Omer Charles Tamenne.&lt;ref name="custodians" /&gt;

Demographically the religions expanded as follows:

In 1952: 3 assemblies, 3 groups, and 6 isolated Bahá'ís.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International News; France|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1952 | number = 260|pages=13–14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public/Media engagement ====

Since the inception of the Bahá'í Faith, its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]] exhorted believers to be involvemed in [[socio-economic development]], leading individuals to become active in various projects.&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = History of the Bahá'í Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | accessdate = 16 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France this developed from just participating in social public events but it expanded into social developments and cares which returned government appreciation and support.

In 1966 the Bahá'ís participated in the International Fair in Nice handing out thousands of pieces of literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Bahá'í display at the International Faith in Nice…|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1966 | number = 424| page =19 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar exhibit took place in Marseille in later 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Marseille exhibit proclaims Faith to thousands |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1966 | number = 427| page =3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller one took place in late 1966 in [[Luchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = French school proclaims faith to hundreds |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1966 | number = 429| page =13 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit opportunity in Nice repeated in 1967 and was paralleled in [[Grenoble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = French proclamation in two major cities |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1967 | number = 436| page =18 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 the event in Nice repeated and this time an additional venue in Montpelier had a Bahá'í display present&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = French exhibits in Nice, Montpelier draw crowds |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=June 1968 | number =447 | page =7 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a smaller event took place in [[Marseille]] and [[Saint-Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = News Briefs |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=September 1968 | number =450 | page =15 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971–72 Bahá'í youth organized a proclamation comparing and the music group [[Seals and Crofts]] after their [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] along with related publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Recent French Activities |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=March 1972 | number =492 | page =14 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year the national assembly formally met with the Mayor of Monaco officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Mayor of Monaco Receives Baha'is |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=March 1973 | number =504 |page =24 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 local efforts to promulgate the religion in the area of [[Clermont-Ferrand]] developed into television coverage between there and Switzerland on local television and it was reported most of the new converts were youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = A working holiday in the villages of France |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=October 1973 | number =511 |pages=22–3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1976 the national assembly sent all local assemblies a package of information suitable for public use about [[Bahá'í Holy Days]], and Bahá'í support for observances like [[United Nations Day]] which was in turn offered to local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Media campaign has good results |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=March 1976 | number =541 |page =18 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, an architecture student of [[I'Ecole Superieure d'Architecture de Bordeaux]] was able to formulate a study program on "The Baha'i Faith and Architecture" which was then in turn presented to students and faculty of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Architecture student talks about Faith |magazine= Bahá'í News|date=May 1976 | number =542 |pages=8–9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the first national television coverage of the religion took place during the 1976 international conference held in Paris.&lt;ref name="BN546" /&gt; [[Kurt Waldheim]], then secretary-general of the United Nations, sent a message in recognition of the contributions of the Baha'is to United Nations initiatives to the conference.

In 1987 Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] commemorated her mother's time in France with a trip visiting the Baha'is in 17 places during a 33-day stay arriving on 11 November. Events included a two-day national conference on spreading the religion was held in Paris; seven regional gatherings throughout the country in Nice, Marseille, Annecy, Bordeaux, Nantes, Rennes and Strasbourg, and a national youth conference of more than 450 youth in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Special report – Recounting a memorable visit to France|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1988 | number = 424|pages=1–3 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the visit she met with the director of the ''Affairs of Cultes'' and former president of the European Parliament, [[Simone Veil]], former prime minister, then Speaker of its House of Representatives, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], as well as local officials. During meetings with Baha'is and visitors she often spoke of her recent trips to Africa.

Extending the background of academic interest in the religion since 1900 two volumes of the French language Catholic encyclopedia ''Fils d'Abraham'' were published in 1987 mentioning the religion:

[[File:American Missionary Emily Susan Hartwell.jpg|thumb|Bible women in the Foochow Mission, China, 1902]]
In [[Christian missions|missions]] history, a '''Bible woman''' was a local woman who supported foreign female missionaries in their [[Christian]] [[evangelism|evangelistic]] and [[social work]].

==Background==
The title "Bible woman" was first used in London in connection with a female [[evangelism|evangelist]], [[Ellen Henrietta Ranyard]], who put effort to reach sick and poor women in the poorest area of London in the mid-nineteenth century. Ranyard's heart was heavily burdened with the poor condition of women in St. Giles district that she decided to start an evangelistic work among them. Ranyard found a Christian woman who had a similar life as such and hired the woman to go with her to the poorest district in [[London]] to evangelize and help the sick women there. The woman who had the similar life as her recipients would freely visit the poor women and read the Bible to their hearings. She also distributed the Bible and tracts to the area, this is why she was called Bible woman. From this little seed, sprang Ranyard's mission. In 1879, there were about 170 Bible women employed in the mission. After Ellen Ranyard's death in 1879, her work was continued as the [[London Bible and Domestic Female Mission]]. The idea of "Bible women" did not stay in her home of origin, in London, but spread throughout England, Scotland, and it travelled to Asia, Africa, and rest of the non-western world with women missionaries.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/136631142|url-access=subscription|title=Bible-Women|last=|first=|date=11 May 1865|work=New York Observer and Chronicle|access-date=22 October 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=19|volume=43|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the creation of many interdenominational [[Christian mission|mission]] organizations was influenced by the [[Evangelical revival]]s, [[anti-slavery movement]]s, and [[free trade]] theories, especially in Britain. The urge to preach the gospel to individuals shifted to nations and was motivated not only by religious zeal but was also inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideology (which saw liberation and salvation of the world as an equal) to improve one's self to contribute the global progress.{{sfn|Prevost|2009|p=766}} In this context, [[Protestant missionary]] women from the western world became increasingly interested in mission and trained themselves as educators, doctors, nurses, and other professionals to join in the mission work. They played a central role in mission fields as doctors, nurses, and teachers; they ran schools, hospitals and orphanages for children, etc. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most of the missionaries operating in the mission field were women.{{sfn|Prevost|2009|p=768}}

==Role==
In the mission field, "Bible women" or "Bible readers" were local [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] women. The majority of Bible women held lower social status in their respective countries.{{sfn|Chilcote|Schuler|2017|pp=113-114}} They were either supported by female missionaries or by local churches but were usually the lowest paid or even sometimes they were unpaid.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=141}} These local Christian women helped the British missionaries, especially female missionaries to perform their daily tasks and to accomplish their mission goal. Ruth Tucker argues that "without Bible Women, female missionaries would have been at a loss."{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=134}}

==Ministry==
Accompanying western missionaries on their missions were a significant part of Bible women ministry, but on many occasions, they served alone or in teams without any direct assistance from the missionaries.&lt;ref name="London"/&gt; Their ministry was wide in its range: they openly shared their faith with their fellow women, read the Bible in communities, taught children in village schools, called on the sick or troubled, worked among girls, and visited women in their homes. Bible women served as [[Evangelism|evangelists]] not only in their homelands but also in foreign settings.{{sfn|Strawn|2012|p=120}} In the beginning of the 20th century, there were a number of [[Koreans|Korean]] Bible women in [[Manchuria]], [[Japan]], and [[Hawaii]] sharing Bible stories with women and children.{{sfn|Strawn|2012|p=119}} Furthermore, Bible women itinerated in villages to distribute and sell Bibles, tracts, and religious literature.

In 1913, thirty-six Bible women were employed by the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] for the purpose of helping distribute scripture, and this practice continued with other [[Bible society|Bible societies]].{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=140}} Even though there were few who wished to buy the Bible,{{sfn|Woman's Foreign Mission Society|1886|p=51}} Bible women were successful in winning women for the Gospel. The Bible women were more effective in their evangelistic task than that of missionary women because they had open access to local women, girls, and children. In addition, they did not have a language barrier as most of the missionaries did have. Although Bible women focused on ministering to other women, occasionally, there were opportunities to minister to men as well.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=140}}

==Training==
Initially, Bible women were trained by women missionaries on an individual basis.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=134}} They were taught the Bible, but on occasion, they were taught nursing, writing, homemaking, and health.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=135}} However, in later years, the number of Bible women increased and female training schools were opened: in China, alone, forty girls' schools were running in 1900.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=135}} Bible women were trained as Bible teachers, nurses, and healthcare providers. Bible women who had a solid foundation in [[biblical studies]] were trained to be Bible teachers. 
     
In [[Sudan]], Bible women used a book entitled ''One Hundred Lessons from the Bible'' that took the student through the Bible in outlined studies that involved answering questions and memorizing verses. Following the one hundred lessons, there was a "Way of Salvation" series that was geared to bring the student to a personal commitment to Christ.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=139}}

Bible women were actively involved in medical ministry too. They were taught basic medical skills by their female [[Medical missions|medical missionaries]] and then they worked as nurses and healthcare providers; they cared patients and shared the [[Gospel]] with them.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|pp=140-141}}

==Today==
Although Bible women played a major role in evangelizing their fellow women in their countries, they are largely left behind in contemporary study of Christian mission. There are not many records of Bible women today, neither of their successes nor their failures. It is because women were disregarded in their own cultures or may be they were ignored by their western male and female missionaries. Although they were the least known [[evangelism|evangelists]], Bible women played a major role in furthering the [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Kingdom of God]] in their homelands and beyond.{{sfn|Tucker|1985|p=144}}

'''Borscht Belt''', or '''Jewish Alps''', is a nickname for the (now mostly defunct) summer resorts of the [[Catskill Mountains]] in parts of [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]], [[Orange County, New York|Orange]], and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties in [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Borscht]], a soup associated with immigrants from eastern Europe, was a colloquialism for "Jewish". These resorts were a popular vacation spot for [[New York City]] [[Jews]] between the 1920s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/1995-96/95-062i.html |title=Catskills Institute: Jewish scholars study history, cultural significance of the Borscht Belt | publisher= [[Brown University]]| location=Providence, Rhode Island| date=November 29, 1995|accessdate= August 21, 2017| archivedate= August 20, 2017|

Most Borscht Belt resorts hosted traveling Jewish comedians and musicians, and many who later became famous began their careers there.

The tradition of Borscht Belt entertainment started in the early twentieth century with the indoor and outdoor theaters constructed on a 40-acre (16-hectare) tract in [[Hunter, New York|Hunter]], New York, by [[Yiddish theater]] star [[Boris Thomashefsky]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545027326/jerry-lewis-on-his-borscht-belt-childhood-and-the-lonely-work-of-comedy&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1987 films ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' and ''[[Maureen Stapleton#Filmography|Sweet Lorraine]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|title=Overnight fire destroys Heiden Hotel of 'Sweet Lorraine' fame|work=[[Times Herald-Record]]|location=Middletown, New York|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archivedate=February 1, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201165544/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflect on the bygone era.

Beginning in the 1980s, the growth of air travel made the Catskills less attractive, so many of the resorts eventually closed, although Jewish culture has remained present. A large percentage of the region comprises summer homes and bungalow colonies (including many of the historic colonies) for [[Orthodox Jewish]] families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Frankfurter|first=Yitzchok|title=Ruins of the Borscht Belt|url=https://issuu.com/amimagazine/docs/epub_ami136|magazine=[[Ami (magazine)|Ami]]|date=Sep 15, 2013|issue=136|page=172|access-date=Nov 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily from the [[New York metropolitan area]], as well as year-round dwellers.

Resorts still are operating in the region, including Villa Roma, an Italian American resort, [[Soyuzivka]] and Xenia, Ukrainian cultural resorts, and the Skazka and Hotel Pine, Russian cultural resorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skazka.us|website=Skazka.us|title=Skazka Resort|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xeniaresort.net|title=Xenia Resort|website= XeniaResort.net|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianresort.net|title=Hotel Pine|website=RussianResort.net|date=|accessdate=2011-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, motorsports enthusiasts are drawn to the area visiting the [[Monticello Motor Club]].

==History==
Borscht Belt hotels, bungalow colonies, [[summer camp]]s, and קאָך-אַליינס ''kokh-aleyns'' (a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] name for self-catered [[boarding house]]s, literally, "cook-alones") were frequented by families of middle and working class Jewish New Yorkers, mostly [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish immigrants.
[[Antisemitism]], particularly in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, meant that they were often denied accommodation elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;E. Raab and G.J. Selznick: Major Social Problems. Joanna Cotler Books, 1974 (3rd edition). {{ISBN|0060452994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Catskill hotels were converted from farms that immigrant Jews had started in the early 1900s. As the area grew, it began to cater specifically to Jews, providing kosher food, synagogues, and other features of Jewish communities, including entertainment. The area became known as "The Jewish Alps", and the [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan County]] portion as "Solomon County".&lt;ref name="hvmag"&gt;{{cite web | last=Levine | first=David | date=August 8, 2014 | title=History of Borscht Belt Hotels and Bungalow Colonies in the Catskills | url=http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/August-2014/History-of-Borscht-Belt-Hotels-and-Bungalow-Colonies-in-the-Catskills/ | work=[[Hudson Valley (magazine)|Hudson Valley]] | publisher=Today Media | accessdate=May 26, 2017 | archivedate=2016-09-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918130642/http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/August-2014/History-of-Borscht-Belt-Hotels-and-Bungalow-Colonies-in-the-Catskills/# | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millions of tourists, especially New Yorkers, came to swim in the lakes and oversized hotel pools, to ski or ice-skate&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag" /&gt; or take lessons in golf, tennis, and dancing. No fewer than 538 hotels sprang up in this area of Eastern New York.&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag"/&gt;

Well known resorts in the area included [[Concord Resort Hotel|The Concord]], [[Grossinger's]], [[Brickman's]], [[Brown's Hotel (Catskills)|Brown's Hotel]], [[Kutsher's Hotel|Kutsher's Hotel and Country Club]], the [[Nevele Grand Hotel|Nevele]], Friar Tuck Inn, Gibber's, Gilbert's, Granit, the Woodbine Hotel, the Heiden Hotel, Irvington, Lansman's, The Laurels Hotel and Country Club, The Pines Resort, [[Raleigh Hotel (South Fallsburg, New York)|Raleigh]], Silverman's River View Hotel, Stevensville, Stiers, the Tamarack Lodge, the Olympic, and the Windsor Regency.

Two of the larger hotels in High View (north of [[Bloomingburg, New York|Bloomingburg]]) were Shawanga Lodge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Dan | first = Abby |date=n.d. | title= History | url=http://shawanga.com | publisher=Shawanga.com (fan site) |accessdate= November 11, 2016| archivedate=May 21, 2017| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170521222001/http://shawanga.com/| deadurl=no}} Collection of photographs and memorabilia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Overlook. In 1959, the Shawanga hosted a conference that marked the beginning of serious research into lasers.&lt;ref name='Beam'&gt;{{cite book | last = Hecht | first = Jeff | title = Beam: the race to make the laser | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | location = Oxford, UK | page = 101 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6jOnlRViWPoC | isbn = 978-0-19-514210-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel burned to the ground in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Roosa | first=Monoka A. | date= 2007 | title= Mamakating | publisher = Arcadia Publishing| location= publocation | page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Overlook had entertainment and summer lodging through the late 1960s and was operated by the Schrier family. It included a main building and about 50 other bungalows, plus a five-unit cottage just across the street. It remains in a different form, no longer functioning as it was in its heyday.

The [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway|New York, Ontario &amp; Western Railway]] carried passengers to the resorts from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], until 1948. The railroad was abandoned in 1957. Despite the improvement of roads such as the original [[New York State Route 17]], the area is no longer a major travel destination.

The decline of the Catskills resorts was apparent as early as 1965. Entertainment in America was changing as the country ushered in the [[jet age]].&lt;ref name="Tablet Mag" /&gt; As ethnic barriers in the U.S. began to fall and travel to distant resorts became easier and cheaper, fewer Jewish American families in New York City went to the Catskills. By the early 1960s, between a quarter and a third of Grossinger's annual visitors were non-Jewish.&lt;ref name=AJones&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Abigail|title=Beautiful ruins: The Catskills may be dying, but the memories live on|url=http://forward.com/articles/183901/rediscovering-beauty-amid-ruins-of-once-glorious-c/?p=all|accessdate=October 27, 2013|work=The Forward|publisher=The Forward Association| date=September 27, 2013|archivedate= March 6, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160306111031/http://forward.com/culture/183901/rediscovering-beauty-amid-ruins-of-once-glorious-c/?p=all|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the universalization of [[air conditioning|air-conditioned]] hotels across America drew customers away from the aging resorts primarily built before this innovation became popular.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun mistake" /&gt; In the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s]], traditional resort vacations lost their appeal for many younger adults.&lt;ref name=AJones /&gt;

Smaller, more modest hotels such as Youngs Gap and the Ambassador found themselves in a niche with a vanishing clientele and closed by the end of the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} By the mid-1990s, nearly 300 hotels and motels had gone out of business in Sullivan County.&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun mistake" /&gt;

The 1970s took a toll on more lavish establishments such as the Flagler and The Laurels.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5it7KmNphMo&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 Grossinger's closed for renovations, and the property was abandoned by new owners midway through work. Grossinger's largest historic rival (and the largest of all the Borscht Belt resorts), the Concord, benefitted only temporarily, filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and closing a year later.

In 1987, New York's mayor [[Ed Koch]] proposed buying the Gibber Hotel in Kiamesha Lake to house the homeless. The idea was opposed by local officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Joyce Purnick | first=Joyce | last=Purnick | date=April 4, 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/04/nyregion/catskills-hotel-suggested-for-homeless.html | work=The New York Times | title=Catskills Hotel Suggested For Homeless | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel instead became a religious school, like many old hotels in the Catskills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelframes.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228045158/http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelframes.html |date=February 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update|date=September 2017}}

Plans are now in place by those who purchased the former Borscht Belt resorts [[Concord Resort Hotel]] and [[Grossinger's]] to work with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in an attempt to bring gambling to the region. Because the Borscht Belt's prime has long passed and many of the resorts are abandoned, developers believe this is the only way to revitalize the region to the popularity it once had by attracting guests to world-class casinos and resorts such as the ones in [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} However, large-scale casino plans have not come to fruition, mainly because there are no [[Indian reservation]]s anywhere near the area (the [[Mohawk tribe]]'s effort to build a Catskills casino was rejected for this very reason). Instead, the state government proposed legalizing off-reservation gambling, which required a positive referendum, passed in November 2013.

The Heiden Hotel in [[South Fallsburg, New York|South Fallsburg]], which was the location of the movie ''[[Maureen Stapleton#Filmography|Sweet Lorraine]]'' starring [[Maureen Stapleton]], was destroyed by fire in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|title=Overnight fire destroys Heiden Hotel of 'Sweet Lorraine' fame|work=[[Times Herald-Record]]|location=Middletown, New York|publisher=Dow Jones Local Media Group, Inc.|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archivedate=February 1, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201165544/http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/NEWS/80518002|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stevensville Hotel in [[Liberty (town), New York|Swan Lake]], which was owned by the family of [[David G. Friehling]], who pleaded guilty as an accomplice of [[Bernard Madoff]]'s, has reopened as the Swan Lake Resort Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Israel|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090322%2FNEWS%2F903220321|title=Madoff mess has local link|work=Times Herald-Record|location=Middletown, New York|publisher=GateHouse Media|date=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|archivedate=2017-08-21|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6stPIKkjU?url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090322%2FNEWS%2F903220321#|deadurl=yes|df=}} Additional [[ WebCitation archive]] August 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelnews/rebuild.html |title=Reinventing the Catskills|first=Rich|last=Newman|date=n.d.| publisher= The Catskills Institute (Brown University) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227094255/http://catskills.brown.edu/hotelnews/rebuild.html |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Homowack Lodge in [[Spring Glen, New York]], was converted into a summer camp for [[Hassidic]] girls.

Broadcast media is being utilized by the '''[[Members Church of God International|Members Church of God International (MCGI)]]''', an international Christian religious organization with headquarters in the [[Philippines]], to preach the gospel and expand internationally. The church is producing religious programs in different languages, aired in various countries, by acquiring [[brokered programming|time slots]] in several television stations. The church also maintains its own radio and television network for its 24/7 terrestrial, satellite and internet broadcasts.

The MCGI started as a small group with less than a hundred believers in 1977. It is popularly known in the Philippines as '''''Ang Dating Daan (ADD)''''' (English: The Old Path), the title of its flagship radio and television program and currently the longest-running religious program in the Philippines with [[Eliseo Soriano]] (also known as "Bro. Eli") as the program's main host and the "Overall Servant" (Former title: "Presiding Minister") to MCGI. Most of its broadcast ministries are directly funded by the church, through voluntary contributions from its members, as the church do not accept monetary donations from non-members. Meanwhile, a few of its news and public affairs programs in the Philippines are supported by commercial advertisements.

Its global evangelism is conducted mostly via [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio, [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio, terrestrial television, [[cable television]] and direct-to-home satellite transmissions. Other platforms include [[internet streaming]], [[mobile app]]lications and various forms of social media. The group also conducts regular Bible Expositions aired live via satellite in all MCGI local congregations and through the "MCGI Broadcast" mobile app.

==History==
Soriano started his nightly town-to-town preaching in the 1970s but eventually realized that his lifetime is not enough to reach the entire Philippines. In 1980, he decided to go on radio and after a few years on television to preach the gospel. In 1999, the church took advantage of the advancement in internet technology. Its foray into satellite broadcasting happened in 2004, to reach more souls in different countries around the globe.

In October 1980, the 30-minute radio program ''Ang Dating Daan'' was aired in [[DWAN|DWWA 1206 kHz]] with a shoe-string budget. In February 1983, the program was aired for the first time in television through [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC Channel 13]]. In 1997, the program moved to [[DZRJ-TV|RJTV Channel 29]], government-owned [[People's Television Network|PTV-4]] and later in [[Southern Broadcasting Network|SBN 21]]. In 1999, the church launched a nationwide radio broadcast through [[DZRH]], [[Radio Mindanao Network|RMN]] and [[Radyo Natin Network|100 Radyo Natin]] stations.

==Radio and television==
The [[UNTV (Philippines)|UNTV Public Service]] channel, [[DWUN|Radyo La Verdad 1350 kHz]], [[The Old Path (TOP) Channel|TOP Channel]], [[The Truth Channel]], [[TV Verdade]] and [[TV La Verdad]] are the official religious media services of the Members Church of God International.

Between 2010 and 2011, the MCGI programs reached the airwaves of [[India]], [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Portugal]]. To further boost viewership, the church acquired a 30-minute slot in [[Fox Channel]] which can be seen in over 50 cable networks in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. In 2012, MCGI launched its own channel [[TV La Verdad]] (English: Truth TV) for [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries. In 2012, through a blocktime agreement with PBC, MCGI's own radio station in [[Mega Manila]], UNTV Radio La Verdad 1350&amp;nbsp;kHz was launched.

===International broadcasts===
''Ang Dating Daan'' is being aired internationally, with programs usually lasting for an hour or two, through [[blocktime]] agreements with local television networks.

===UNTV Public Service channel (Philippines)===
In 2004, [[DWAO-TV|UNTV-37]] became the permanent home of MCGI when it acquired an exclusive [[blocktime]] agreement with UNTV's parent, the [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]].  In 2007, the station became a "Public Service Channel" when MCGI affiliate Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International, Inc. (BMPI), acquired the entire production and management operations of UNTV. The station operates 24/7 in [[Metro Manila]] and surrounding provinces with a power of 60 kilowatts, with several low-powered relay stations in the provinces. UNTV was aired nationwide via [[Mabuhay Satellite Corporation|Mabuhay]] [[ABS-3|Agila 2]]. In 2011, UNTV left Agila 2 and transferred its [[free-to-air]] broadcast feed to [[MEASAT-3a]] satellite which covers [[Asia]] and selected parts of [[Australia]], [[Middle East]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. UNTV is also being carried by [[Sky (cable company)|Sky Cable]] and more than 200 local [[cable television|cable operators]] and [[Cignal]], the largest direct-to-home satellite provider in the Philippines. In 2016, it was also included in the line-up of [[ABS-CBN]]'s newest DTH service, [[Sky Direct]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2279">'''Buddha's Dispensation''' (Buddha-sasana) is the time period which [[Dharma]] ([[Pali Canon]]) exist and follow. It is totally 5000 years after the Buddha's [[Parinirvana]] (pass away or "Skandha Parinirvana"). There are three types of Parinirvana. These are "Klesha Parinirwana", "Skandha Parinirvana" and "Dhatu Parinirvana".

Dhatu Parinirvana will occur the end of the Buddha's Dispensation (totally 5000 years after the Buddha's Skandha Parinirvana). It happens according to the Buddha's wish even though he doesn't exist. 
All Buddha's Relics in the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] (the place where a large amount of Buddha's Relics exist) in [[Sri Lanka]] will join together and make a picture of a Buddha in the sky above Ruwanwelisaya. Then those relics and all [[Relics associated with Buddha]] in the human, Naga, heaven and Brahma worlds will came to the sky above the [[Vajrasana, Bodh Gaya|Vajrasana]] (diamond throne) in '[[Bodh Gaya]]' of India and will make a complete picture of Buddha which will preach [[Dharma]] for the last time. This will not be a normal preaching like in the '[[Sutta Pitaka]]' in [[Pali Canon]]. It will be a '[[Samukkansika mode of preaching]]' extensively on 'Four Noble Truths' which preach with Buddha's super-normal abilities. This is a very long (containing many hundred thousand words) preaching, done in high speed but every one can understand each word clearly. With this preaching, many beings realize Nirvana. Then Vajrasana will come to the sky from the earth and all Buddha's Relics and Vajrasana will be completely burned out but without any ash.

After this 'Dhatu Parinirvana' and when the last [[Sotāpanna]] human passed away from the earth it is said to be the end of Buddha's Dispensation. Before the end of Buddha's dispensation any one who correctly follows Buddha's words is said to be able realize the Nirvana. But after the Buddha's Dispensation it seems it is impossible since no one has the energy to correctly follow Buddha's words. But if any great being correctly follows Buddha's words even after the Buddha's Dispensation it is said to be able to realize the reality (Nirvana).

'''Christian monasticism''' is the devotional practice of individuals who live ascetic and typically cloistered lives that are dedicated to Christian worship. It began to develop early in the history of the [[Christian Church]], modeled upon scriptural examples and ideals, including those in the [[Old Testament]], but not mandated as an institution in the scriptures. It has come to be regulated by religious rules (e.g. [[the Rule of Saint Augustine]], [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great|St Pachomius]], the [[Rule of St Basil]], the [[Rule of St Benedict]],) and, in modern times, the [[Canon law]] of the respective [[Christian denomination]]s that have forms of monastic living. Those living the monastic life are known by the generic terms [[monk]]s (men) and [[nuns]] (women). The word ''monk'' originated from the Greek ''monachos'' "monk", itself from ''monos'' meaning "alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|monk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corbishley, Mike.Monks lived a very strict and regulated life.Life in a monastery included prayer, manualwork, and this promoted the idea of the dignity and labour. Cultural Atlas for Young People The Middle Ages Revised Edition. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2004, page 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Monks did not live in monasteries at first, rather, they began by living alone, as the word ''monos'' might suggest. As more people took on the lives of monks, living alone in the wilderness, they started to come together and model themselves after the original monks nearby. Quickly, the monks formed communities to further their ability to observe an [[ascetic]] life.&lt;ref&gt;Rowling, Marjorie. Everyday Life in Medieval Times. London: Jarrold and Sons Ltd, 1968, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Christianity historian Robert Louis Wilken, "By creating an alternate social structure within the Church they laid the foundations for one of the most enduring Christian institutions . . ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilken|first1=Robert Louis|title=The First Thousand Years: A Global History of Christianity|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-11884-1|pages=100}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Monastics generally dwell in a [[monastery]], whether they live there in community ([[cenobite]]s), or in seclusion ([[recluse]]s).

The basic idea of monasticism in all its varieties is seclusion or withdrawal from the world or society. The object of this is to achieve a life whose ideal is different from and largely at variance with that pursued by the majority of humanity, and the method adopted, no matter what its precise details may be, is always self-abnegation or organized asceticism. Monastic life is distinct from the "religious orders" such as the [[friar]]s, [[canons regular]], [[clerks regular]], and the more recent [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]]s. The latter have essentially some special work or aim, such as preaching, teaching, liberating captives, etc., which occupies a large place in their activities. While monks have undertaken labours of the most varied character, in every case this work is extrinsic to the essence of the monastic state.&lt;ref name=huddleston&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10459a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. "Monasticism." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both ways of living out the Christian life are regulated by the respective church law of those Christian denominations that recognize it (e.g., the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Anglican Church]], or the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]]). Christian monastic life does not always involve communal living with like-minded Christians.  Christian monasticism has varied greatly in its external forms, but, broadly speaking, it has two main types (a) the [[eremitical]] or secluded, (b) the [[cenobitical]] or city life. [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony the Abbot]] may be called the founder of the first and [[St. Pachomius]] of the second.&lt;ref name=trappist&gt;[http://www.trappist.net/EarlyMonasticism "Early Monasticism", Monastery of the Holy Spirit]&lt;/ref&gt; The monastic life is based on [[Jesus]]'s amen to "be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48). This ideal, also called the [[state of perfection]], can be seen, for example, in the ''[[Philokalia]]'', a book of monastic writings. Their manner of self-renunciation has three elements corresponding to the three [[evangelical counsels]]: [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]].

Monks and friars are two distinct roles. In the thirteenth century "… new orders of friars were founded to teach the Christian faith," because monasteries had declined.&lt;ref name="Macdonald, Fiona 1995, page 37"&gt;Macdonald, Fiona. How would you survive in the Middle Ages?. New York: Franklin Watts, 1995, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Biblical precedent===
First Century groups such as the [[Essenes]] and the [[Therapeutae]] followed lifestyles that could be seen as precursors to Christian monasticism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', describes Philo's Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks. Professor Constantine Scouteris, [http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/patrology/scouteris_theraputae.htm Source]&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christian monasticism drew its inspiration from the examples of the Prophet [[Elijah]] and [[John the Baptist]], who both lived alone in the desert, and above all from the story of Jesus’ time in solitary struggle with Satan in the desert, before his public ministry.&lt;ref name=ocso&gt;[http://www.ocso.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=150&amp;Itemid=182&amp;lang=en "Early Christian Monasticism", Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carmelites]] find inspiration in the Old Testament prophet Elijah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocarm.org/en/content/ocarm/elijah-mary The Carmelites]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Christianity===
[[File:Saint Anthony The Great.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of [[Saint Anthony the Great]], the founder of Christian monasticism]]
{{Main|Christian monasticism before 451}}
From the earliest times within the [[Early Christianity|Christian Church]], there were probably individual hermits who lived a life in isolation in imitation of Jesus's 40 days in the desert. They have left no confirmed archaeological traces and only hints in the written record. Communities of virgins who had consecrated themselves to Christ are found at least as far back as the 2nd century. There were also individual ascetics, known as the "devout", who usually lived not in the deserts but on the edge of inhabited places, still remaining in the world but practicing asceticism and striving for union with God.

====Eremitic Monasticism====
Eremitic monasticism, or solitary monasticism, is characterized by a complete withdrawal from society. The word ‘eremitic’ comes from the Greek word eremos which means desert.&lt;ref name="Idiorrythmic Monasticism"&gt;{{cite web |title=Idiorrythmic Monasticism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281997/idiorrhythmic-monasticism|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This name was given because of St. Anthony of the Desert, or St. Anthony of Egypt, who left civilization behind to live on a solitary Egyptian mountain in the third century. Though he was probably not the first Christian hermit, he is recognized as such as he was the first known one.&lt;ref name="St. Anthony"&gt;{{cite web |last=Butler|first=Edward Cuthbert|title=St. Anthony|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01553d.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopaedia Vol. 1|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul the Hermit]] is the first Christian historically known to have been living as a monk. In the 3rd Century [[Anthony of Egypt]] (252-356) lived as a hermit in the desert and gradually gained followers who lived as hermits nearby but not in actual community with him. This type of monasticism is called '''eremitical''' or "hermit-like".

An early form of "proto-monasticism" appeared as well in the 3rd century among [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] through the "[[Sons of the covenant]]" movement. [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] looks to [[Basil the Great|Basil of Caesarea]] as a founding monastic legislator, as well to as the example of the [[Desert Fathers]].

Another option for becoming a solitary monastic was to become an anchoress. This began because there were women who wanted to live the solitary lifestyle but were not able to live alone in the wild. Thus they would go to the Bishop for permission who would then perform the rite of enclosure. After this was completed the anchoress would live alone in a room that typically had a window that opened into a church so they could receive communion and participate in church services. There were two other windows that allowed food to be passed in and people to come seek advice.&lt;ref name=Anchoress&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchoress|url=http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/anchoress.htm|work=The Middle Ages Website|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most well known anchoress was [[Julian of Norwich]] who was born in England in 1342.&lt;ref name="Juliana of Norwich"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gardner|first=Edmund|title=Juliana of Norwich|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08557a.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopaedia Vol. 8|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cenobitic Monasticism====
{{Main|Cenobitic monasticism}}
While the earliest Desert Fathers lived as hermits, they were rarely completely isolated, but often lived in proximity to one another, and soon loose-knit communities began to form in such places as the Desert of Nitria and the Desert of Skete.&lt;ref name=ocso/&gt; [[Macarius of Egypt|Saint Macarius]] established individual groups of cells such as those at [[Kellia]] (founded in 328.) These monks were anchorites, following the monastic ideal of St. Anthony. They lived by themselves, gathering together for common worship on Saturdays and Sundays only.&lt;ref name=greek&gt;[http://orthodoxbahamas.com/?page_id=986 "Monasticism", Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, Nassau, Bahamas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025155947/http://orthodoxbahamas.com/?page_id=986 |date=25 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 346 [[St Pachomius]] established in Egypt the first cenobitic Christian monastery.&lt;ref name=ocso/&gt; At [[Tabenna]] in Upper [[Egypt]], sometime around 323 AD, Pachomius decided to mold his disciples into a more organized community in which the monks lived in individual huts or rooms (''cellula'' in [[Latin]],) but worked, ate, and worshipped in shared space. The intention was to bring together individual ascetics who, although pious, did not, like Saint Anthony, have the physical ability or skills to live a solitary existence in the desert. This method of monastic organization is called '''cenobitic''' or "community-based". In Catholic theology, this community-based living is considered superior because of the obedience practiced and the accountability offered. The head of a monastery came to be known by the word for "Father;" - in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], ''Abba''; in English, "[[Abbot]]".

Guidelines for daily life were created, and separate monasteries were created for men and women. St Pachomius introduced a monastic Rule of cenobitic life, giving everyone the same food and attire. The monks of the monastery fulfilled the obediences assigned them for the common good of the monastery. Among the various obediences was copying books. St Pachomius considered that an obedience fulfilled with zeal was greater than fasting or prayer.&lt;ref name=oca&gt;[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/05/15/101384-venerable-pachomius-the-great-founder-of-coenobitic-monasticism "Venerable Pachomius the Great, Founder of Coenobitic Monasticism", Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pachomian monastery was a collection of buildings surrounded by a wall. The monks were distributed in houses, each house containing about forty monks. There would be thirty to forty houses in a monastery. There was an abbot over each monastery, and provosts with subordinate officials over each house. The monks were divided into houses according to the work they were employed in: thus there would be a house for carpenters, a house for agriculturists, and so forth. But other principles of division seem to have been employed, e.g., there was a house for the Greeks. On Saturdays and Sundays all the monks assembled in the church for Mass; on other days the Office and other spiritual exercises were celebrated in the houses.&lt;ref name=bacchus/&gt;

From a secular point of view, a monastery was an industrial community in which almost every kind of trade was practised. This, of course, involved much buying and selling, so the monks had ships of their own on the Nile, which conveyed their agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the market and brought back what the monasteries required. From the spiritual point of view, the Pachomian monk was a religious living under a rule.&lt;ref name=bacchus&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10464a.htm Bacchus, Francis Joseph. "Eastern Monasticism Before Chalcedon (A.D. 451)." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The community of Pachomius was so successful he was called upon to help organize others, and by one count by the time he died in 346 there were thought to be 3,000 such communities dotting Egypt, especially in the [[Thebaid]]. From there monasticism quickly spread out first to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Judean Desert]], [[Syria]], [[North Africa]] and eventually the rest of the [[Roman Empire]].

In 370 Basil the Great, monastic founder in Cappadocia, became bishop of Caesarea and wrote principles of ascetic life. Eastern monastic teachings were brought to the western church by Saint John Cassian (ca. 360 – ca. 435).  As a young adult, he and his friend Germanus entered a monastery in Palestine but then journeyed to Egypt to visit the eremitic groups in Nitria. Many years later, Cassian founded a monastery of monks and probably also one of nuns near Marseilles. He wrote two long works, the ''Institutes'' and ''Conferences''. In these books he not only transmitted his Egyptian experience but also gave Christian monasticism a profound evangelical and theological basis.&lt;ref name=ocso/&gt;

At the time of his conversion in Milan in the years 386-387, Augustine was aware of the life of Saint Anthony in the desert of Egypt. Upon his return to Africa as a Christian in the year 388, however, Augustine and a few Christian friends founded at Thagaste a lay community. They became cenobites in the countryside rather than in the desert.&lt;ref name=augnet&gt;[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1113&amp;iparentid=1112 "Monasticism", Augnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012002816/http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1113&amp;iparentid=1112 |date=12 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Benedict (c. 480 – 547 AD) lived for many years as a hermit in a cave near Subiaco, Italy. He was asked to be head over several monks who wished to change to the monastic style of Pachomius by living in community. Between the years 530 and 560, he wrote the Rule of Saint Benedict as a guideline for monks living in community.&lt;ref name=augnet/&gt;

Scholars such as [[Lester K. Little]] attribute the rise of monasticism at this time to the immense changes in the church brought about by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s legalization of Christianity. The subsequent transformation of Christianity into the main Roman religion ended the position of Christians as a minority sect. In response a new form of dedication was developed. The long-term "martyrdom" of the ascetic replaced the violent physical [[martyrdom]] of the [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions]].

==Eastern Orthodox tradition==
[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|200px|Right|''Analavos'' worn by Eastern Orthodox Schema-Monks.]]
{{See also|Monk#Eastern Christianity}} {{Main|Eastern Christian monasticism}}
Orthodox monasticism does not have religious orders as in the West,&lt;ref&gt;One may hear Orthodox monks referred to as "Basilian Monks", but this is really an inappropriate application of western categories to Orthodoxy.&lt;/ref&gt; so there are no formal Monastic Rules (''Regulae''); rather, each monk and [[Nun#Eastern Orthodox Christian|nun]] is encouraged to read all of the [[Saints|Holy Fathers]] and emulate their virtues. There is also no division between the "active" and "contemplative" life. [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] monastic life embraces both active and contemplative aspects.

Within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], there exist three types of monasticism: eremitic, cenobitic, and the [[skete]]. The skete is a very small community, often of two or three ({{bibleverse||Matthew|18:20}}), under the direction of an [[Starets|Elder]]. They pray privately for most of the week, then come together on Sundays and Feast Days for communal prayer, thus combining aspects of both eremitic and coenobitic monasticism.

===Historical development===
Even before Saint [[Anthony the Great]] (the "father of monasticism") went out into the desert, there were Christians who devoted their lives to ascetic discipline and striving to lead an evangelical life (i.e., in accordance with the teachings of the Gospel).
As monasticism spread in the East from the hermits living in the deserts of Egypt to Palestine, Syria, and on up into [[Asia Minor]] and beyond, the sayings (''apophthegmata'') and acts (''praxeis'') of the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] came to be recorded and circulated, first among their fellow monastics and then among the laity as well.

Among these earliest recorded accounts was the ''Paradise,'' by [[Palladius of Galatia]], [[Bishop of Helenopolis]] (also known as the ''[[Lausiac History]]'', after the [[prefect]] Lausus, to whom it was addressed). Saint [[Athanasius]] of Alexandria (whose ''Life of [[Saint Anthony the Great]]'' set the pattern for monastic [[hagiography]]), Saint [[Jerome]], and other anonymous compilers were also responsible for setting down very influential accounts. Also of great importance are the writings surrounding the communities founded by Saint Pachomius, the father of [[cenobite|cenobiticism]], and his disciple Saint Theodore, the founder of the skete form of monasticism.

Among the first to set forth precepts for the monastic life was Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], a man from a professional family who was educated in [[Caesarea]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Athens]]. Saint Basil visited colonies of hermits in Palestine and Egypt but was most strongly impressed by the organized communities developed under the guidance of Saint Pachomius. Saint Basil's ascetical writings set forth standards for well-disciplined community life and offered lessons in what became the ideal monastic virtue: humility.

Saint Basil wrote a series of guides for monastic life (the ''Lesser Asketikon'' the ''Greater Asketikon'' the ''Morals'', etc.) which, while not "Rules" in the legalistic sense of later Western rules, provided firm indications of the importance of a single community of monks, living under the same roof, and under the guidance—and even discipline—of a strong abbot. His teachings set the model for Greek and Russian monasticism but had less influence in the Latin West.

Of great importance to the development of monasticism is the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Here the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] was written by Saint [[John Climacus]] (c.600), a work of such importance that many Orthodox monasteries to this day read it publicly either during the [[Canonical Hours|Divine Services]] or in [[Refectory|Trapeza]] during [[Great Lent]].

At the height of the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] Empire, numerous great monasteries were established by the emperors, including the twenty "sovereign monasteries" on the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]],&lt;ref&gt;Both Mount Sinai and Mount Athos are referred to as "the Holy Mountain" in Orthodox literature,&lt;/ref&gt; an actual "monastic republic" wherein the entire country is devoted to bringing souls closer to God. In this milieu, the [[Philokalia]] was compiled.

As the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] between East and West grew, conflict arose over misunderstandings about [[Hesychasm]]. Saint [[Gregory Palamas]], bishop of [[Thessalonica]], an experienced Athonite monk, defended Orthodox spirituality against the attacks of [[Barlaam of Calabria]], and left numerous important works on the spiritual life.

===Present===
Christian monasticism was and continued to be a lay condition—monks depended on a local parish church for the [[sacraments]]. However, if the monastery was isolated in the desert, as were many of the Egyptian examples, that inconvenience compelled monasteries either to take in priest members, to have their abbot or other members ordained. A priest-monk is sometimes called a [[hieromonk]]. In many cases in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], when a [[Diocese|bishopric]] needed to be filled, they would look to nearby monasteries to find suitable candidates, being good sources of men who were spiritually mature and generally possessing the other qualities desired in a bishop. Eventually, among the Orthodox Churches it became established by [[canon law]] that all bishops must be monks.

Monastic centers thrive to this day in [[Bulgaria]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], the [[Holy Land]], and elsewhere in the Orthodox world, the [[Mount Athos|Autonomous Monastic State of Mount Athos]] remaining the spiritual center of monasticism for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], a great renaissance of monasticism has occurred, and many previously empty or destroyed monastic communities have been reopened.

Monasticism continues to be very influential in the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the [[Canon Law#Orthodox Churches|Sacred Canons]], all Bishops must be monks (not merely celibate), and feast days to [[Canonization|Glorified]] monastic saints are an important part of the liturgical tradition of the church. [[Fasting]], Hesychasm, and the pursuit of the spiritual life are strongly encouraged not only among monastics but also among the laity.

===Types of monks===
[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-39.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orthodox monks farming potatoes in [[Russia]], ca. 1910]]
{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}
There are also three levels of monks: The Rassophore, the Stavrophore, and the Schema-Monk (or Schema-Nun). Each of the three degrees represents an increased level of asceticism. In the early days of monasticism, there was only one level—the Great Schema—and even Saint [[Theodore the Studite]] argued against the establishment of intermediate grades, but nonetheless the consensus of the church has favored the development of three distinct levels.

When a candidate wishes to embrace the monastic life, he will enter the monastery of his choice as a guest and ask to be received by the [[Hegumen]] (Abbot). After a period of at least three days the Hegumen may at his discretion clothe the candidate as a [[novice]]. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) would simply be given the [[cassock#Eastern practice .28Orthodox and Eastern Catholic.29|''Podraznik'']], belt and ''[[skoufos]]''.

After a period of about three years, the Hegumen may at his discretion [[tonsure]] the novice as a ''Rassophore'' monk, giving him the outer garment called the Rassa (Greek: ''Rason''). A monk (or nun) may remain in this grade all the rest of his life, if he so chooses. But the Rite of Tonsure for the Rassophore refers to the grade as that of the "Beginner", so it is intended that the monk will advance on to the next level. The Rassophore is also given a [[klobuk]] which he wears in church and on formal occasions. In addition, Rassophores will be given a [[prayer rope]] at their tonsure.

The next rank, ''Stavrophore'', is the grade that most Russian monks remain all their lives. The title Stavrophore means "cross-bearer", because when Tonsured into this grade the monastic is given a cross to wear at all times. This cross is called a Paramand—a wooden cross attached by ribbons to a square cloth embroidered with the [[Passion (Christianity)#Instruments of the Passion|Instruments of the Passion]] and the words, "I bear upon my body the marks of the Lord Jesus" ({{bibleverse||Galatians|6:17}}). The Paramand is so called because it is worn under the [[Mantle (vesture)|Mantle]] (Greek: ''Mandyas''; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Mantya''), which is a long cape which completely covers the monk from neck to foot. Among the Russians, Stavrophores are also informally referred to as "mantle monks". At his Tonsure, a Stavrophore is given a wooden hand cross and a lit candle, as well as a prayer rope.

[[File:St Anthony of Kiev.jpg|thumb|300px|left|St. [[Anthony of Kiev]] wearing the Great Schema.]]
The highest rank of monasticism is the ''Great Schema'' (Greek: ''Megaloschemos''; Church Slavonic: ''Schimnik''). Attaining the level of ''Schema monk'' is much more common among the Greeks than it is among the Russians, for whom it is normally reserved to hermits, or to very advanced monastics. The ''Schema monk'' or ''Schema nun'' wears the same habit as the Rassophore, but to it is added the ''Analavos'' (Church Slavonic: ''Analav''), a garment shaped like a cross, covering the shoulders and coming down to the knees (or lower) in front and in back. This garment is roughly reminiscent of the [[scapular]] worn by some Roman Catholic orders, but it is finely embroidered with the Cross and instruments of the Passion (see illustration, above). The Klobuk worn by a Schema monk is also embroidered with a red cross and other symbols. the Klobuk may be shaped differently, more rounded at the top, in which case it is referred to as a ''koukoulion''. The skufia worn by a Schema monk is also more intricately embroidered.

The [[religious habit]] worn by Orthodox monastics is the same for both monks and nuns, except that the nuns wear an additional veil, called an ''[[apostolnik]]''.

The central and unifying feature of Orthodox monasticism is [[Hesychasm]], the practice of silence, and the concentrated saying of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. All ascetic practices and monastic humility is guided towards preparing the heart for [[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Church|''theoria'']] or the "divine vision" that comes from the union of the soul with God. It should be noted, however, that such union is not accomplished by any human activity. All an ascetic can do is prepare the ground; it is for God to cause the seed to grow and bear fruit.

==Western Christian monasticism==
===History===
The introduction of monasticism into the West may be dated from about A.D. 340 when St. Athanasius visited Rome accompanied by the two Egyptian monks Ammon and Isidore, disciples of St. Anthony. The publication of the "Vita Antonii" some years later and its translation into Latin spread the knowledge of Egyptian monachism widely and many were found in Italy to imitate the example thus set forth. The first Italian monks aimed at reproducing exactly what was done in Egypt and not a few — such as St. Jerome, Rufinus, Paula, Eustochium and the two Melanias — actually went to live in Egypt or Palestine as being better suited to monastic life than Italy.&lt;ref name=huddleston/&gt;

The earliest phases of monasticism in Western Europe involved figures like [[Martin of Tours]], who after serving in the Roman legions converted to Christianity and established a hermitage near [[Milan]], then moved on to [[Poitiers]] where a community gathered around his hermitage. He was called to become [[Bishop of Tours]] in 372, where he established a monastery at [[Marmoutiers]] on the opposite bank of the [[Loire River]], a few miles upstream from the city. His cell was a hut of wood, and round it his disciples, who soon numbered eighty, dwelt in caves and huts. His monastery was laid out as a colony of hermits rather than as a single integrated community. The type of life was simply the Antonian monachism of Egypt.&lt;ref name=huddleston/&gt;

[[Honoratus of Marseilles]] was a wealthy [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, who after a pilgrimage to Egypt, founded the [[Lérins Abbey|Monastery of Lérins]] in 410, on an island lying off the modern city of [[Cannes]]. The monastery combined a community with isolated hermitages where older, spiritually-proven monks could live in isolation. Lérins became, in time, a center of monastic culture and learning, and many later monks and bishops would pass through Lérins in the early stages of their career.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10472a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. "Western Monasticism." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 18 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Honoratus was called to be [[Bishop of Arles]].

[[John Cassian]] began his monastic career at a monastery in Palestine and Egypt around 385 to study monastic practice there. In Egypt he had been attracted to the isolated life of hermits, which he considered the highest form of monasticism, yet the monasteries he founded were all organized monastic communities. About 415 he established two monasteries near [[Marseilles]],&lt;ref name=Gilbert/&gt; one for men, one for women. In time these attracted a total of 5,000 monks and nuns. Most significant for the future development of monasticism were Cassian's ''Institutes'', which provided a guide for monastic life and his ''Conferences'', a collection of spiritual reflections.

====Celtic monasticism====
It seems that the first Celtic monasteries were merely settlements where the Christians lived together — priests and laity, men, women, and children alike — as a kind of religious clan.&lt;ref name=Gilbert/&gt; According to James F. Kenney, every important church was a monastic establishment, with a small walled village of monks and nuns living under ecclesiastical discipline, and ministering to the people of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, J.F., ''The Sources for the Early History of Ireland'', New York, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Monastic spirituality came to Britain and then Ireland from Gaul, by way of Lérins, Tours, and Auxerre. Its spirituality was heavily influenced by the Desert Fathers, with a monastic enclosure surrounding a collection of individual monastic cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxchurch.co.uk/Celtic_Monasteries.html "Celtic Monasteries", Orthodox Christian Contact Wales]&lt;/ref&gt; The British church employed an episcopal structure corresponding closely to the model used elsewhere in the Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Corning, Caitlin. ''The Celtic and Roman Traditions: Conflict and Consensus in the Early Medieval Church''. Macmillan. (2006) {{ISBN|1-4039-7299-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illtud]], [[Saint David|David]], Gildas, and [[Deiniol]] were leading figures in 6th-century Britain.

According to [[Thomas O'Loughlin]], "Each monastery should be seen, as with most monasteries of the period, as an individual response to the monastic impulse by someone who had experienced monasticism and then went off to establish either a hermitage to which others later came or a cenobitic community."&lt;ref name=oloughlin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iepJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT300&amp;lpg=PT300&amp;dq=celtic+monasticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cu0OGN1jSl&amp;sig=1yEImKgaGRdV-HaogMQTdNLvpbk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ7M2eyubJAhXBVh4KHbf2DSA4FBDoAQhIMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=celtic%20monasticism&amp;f=false "Celtic Monasticism", ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism'', (William M. Johnston, ed.), Routledge, 2013] {{ISBN|9781136787164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monasteries were organized on a family basis. Next in importance to the abbot was the scribe, in charge of the scriptorium, the teaching function of the monastery, and the keeping of the annals. The role of scribe was often a path to the position of abbot.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Kathleen. "The Distribution of Irish Scriptoria and Centres of Learning from 730 to 1111", ''Studies in the Early British Church'', (N. Chdwick et sl, eds.), Cambridge, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; Hereditary right and relationship to the abbot were factors influencing appointment to monastic offices.

Buildings would generally have been of wood, wattle and thatch. Monasteries tended to be cenobitical in that monks lived in separate cells but came together for common prayer, meals, and other functions. Celtic monasticism was characterized by an rigorous asceticism and a love for learning.&lt;ref name=mcgonigle&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h2pUXP-Ps2QC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=celtic+monasticism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yCQiMIpdPU&amp;sig=eBLd5q43GF-k9_7UXXC483xvdI4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1ofPRmOfJAhUFLyYKHSn-BRY4MhDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=celtic%20monasticism&amp;f=false McGonigle, Thomas C., McGonigle, Thomas D., and Quigley, James F., "A History of the Christian Tradition", Paulist Press, 1988] {{ISBN|9780809129645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Hermits=====
Some more austere ascetics became hermits living in remote locations in what came to be called the "green martyrdom".

=====Pilgrimage=====
=====Women's communities=====

Women's communities were normally much smaller and poorer. The nuns had to do everything themselves, unless they had a couple of tenant-farmers to supply food, or pious who made donations. They spun and wove, kept their huts clean, milked their cows, and made their own meals, which could be meager.

=====Scotland=====
Around 397, [[Ninian]], a Briton probably from the area south of the Firth of Clyde, dedicated his church at [[Whithorn]] to St. Martin of Tours. According to [[Bede]], Ninian evangelized the southern Picts.&lt;ref name=Addleshaw&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rqh4ZnOXHQkC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=celtic+monasticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDje2UnefJAhUBzCYKHco0A4w4ChDoAQgqMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=celtic%20monasticism&amp;f=false Addleshaw, George William Outram.

[[Saint Mungo|Kentigern]] was an apostle of the British Kingdom of Strathclyde in the late 6th century, and the founder and patron saint of the city of Glasgow. Due to anti-Christian sentiment he re-located for a time to Wales, where he established a monastery at [[St Asaphs|St. Asaph's]]. Here he divided the monks into three groups. The unlettered were assigned to the duty of agriculture, the care of cattle, and the other necessary duties outside the monastery. He assigned 300 to duties within the cloister of the monastery, such as doing the ordinary work, and preparing food, and building workshops. The remaining monks, who were lettered, he appointed to the celebration of Divine service in church by day and by night.

=====Wales=====
[[Cadoc]] founded [[Llancarfan]] in the latter part of the fifth century. He received the religious habit from an Irish monk, St. Tathai, superior of a small community near Chepstow, in Monmouthshire. Returning to his native county, Cadoc built a church, and monastery, which was called Llancarfan, or the "Church of the Stags". There he also established a college and a hospital.&lt;ref name=Chandlery&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15585a.htm Chandlery, Peter. "Welsh Monastic Foundations." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 18 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; His legend recounts that he daily fed a hundred clergy and a hundred soldiers, a hundred workmen, a hundred poor men, and the same number of widows. When thousands left the world and became monks, they very often did so as clansmen, dutifully following the example of their chief. Bishoprics, canonries, and parochial benefices passed from one to another member of the same family, and frequently from father to son. Their tribal character is a feature which Irish and Welsh monasteries had in common.&lt;ref name=newell&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historywelsh00neweuoft/historywelsh00neweuoft_djvu.txt Newell, E.J., ''A History of the Welsh Church to the Dissolution of the Monasteries'', Chapter III, Elliot Stock, London, 1895]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illtyd]] spent the first part of his religious life as a disciple of Cadoc at Llancarfan. He founded the monastery at [[Llanilltyd Fawr]]. One of his students was [[Paul Aurelian]], a key figure in Cornish monasticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15582b.htm Thurston, Herbert. "Welsh Church." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 19 Nov. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gildas]] the Wise was also a student at Llanilltyd Fawr,&lt;ref name=Chandlery/&gt; as was [[Samson of Dol]]. Samson founded a monastery in an abandoned Roman fort near the river Severn and lived for a time the life of a hermit in a nearby cave before going to [[Seven founder saints of Brittany#Religion|Brittany]].

St David established [[St David's Cathedral|his monastery]] on a promontory on the western sea, well placed to be a centre of Insular Christianity. His establishment became known for its austerity and holiness, more than as a centre of learning,&lt;ref name=woods&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMbqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT312&amp;dq=celtic+monasticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie3ImIt-nJAhVEuhoKHREvDY04HhDoAQgzMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=celtic%20monasticism&amp;f=false Woods, Richard J., ''Christian Spirituality'', Orbis Books, 2015] {{ISBN|9781608334261}}&lt;/ref&gt; although when [[King Alfred]] sought a scholar for his court, he summoned [[Asser]] of St David's. Contemporary with David were [[Teilo]], [[Cadoc]], [[Padarn]], [[Beuno]] and [[Tysilio]] among them.

=====Cornwall=====
Many early medieval settlements in the region were occupied by hermitage chapels which are often dedicated to St Michael as the conventional slayer of pagan demons, as at [[St Michael's Mount]].

=====Ireland=====
[[File:Clonmacnois Round Tower 2003 09 02.jpg|thumb|Clonmacnois Round Tower]]
The earliest monastic settlements in Ireland emerged at the end of the fifth century. It was from Illtud and his colleagues that the Irish sought guidance on matters of ritual and discipline. [[Enda of Aran]] is called the "patriarch of Irish monasticism".&lt;ref name=woods/&gt; A warrior prince of Oriel, upon the death of his betrothed he decided to study for the priesthood. He first joined [[Ailbe of Emly|St Ailbe]] at Emly, before travelling to Ninian’s [[Candida Casa]] in Scotland, where he was ordained. About 484 he established the first Irish monastery at Killeaney on Aran Mor. [[Finnian of Clonard]] is said to have studied under Cadoc at [[Llancarfan]] in [[Glamorganshire]].&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.earlychristianireland.org/Specials/Irish%20Monasticism/ |title="Irish Monasticism", Early Christian Sites in Ireland |access-date=5 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313065058/http://www.earlychristianireland.org/Specials/Irish%20Monasticism/ |archive-date=13 March 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finnian of Moville]] studied under [[Colman of Dromore]] and Mochae of Noendrum, before he too went to Candida Casa.&lt;ref name=grattan&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06077a.htm Grattan-Flood, William.

Ireland was a rural society of chieftains living in the countryside. As in Wales, if a clan chieftain accepted Christianity so did those he ruled.&lt;ref name=Duckett&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-SYpFbidiAC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=celtic+monasticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHzdXKzunJAhUFWhoKHQnhDWQ4KBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=celtic%20monasticism&amp;f=false Duckett, Eleanor Shipley. ''The Gateway to the Middle Ages: Monasticism'', University of Michigan Press, 1988] {{ISBN|9780472060511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly Irish monasteries were established by grants of land to an abbot or abbess who came from a local noble family. The monastery became the spiritual focus of the tribe or kin group. Successive abbots and abbesses were members of the founder’s family, a policy which kept the monastic lands under the jurisdiction of the family (and corresponded to Irish legal tradition, which only allowed the transfer of land within a family).
In Ireland, the abbot was often called "coarb", a term designating the heir of successor of the founder.&lt;ref name=Addleshaw/&gt;

The abbots of the principal monasteries— such as Clonard, Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Swords, etc.—were of the highest rank and held in the greatest esteem. They wielded great power and had vast influence. The abbot usually was only a presbyter, but in the large monasteries there were one or more resident bishops who conferred orders and discharged the other functions of a bishop. The abbot was superior of the house, and all were subject to him.&lt;ref name=ohalloran/&gt;

The Irish rule was rigorous. It was more or less a copy of the French rule, as the French was a copy of the Thebaid. The daily routine of monastic life was prayer, study, and manual labor. With regard to food the rule was very strict. Only one meal a day, at 3 o'clock p.m., was allowed, except on Sundays and Feast days. Wednesdays and Fridays were fast days, except the interval between Easter and Whit Sunday. The food allowed was barley bread, milk, fish, and eggs. Flesh meat was not allowed except on great feasts.&lt;ref name=ohalloran&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/WestCorkHistory/Monasteries.php O'Halloran, W., ''Early Irish History and Antiquities and the History of West Cork'', Chapter XI, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland a distinctive form of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|penance]] developed, where confession was made privately to a priest, under the seal of secrecy, and where penance was given privately and ordinarily performed privately as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Handbooks of Penance'', eds. John T. McNeil and Helena M. Gamer (New York, Columba University Press, 1938), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Penance was considered therapeutic rather than punitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cY1SymrAGeEC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=celtic+monasticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHzdXKzunJAhUFWhoKHQnhDWQ4KBDoAQhCMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=celtic%20monasticism&amp;f=false Hinson, E. Glenn. ''The Church Triumphant: A History of Christianity Up to 1300'', Mercer University Press, 1995] {{ISBN|9780865544369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain handbooks were made, called "[[penitential]]s", designed as a guide for confessors and as a means of regularising the penance given for each particular sin. According to Thomas Pollock Oakley, the penitential guides first developed in Wales, probably at St. David's, and spread by missions to Ireland.&lt;ref name=Oakley&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W802krXYf3oC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=penitentials&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E61-VIz8EMaqgwSn3oDgBA&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=penitentials&amp;f=false Oakley, Thomas Pollock.

Irish monasticism maintained the model of a monastic community while, like John Cassian, marking the contemplative life of the hermit as the highest form of monasticism. Saints' lives frequently tell of monks (and abbots) departing some distance from the monastery to live in isolation from the community. Irish monastic rules specify a stern life of prayer and discipline in which prayer, poverty, and obedience are the central themes.

Irish monks needed to learn Latin, the language of the Church. Thus they read Latin texts, both spiritual and secular, with an enthusiasm that their contemporaries on the continent lacked. Subjects taught included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, arithmetic, chronology, the Holy Places, hymns, sermons, natural science, history and especially the interpretation of Sacred Scripture.&lt;ref name=ohalloran/&gt; In 544 [[Ciarán of Clonmacnoise|St Ciarán]] founded a monastery at [[Clonmacnoise]], which became one of the most important centres of learning and religious life in Ireland.  Contrary to common practice, the title of abbot {{ndash}} which included the title "[[Comarba]] of Saint Ciarán" {{ndash}} at the community was not hereditary, which reflected the humble origins of its founder. In 557 [[Brendan|St Brendan]] founded a monastery at Clonfert.

By the end of the seventh century, Irish [[monastic school]]s were attracting students from England and from Europe.

The achievements of [[insular art]], in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], [[high cross]]es, and metalwork like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and in the case of manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art. The manuscripts were produced by and for monasteries, and evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Work of Angels', Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork", (Susan Youngs, ed.)

=====Hiberno-Scottish mission=====
Irish monasticism spread widely, first to [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]], then to Gaul and Italy. [[Columba]] and his followers established monasteries at [[Bangor Abbey|Bangor]], on the northeastern coast of Ireland, at [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], an island north-west of Scotland, and at [[Lindisfarne]], which was founded by Aidan, an Irish monk from Iona, at the request of King [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. Abbots of Iona were normally appointed from the founders kin, with an abbot often naming hhis successor.&lt;ref name=Addleshaw/&gt;

[[Columbanus]], an abbot from a Leinster noble family, traveled to Gaul in the late 6th century with twelve companions. Columbanus and his followers spread the Irish model of monastic institutions to the continent. A whole series of new monastic foundations under Irish influence sprang up, starting with Columbanus's foundations of [[Luxeuil]] and [[Fontaine-lès-Luxeuil]] and, sponsored by the Frankish King [[Childebert II]]. After Childebert's death Columbanus traveled east to Metz, where Theudebert II allowed him to establish a new monastery among the semi-pagan [[Alemanni]] in what is now [[Switzerland]]. One of Columbanus's followers founded the monastery of St. Gall on the shores of Lake Constance, while Columbanus continued onward across the [[Alps]] to the kingdom of the [[Lombards]] in Italy. There King [[Agilulf]] and his wife [[Theodolinda]] granted Columbanus land in the mountains between [[Genoa]] and Milan, where he established the monastery of [[Bobbio]]. From about 698 until the reign of Charlemagne in the 770s, the Hiberno-Scottish efforts in the Frankish Empire were continued by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]. The rule of St. Columbanus, which was originally followed in most of these monasteries, was eventually superseded by that of St. Benedict.

====Benedictine monasticism====
[[File:Heiligenkreuz.St. Benedict.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Saint Benedict]] by Herman Nieg, Heiligenkreuz Abbey, Austria]]

[[Benedict of Nursia]] is the most influential of Western monks and is called "the father of western monasticism". He was educated in Rome but soon sought the life of a hermit in a cave at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], outside the city. He then attracted followers with whom he founded the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] around 520, between Rome and [[Naples]]. He established the [[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]], adapting in part the earlier anonymous [[Rule of the Master]] (''Regula magistri''), which was written somewhere south of Rome around 500, and defined the activities of the monastery, its officers, and their responsibilities. By the ninth century, largely under the inspiration of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]], Benedict's Rule became the basic guide for Western monasticism.

While the Celtic monasteries had a stronger connection to the semi-eremitical tradition of Egypt via Lérins and Tours, Benedict and his followers were more influenced by the cenobitism of St [[Pachomius]] and [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]]. Early Benedictine monasteries were relatively small and consisted of an oratory, refectory, dormitory, scriptorium, guest accommodation and out-buildings, a group of often quite separate rooms more reminiscent of a decent sized Roman villa than a large medieval abbey. A monastery of about a dozen monks would have been normal during this period.

Medieval monastic life consisted of prayer, reading, and manual labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/medieval-monastery.htm Middle-ages.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer was a monk’s first priority. Apart from prayer, monks performed a variety of tasks, such as preparing medicine, lettering, reading, and others. Also, these monks would work in the gardens and on the land. They might also spend time in the Cloister, a covered colonnade around a courtyard, where they would pray or read.  Some monasteries held a scriptorium where monks would write or copy books. When the monks wrote, they used very neat handwriting and would draw illustrations in the books. As a part of their unique writing style, they decorated the first letter of each paragraph.

The efficiency of Benedict's cenobitic Rule in addition to the stability of the monasteries made them very productive. The monasteries were the central storehouses and producers of knowledge.Vikings started attacking Irish monasteries famous for learning in 793. One monk wrote about how he did not mind the bad weather one evening because it kept the Vikings from coming: "Bitter is the wind tonight, it tosses the ocean’s white hair, I need not fear—as on a night of calm sea—the fierce raiders from Lochlann."&lt;ref&gt;Rowling, Marjorie. Everyday Life in Medieval Times. London: Jarrold and Sons Ltd., 1968, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the growing pressure of monarchies and the nation states undermined the wealth and power of the orders. Monasticism continued to play a role in Catholicism, but after the [[Protestant reformation]] many monasteries in Northern Europe [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|were shut down]] and their assets seized.
===Military orders===
In the twelfth century, traditional monastic orders in [[Outremer]] evolved into military orders, initially for the purpose of defending pilgrims, although they later became larger military forced that played a key role in combating Muslim efforts at reconquest and propping up continued Christian rule in the region. These orders included the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Hospitallers]]. In large part, the notion of military monasticism became so popular because of the advocacy of [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]], who believed that existing Christian methods of serving the Church's ends in war were inadequate, and that a group of dedicated warrior monks, who achieved spiritual merit and served God through waging war, was necessary. In his view, advancing the cause of Christendom was an end that justified means that might fall outside the bounds of [[just war]]. &lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These orders largely declined with the loss of Outremer in the 1200s - except for the [[Teutonic Order]], which transferred itself to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] where it took up a major role in the [[Baltic Crusades]]. In the Baltic, warrior monks used massacre and forced conversion to compel the submission of local pagan tribes, which disliked the Order's rule and rebelled repeatedly. They also enslaved members of defeated tribes, sometimes refusing to permit them to be baptized in order to keep them in a state of enslavement (which was theologically justifiable only against non-Christians). &lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Christian orders in the Modern Era===
Many distinct monastic orders developed within [[Roman Catholic religious order|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Monastic communities in the West, broadly speaking, are organized into orders and congregations guided by a particular religious rule, such as the [[Rule of St Augustine]] or especially [[Rule of St Benedict]]. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have a system of orders per se, though some of the Eastern Catholic Churches do.

====Roman Catholicism====

====Lutheran Church====
[[File:Kloster Loccum.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Loccum Abbey]] continued as a Lutheran monastery since the 16th century A.D.]]
After the foundation of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] near [[Negenborn]] and [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Rehburg-Loccum]]) and convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197. It belongs to the group of so-called Lüneklöstern (monasteries of Lüne), which became Lutheran convents following the Protestant Reformation. […] It is currently one of several Lutheran convents maintained by the Monastic Chamber of Hanover (Klosterkammer Hannover), an institution of the former Kingdom of Hanover founded by its Prince-Regent, later King George IV of the United Kingdom, in 1818, in order to manage and preserve the estates of Lutheran convents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loccum Abbey]] and [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries.
Since the 19th century there have been a renewal in the monastic life among Protestants. There are many present-day Lutherans who practice the monastic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1947 Mother [[Basilea Schlink]] and Mother Martyria founded the [[Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary]], in [[Darmstadt, Germany]]. This movement is largely considered [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] in its roots.

In 1948 [[Bavaria]]n Lutheran pastor Walter Hümmer and his wife Hanna founded the [[Communität Christusbruderschaft Selbitz]].

In other Lutheran traditions "The Congregation of the Servants of Christ" was established at [[St. Augustine's House]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staugustineshouse.org Saint Augustine's House]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Oxford, Michigan]], in 1958 when some other men joined Father [[Arthur Kreinheder]] in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur. During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there are 2 permanent professed members and 2 long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden ([[Östanbäck monastery]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/klostren/OSTANENG.htm Östanbäck monastery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813114047/http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/klostren/OSTANENG.htm |date=13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Germany the ([[Priory of St. Wigbert]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wigberti.de Priorat St. Wigberti: Unser Kloster]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, [[Communität Casteller Ring]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwanberg.de/index.php/communitaet-casteller-ring-ev.html Communität Casteller Ring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911174924/http://www.schwanberg.de/index.php/communitaet-casteller-ring-ev.html |date=11 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Lutheran Benedictine community for women.  In 2011, an Augustinian religious order, the Priestly Society of St. Augustine (Societas Sacerdotalis Sancti Augustini) was established by the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]].  It follows the [[Rule of St. Augustine]], its headquarters is at Christ Lutheran Church ALCC. Kent Island, Maryland, and Fr. Jens Bargmann, Ph.D., is the Grand Prior.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161219073059/http://www.sssa-us.org/Home_Page.html Priestly Society of St. Augustine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lutheran [[Sweden]], religious life for women had been established already in 1954, when Sister Marianne Nordström made her profession through contacts with The [[Order of the Holy Paraclete]] and Mother Margaret Cope (1886–1961) at St Hilda’s Priory, [[Whitby]], Yorkshire.

====Anglican Communion====
{{Main|Anglican religious order}}
In England, [[John Wycliffe]], organized the [[Lollard]] Preacher Order (the "Poor Priests") to promote his views, many of which resounded with those held by the later Protestant Reformers.

Monastic life in England came to an abrupt end with [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. The property and lands of the [[monastery|monasteries]] were confiscated and either retained by the king or sold to catholic landowners or given to loyal [[protestant]] [[nobility]]. [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were pensioned off and retired or some were forced to either flee for the continent or to abandon their vocations. For around 300 years, there were no monastic communities within any of the [[Anglican]] churches.

Shortly after the [[Oxford Movement]] began to advocate restoring [[catholic]] faith and practice to the [[Church of England]] (see [[Anglo-Catholicism]]), there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. Anglican [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] [[John Henry Newman]] established a community of men at [[Littlemore]] near [[Oxford]] in the 1840s while he was vicar of [[Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore]]. From then forward, there have been many communities of [[monk]]s, [[friar]]s, sisters, and [[nun]]s established within the [[Anglican Communion]]. In 1848, Mother [[Priscilla Lydia Sellon]] founded the Anglican Sisters of Charity and became the first woman to take religious vows within the [[Anglican Communion]] since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. In October 1850 the first building specifically built for the purpose of housing an [[Sisterhoods (Modern Anglican)|Anglican Sisterhood]] was consecrated at Abbeymere in [[Plymouth]]. It housed several schools for the destitute, a laundry, printing press and soup kitchen. From the 1840s and throughout the following one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated in the UK and the United States, as well as in various countries of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Canada]], India and the [[Pacific]].

Some Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called "mixed life", a combination of a life of contemplative prayer with active service. Anglican religious life closely mirrors that of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Like Roman Catholic religious, Anglican religious also take the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Religious communities live together under a common rule, reciting the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] and celebrating the [[Eucharist]] daily.

In the early 20th century when the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic movement]] was at its height, the [[Anglican Communion]] had hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of religious. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion, most notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in religious communities around the world. While vocations remain few in some areas, Anglican religious communities are experiencing exponential growth in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Oceania]].

Around 1964, Reuben Archer Torrey III, an Episcopal missionary, grandson of [[Reuben Archer Torrey|R. A. Torrey]], founded Jesus Abbey as a missionary community in [[Korea]]. It has some links with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and holds an [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical doctrine]].

====Methodist Churches====
In February 2001, the [[United Methodist Church]] organized the [[Saint Brigid of Kildare Monastery]]. It is a Methodist-Benedictine residential [[double monastery]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]]. Besides monastic orders, the [[Order of Saint Luke]] is a dispersed religious order within Methodism.

====Presbyterian Churches====
The Community of the Sisterhood Emmanuel was founded in 1973 in Makak - in the Centre Province by Mother Marie, one of the first female Pastors of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon. In 1975 she moved the community to the present site- at Agyati in Bafut.  It has 10 finally consecrated Sisters, four in simple vows and a handful of others in formation.  The Sisters are trained in strong collaboration with the sister Institutes of the Catholic Church. They say that one of their charisms is ecumenism. The Sisterhood Emmanuel is the only Presbyterian Monastery in Cameroon.

====Anabaptism====
[[Anabaptist]] Christians "retained many elements of the monastic understanding of a 'holy life' that followed true faith".&lt;ref name="RedekopKrahn1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redekop|first1=Calvin Wall|last2=Krahn|first2=Victor A.|last3=Steiner|first3=Samuel J.|title=Anabaptist/Mennonite Faith and Economics|year=1994|publisher=University Press of America|language=English|isbn=9780819193506|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hutterites]] and [[Bruderhof]], for example, live in intentional communities with their big houses having "ground floors for common work, meals and worship, the two-storey attics with small rooms, like monastic cells, for married couples".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quakerism and Shakerism====
The [[Shakers]], who are also known as the "Shaking Quakers", have been characterized as a "Protestant monastic order providing refuge and otherworldly compensation".&lt;ref name="Hammond1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Phillip E.|title=The Sacred in a Secular Age: Toward Revision in the Scientific Study of Religion|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|language=English |isbn=9780520053434|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle, [[pacifism]], and their model of [[equality of the sexes]], which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s. They are also known for their simple living, architecture, and furniture. Sincere newcomers are invited to become Shakers:&lt;ref name="Williams2015"/&gt;
{{quotation|If someone wants to become a Shaker, and the Shakers assent, the would-be member can move into the dwelling house. If the novices, as they are called, stay a week, they sign an articles of agreement, which protects the colony from being sued for lost wages. After a year, the Shakers will take a vote whether to allow the novice in, but it takes another four years to be granted full Shaker status in sharing in the colony’s finances and administrative and worship decisions.&lt;ref name="Williams2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/5/3/last-shakers-hope-novice-can-revive-communal-society.html|title=A few good Shakers wanted|last=Williams|first=Kevin|date=3 May 2015|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|language=English|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Currently, there are two remaining Shakers, Brother Arnold Hadd and Sister June Carpenter, though they hope that others will join them at the only remaining Shaker community, the [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/shakers-left-live-maine-community-article-1.2934694|title=The only two Shakers left live in Maine community|last=Gibbs|first=Constance|date=4 January 2017|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|language=English|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecumenical expressions==
Christian monasticism is experiencing renewal in the form of several new foundations with an 'inter-Christian' vision for their respective communities.

In 1944 [[Frère Roger|Roger Schütz]], a pastor of the [[Swiss Reformed Church]],  founded a small religious brotherhood in France which became known as the [[Taizé Community]]. Although he was partly inspired by the hope of reviving monasticism in the Protestant tradition, the brotherhood was interdenominational, accepting Roman Catholic brothers, and is thus an ecumenical rather than a specifically Protestant community.

The [[Order of Ecumenical Franciscans]] is a religious order of men and women devoted to following the examples of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Clare of Assisi in their life and understanding of the Christian gospel: sharing a love for creation and those who have been marginalized. It includes members of many different denominations, including Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and a range of Protestant traditions. The Order understands its charism to include not only ecumenical efforts and the traditional emphases of the Franciscans in general, but also to help to develop relationships between the various Franciscan orders.

Additional expressions of ecumenical monasticism can be seen in the [[Bose Monastic Community]] and communities of the [[New Monasticism]] movement arising from Protestant Evangelicalism.

In 1999 an independent Protestant order was founded named [[The Knights of Prayer Monastic Order]]. The community maintains several monks in its [[Portland, Oregon]], cloister and has an international network of associated lay people. It is not affiliated with any particular congregation.

==Contributions==
[[File:ZCHronskýSvätýBeňadikKostol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A monastery in [[Hronský Beňadik]] ([[Slovakia]]).]]
In traditional Catholic societies, monastic communities often took charge of social services such as [[education]] and [[healthcare]]. The legacy of monasteries outside remains an important current in modern society. [[Max Weber]] compared the closeted and [[Puritan]] societies of the [[English Dissenters]], who sparked much of the [[industrial revolution]], to monastic orders. Many [[Utopianism|Utopian]] thinkers (starting with [[Thomas More]]) felt inspired by the common life of monks to apply it to the whole society (an example is the [[phalanstère]]). Modern [[universities]] have also attempted to emulate Christian monasticism. Even in the [[Americas]], universities are built in the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] style of twelfth century monasteries. Communal meals, dormitory residences, elaborate rituals and dress all borrow heavily from the monastic tradition. Today monasticism remains an important part of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican faiths.

===Education===
The capitulary of 789 reads: "Let every monastery and every abbey have its school, in which boys may be taught the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic and grammar". There can be no doubt that by boys are meant not only the candidates for the monastery and the wards (generally the children of nobles) committed to the care of the monks, but also the children of the village or country district around the monastery, for whom there was usually an external school attached to groups of monastic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03349c.htm Turner, William. "Carolingian Schools."] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, monasteries conserved and copied ancient manuscripts in their [[scriptorium|scriptoria]]. A prospective monk first learned grammar, logic, and oratory. Later, he would take up mathematics, astronomy, and music. The students would use a stylus on wax. Later, when their handwriting improved, they would be given ink and parchment. Eventually, many of those schools became universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historymedren.about.com/cs/monasticism/a/keepers_2.htm Historymedrend.about.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Monks in scriptoria copied texts of Greece and Rome, as well as religious texts, and kept these manuscripts from being lost during the tumultuous Middle Ages.

===Medicine===
[[File:Soutra Aisle.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A Picture of the Hospital of [[Soutra Aisle]].|The Hospital at [[Soutra Aisle]].]] Monastic [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] stored and studied [[medicament]]s. Some of the works that the monks copied were by medical writers, and reading and copying these works helped create a store of medical knowledge. Monasteries had infirmaries to treat the monks, travelers, the poor, old, weak and sick. In 2005, archeologists uncovered waste at [[Soutra Aisle]] which helped scientists figure out how people in the Middle Ages treated certain diseases, such as scurvy; because of the vitamin C in watercress, patients would eat it to stop their teeth from falling out. The same archeological group discovered hemlock, a known pain killer, in the drains of the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3745498.stm | work=BBC News | title=The medical world of medieval monks | date=6 August 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monasteries also aided in the development of agricultural techniques. The requirement of [[wine]] for the Mass led to the development of [[enology|wine culture]], as shown in the discovery of the ''[[méthode champenoise]]'' by [[Dom Pérignon (person)|Dom Perignon]]. Several liquors like ''[[Bénédictine]]'' and the [[Trappist beer]]s were also developed in monasteries. Even today many monasteries and convents are locally renowned for their cooking specialties.

The consequence of this centralisation of knowledge was that they initially controlled both public administration and education, where the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] led through the [[quadrivium]] to [[theology]]. Christian monks cultivated the arts as a way of praising God. [[Gregorian chant]] and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] are examples of the practical application of quadrivium subjects.

The status of monks as apart from secular life (at least theoretically) also served a social function. Dethroned [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kings]] were [[tonsure]]d and sent to a monastery so that they could not claim the crown back. Monasteries became a place for [[second son]]s to live in celibacy so that the family inheritance went to [[primogeniture|the first son]]; in exchange the families donated to the monasteries. Few cities lacked both a St Giles house for lepers outside the walls and a Magdalene house for prostitutes and other women of notoriety within the walls, and some orders were favored by monarchs and rich families to keep and educate their [[maiden]] daughters before [[arranged marriage]].

The monasteries also provided refuge to those like [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] who retired to [[Yuste]] in his late years, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]], who was functionally as close to a monastic as his regal responsibilities permitted.

The '''definition of religion''' is a controversial subject in [[religious studies]] with scholars failing to agree on any one definition. [[Oxford Dictionary]] defines [[religion]] as the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a [[personal God]] or gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/religion|title=religion (English Oxford living Dictionaries)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]], have tried to correct a perceived Judeo-Christian and Western bias in the definition and study of religion. Thinkers such as Daniel Dubuisson{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}} have doubted that the term religion has any meaning outside of western cultures, while others, such as Ernst Feil{{sfn|Feil|2000}} even doubt that it has any specific, universal meaning even there.

==Competing definitions==

Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are however two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl.

* [[Emile Durkheim]] defined religion as "a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practises which unite into one single moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them."{{sfn|Taves|2009|page=176}}
* [[Max Lynn Stackhouse]], defined religion as "a comprehensive worldview or 'metaphysical moral vision' that is accepted as binding because it is held to be in itself basically true and just even if all dimensions of it cannot be either fully confirmed or refuted".{{sfn|Nelson|2010|page=xi}}

Some jurisdictions refuse to classify specific religions as religions, arguing that they are instead heresies, even if they are widely viewed as a religion in the academic world.{{sfn|Minahan|2002|page=234}}

===Modern western===
Religion is  a [[modern era|modern]] [[Western culture|Western]] concept.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv|first=Timothy|last=Fitzgerald|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages.&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM.  2002).

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1=Daniel|last1=Dubuisson|title=The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date=2007|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=0801887569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"/&gt;

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McKinnon | first=A. M. |date=2002 |title=Sociological definitions, language games, and the 'essence' of religion | journal=Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion | publisher=Brill Academic Publishers | volume=14 | issue=1 | issn=0943-3058 | doi=10.1163/157006802760198776 | pages=61–83 |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3073/1/McKinnon_Definition_of_Religion_author_version_no_format.pdf |access-date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the [[Peace of Westphalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wilfred Cantwell |date=1978 |title=The Meaning and End of Religion |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:
{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference USA]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=James |first1=Paul |last2=Mandaville |first2=Peter |year=2010 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions |url=https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Classical===
[[File:Будажап Цыреторов.JPG|thumb|Budazhap Shiretorov (Будажап Цыреторов), the head shaman of the religious community Altan Serge (Алтан Сэргэ) in [[Buryatia]].]]
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] in the late 18th century defined religion as ''das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl'', commonly translated as "the feeling of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Hueston A. Finlay. "'Feeling of absolute dependence' or 'absolute feeling of dependence'? A question revisited". ''Religious Studies'' 41.1 (2005), pp. 81–94. {{doi|10.1017/S0034412504007462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] defined religion in 1871 as "the belief in spiritual beings".&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Tylor, E.B. (1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"&gt;Tillich, P. (1957) ''Dynamics of faith''. Harper Perennial; (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion.

==Religion as modern western construct==
[[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]]]]

A number of scholars have pointed out that the terminology used in the study of religion in the west derives from [[Judeo-Christian tradition]], and that the basic assumptions of religion as an analytical category are all Western in origin. This idea was first raised by Wilfred Cantwell Smith in his 1962 book, ''The Meaning and End of Religion''.{{sfn|Smith|1991}} Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], and Jason Ānanda Josephson. These [[social constructionist]]s argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

While few would dispute that the concept of religion does have a historical genealogy, there is some disagreement about what the Western origin of the term has meant historically. Some such as [[Tomoko Masuzawa]] have felt that the equation of religion with Christianity had the effect of diminishing other traditions, especially in the study of comparative religions as it developed during the high point of Western imperialism.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}} Others{{who|date=November 2017}} have felt that this sort of criticism overestimates the influence that Western academic thought had on the rest of the world.

Daniel Dubuisson, a French anthropologist, argues that the idea of religion has changed a lot over time and that one cannot fully understand its development by relying on consistent use of the term, which "tends to minimize or cancel out the role of history".{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} "What the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history."{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}} He notes that [[St. Augustine]]'s definition of ''religio'' differed from the way we used the modern word religion.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2003}}

Dubuisson prefers the term "cosmographic formation" to religion. Dubuisson says that, with the emergence of religion as a category separate from culture and society, there arose [[religious studies]]. The initial purpose of religious studies was to demonstrate the superiority of the living or universal European world view to the dead or ethnic religions scattered throughout the rest of the world, expanding the teleological project of [[Schleiermacher]] and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Tiele]] to a worldwide ideal religiousness.{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007|p=792}} Due to shifting theological currents, this was eventually supplanted by a liberal-ecumenical interest in searching for Western-style universal truths in every cultural tradition.{{sfn|Masuzawa|2005}}

According to Fitzgerald, religion is not a universal feature of all cultures, but rather a particular idea that first developed in Europe under the influence of [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|p=45–46}} Fitzgerald argues that from about the 4th century CE Western Europe and the rest of the world diverged. As Christianity became commonplace, the [[charismatic authority]] identified by Augustine, a quality we might today call religiousness, exerted a commanding influence at the local level. As the Catholic Church lost its dominance during the [[Protestant Reformation]] and Christianity became closely tied to political structures, religion was recast as the basis of national [[sovereignty]], and religious identity gradually became a less universal sense of spirituality and more divisive, locally defined, and tied to nationality.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=194}} It was at this point that religion was dissociated from universal beliefs and moved closer to [[dogma]] in both meaning and practice. However, there was not yet the idea of dogma as a personal choice, only of [[established church]]es. With the Enlightenment religion lost its attachment to nationality, says Fitzgerald, but rather than becoming a universal social attitude, it now became a personal feeling or emotion.{{sfn|Fitzgerald|2007|page=268}}

[[Talal Asad]] later refined this notion by showing that many assumptions about religion derive specifically from post-Enlightenment Christianity.{{sfn|Asad|2003}}
Asad argues that before the word religion came into common usage, Christianity was a ''disciplina'', a rule just like that of the Roman Empire. This idea can be found in the writings of [[St. Augustine]] (354–430). Christianity was then a power structure opposing and superseding human institutions, a literal Kingdom of Heaven. It was the discipline taught by one's family, school, church, and city authorities, rather than something calling one to self-discipline through symbols.{{sfn|Asad|1993|p=34-35}}

These ideas are developed by [[S. N. Balagangadhara]]. In the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Balagangadhara argues that the idea of Christianity as the purest expression of spirituality was supplanted by the concept of religion as a worldwide practice.{{sfn|Balagangadhara|1994|p=159}} This caused such ideas as [[religious freedom]], a reexamination of classical [[philosophy]] as an alternative to Christian thought, and more radically [[Deism]] among intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]]. Much like Christianity, the idea of religious freedom was exported around the world as a civilizing technique, even to regions such as [[India]] that had never treated spirituality as a matter of political identity.{{sfn|Pennington|2005}}

More recently, in ''The Invention of Religion in Japan'', Josephson has argued that while the concept of religion was Christian in its early formulation, non-Europeans (such as the Japanese) did not just acquiesce and passively accept the term's meaning. Instead they worked to interpret religion (and its boundaries) strategically to meet their own agendas and staged these new meanings for a global audience.{{sfn|Josephson|2012}} In nineteenth century [[Japan]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] was radically transformed from a pre-modern philosophy of [[natural law]] into a religion, as Japanese leaders worked to address domestic and international political concerns. In summary, Josephson argues that the European encounter with other cultures has led to a partial de-Christianization of the category religion. Hence religion has come to refer to a confused collection of traditions with no possible coherent definition.{{sfn|Josephson|2012|p=257}}

[[George Lindbeck]], a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Postliberal theology|postliberal theologian]] (but not a social constructionist), says that religion does not refer to belief in [[God]] or a transcendent Absolute, but rather to "a kind of cultural and/or linguistic framework or medium that shapes the entirety of life and thought ... it is similar to an idiom that makes possible the description of realities, the formulation of beliefs, and the experiencing of inner attitudes, feelings, and sentiments."{{sfn|Lindbeck|1984|p=33}}

[[File:El-tiempo.jpg|thumb|''El Tiempo'' cover]]'''''El Tiempo''''' was a [[Ladino language]] newspaper published in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]] in the years 1872–1930. ''El Tiempo'' was the first Ladino newspaper published in Istanbul. It was also the longest-running Ladino newspaper in the city.&lt;ref name="p52"&gt;Migdal, Joel S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vahSdZ2JBvwC Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices]''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; It was published as a daily newspaper, later being converted into a biweekly. It soon became the most influential newspaper of its time, with a circulation of up to 10,000&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fresco-david&lt;/ref&gt;. From July 1882 to 1930 ''El Tiempo'' was published three times a week.&lt;ref name="p51"&gt;Migdal, Joel S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vahSdZ2JBvwC Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices]''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. pp. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, the newspaper supported the positions of Turkish reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Johann. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=aHdPocSrcLcC Jüdische Geschichte in Daten. Beck'sche Reihe, 1653]''. München: Beck, 2005. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the time of the [[First World War]], half of the adult Jews in the city were subscribers of ''El Tiempo''.&lt;ref name="p52"/&gt; However, from that point onwards the influence of the newspaper declined sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Migdal, Joel S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vahSdZ2JBvwC Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices]''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the initial phase of its history the newspaper was patronized by Hayim Carmona. His son Isaac Carmona served as its editor from its founding year. After his father's death in 1883, Isaac Carmona took over as patron of the newspaper whilst the post of editor passed on to Mercado Fresco and Sami Alkabez. After a few years, [[David Fresco]] became editor. He served as editor of the newspaper for almost fifty years.&lt;ref name="p51"/&gt;

''El Tiempo'' was supported by the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]''. As a result, the newspaper promoted the teaching of the [[French language]] to its readers. Moreover, it sought to educate its readers in the [[Turkish language]]. It ran a section in Turkish (written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]) every two-three days. The world-view of the paper in its early phase was largely [[Eurocentric]], reporting events from the capitals of  Europe ([[Paris]], [[London]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] and [[Berlin]]) whilst paying little attention to events inside the Ottoman Empire (including Constantinople/Istanbul itself). Fictional stories published in the newspaper were largely translations from French. The promotion of the French language was however somewhat subdued in the 1890s, but the language used in articles was often a heavily French-influenced Ladino.&lt;ref name="p59"&gt;Migdal, Joel S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vahSdZ2JBvwC Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices]''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. pp. 59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Once [[Zionism]] emerged as a political force, ''El Tiempo'' responded by proclaiming its loyalty to the Ottoman Empire. Within the Ladino Jewish community in Constantinople/Istanbul (where Zionist ideas were beginning to take root) ''El Tiempo'' argued that Ottoman Jews ought to remain Ottoman nationals.&lt;ref name="p59"/&gt; There was a brief period (prior to 1910) during which discussions were ongoing between the [[World Zionist Organization]] and ''El Tiempo'', but any re-evaluation of Zionism on behalf of ''El Tiempo'' was sealed as David Fresco aligned with prominent anti-Zionist Rabbi [[Chaim Nahum]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fresco-david&lt;/ref&gt;. Fresco argued in favour of assimilation of the Ottoman Jews into Turkish society and the promotion of the use of the Turkish language.&lt;ref&gt;Migdal, Joel S. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vahSdZ2JBvwC Boundaries and Belonging States and Societies in the Struggle to Shape Identities and Local Practices]''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fellowship of Isis''' (FOI) is an international [[spirituality|spiritual]] organisation devoted to promoting awareness of the [[Goddess_movement#Terminology|Goddess]]. It is dedicated specifically to the [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]] goddess [[Isis]] because the FOI co-founders believed Isis best represented the energies of the dawning [[Age of Aquarius|Aquarian Age]]. The FOI is a multi-faith, multi-racial, and multi-cultural organisation, and despite worshipping [[pagan]] deities, does not consider itself to be a [[Neopagan]] faith.

==History==

The FOI was founded at [[Huntington Castle, Clonegal|Huntington Castle]], Co. Carlow, Ireland at the [[Vernal Equinox]] of 1976. The three co-founders were [[Olivia Robertson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.fellowshipofisis.com/oliviarobertson.html|publisher=FOI Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her brother, Lawrence Durdin-Robertson (grandchildren of [[Thomas Herbert Robertson]]) and Lawrence's wife Pamela. Their aim was to create a fellowship to "help the [[Goddess_movement#Terminology|Goddess]] actively in the manifestation of Her divine plan." Olivia has described Isis as "God in female form."  The FOI grew out of a "working group" created in 1963 called the Huntington Castle Centre for Meditation and Study. This Centre was active in gathering together various occult and theological figures such as [[Ross Nichols]], Josephine and Mohun Lall, and Gerald Gough. The experiences shared within this group, along with the personal spiritual revelations and experiences of the three FOI co-founders led to the eventual founding of the Fellowship of Isis on the Vernal Equinox, 1976. From 1976 until the early 1990s, the group steadily grew.

In August 1993, the Fellowship of Isis was represented at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at Chicago by Olivia Robertson and other member delegates. It is the first time that the Religion of the Goddess has been acknowledged as a world faith at this Parliament.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Robertson, Olivia. ''The Handbook of the Fellowship of Isis.'' Enniscorthy: Cesara Publications, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Parliament "became a showcase for the new religions in America, especially since mainstream Christianity was much underrepresented . . . Two feminist neopagan groups, the [[Covenant of the Goddess]] and the Fellowship of Isis, were among the sponsors of the parliament."&lt;ref name="Keller"&gt;Keller, Rosemary Skinner &amp; Ruether, Rosemary Radford.  ''In Our Own Voices, Four Centuries of American Women's Religious Writings.''  San Francisco: Westminster John Knox Press, 1995. pg. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

Custodianship of the Fellowship of Isis Foundation Centre is now under the aegis of the Durdin-Robertsons, heirs of the co-founders.  In 2011, Olivia Robertson named her niece, Cressida Pryor, successor and FOI steward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice|url=http://www.fellowshipofisis.com/cressidapryor.html|publisher=Fellowship of Isis Homepage Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Cressida announced the Irish-based Circle of Brigid the "central parliament" and "executive board" of the Fellowship of Isis Foundation Centre, of which she is overall adviser.   The Circle of Brigid is also responsible for festivals at the Castle Centre in Ireland and has a subcommittee to sort ethics grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice|url=http://www.fellowshipofisis.com/letters/samhain2014.html|publisher=Fellowship of Isis Homepage Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fellowship is a globally organised religion, whose international and Internet presence is very large by comparison with its Irish base.&lt;ref&gt;Maignant, Catherine, "Irish base, global religion: the Fellowship of Isis". 53 – 73 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==

"Over the past 30 years a body of liturgy has developed, detailing how the [Manifesto] principles can be practised by interested members through establishing a relationship between self and deity.  Members are encouraged to express this spiritual relationship by enacting rituals, prayers and meditations, as detailed in the liturgy.  This liturgy is drawn from the ritual structures of contemporary paganisms, Goddess spirituality and diverse archaeological scholarship into religious experience in the ancient world."&lt;ref name="Melton"&gt;Melton, Gordon J., and Partridge, Christopher, ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities.''  New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. pg. 300&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Liturgy]] of the Fellowship of Isis was written by [[Olivia Robertson]], each ritual honouring different [[pantheon (gods)|pantheons]], and including a divinely channelled [[oracle]] encouraging spiritual communion with that [[Deity]].  These rites may be used for personal spiritual enhancement or, via instruction from a Fellowship of Isis centre, various degrees may be attained.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Olivia. ''The Call of Isis''. Neptune Press, London for Cesara Publications: Ireland, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==
The stated goal of the Fellowship of Isis is to support and promote the idea of the Divine Feminine. The Fellowship of Isis Manifesto sets out the basic principles of this society.  The Fellowship accepts religious toleration, and is not exclusivist. Members are free to maintain other religious allegiances. The good in all faiths is honoured. The Fellowship of Isis has no particular affiliations. It practices total religious tolerance, forbids sacrifice of any kind and discourages asceticism.&lt;ref name=Manifesto&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fellowship of Isis Manifesto|year=1976|author1=Olivia Robertson|author2=Lawrence Durdin-Robertson|author3=Pamela Durdin-Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes considered pagan, but co-founder [[Olivia Robertson]] stated in 2002: "We are happy to have thousands of Pagans among our 21,000 members in so many countries. But we also have [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Protestants]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Spiritualism|Spiritualists]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]] as members. All love and follow the religion of Isis of 10,000 Names."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice|url=http://www.fellowshipofisis.com/olivia11b_2002.html|publisher=Fellowship of Isis Homepage Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All members in the Fellowship of Isis have equal privileges within it, and membership is free.&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Adler, Margot. ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today.'' New York: Penguin Group, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is open to anyone who wishes to join – once an individual has read through the Fellowship of Isis Manifesto and finds themselves in agreement with the principles laid out within it. There are no vows of secrecy. Members are free to resign at any time, if they so choose and to rejoin again at a later time.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;Robertson, Olivia. The Handbook of the Fellowship of Isis. Enniscorthy: Cesara Publications, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fellowship is dedicated to spreading the religion of all the Goddesses throughout this planet. The Gods are also venerated. The [[Goddess]] is seen as Deity, the [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]] of all beings, as well as the embodiment of Truth and Beauty.  "The ecumenical nature of this nonprofit organization reveals itself in a membership that includes Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Shintoists, Cabalists, Spiritualists, and Wiccan and pagan worshippers of all kinds."&lt;ref name="Cott"&gt;Cott, Jonathan, ''Isis and Osiris''. New York: Doubleday, 1995. pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

FOI sub-groups, called "FOI Foundation Center Societies" or "Daughter Societies" of the Fellowship of Isis consist of the ‘College of Isis’ (Lyceums), the ‘Spiral of the Adepti’ (Iseums), the ‘Spiral of Alchemy’ (Solar Iseums), the 'Druid Clan of Dana' (Groves) and the 'Noble Order of Tara' (Priories).  There are sub-chapters of these societies of the FOI in many major cities and countries around the world.

The Fellowship of Isis claims over 24,000 members in nearly a hundred countries. Members often blend their own traditions and beliefs with those offered by the Fellowship.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

== Anglican churches ==
There are two Anglican churches is Northern Cyprus.  They are:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standrewschurchkyrenia.net/&lt;/ref&gt;
* St Andrew's Church in [[Kyrenia]]
* St Mark's Church in [[Famagusta]] visit:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stmarksfamagusta.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodox Christianity ==
In 2010, the US Department of State reported that "Greek Cypriot Orthodox and Maronite Catholics were allowed to perform religious services on a regular basis, without prior permission."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148926.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010 - Cyprus], US Department of State, Retrieved 2011-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2010, Resolution 1631, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... calling for the protection of religious sites and artifacts from and in Turkish-occupied areas of northern Cyprus as well as for general respect for religious freedom."&lt;ref name=aw&gt;[http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/10/07/turkey%E2%80%99s-foreign-ministry-decries-%E2%80%98biased-resolution%E2%80%99-on-n-cyprus/ Turkey’s Foreign Ministry Decries ‘Biased Resolution’ on N. Cyprus by Nanore Barsoumian] Armenian Weekly, 7 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Turkish Foreign Ministry responded with a press released statement, saying that the resolution had "many factual errors which may harm the credibility of the House of Representatives".&lt;ref name=aw/&gt;

On 27 January 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], in written declaration no. 467, condemned the alleged interruption of the Christmas mass in Northern Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship.&lt;ref name="coe467"&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf Interruption of the Christmas mass in the northern occupied part of Cyprus by Turkish troops and restrictions to the right to freedom of religion and worship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225181325/http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/Doc11/EDOC12505.pdf |date=2011-02-25 }} Written Declaration No. 467, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Doc. 12505, 27 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The declaration claimed that Turkish troops forced the priest conducting the service to remove his vestments and ordered everybody to leave the church, thus violating the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="coe467" /&gt;

On 18 March 2011, 204 Greek school books, including religious books, that were being taken to the schools at Rizokarpaso were confiscated by Turkish Cypriot customs officers at the Pergamos village barricade. The Turkish Cypriot daily newspaper ''Afrika'', in a front page article, criticised those who claim that there is freedom of religion in Northern Cyprus when the religious books were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrikagazetesi.net/arsivafrika/Mart2011/18mart2011.pdf Islam fanatizmi Isa'ya yasak, Turkish translation: "Islam fanaticism, ban Jesus"], Afrika newspaper, 18 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church service restriction controversy===
On 20 May 2016, Northern Cypriot Foreign Minister [[Tahsin Ertuğruloğlu]] restricted Greek Orthodox communities to only hold a single religious service per year, with the exceptions of the [[Apostolos Andreas Monastery]] in Rizokarpaso, the [[Monastery of St. Barnabas]] in Famagusta and [[Morphou#Church|St. Mamas' Church]] in Morphou. The remaining churches could be used for one of the following three feasts: the church's [[Name days in Greece|Name Day]], [[Easter]] or [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name=CyMail&gt;{{cite news |author=Andria Kades |title=Turkish Cypriot side restricts Orthodox church services in north |newspaper=[[Cyprus Mail]] |url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2016/05/24/turkish-cypriot-side-restricts-orthodox-church-services-north/ |date=24 May 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undersecretary Mustafa Lakadamyalı claimed that the move was to prevent the "abuse" of the permission to hold masses, also citing difficulties with the policing of more than one mass a day or frequent masses. Lakadamyalı also said that "whilst some TRNC citizens can pass to the south even for worship, some absolutely cannot". No restriction was placed on Maronites.&lt;ref name=Kibris&gt;{{cite web |title=KKTC'deki kilse ayinlerine sınırlama |publisher=[[Kıbrıs (newspaper)|Kıbrıs]] |url=http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=797018 |date=20 May 2016 |accessdate=23 May 2016 |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was harshly criticized by Turkish Cypriot group [[Famagusta Initiative]] as "chauvinist and intolerant" and it was pointed out that no problem was encountered in the masses which took place in, for example, the [[Nestorian Church (Famagusta)|Nestorian Church]] in Famagusta.&lt;ref name=Kibris /&gt; Ertuğruloğlu's decision was also criticized by Burak Mavis of the [[Turkish Cypriot Teachers’ Trade Union]] (KTOS) who called out the whole debate as being driven by "a backwards and racist political mentality," but it was defended by [[Yilmaz Bora]], the leader of the Association of the Ex-Servicemen of the [[Turkish Resistance Organisation]], who was cited as saying "it was not possible to live with the Greek Cypriots in a United Cyprus, because the mentality of the Greek Cypriots has not changed in 53 years."&lt;ref name=CyMail /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6691">'''Goddess I''' is the [[Schellhas-Zimmermann-Taube letter designation]] for one of the most important [[Maya deities]]: a youthful woman to whom considerable parts of the post-Classic codices are dedicated, and who equally figures in Classic Period scenes. Based on her representation in codical almanacs, she is considered to represent vital functions of the fertile woman, and to preside over eroticism, human procreation, and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1992:145&lt;/ref&gt; Her aged form is associated with weaving. Goddess I could, perhaps, be seen as a terrestrial counterpart to the [[Maya moon goddess]]. In important respects, she corresponds to [[Xochiquetzal]] among the Aztecs, a deity with no apparent connection to the moon.[[File:Maya ceramic figurine, Museo de América.jpg|thumb|right|Possible representation of Goddess I in the Classic Period. Museo de América, Madrid]]

==Name and attributes==
The hieroglyphical name of the goddess consists of a female head characterized by a hair-like curl (prefixed or infixed). The curl is not unimportant, since it is usually assumed to be the sign of the earth (''kab'[an]'') or the moon (Landa's ''u''-sign), with the goddess being identified accordingly. However, the curl might, perhaps, better be viewed as the post-Classic rendition of the infix and hair curl characteristic of Classic glyphs for 'woman' (''ixik'').&lt;ref&gt;Stone and Zender 2011: 35&lt;/ref&gt; The head of goddess I is often preceded by the [[glyph]] for 'white' (''sak''). The figure of goddess I shows a restricted set of variable attributes, amongst which is also the coiled snake headband of goddess O. As a mantic designation, 'White Woman'  contrasts with 'Red Woman', a name referring to the aged patroness of midwifery, [[Ixchel]] (the goddess O). In the codices, the main female functions have been distributed over the White Woman - the Red Woman.

==Functions in ancient almanacs==
Goddess I is the subject of almanacs which take up several pages in the Post-Classic codices of Dresden (16-23) and Madrid (91-95). There, she is chiefly represented in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1972:47-60&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Carrying a bird on the shoulders'': 
The bird species have been argued to refer to the names of specific diseases mentioned in early-colonial medical treatises (especially the ''[[Ritual of the Bacabs]]''). Goddess I thereby appears to function as a general mother of disease. 
*''Carrying a deity or a symbol in a carrying-strap on her back'': 
The deity (e.g., the rain god, the death god) or the symbol (e.g., 'abundance') contains a general prognostication.
*''Holding a deity as a child on her lap'': 
The deity so held may contain a prediction relative to the child's development.
*''Seated opposite another deity or animal'': 
The combinations with a deity or an animal (vulture, armadillo, deer, dog) seem to refer to the prospects of marriage, in the Madrid codex symbolized by the reed mat on which the couples have been placed. The deity or the animal may be indicative of certain qualities of the male partner in marriage, with the female partner representing the constant element. In some cases - involving a young deity as well as the old, lecherous [[God N]] - the coupling has unmistakably erotic overtones.
*''Seated on the lap of another deity'': 
This occurs only once, and implies the aged [[God L]]. The prognostication may conceivably refer to the sort of husband that can be expected to take and marry the woman, or to the deity's influence on the female partner in marriage.

==Classic correspondences==
[[File:WLA lacma ceramic couple whistle.jpg|thumb|150px|Woman embraced by old man, ocarina, Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]
With the exception of the disease-carrying birds, several depictions of the goddess in the almanacs have their counterparts in the Classic Period: Goddess I can be depicted with the maize child in a carrying-strap on her back; in amorous embrace with an aged and lecherous old man, probably [[God N]];&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 1999:153&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the 'harem' of [[God L]] ([[Princeton vase]]); and in encounters, sometimes markedly erotic, with animals such as armadillo, deer, spider monkey, and stinging insects.

The combinations with animals are not well understood. They have been interpreted astronomically (on the assumption that goddess I is identical with the moon goddess),&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1972&lt;/ref&gt; but could in principle also be viewed as metaphorical references to marriage; as mythological scenes; or as relating to animal fertility.

==Mythological comparisons==
Although in the codices and in Classic Period art, goddess I is not clearly identified with the [[Maya moon goddess]] (who can be recognized by her rabbit pet and the lunar crescent), her main functions seem largely to coincide with those of the Moon (excepting the Moon's strong association with water and rain). Mythologically, she has been compared to the underworldly wife of Hun-Hunahpu, [[Xquic]], in the Quichean Popol Vuh,&lt;ref&gt;Taube 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and to the wife of the deer-hunting hero of Q'eqchi' Sun and Moon myth, Po 'Moon'.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1939; 1972:47&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson has pointed out that in the Q'eqchi' myth - which is about the earthly life of a mountain deity's daughter before her final transformation into the Moon - the themes of eroticism, fertility, and marriage strongly come to the fore. In contemporary Maya religion generally, goddess I may possibly go under the cloak of the Virgin Mary, in the latter's various aspects and local manifestations, such as that of "guardian and embracer of the maize".&lt;ref&gt;Redfield and Villa 1934: 116&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory W. Hayes''' (died December 2, 1906) was a prominent leader in the Baptist community of African Americans in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. He graduated from [[Oberlin College]].&lt;ref name=lead&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHJ5AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Z.d.+lewis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fqiK8O5Lh&amp;sig=1t6Y3hM0cGVgmLqasucMCQuEyVY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtucXgy9XYAhUq8IMKHSQKDAI4ChDoAQgoMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Z.d.+lewis&amp;f=false|title=The Perils and Prospects of Southern Black Leadership: Gordon Blaine Hancock, 1884-1970|first=Raymond|last=Gavins|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899 he was involved in a leadership struggle with Z.D. Lewis over issues of operations and autonomy of an educational institution.&lt;ref name=lead/&gt; 

The G. W. Hayes School of Arts and Sciences, a division of [[Virginia Seminary and College]], was named in 1988 in honor and memory of Professor Gregory W. Hayes, the college's second President.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtdwVbiKsL0C&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=Gregory+w.+Hayes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdn76tz9XYAhVs04MKHXHxAjMQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Gregory+w.+Hayes&amp;f=false|title=Freedom's Child: The Life of a Confederate General's Black Daughter|first=Carrie Allen|last=McCray|date=13 January 1998|publisher=Algonquin Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes intervened to provide [[Ota Benga]], an [[Mbuti]] [[pygmy]] former slave who was exhibited at anthropological exhibitions, the opportunity to live and study at the seminary.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=JkXJZtI9DQoC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=Gregory+w.+Hayes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdn76tz9XYAhVs04MKHXHxAjMQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Gregory%20w.%20Hayes&amp;f=false page 453&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev. Hayes became president of the school in 1891 after a leadership struggle. He served until his death in 1906. His wife, Mary Rice Hayes Allen, was the daughter of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general and an African American mother. She served as the seminary's president after Hayes' death until 1908. She is the mother of author [[Carrie Allen McCray]].

An annual Hayes Day celebration has been held at the seminary in his honor and a statue commemorates his life and leadership.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Guru Nanak''' ({{IPA-hns|ˈɡʊɾu ˈnɑnək|}}, {{audio|Guru Nanak Dev.ogg|pronunciation|help=no}}, [[IAST]]: ''Gurū Nānak'') (29 November 1469 – 22 September 1539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]] and the first of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]]. His birth is celebrated worldwide as [[Guru Nanak Gurpurab]] on Kartik Pooranmashi, the full-moon day in the month of [[Katak]], October–November.&lt;ref name=Harbans&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx  |title= Srī Gurū Nānak Dev |last=Dawe |first=Donald G. |work= Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Nanak travelled far and wide teaching people the message of one God who dwells in every one of His creations and constitutes the eternal Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayer|first=Tara|title=Economic History of Sikhs: Sikh Impact Volume 1|year=1988|publisher=Indo-Canadian Publishers|location=Surrey, Canada|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up a unique spiritual, social, and political platform based on equality, fraternal love, goodness, and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sidhu|first=Dawinder|title=Civil Rights in Wartime: The Post-9/11 Sikh Experience|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781409496915|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khorana|first=Meena|title=The Indian Subcontinent in Literature for Children and Young Adults: An Annotated Bibliography of English-language Books|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313254895|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prasoon|first=Shrikant|title=Knowing Guru Nanak|year=2007|publisher=Pustak Mahal|isbn=9788122309805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Nanak's words are registered in the form of 974 poetic hymns in the holy text of Sikhism, the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], with some of the major prayers being the [[Japji Sahib]], the [[Asa di Var]] and the Sidh-Ghost. It is part of Sikh religious belief that the spirit of Guru Nanak's sanctity, divinity and religious authority descended upon each of the nine subsequent Gurus when the Guruship was devolved on to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bhai Gurdas Vaaran|url=http://searchgurbani.com/bhai_gurdas_vaaran/vaar/1/pauri/45|publisher=Search Gurbani|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and early life==
[[File:The Entrance of Janam Asthan-2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Gurdwara Janam Asthan]] in [[Nankana Sahib]], [[Pakistan]], commemorates the site where Guru Nanak is believed to have been born.]]
Guru Nanak was born on 29 November 1469 at Rāi Bhoi Kī Talvaṇḍī (present day [[Nankana Sahib]], Punjab, Pakistan) near [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name=Macauliffe&gt;{{cite book | last=Macauliffe | first=Max Arthur | authorlink=Max Arthur Macauliffe | year=2004 | origyear=1909 | title=The Sikh Religion&amp;nbsp;— Its Gurus, Sacred Writings and Authors | publisher=Low Price Publications | location=India | isbn = 81-86142-31-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Khushwant | authorlink=Khushwant Singh | year=2006 | title=The Illustrated History of the Sikhs | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=India | isbn = 0-19-567747-1 | pages=12–13}} Also, according to the Purātan Janamsākhī (the birth stories of Guru Nanak).&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Kalyan Chand Das Bedi, popularly shortened to [[Mehta Kalu]], and [[Mata Tripta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgpc.net/gurus/gurunanak.asp |title=Guru Nanak Sahib, Guru Nanak Ji, First Sikh Guru, First Guru Of Sikhs, Sahib Shri Guru Nanak Ji, India |publisher=Sgpc.net |accessdate=9 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218023855/http://www.sgpc.net/gurus/gurunanak.asp |archivedate=18 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was the local [[Village accountant|patwari]] (accountant) for crop revenue in the village of Talwandi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nankana.com/AboutRaiBular1.html |title=The Bhatti's of Guru Nanak's Order |publisher=Nankana.com |accessdate=9 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616151332/http://nankana.com/AboutRaiBular1.html |archivedate=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were both [[Hindu Khatris]] and employed as merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H.

He had one sister, [[Bebe Nanaki]], who was five years older than he was. In 1475 she married and moved to [[Sultanpur Lodhi|Sultanpur]]. Guru Nanak was attached to his sister and followed her to Sultanpur to live with her and her husband, Jai Ram. At the age of around 16&amp;nbsp;years, Nanak started working under [[Daulat Khan Lodi]],&lt;ref name=Harbans/&gt; employer of Nanaki's husband. This was a formative time for Nanak, as the Puratan (traditional) [[Janamsakhis|Janam Sakhi]] suggests, and  in his numerous allusions to governmental structure in his hymns, most likely gained at this time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cole | first=W.

According to Sikh traditions, the birth and early years of Guru Nanak's life were marked with many events that demonstrated that Nanak had been marked by divine grace.&lt;ref name=GuruNanak_BBC /&gt; Commentaries on his life give details of his blossoming awareness from a young age. At the age of five, Nanak is said to have voiced interest in divine subjects. At age seven, his father enrolled him at the village school as was the custom.&lt;ref name=Macauliffe/&gt; Notable lore recounts that as a child Nanak astonished his teacher by describing the implicit symbolism of the [[Aleph|first letter of the alphabet]], resembling the mathematical version of one, as denoting the unity or oneness of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cunningham | first=Joseph Davey| year=1853 | origyear= | title=A History Of The Sikhs | publisher=John Murray| location=London | id = | pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other childhood accounts refer to strange and miraculous events about Nanak, such as one witnessed by Rai Bular, in which the sleeping child's head was shaded from the harsh sunlight, in one account, by the stationary shadow of a tree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Rai Bular |last=Gurnek Singh |work= Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in another, by a venomous cobra.&lt;ref name="kartar singh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kartar|title=Life Story Of Guru Nanak|year=1984|publisher=Hemkunt Press|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8170101628|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhKMUnfLZLEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 1487 Nanak married Mata Sulakkhani, daughter of  Mūl Chand and Chando Rāṇī, in the town of [[Batala]]. The couple had two sons, [[Sri Chand]] (8 September 1494 – 13 January 1629)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title= Sri Chand |last=Gurnek Singh |work= Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lakhmi Chand (12 February 1497 – 9 April 1555). Sri Chand received enlightenment from Guru Nanak's teachings and went on to become the founder of the [[Udasi]] sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title= Udasi |last=Madanjit Kaur |work= Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/gurus/nanak1.html |title=Sikh Gurus |website=Sikh-history.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographies==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Bhai Mani Singh's Janamsakhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bhai Mani Singh]]'s Janamsakhi]]
The earliest biographical sources on Nanak's life recognised today are the ''[[Janamsākhīs]]'' (life accounts). [[Bhai Gurdas]], a scribe of the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Gurū Granth Sahib]], also wrote about Nanak's life in his ''vārs''. Although these too were compiled some time after Nanak's time, they are less detailed than the Janamsākhīs. The Janamsākhīs recount in minute detail the circumstances of the birth of the guru.

Gyan-ratanavali is attributed to [[Bhai Mani Singh]] who wrote it with the express intention of correcting heretical accounts of Guru Nanak. Bhai Mani Singh was a disciple of [[Guru Gobind Singh]] who was approached by some Sikhs with a request that he should prepare an authentic account of Guru Nanak’s life.

One popular Janamsākhī was allegedly written by a close companion of the Guru, [[Bhai Bala]]. However, the writing style and language employed have left scholars, such as [[Max Arthur Macauliffe]], certain that they were composed after his death.&lt;ref name=Macauliffe/&gt; According to the scholars, there are good reasons to doubt the claim that the author was a close companion of Guru Nanak and accompanied him on many of his travels.

Nanak was a [[Guru]] (teacher), and founded Sikhism during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cole | first=W. Owen |author2=Sambhi, Piara Singh | year=1978 | title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices | publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | location=London| isbn = 0-7100-8842-6 | pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Luis Moreno|author2=César Colino|title=Diversity and Unity in Federal Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5lpveRnSxEC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2010|publisher=McGill Queen University Press|isbn=978-0-7735-9087-8|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental beliefs of Sikhism, articulated in the sacred scripture [[Guru Granth Sahib]], include faith and meditation on the name of the one creator, unity of all humankind, engaging in [[selfless service]], striving for social justice for the [[Sarbat da bhala|benefit and prosperity of all]], and honest conduct and livelihood while living a householder's life.&lt;ref name="Kalsi_Chelsea"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sikhism | publisher=Chelsea House, Philadelphia| author = Sewa Singh Kalsi | pages=41–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole_Sambhi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices | publisher=Sussex Academic Press |author1=William Owen Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi | year=1995|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teece 2004 4"&gt;{{cite book|last=Teece|first=Geoff|year=2004|title=Sikhism:Religion in focus|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|location=|isbn=978-1-58340-469-0|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guru Granth Sahib is worshipped as the Supreme Authority of Sikhism and is considered the eleventh and final guru of Sikhism. As the first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak contributed a total of  974 hymns to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christopher Shackle|author2=Arvind Mandair|title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftdcvmviy_8C |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45108-9|pages=xviii–xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
[[File:GuruNanakFresco-Goindwal.jpg|Fresco of Guru Nanak|left|thumbnail]]
Nanak’s teachings can be found in the Sikh scripture [[Guru Granth Sahib]], as a collection of verses recorded in [[Gurmukhi]].

There are two competing theories on Guru Nanak's teachings.&lt;ref name=arvindmandair131&gt;Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair (2013), Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1441102317}}, pages 131-134&lt;/ref&gt; One, according to Cole and Sambhi, is based on hagiographical [[Janamsakhis]],&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pages 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; and states that Nanak's teachings and Sikhism were a revelation from God, and not a social protest movement nor any attempt to reconcile Hinduism and Islam in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Cole_Sambhi_Dic"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism: Sikh Religion and Philosophy) | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author1=W. Owen Cole |author2=Piara Singh Sambhi | year=1997 |page=71 | isbn=0203986091}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other states, Nanak was a [[Guru]]. According to Singha, "Sikhism does not subscribe to the theory of incarnation or the concept of prophethood. But it has a pivotal concept of Guru. He is not an incarnation of God, not even a prophet. He is an illumined soul."&lt;ref&gt;HS Singha (2009), The Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170103011}}, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hagiographical ''Janamsakhis'' were not written by Nanak, but by later followers without regard for historical accuracy, and contain numerous legends and myths created to show respect for Nanak.&lt;ref&gt;Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh (2011), Sikhism: An Introduction, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1848853218}}, pages 2-8&lt;/ref&gt; The term revelation, clarify Cole and Sambhi, in Sikhism is not limited to the teachings of Nanak, they include all Sikh Gurus, as well as the words of past, present and future men and women, who possess divine knowledge intuitively through meditation. The Sikh revelations include the words of non-Sikh [[bhagat]]s, some who lived and died before the birth of Nanak, and whose teachings are part of the Sikh scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1898723134}}, pages 52-53, 46, 95-96, 159&lt;/ref&gt; The Adi Granth and successive Sikh Gurus repeatedly emphasised, states Mandair, that Sikhism is "not about hearing voices from God, but it is about changing the nature of the human mind, and anyone can achieve direct experience and spiritual perfection at any time".&lt;ref name=arvindmandair131/&gt; Guru Nanak emphasised that all human beings can have direct access to God without rituals or priests.&lt;ref name=GuruNanak_BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/people/nanak.shtml |title=Guru Nanak: A brief overview of the life of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of man as elaborated by Guru Nanak, states Arvind-pal Singh Mandair, refines and negates the "monotheistic concept of self/God", and "monotheism becomes almost redundant in the movement and crossings of love".&lt;ref name="Mandair1"/&gt; The goal of man, taught the Sikh Gurus, is to end all dualities of "self and other, I and not-I", attain the "attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life".&lt;ref name="Mandair1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzeCy_zL0Q8C | title=Religion and the Specter of the West - Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality and the Politics of Translation | publisher= Columbia University Press | author=Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh |  year= 2009 | pages=372–373 | isbn=0231147244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Nanak, and other Sikh Gurus emphasised Bhakti, and taught that the spiritual life and secular householder life are intertwined.&lt;ref name="Kamala1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTfKwGV6mBkC |title=The Socially Involved Renunciate - Guru Nanaks Discourse to Nath Yogi's | publisher=State University of New York Press |author1=Nayar, Kamal Elizabeth  |author2=Sandhu, Jaswinder Singh | year=2007 |location=United States of America | pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sikh worldview, the everyday world is part of the Infinite Reality, increased spiritual awareness leads to increased and vibrant participation in the everyday world.&lt;ref name="Nikky1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUWIEfAY-mMC | title=Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern (Editors: K. R. Sundararajan, Bithika Mukerji) | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |author1=Kaur Singh |author2=Nikky Guninder | date=30 Jan 2004 | location=English | pages=530 | isbn=8120819373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak, states Sonali Marwaha, described living an "active, creative, and practical life" of "truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity" as being higher than the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] truth.&lt;ref name="Marwha1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROtEr_QdB3sC | title=Colors of Truth, Religion Self and Emotions | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | author=Marwha, Sonali Bhatt | year=2006 | location=New Delhi | pages=205 | isbn=818069268X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through popular tradition, Nanak’s teaching is understood to be practised in three ways:
* ''[[Vaṇḍ Chakkō|Va{{IAST|ṇḍ}} Chakkō]]'': Sharing with others, helping those with less who are in need
* ''[[Kirat Karō]]'': Earning/making a living honestly, without exploitation or fraud
* ''[[Naam Japna]]'': Meditating on God's name to control the [[Five Thieves|five weaknesses]] of the human personality.

Guru Nanak emphasised [[Naam Japna|Nam Japna]] (or Naam Simran), that is repetition of God's name and attributes, as a means to feel God's presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. H.

Nanak was raised in a Hindu family and belonged to the Bhakti Sant tradition.&lt;ref name="David Lorenzen 1995 pages 1-2"&gt;David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791420256}}, pages 1-2, Quote: "Historically, Sikh religion derives from this nirguni current of bhakti religion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Louis Fenech 2014 page 35"&gt;Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E.

The roots of the Sikh tradition are, states Louis Fenech, perhaps in the [[Sant (religion)|Sant]]-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition.&lt;ref name="Louis Fenech 2014 page 35"/&gt; Furthermore, adds Fenech, "Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fenech (2014), in The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 36, Quote: "Few Sikhs would mention these Indic texts and ideologies in the same breadth as the Sikh tradition, let alone trace elements of their tradition to this chronological and ideological point, '''despite the fact''' that the Indic mythology permeates the Sikh sacred canon, the ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and the secondary canon, the ''Dasam Granth'' (Rinehart 2011), and adds delicate nuance and substance to the sacred symbolic universe of the Sikhs of today and of their past ancestors."&lt;/ref&gt;

Guru Nanak travelled extensively during his lifetime. Some modern accounts state that he visited Tibet, most of South Asia and Arabia starting in 1496, at age 27, when he left his family for a thirty-year period.&lt;ref name=GuruNanak_BBC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Harjinder Singh Dilgeer|year=2008|title=Sikh Twareekh|publisher=The Sikh University Press|location=Belgium &amp; India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jagbir Johal |title=Sikhism Today |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37i7uAYe6QEC&amp;pg=PA125 |year=2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-84706-272-7 |pages=125 note 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims include Guru Nanak visiting the Mount Sumeru of Indian mythology, as well as Mecca, Baghdad, Achal Batala and Multan, in these places he debated religious ideas with competing groups.&lt;ref name="CallewaertSnell1994p26"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Winand M. Callewaert |author2=Rupert Snell |title=According to Tradition: Hagiographical Writing in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrMwdEqHLzEC  |year=1994|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-03524-8 |pages=26–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories became widely popular in the 19th and 20th century, and exist in many versions.&lt;ref name="CallewaertSnell1994p26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenzen1995p41"/&gt;

The [[hagiography|hagiographic]] details is a subject of dispute, with modern scholarship questioning the details and authenticity of many claims. For example, Callewaert and Snell state that early Sikh texts do not contain these stories, and after these travel stories first appear in hagiographic accounts of Guru Nanak centuries after his death, they continue to become more sophisticated over time, with the late phase ''Puratan'' version describing four missionary journeys (''udasis''), which however differs from the ''Miharban'' version.&lt;ref name="CallewaertSnell1994p26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenzen1995p41"/&gt; Some of the stories about Guru Nanak's extensive travels first appear in the 19th-century versions of ''janam-sakhi'' in the Puratan version. Further, stories about Guru Nanak's travel to Baghdad is absent from even the early 19th-century ''Puratan'' version.&lt;ref name="CallewaertSnell1994p26"/&gt; These embellishments and insertion of new stories, according to Callewaert and Snell, closely parallel claims of miracles by Islamic ''pirs'' found in Sufi tazkiras of the same era, and these legends may have been written in a competition.&lt;ref name="CallewaertSnell1994p26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=WH McLeod |title=Essays in Sikh History, Tradition and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VKgAAAAMAAJ |year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-568274-8 |pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of dispute has been the Baghdad stone inscription in a Turkish script, which some interpret saying ''Baba Nanak Fakir'' was there in 1511-1512, other interpret it stating 1521-1522 (and that he lived in the Middle East for 11 years away from his family), while others particularly Western scholars stating that the stone inscription is from the 19th century and the stone is not a reliable evidence that Guru Nanak visited Baghdad in early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;V.

Claims have been asserted of additional inscriptions, but no one has been able to locate and verify them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=WH McLeod |title=Sikhs and Sikhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhV5AAAAMAAJ |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-566892-6 |pages=127–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baghdad inscription remains the basis of writing by Indian scholars that Guru Nanak journeyed in the Middle East, with some claiming he visited [[Jerusalem]], [[Mecca]], [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mahinder N.

Novel claims about his travels, as well as claims such as Guru Nanak's body vanishing after his death, are also found in later versions and these are similar to the miracle stories in Sufi literature about their ''pirs''. Other direct and indirect borrowings in the Sikh ''janam-sakhis'' relating to legends around Guru Nanak's journeys are from Hindu epics and Puranas and Buddhist Jataka stories.&lt;ref name="Lorenzen1995p41"&gt;{{cite book|author=David N.

==Succession==
Guru Nanak appointed Bhai Lehna as the successor [[Guru]], renaming him as [[Guru Angad]], meaning "one’s very own" or "part of you". Shortly after proclaiming Bhai Lehna as his successor, Guru Nanak died on 22 September 1539 in [[Kartarpur, Pakistan|Kartarpur]], at the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhs.org/guru1.htm |title=The Sikhism Home Page: Guru Nanak |publisher=Sikhs.org |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goolwa-Hindmarsh Island causeway.jpg|thumb|250px|right|View of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge from the Goolwa wharf.]]

The '''Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy''' was a 1990s Australian legal and political controversy that involved the clash of [[Indigenous Australian]] religious beliefs and [[Private property|property rights]]. A proposed bridge to [[Hindmarsh Island]], near [[Goolwa, South Australia]] (intended to replace the existing [[cable ferry]] and service a proposed [[marina]] development) attracted opposition from many local residents, environmental groups and indigenous leaders. In 1994, a group of Ngarrindjeri women elders claimed the site was sacred to them for reasons that could not be revealed. The case attracted much controversy because the issue intersected with broader concerns about [[Indigenous rights]] in the Australian community at the time, and coincided with the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo]] and [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik]] [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] cases regarding [[Native Title]].

"Secret women's business", as the group's claims became known, became the subject of intense legal battles. Some Ngarrindjeri women came forward to dispute the veracity of the claims. The [[Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission]] found that "secret women's business" had been fabricated. Subsequently, the [[First Howard Ministry|Howard Government]] passed the ''Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act (1997)'',{{r|HIAct}} which allowed construction to go ahead. The bridge was completed in March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builtenvirons.com.au/Capabilities/Keyprojects/HindmarshIslandBridge/tabid/91/Default.aspx |title=Hindmarsh Island Bridge |publisher=Built Environs Pty Ltd |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926065627/http://www.builtenvirons.com.au/Capabilities/Keyprojects/HindmarshIslandBridge/tabid/91/Default.aspx |archivedate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2001, a civil case in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] re-ignited the debate. In rejecting claims for damages by the developers, Justice [[John von Doussa]] stated that he was not satisfied that the claims of "secret women's business" had been fabricated, although never explicitly stating them to be true. The Ngarrindjeri and their supporters took the decision as a vindication, and many organisations subsequently apologised. Opinion remains divided over the issue to the present day.&lt;ref name=vondoussa&gt;

==Background==
In 1977, [[Adelaide]] developers Tom and Wendy Chapman, trading as Binalong Pty Ltd, purchased {{convert|30|ha|acre}} of land on [[Hindmarsh Island]] in the [[Murray River]] [[estuary]] and later received planning permission for their company to build a 560-berth [[marina]], car parking, residential development, conference centre, golf course and associated buildings. Wendy Chapman was a former [[Lord Mayor]] of [[City of Adelaide|Adelaide]] from 1983 to 1985.

With the marina only partially completed, in 1988 the Chapmans applied for permission to increase the size of the project as the original project was found to be financially unviable. The Planning Assessment Commission rejected the proposal, stating that the development couldn't expand unless a bridge was built from [[Goolwa, South Australia|Goolwa]] to Hindmarsh Island as the existing [[Cable ferry]] would not be able to handle the increased traffic. In October 1989, approval was granted for a bridge, to be financed by the Chapmans, subject to an [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Impact Study]] (EIS). The EIS (the Edmonds Report) was completed within two weeks and identified the need for an anthropological study. The Chapmans funded a study by Rod Lucas who reported in January 1990 that existing written records did not record mythological sites, but cautioned that consultation with Indigenous groups would be required.

===Indigenous heritage===
The [[Ngarrindjeri]] are one of the 30–40 clan-groups (''lakinyeri'') that inhabited [[South Australia]] at the time of white settlement. Originally numbering around 6,000 members they are the only tribe in Australia whose land lay within {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} of a capital city to have survived as a distinct people as recognised in the 2002 ''Kungun Ngarrindjeri Yunnan'' Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atns.net.au/agreement.asp?EntityID=978 Protocol Agreement between Alexandrina Council and Ngarrindjeri People]  Agreements, Treaties and Negotiated Settlements (ATNS) 8 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murraybridge.sa.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Kungun_Ngarrindjeri_Yunnan_Agreement.pdf Kungun Ngarrindjeri Yunnan Agreement 17 March 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}{{Dubious|date=May 2011}}

In April 1990, the State Minister for Environment and Planning wrote to the Chapmans granting them planning permission for the bridge to Hindmarsh Island and the extensions to their marina. The estimated cost of the bridge was around $6 million which was considerably more than the estimated value of the marina once completed. The planning permission was subject to a number of conditions, including the requirements for consultation with "relevant Aboriginal representative bodies" such as Ngarrendjeri Elders, the Raukkan Community Council, the Ngarrendjeri Lands and Progress Association, and the Lower Murray Heritage Committee.

This was to become an issue in 1994 as the Chapmans had clearly not met these requirements.&lt;ref name="Brief"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/backgroundbriefing/stories/1995/10792.htm Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission] Background Briefing [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] 17 September 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chapmans had done several environmental impact studies, submitted plans that included the bridge to the Raukkan Community Council and had also consulted with Henry Rankin, a senior Ngarrendjeri Elder, in November 1989 this was prior to the planning permission for the bridge being granted on condition of additional consultation. In the Federal Court hearing in 1994, Wendy Chapman gave evidence that the page of the letter setting out these additional consultation requirements was missing from the Minister's letter she had received (the same recommendations were also included in an assessment sent to the Chapmans by the Department of Environment and Planning). She also stated her belief that as no skeletal remains had been found, no further consultation was required.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt;

===Government assistance===
The Hindmarsh Island marina was at this time losing money and the Chapmans were in financial difficulties due the failure of another marina project they had built at [[Wellington, South Australia|Wellington]]. They could not afford to construct the bridge themselves so they approached the [[Government of South Australia|State Government]] for assistance.

Beneficial Finance, a subsidiary of the state owned [[State Bank of South Australia]], had supplied the financing for the marina development. By 1990 it was obvious that the State Bank was having financial difficulties and The State [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor]] government led by Premier [[John Bannon]] was anxious to protect Beneficial’s large investment in the Chapman's projects. The government was also under pressure for a series of major projects it had promised that had never eventuated so the bridge project was also seen as likely to be the only major success Labor would be able to claim for the next election.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt;

The State government made a deal with Chapmans. Binalong would pay up front for the bridge to be built. Then the State government would reimburse Binalong for half of the cost of construction, up to a limit of $3 million.

===Legal liability===
In September 1990 Beneficial Finance decided to withdraw funding and the Chapmans approached Partnership Pacific, a subsidiary of [[Westpac]], to take over the financing. Partnership Pacific agreed but only with the condition that the State Government paid the entire cost of the bridge. A secret meeting was arranged between the Chapmans, Westpac and the government at which it was accepted that the government would pay the whole cost of the bridge while the Chapmans would pay back half at a later date, but only after Binalong had paid off all its debts to Westpac. Binalong owed so much money to the State Bank through Beneficial Finance that Bannon apparently had no choice but to prop the company up. The State Bank collapsed not long after with debts of $3 Billion.

On 22 November 1990, Premier Bannon wrote a personal letter to the Managing Director of Westpac, Stewart Fowler, guaranteeing government financing of the bridge and in February 1991, Cabinet approved the funding agreement as outlined in the Premier's letter.&lt;ref&gt;John Bannon Letter: "Dear Mr Fowler, I am willing to put a recommendation to my Cabinet that the government commit immediately to fund the construction of a bridge between Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island on terms previously outlined, including a contribution from Chapman payable subsequent to the repayment of Westpac advances. However, the making of such a recommendation could only be on the basis of having received a commitment from Westpac to finance the marina and residential waterfront development, the details of which have been previously submitted to your bank. Yours sincerely, John Bannon."&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the government had no liability beyond paying half the cost of the bridge. Unfortunately, Premier Bannon’s letter had created an unintended liability for the State government. Not only was the government liable for Wespac’s losses if it did not build the bridge but even if the bridge was built and Westpac suffered any losses from stages two, three and four of the marina project, the government was now also liable to cover those losses which could run to hundreds of millions of dollars.

A deed was signed in March 1993 binding the government to this commitment. Public outrage at government funding of a project for the sole benefit of private developers, led [[South Australian Legislative Council]] member and leader of the [[Australian Democrats]], [[Mike Elliott (politician)|Mike Elliott]], to call for a Parliamentary inquiry into the bridge and the financial arrangements between the government and Westpac. One of its terms of reference dealt specifically with the propriety of the government's decision in conferring private benefits at taxpayers' expense. The inquiries findings criticised the financial arrangements between the government, the Chapmans and Wespac, and recommended that the government reconsider the bridge and examine whether the bridge could be replaced by a second ferry.

In early October, the Lower Murray Heritage Committee wrote to the Aboriginal Affairs Minister asking him to protect Aboriginal sites on Hindmarsh Island however, work on the bridge began on 27 October 1993 though it quickly ceased due to industrial action.

===1993 election===
Largely due to the financial disaster of the State Bank collapse leaving the state essentially bankrupt, Labor was routed in the December [[South Australian state election, 1993|1993 election]] and the Liberals came to power with Dean Brown as Premier. When in opposition the Liberals had campaigned against the Hindmarsh Island Bridge and stopping it was a campaign promise during the election. Further up the Murray, the local community in [[Berri, South Australia|Berri]] was campaigning for a much-needed bridge to replace their ferry and the government had agreed to build it. Seeking a way out of the Hindmarsh Island contract, Premier Brown hired Samuel Jacobs [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], to carry out an investigation into the legal responsibilities of the contract.

Shortly before the 1993 elections the Labor government had instructed archaeologist, Dr Neil Draper, to survey Hindmarsh Island and the mainland foreshore for Aboriginal sites. Justice Jacobs, unaware of Draper’s survey, finished his report in early 1994, concluding there was no way out of building the bridge without significant financial liabilities. On 29 April 1994, Draper presented his report to the new Liberal government. The report mentioned that the area had spiritual significance to Aboriginal women, identified a number of significant sites and argued that they should be protected under the [[Aboriginal Heritage Act 1988|State Aboriginal Heritage Act]]. On 3 May the State Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Dr [[Michael Armitage (politician)|Michael Armitage]], now used his powers under the act to authorise damage to the identified sites if required for the bridge to proceed. Work recommenced and a number of protestors were arrested. It has since been pointed out that Justice Jacobs and the government had missed an opportunity to cancel the bridge contract. They had overlooked that Aboriginal Heritage legislation overrides all contractual obligations.

==Opposition==
Many people, including a majority of the islands inhabitants, variously opposed the government funding of a project for the benefit of private developers, the urbanisation of Hindmarsh Island and/or the effects it would have on the natural environment had also voiced their opposition. Initiating legal action in April 1994 they applied to the [[Government of Australia|Federal government]] for an order prohibiting construction.

On 12 May, shortly before construction began, at the request of the Ngarrindjeri, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, [[Robert Tickner]] issued an emergency declaration blocking work on the bridge, and then appointed a lawyer, Professor Cheryl Saunders [[Order of Australia|OA]], to report on the significant Aboriginal sites. Saunders consulted with a range of interested parties, including a group of [[Ngarrindjeri]] women who claimed Hindmarsh Island was sacred to them as a fertility site, and for other reasons that could not be publicly revealed. An anthropologist, Dr Dean Fergie, prepared an assessment of the women's claims, which was then submitted to Saunders. As a part of this process some of these cultural secrets were written down and sealed in two envelopes marked ''Confidential: to be read by women only'' and forwarded to Tickner with the assessment. On 10 July 1994, Tickner placed a 25-year ban on the bridge construction putting the marina in doubt and bringing the Chapmans close to bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AboriginalLawB/1996/64.html |title=Chronology of the Kumarangk / Hindmarsh Island Affair |author=Clarke, Jennifer }} (1996) 3(84) Aboriginal Law Bulletin 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1995 the Chapmans initiated a legal challenge of the ban in the Federal Court. Although the Judge praised Saunders report and criticized the Chapman’s litigation, the Judge overturned the ban on a [[legal technicality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Chapman v Tickner|court=FCA|num=1068|year=1995|parallelcite=(1995) 55 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 316}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The media had heavily criticized the ban and focused on Tickner issuing it based on the contents of sealed envelopes that he had never read. In fact Saunders’ assessment had stressed that the contents were not needed to reach a decision, as there was enough evidence supporting their contents in the assessment and public domain. In fact, Tickner is on record in the February court case as stating that his decision was not based on the envelopes' contents.

In March, [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow Minister]] for the Environment [[Ian McLachlan]] was forced to resign after tabling some of the secret documents in Parliament misrepresenting how he obtained them and falsely claiming they had not been marked "Confidential". The envelope had been delivered to McLachlan's office in error and despite being clearly marked "Confidential: to be read by women only" had been read, photocopied and circulated among both male and female staff.

In May 1995 the media and politicians aired the claims of five "dissident" Aboriginal women who stated that what had become known as "secret women's business" must have been "fabricated" by the "proponents" because they either had no knowledge of the secrets or did not believe them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-June-1997/gelder.html Promiscuous Sacred Sites: Reflections on Secrecy and Scepticism in the Hindmarsh Island Affair] Australian Humanities Review June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The women’s positions were identified by the Royal Commission as "Dissidents" for those who rejected the secrets and "Proponents" for those supporting them. Literary circles continue to use those designations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret women's business===
[[File:LowerLakes2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the pivotal assertions of "secret women's business" was that the geography of Hindmarsh Island resembled the female reproductive organs. Hindmarsh Island can be seen in the centre-left of the image.]]
The Royal Commission identified at least twelve separate aspects to the claim of "secret women's business" during the course of its inquiry. This knowledge was claimed to be of great antiquity, and passed only to a small number of properly initiated women, hence the ignorance of prior anthropologists to the myth.&lt;ref name=oliviera/&gt; The most prominent aspects of the claims are listed below:
*That the island was regarded as a fertility site, as its shape and that of the surrounding wetlands resembled [[Female reproductive system (human)|female reproductive anatomy]] when viewed from the air. It was also suggested that the Ngarrindjeri name for the island, ''Kumarangk'', was similar to the word for pregnancy, or woman.&lt;ref name=oliviera&gt;{{citation|title=Decolonising Indigenous Rights|author=Adolfo de Oliviera|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2009|pages=80–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*That the island had to remain separate from the mainland – creating a permanent link (such as a bridge) would be "as disastrous as if two bodily organs were connected together".
*That the proposed bridge might interfere with the "meeting of the waters", the mixing of salt and sea water in the Goolwa estuary, which was believed to be crucial for Ngarrindjeri fertility.&lt;ref name=partington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geoffpartington.com/fabrication_of_aboriginal_mythology.html |title=Hindmarsh Island and the Fabrication of Aboriginal Mythology |author=Geoffrey Partington |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309044348/http://www.geoffpartington.com/fabrication_of_aboriginal_mythology.html |archive-date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*That the waters of the Goolwa channel required uninterrupted views of the sky, particularly the [[Pleiades|Seven Sisters]] constellation, which features in several aboriginal [[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreaming stories]]. The existing [[Goolwa Barrages|barrage]]s, built in the 1930s, were claimed to be acceptable because they did not create a barrier between water and sky.&lt;ref name=partington/&gt;
*That the island was a place where aboriginal women went to [[Abortion|abort]] fetuses conceived with white men. This particular practice could not have dated from prior to around 1820, when British [[Whaling|whalers]] began to frequent the area.&lt;ref name=oliviera/&gt;&lt;ref name=partington/&gt;
*Although unrelated to secret women's business, the lower River Murray features prominently in the Ngarrindjeri creation myth. Many of the geographical features of the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] are believed to be remnants of the bodies of creation hero, Ngurunderi, and his wives.&lt;ref name=oliviera/&gt;
*Archaeological evidence suggests that the site was probably used for ritual burials.&lt;ref name=oliviera/&gt;

==Binalong fails==
In 1994, Binalong went into liquidation owing Partnership Pacific $18.5 million with Westpac taking possession of the marina as mortgagee. The marina was at this time valued at up to $1.35 million. Following protracted negotiations, in September 1997 Westpac sold the marina to Kebaro Pty Ltd, a family trust belonging to the Chapmans for $50,000 with a further $1.3 million to follow at a later date. A further assessment of the marina now revised its value to $4.5 million. As part of the transaction, the liquidator of Binalong agreed to assign Binalong's [[Cause of action|causes of action]] to Mr and Mrs Chapman who would then pay a percentage of any damages recovered in court to the liquidators. In regards to the financial losses the Chapmans believed had resulted from the heritage applications, the Chapmans claimed financial losses of $16.58 million based on the difference between what the Chapmans paid Westpac and what they claimed the completed marina would have sold for had the bridge been built prior to 1994. In 2001 this court action failed.&lt;ref name=vondoussa/&gt;

==Royal Commission==
In June 1995, the [[Hindmarsh Island Royal Commission]] was called by the [[Government of South Australia|South Australian government]]. The proponent Ngarrindjeri women were sharply divided. Some believed nothing of the secrets could be revealed for any reason, while others argued that some cultural rules had to be broken in order to protect the area. 23 of the proponent Ngarrindjeri women withdrew from the Royal Commission, rejecting an inquiry into people's spiritual beliefs as unlawful. Those that did attend refused to testify and heckled from the gallery or were otherwise generally disruptive. The 12 dissident women (and one man) by contrast were well behaved.

The terms of reference for the Commission implied that the contents of the envelopes were central to the Ministers decision to implement the 25-year ban. The Commission sought clarification from Premier Brown who confirmed the contents were not central. However, the counsel for the dissidents continued to emphasize the importance of knowing what the contents stated.

Chief spokesperson for the dissident women, Dorothy Wilson testified to the Royal Commission how she first heard about the "secret women's business" at a meeting called by the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee. She initially believed the story as Dr. Doreen Kartinyeri was in a position to have secrets passed to her by the female elders. Following the meeting the women went to the local Heritage Committee where the men were. One of the men later pointed to an aerial map of Hindmarsh Island hanging on the wall and commented that it looked like "female privates". As a map of the island along with the same claim was in the secret envelope, Wilson had second thoughts ''It just doesn’t add up to being secret women’s business if the men actually told us. If our old women didn’t know about it, well then why did the men tell us about it? I thought it must be a load of nonsense.''  The premise was that a man should not know what Hindmarsh Island looked like. Kartinyeri later responded that the man shouldn't have said that, because he was a man but that ''pointing at an aerial map that's been surveyed'' does not imply that the claim itself was fabricated.

None of the dissident women were able to take their claims of fabrication further than their own lack of knowledge of the beliefs. Several admitted that they had no knowledge of any Ngarrindjerri culture or traditions at all. Some admitted that it was not unreasonable for only a limited number of women to be privy to traditional secrets. One took the position that they saw no point in living in the past even if the claims were true. The women all identified themselves as Christians and it has been suggested some saw [[Dreamtime|The Dreamtime]] as incompatible with their own beliefs, was a [[Paganism|Pagan]] belief and as such, wrong.&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{cite news |title= Secret Women's Business |work= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Radio]] |url= http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/natint/stories/s851913.htm |accessdate=19 January 2010 |date= 11 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been shown before the Commission that no anthropological work regarding the Ngarrindjeri, specifically [[Ronald Berndt]]’s authoritative book ''A World That Was,''  mentioned the existence of a secret life for Ngarrindjeri women. Cultural geographer Dr Jane Jacobs argued that these publications needed to be seen as a product of their times. In the case of Berndt, we are assuming a male anthropologist walking into an Aboriginal community in the 1940s got the truth. His enquiries were likely not directed towards secrets held by female members of the tribe. Connie Roberts, who was born in 1919 and was one of the elders who had passed the "women’s business" on to Doreen Kartinyeri, was asked about talking about such things with an anthropologist: ''You can't. You're not supposed to talk about things like that. My parents told me, only the old people used to tell certain people.''&lt;ref&gt;It is a common practice for the elders of Indigenous communities to pass on secrets only to members deemed "worthy". One of the "dissidents" testified before the commission that when growing up she did not believe any sacred tribal secrets still existed as she knew of none. In middle age she was told a few secrets and was surprised to find that her husband had already been told them as a boy but could not speak of them in her presence until she had also been told. She also admitted being told by the elders she was not yet ready to receive more.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, without knowing what was in the envelopes, the Royal Commission found that the idea of Hindmarsh Island as being significant to the Ngarrindjerri women had come about at the meeting of the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee. Despite evidence that mention of the island as a fertility site had been mentioned in 1967, predating the meeting, the Royal Commission found that the secret women's business was a fabrication and [[hoax]].&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt;

Specifically, the Royal Commission based its finding on five points. The way the secrets were revealed, at the last minute then progressively was suspicious. The lack of mention of the secrets in the anthropological record. The Seven Sisters Dreaming story belonged to the western Aborigines and was never part of the Ngarrindjerri Dreaming. The testimony given by dissidents Dorothy Wilson and Doug Milera supported fabrication and lastly, that the secret women's business was irrational because the barrages were a more intrusive barrier than a bridge could be.&lt;ref name="Simons2"&gt;{{cite book |first=Margaret |last=Simons |author-link=Margaret Simons |title=''The Meeting of the Waters: The Hindmarsh Island Affair'' |publisher=[[Headline Publishing Group|Hodder Headline]] |year=2003 |ISBN=0-7336-1348-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage applications==
The first Section 10 application brought by the so-called "proponent women" in 1994 under the ''Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 (CTH)'' succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|1726|1995|litigants=Minister of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v Chapman |date=7 December 1995 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] (Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{url|https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00937|''Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act'' 1984}} (Cth).&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of the Report of Law Professor Cheryl Saunders (1994), Minister Robert Tickner declared a 25-year ban on the building of a bridge. That ban was overturned on a technicality. The veracity of the proponent's women story was not at issue. They had told their story and been believed but the Minister had erred in the manner in which he had dealt with the material.

The Ngarrindjeri brought another application under the federal heritage act in 1995-6. This time Senator [[Rosemary Crowley]] appointed a woman judge, Jane Mathews, to be the reporter and thus the proponent women would be able to include knowledge restricted to women without violating their cultural rules. However, the Mathews Report was not able to run its full course. in 1996 the Howard Liberal government came to power and Minister Herron refused to appoint a woman to receive the report. Then, following the Federal Court judgment in ''Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v Western Australia'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs v Western Australia|court=FCA|num=1509|year=1996|parallelcite=(1997) 149 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathews (1996: 43–6) made it plain that the women could not rely on material that was not being made available to the other parties most closely affected by the application. Rather than have their stories read by a male minister and made available to other parties, the women withdrew their restricted material. They chose not to violate their religious law that women’s knowledge was for women’s eyes only. Although this knowledge was missing, the Mathews Report of June 1996 nonetheless acknowledges that the area of the proposed bridge was of significance.

The dissident Ngarrindjeri women sought a declaration from the High Court that the nomination of Justice Mathews as the reporter was incompatible with her commission as a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. On 6 September 1996, the majority of the court agreed that the appointment of Justice Mathews was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Affairs]]|court=HCA|num=18|year=1996|parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act 1997==

After [[John Howard]]'s [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] [[Government of Australia]] came to power in 1996, it legislated to allow the bridge to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/Library/Pubs/BD/1996-97/97bd050.htm Bills Digest 50 1996–97, Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, Australian Parliamentary Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090700/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/1996-97/97bd050.htm |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HIAct&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004A05158|title=Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act 1997|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ngarrindjeri challenged the legislation in the High Court on the basis that it was discriminatory to declare that the Heritage Protection Act applied to sites everywhere but on Hindmarsh Island, and that such discrimination – essentially on the basis of race – had been disallowed since the Commonwealth was granted the power to make laws with respect to the "Aboriginal race" as a result of the 1967 Referendum.  The High Court decided, controversially, in ''Kartinyeri v Commonwealth'' that the amended s.51(xxvi) of the Constitution did not restrict the Commonwealth parliament to making laws for the ''benefit'' of the "Aboriginal race", and could in fact enact laws to the ''detriment'' of any particular race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=[[Kartinyeri v Commonwealth]]|court=HCA|num=22|year=1998|parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision effectively meant that those people who had believed that they were casting a vote ''against'' the discrimination of Indigenous people in 1967 had in fact merely allowed the Commonwealth to participate in the discrimination against Indigenous people which had been practised by the States throughout their history.&lt;ref name="FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Wik Bill challenged following Hindmarsh decision’, ABC Radio News, 1 April 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial discrimination has been outlawed by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), but the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act of 1997 expressly removed the Hindmarsh Island area from the purview of the Racial Discrimination Act.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | last =  | first =  | date =  | title = When have the discriminatory provisions in the Constitution been used? | work = [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] | url = https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/constitutional-reform-faqs-why-reform-constitution-needed | accessdate = 8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The von Doussa decision==
Justice [[John von Doussa]] of the Federal Court heard from all parties to the dispute in the course of the action brought by the Chapmans. In the summary of his Reasons for Decision, von Doussa stated
&lt;blockquote&gt;
5. This action seeks damages for losses allegedly suffered by Binalong from five respondents. Mr Tickner is sued as the former Minister. Professor [[Cheryl Saunders]] is sued as the person nominated by Mr Tickner under the [[Australian Heritage Protection Act]] to receive representations from interested members of the public and to prepare the report required by the Act concerning the application for protection. Luminis Pty Ltd (Luminis) and Dr [[Deane Fergie]] are sued in respect of their provision of consultancy services to the ALRM including the preparation of a report containing an anthropological evaluation of the significance of secret women's knowledge within Aboriginal tradition to the area where the bridge was to be constructed. The last respondent is the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] which is sued for compensation on the basis that the declaration under the Heritage Protection Act resulted in the acquisition of property belonging to Binalong.{{r|vondoussa}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Doussa found for the respondents. His findings took issue with those of the Royal Commission of 1996 finding that the main bases for the Royal Commission conclusion were not established. In particular, the late emergence of the knowledge did not provide proof of fabrication and is expected in the case of genuine sacred information, lack of recording in the literature was not inconsistent with the material, that it was inappropriate to assert that a particular spiritual belief was irrational, Wilson's testimony was not reliable and Mileras was a personal belief and not evidence of fabrication. Most significantly, the various accounts of the Seven Sisters story given were consistent. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
12. ... the evidence received by the Court on this topic is significantly different to that which was before the Royal Commission. Upon the evidence before this Court I am not satisfied that the restricted women's knowledge was fabricated or that it was not part of genuine Aboriginal tradition.{{r|vondoussa}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the two key independent expert witnesses from the [[South Australian Museum]], Philip Clark, was found by the Federal Court at [373] to have erred in terms of professional objectivity before the Royal Commission when it was discovered that he had been secretly helping the lawyers for the "dissident" Ngarrindjerri women.{{r|vondoussa}} The court found against the developers and dismissed the claims of fabrication.&lt;ref name=vondoussa/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Developers Tom and Wendy Chapman and their son Andrew took defamation action against conservation groups, academics, politicians, media operators, printers and individuals who had spoken out against the Bridge. The Chapmans received court judgements of around $850,000 in their favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|litigants=Chapman v Conservation Council (SA)|court=SASC|num=4|year=2002|parallelcite=(2002) 82 [[South Australian State Reports|SASR]] 44 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Supreme Court]] (SA)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|CCSA}} The bulk of the damages related to claims by the defendants that the Chapmans had used [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP accusations]] to silence them.&lt;ref name=CCSA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsa.asn.au/HIB/latest/Hindmarsh_Isld_def_Parnell.htm |title=Hindmarsh Island Bridge Defamation case |publisher=[[Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices|Environmental Defenders Office (SA) Inc]] |year=2002|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410073855/http://www.ccsa.asn.au/HIB/latest/Hindmarsh_Isld_def_Parnell.htm |archivedate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proving SLAPP accusations in court is almost impossible without an express statement by plaintiffs that they were trying to silence their critics. In the Chapman case the judge rejected the SLAPP accusations, accepted that the injunctions were narrowly directed to specific actions, and found that any silencing of campaigners or the general community was not intended.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the defamation case the defendants relied heavily on the defence of "fair comment upon a matter of public interest" and the "[[Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Lange Defence]]" ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɒ|ŋ|i}} {{respell|LONG|ee}} – the constitutional right to freedom of speech on political matters). However the court found that these defences did not apply because the defendants were motivated by malice which had been proven by the Defendants, being engaged in a "campaign" to stop the bridge, and the "targeting" of the Chapmans. The judgement was of concern to environmental activists because any form of direct action such as non-violent picketing, boycotting, or attempts to coerce changes of policy or behaviour, while not illegal, could be imputed as "malice" in any resulting defamation claim.

As a result of the Chapman defamation actions, the [[Australian Network of Environmental Defenders Offices|Environmental Defenders Office]] has called for the introduction of a "Protection of Public Participation Act" for South Australia.  Based on North American legislation, the proposed Act would ensure that those engaged in non-violent public participation would be protected from threats or suits that infringe free speech.{{r|CCSA}}

In early 2002, [[Peter Sutton (anthropologist)|Peter Sutton]], a former head of Anthropology of the South Australian Museum, who had been unable to take a position on the claims, stated that additional evidence discovered since the von Doussa judgement had changed his view. "I still allow that aspects of these beliefs may have been embellished or given greater weight than before ... but the patterns and matches with earlier materials on some strands makes the overall fabrication theory insupportable."{{r|Simons2}}

In September 2002, redevelopment of the Goolwa wharf, which lay adjacent the Hindmarsh Island bridge, unearthed the remains of an Aboriginal woman and child. The site had been claimed to have been a burial ground by the proponent Ngarrindjeri women during the Royal Commission. However, the [[Alexandrina Council]] decided that as the wharf was South Australia's first inland port, colonial history should take preference over Ngarrindjeri interests and construction went ahead. Legal action was contemplated but after negotiations, the Alexandrina Council formally apologised to the Ngarrindjeri and entered into a Kungun Ngarrindjeri Yunnan ("Listen to Ngarrindjeri Speaking") agreement where the Council acknowledged Ngarrindjeri rights as the traditional owners of the country and their existence as an identifiable group of people with their own laws, customs, beliefs and traditions which must be taken into consideration for any developments within the council area where the Ngarrindjeri may have rights, interests or obligations.&lt;ref name=kny&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Diane Bell|Bell, Diane]]|title=Listen to Ngarrindjeri Women Speaking|date=2008|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=9781876756697|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2010, in a ceremony at the foot of the bridge, the [[Government of South Australia]] endorsed the finding that "secret women's business" was genuine. Ngarrindjeri elders then led a symbolic walk across the bridge. Elders now believe it is acceptable for Ngarrindjeri people to use the bridge to gain access to their land and waters, but culturally and morally still reject the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/06/2946354.htm|title=Ngarrindjeri in symbolic walk across Hindmarsh Island bridge|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/pain-eases-with-apology-over-ngarrindjeri-secret-womens-business/story-e6frg6nf-1225888703016 | first=David | last=Nason | title=Pain eases with apology over Ngarrindjeri secret women's business | date=7 July 2010 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''House vs. God'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[House (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', which premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on April 25, 2006.

==Plot==
Boyd, a young [[faith healer]], is giving a service in a church and "heals" a woman, allowing her to walk. However, when Boyd is leading the congregation in song, he has spasms and collapses.

When House shows up at work, Wilson approaches him and voices his displeasure of not being invited to House's weekly poker game. Meanwhile, Cameron and Foreman are administering tests when Boyd claims to talk to God about Cameron's feud with Foreman. Cameron and Foreman are shocked, but House is skeptical of every claim of divinity. The tests show low sodium and diluted urine. However, when House goes to talk to Boyd, he notices that he has been drinking water from a previously opened bottle, refilled several times an hour.

House meets with Wilson and discusses his patient while Wilson is meeting with a cancer patient named Grace Palmieri. However, Boyd suddenly wakes up and starts wandering the halls, singing ''[[Go Tell It on the Mountain (song)|Go Tell It on the Mountain]].'' Boyd sees Palmieri, senses that she is sick, and lays his hands on her, performing a "healing." Palmieri is shocked, but Chase catches up with Boyd and takes him back to his room. House and his team are discussing Boyd's symptoms when Wilson barges in and tells the group that Palmieri feels better than before, and House suspects that Boyd is talking to Palmieri.

House notices an abnormal growth called [[Tuberous Sclerosis]], and claims that it is what is causing all of Boyd's symptoms. Boyd consents to the tubular sclerosis tests after talking to Wilson. Boyd, who seems to have a strange omniscient mind, convinces House to invite Wilson to his poker game.  Wilson visits House at home and informs him that Palmieri's [[tumor]] has actually shrunk.

House orders Chase to search Palmieri's house while House, Wilson, and some unnamed people are playing poker. Chase finds clothes that would suggest that Palmieri has a boyfriend, and gets very concerned after he hears noises outside the door. Via phone, House assures Chase that the boyfriend will not come home, while glaring at Wilson across the poker table. House reasoned that Boyd must have learned of the poker game from Palmieri, and Palmieri from Wilson. House then accuses Wilson of having slept with Palmieri and moved in with her.  Wilson, after demanding House tell the rest of the poker party that his name is not Wilson, storms out. They have a short, angry conversation outside.

Back at the hospital, Boyd begins to run a fever. House concludes that the Tuberous Sclerosis cannot be causing this, and that a lumbar puncture is needed. However, Boyd refuses any more of "man's medicine", preferring to leave his life "in God's hands." House believes that Boyd has a [[herpes simplex virus|herpes virus]] that was acquired through sex, and transmitted to Palmieri when he touched her. Boyd refuses to strip to reveal a rash on his lower back until his father, putting faith in science where "teenage boys" are concerned, tells him to do so. The rash is discovered, confirming the scenario that the [[herpes]] [[virus]] [[Oncolytic herpes virus|attacked]] Palmieri's tumor, making it go into temporary remission.

'''Jožef Meneder''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јожеф Менедер}}, {{lang-hu|Meneder József}}; 1974 – 3 June 1993) was [[Serbia]]n-[[FR Yugoslavia]]n [[mass murderer]] of [[Hungarians in Serbia|Hungarian]] origin.&lt;ref name="Minorities"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/serbiandigest/91/t91-3.htm | title=Minorities in the Army - The Hungarian Syndrome | publisher=[[Vreme]] |first1=Mirko|last1=Mlakar |first2=Filip|last2=Svarm |date=21 June 1993 | accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 June 1993, while serving as a private in the [[Serbia and Montenegro Military Forces|Army of FR Yugoslavia]] in the city of [[Vranje]], Meneder opened fire with an [[automatic rifle]], killing seven and wounding four fellow soldiers, before taking his own life.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/283602473.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun%2004,%201993&amp;author=Chicago%20Tribune%20wires.&amp;pub=Chicago%20Tribune%20(pre-1997%20Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Rampaging%20Yugoslav%20soldier%20guns%20down%208,%20kills%20himself | title=Rampaging Yugoslav soldier guns down 8, kills himself | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=4 June 1993 | accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meneder was kept in confinement of the military barracks of the South Morava brigade because of a barracks brawl. On 3 June 1993, just after the midnight, he managed to escape the cell, attacking the guard with an ax. He took an [[automatic rifle]] from the injured guard and opened a fire on the group of sleeping soldiers. He killed six men on the spot (one [[staff sergeant]] and five privates). One more later died as a result of their wounds. After that, he committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Eight-Soldiers-Die-in-Barracks-Shooting-With-PM-Yugoslavia-Bjt/id-126f48851b99cafda460e626cda0ceee | title=EIGHT SOLDIERS DIE IN BARRACKS SHOOTING WITH PM-YUGOSLAVIA, BJT | publisher=The Associated Press | date=3 June 1993 | accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[military police]] investigation found on his left arm a [[tattoo]] with a date "3 June 1993" and [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[symbol]]s in his home.

In later [[Assyria]]n mythology he was associated with ''kuliltu'', "Fish-Woman", and statues of them were apparently located in the [[Nabu|Nabû]] temple in [[Nimrud]], ancient Kalhu, as referenced on a contemporary administrative text.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = [https://books.google.com/books?id=7lK6l7oF_ccC&amp;dq=potts+Companion+to+the+Archaeology+of+the+Ancient+Near+East&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East] | author = D.

==Ritual uses==

He had the head, arms and torso of a human and the lower body and tail of a fish and was portrayed in sculptures found in palaces and on [[kudurru]]s. With a bitumen smeared clay figurine, he seems to have found special purpose attracting prosperity and divine benevolence to households, as his icon was inscribed ''ri-da hi-ṣib'' KUR''-i er-ba taš-mu u ma-ga-ru'', "come down abundance of the mountain, enter intercession and compliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = [https://books.google.com/books?id=xYX64ZkwkMIC&amp;dq=Wiggermann+Mesopotamian+Protective+Spirits&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts ] | author = F.

He appears in Mesopotamian iconography from the Old Babylonian period onward. The [[Agum II#Agum-Kakrime Inscription|Agum-Kakrime Inscription]] places his apotropaic icon on the gate of the ''[[KÁ (gate Sumerogram)|ká]]-su-lim-[[ma (cuneiform)|ma]]'', the chamber of Marduk and his divine consort [[Zarpanitu|Zarpanītu]]. He was one of the eleven monstrous spawn of [[Tiamat|Tiāmat]] in the Epic of Creation, [[Enûma Eliš]]. He is one of the demons listed in tablet VIII of the [[Šurpu]] incantation series, the ritual to counter a curse of unknown origin. He also features in a hymn to Marduk and the gods of the [[Esagila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = [https://books.google.com/books?id=HQZM5Q3eKAQC&amp;dq=Oshima+Babylonian+Prayers+to+Marduk&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Babylonian Prayers to Marduk] | author = Takayoshi Oshima | publisher = Mohr Siebeck | year = 2011 | pages = 67–68 &lt;!-- Pages were unavailable in the preview 12 Jul 2012, may be available later --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His depiction in Assyrian reliefs is limited to a marine scene in [[Sargon II]]'s palace at [[Khorsabad]], ancient Dur-Šarru-kên, a small relief at [[Tell Halaf]] and on an ornamental brass ring found at Har Sena'im, an [[Ituraea]]n cult site on the southern slopes of Mount [[Hermon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = [https://books.google.com/books?id=-cRrGQ8bIAkC&amp;dq=Myers+Ituraeans+and+the+Roman+Near+East&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Ituraeans and the Roman Near East: Reassessing the Sources] | author = E.

Limmud events have been held in Australia (Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth), China (Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai), India and New Zealand.

===Limmud Oz===
A delegation from Sydney, Australia came to Limmud's conference in 1996.  This led to a Limmud Oz group being formed which launched its first activity in 1999 in Sydney. Later they went into an alternative years format with a biennial gathering in Melbourne.  Through a joint venture with Partnership 2000 and Keren Hayesod Australia they have been the impetus for the launch in 2009 of the Limmud Arava programme which replicates the UK relationship with the Northern Galil.

In June 2012, Limmud Oz announced that the following pro-[[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] groups would not be allowed to participate: "Vivienne Porzsolt, a spokeswoman for Jews Against the Occupation, who was detained in Israel last year en route to the flotilla to Gaza; Avigail Abarbanel, the editor of Beyond Tribal Loyalties, who renounced her Israeli citizenship in 2001; and Peter Slezak, a co-founder of the far-left advocacy group Independent Australian Jewish Voices." In addition, they are allowing "the president of the Australian Palestinian Advocacy Network, a representative of the Islamic Council of Victoria and a Palestinian academic."&lt;ref name="Far left"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/australian-jewish-conference-cancels-far-left-speakers-renewing-controversy-1.434518 | title=Australian Jewish conference cancels far-left speakers, renewing controversy | work=[[Haaretz]] | date=6 May 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Goldberg, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limmud in Israel===
Limmud in the Galil started through the connection between the British Jewish community and its Partnership 2000 community in the Northern Galil. The first conference was held in 2001. Limmud FSU (for Russian speakers) held its first conference in [[Ashkelon]] in 2007, followed by conferences in Jerusalem starting in 2008.  Limmud Arava, commencing in 2009, was based on the Galil P2k model and came from the Australian P2k link. Limmud Negev and Limmud Modiin, starting in 2009 and 2010, have been developed in conjunction with Melitz and the local communities.

Limmud Modiin held its first event in June 2010.&lt;ref name="Modiin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/the-spirit-of-limmud-comes-to-modiin/ | title=The Spirit of Limmud Comes to Modiin | publisher=eJewish Philanthropy | work=Inside Israel | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Bergman, Michal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limmud Jerusalem held an event on 10 May 2012.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/68044/limmud-goes-jerusalem | title=Limmud goes to Jerusalem | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=24 May 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Jeffay, Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limmud in Western Europe ==

'''Austria:''' Limmud Wien is an annual and growing tradition in Austria.

'''Belgium:'''  In Belgium, an annual Conference called HowDoYouJew? has run since 2014, which attracts 600+ participants.

'''France:'''  Limmud France (Limoud)&lt;ref name="Rosemarine"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/64763/sarkozy-shocks-french-limmud | title=Sarkozy shocks French Limmud | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=8 March 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Rosemarine, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; has held an annual gathering in Paris each November and smaller day events in Lyon and in Paris.

'''Finland:''' In 2016, Limud Helsinki was held for the first time.

'''Germany:''' Sophie Mahlo, Toby Axelrod and others have organised annual multi-day Limmud festivals since 2008 near Berlin, and they are now helping local teams run one-day events in other cities, including Munich, Cologne/NRW and Frankfurt.

'''Italy:''' Limmud Italia has been held in Florence since 2014 and continues to grow in size year after year.

'''Netherlands:''' There had been growing numbers coming from the Netherlands to the Limmud conference in the UK such that in 1998 they decided to have a day event in Amsterdam. This was run with the help of the Jewish Welfare Board and was hosted for a number of years.  Since 2007 it has been run strictly as a volunteer-run event. In 2010, Limmoed NL ran from Sunday evening to Monday during a holiday-weekend.

'''Spain:'''Limud Barcelona  held its first event in 2014 organised by a team of over 20 volunteers with nearly 200 participants.

'''Sweden:''' Educators from the Hillel school in Stockholm have been coming since the 1980s to Limmud.  Rabbi Morton Narrowe, then Chief Rabbi of Stockholm, led a larger group in the early 1990s. In 1994 the community dovetailed a tour with Debbie Friedman and the Kelmans with Limmud in the UK.  However it was not until 2008 that Limmud Stockholm launched its first activity.

In Lund, a University town in Southern Sweden, a Limmud Lund launched its first activity in March 2012 ("LundaLimmud"). This evolved into Oresundslimmud, which also included the greater region of Copenhagen and Malmo.

'''Switzerland:''' As they decided to pay presenters, they ran a Limmud inspired activity called Yom Iyun in Basle and in more recent years in Zurich.

''[[Doctor Who]]'' is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The show has been a large influence in the media since its inception in 1963. Along with the [[List of Doctor Who episodes (2005–present)|regular series]], special Christmas episodes were also broadcast every year between 2005, the year of the programme's revival, and 2017. "[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]" (2017) marked the final special episode created for Christmas, after the traditional special episode is set to be moved to New Year's Day in 2019.&lt;ref name="NewYearsSpecial2019"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=doctor-who-festive-special-to-air-on-new-years-day|title=Doctor Who festive special to air on New Year's Day|website=Doctor Who TV|date=14 November 2018|accessdate=14 November 2018|first=Christel|last=Dee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==
===Classic era===
During the first run of the programme (1963 to 1989), while not a Christmas special, one episode aired on Christmas Day: "[[The Daleks' Master Plan#The Christmas episode|The Feast of Steven]]", the seventh episode of the twelve-part serial ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which aired on 25 December 1965. The episode, currently [[Doctor Who missing episodes|missing]] from the BBC archive, was a comic interlude in the style of a [[pantomime]], in the middle of an otherwise epic adventure.&lt;ref name="bbcguide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/daleksmasterplan/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who: The Classic Series — The Daleks' Masterplan |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |last2=Day |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Day |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |authorlink3=Keith Topping |last4=Howe |first4=David J. |authorlink4=David J.

Also while not dedicated New Year's specials, three episodes aired on New Year Day during the first run of the programme: "Volcano", the eighth episode of the twelve-part serial ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', the first episode of the four-part serial ''[[Day of the Daleks]]'', and the first episode of the four-part serial ''[[The Face of Evil]]'', each of which aired on New Year's Day in 1966, 1972 and 1977 respectively.

| ShortSummary    = On the Ood-Sphere in 4226, the [[Ood]] warn the Doctor that the Master has returned, heralding "the end of time". On Earth, a cult of women resurrect the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]], but [[Lucy Saxon]] sabotages the ceremony, causing the Master to be brought back with incredible strength but constant hunger. Arriving back on Earth on Christmas Eve, the Doctor encounters [[Wilfred Mott]]. The Doctor finds the Master at wastelands outside London, and learns that the Master has been suffering from hearing the sound of drums. The Master is taken by armed troops and placed in custody of Joshua Naismith. Naismith has recovered a broken alien "Immortality Gate" and wants the Master to fix its programming. The Doctor regroups with Wilfred; a woman in white warns Wilfred to arm himself to before departing. At Naismith's mansion, the Doctor and Wilfred meet two [[Vinvocci]] disguised as humans, who assert the Gate is a harmless medical device from their homeworld. The Master activates the Gate, which he has reprogrammed to replace all of humankind's DNA with his own; only Wilfred and Donna are unchanged, and Donna remembers the Doctor. Elsewhere, the Lord President of the Time Lords asserts their plan can continue, and that the Time Lords will return.

The Lord President and an ensemble of Time Lords appear in Naismith's mansion. The Doctor and the Vinvocci bring the ship to land, the Doctor jumps from it. The Doctor debates between shooting the Master or the Lord President. The Doctor spots the same woman in white Wilfred had seen, who silently communicates to him. The Doctor fires the gun at the whitepoint star, shattering it. As Gallifrey is pulled back, the Lord President, [[Rassilon]], attempts to kill the Doctor, but the Master intervenes, and humanity is restored as Gallifrey returns. The Doctor finds Wilfred is now trapped in one of the Gate's control rooms that is about to be flooded by radiation. The Doctor sacrifices himself, and absorbs the radiation, but knows that his body will soon [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]. After returning Wilfred, the Doctor visits past companions and acquaintances. Inside his TARDIS, the Doctor sets the TARDIS in flight before regenerating into the [[Eleventh Doctor|new Doctor]].

God is infinite, God is everywhere, God created the universe-that's an interesting one. There's no such thing as creating the universe or causing the universe to come into existence, as the universe is the ground of all causation! If there was a God, He would have to consist of some material substance and He'd have to live somewhere. Therefore, existence always existed, even in the context you just gave.

The word '''luz''' in Hebrew (Hebrew: 'לוז') means nut or almond.&lt;ref&gt;The mystical bone of resurrection, Shapiro R., 1987, Department of Radiology, University of Miami School of Medicine, accessed 5 April 2014 http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148%2Fradiology.163.3.718#comments&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this it became associated with the small bone at the top of the [[spinal column]] (the [[ first cervical vertebra, C1 or the Atlas]]) or the [[coccyx]], the small bone at the base of the spinal column, depending on the tradition.

[[Jew]]ish traditions teach that this is the bone from which the body will be rebuilt at the time of [[resurrection]], and share the idea that this bone does not decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sefer Ta'amei Haminhagim|location=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
There is an [[aggadah]] (legend) in the [[midrash]] that the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] asked how man would be revived in the world to come, and Rabbi Joshua Ben Hananiah replied that it would be "From Luz, in the back-bone." "Prove this to me," said Hadrian. Then the Rabbi took Luz, a small bone of the spine, and immersed it in water, but it was not softened; he put it into the fire, but it was not consumed; he put it into a mill, but it could not be pounded; he placed it upon an anvil and struck it with a hammer, but the anvil split and the hammer was broken. ([[Ecclesiastes Rabbah]] xii / [[Genesis Rabbah]] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/hl/hl92.htm xviii]).

==Biblical==

The luz bone narrative can be linked directly to the human-divine encounter in Ezekiel ch. 37 which alludes to the time of the return of the Jewish People to their land after a long exile. The valley of dry bones, that is, the exile or in a metaphorical sense, human constituent, encounters the immortal spirit of God in Eretz Israel, the land of the living, in contrast to this valley.

[[File:Trajan Divi Nerva.jpg|thumb|right|Roman aureus struck under Trajan, c. 115 AD. The reverse commemorates both Trajan's natural father, Marcus Ulpius Traianus (right), and his adoptive father, the Deified Nerva (left).]]

'''Marcus Ulpius Traianus Maior''' (c. 29 AD &amp;ndash; before 98 AD; ''[[Latin]]'': ''Maior'', "the elder") was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] senator who lived in the 1st century. He was father to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]].

==Family==
Traianus belonged to the ''[[Ulpia (gens)|gens Ulpia]]'', originating from the [[Umbria]]n City of [[Tuder]], and was born and raised in the city of [[Italica]] (modern [[Santiponce]], near [[Seville]], [[Spain]]) in the Roman Province of [[Hispania Baetica]].&lt;ref name=stro40&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strobel|first1=Karl|title=Kaiser Traian|date=2010|publisher=Friedrich Pustet|location=Regensburg|isbn=9783791721729|page=40|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ulpii lived there from 206 BC, when the town was founded by [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]], resettling wounded and invalid veterans of the wars against Carthage.&lt;ref name=stro40/&gt; The Ulpii, like the [[Aelia (gens)|Aelii]] and the Traii belonged to the leading [[Hispania|Hispano-Roman]] families of the city.&lt;ref name=stro40/&gt; From the latter family came a branch of the ancestors of Traianus, which intermarried with the Ulpii, originating the ''[[cognomen]]'' Traianus.&lt;ref name=stro40/&gt; Since the father of Traianus joined the ranks of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] in Rome, it is very likely that his grandfather had already belonged to the Roman Senate.&lt;ref name=stro40/&gt; His mother's origin is unknown. His sister [[Ulpia (grandmother of Hadrian)|Ulpia]] would be the mother of praetor [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer]] (father of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Hadrian]]). Traianus married a Roman noblewoman called [[Marcia (mother of Trajan)|Marcia]].&lt;ref name=stro41/&gt; She was the elder sister of [[Marcia Furnilla]], the second wife of future Emperor [[Titus]], and consequently was in a position to help the career of her husband.&lt;ref name=stro41&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strobel|first1=Karl|title=Kaiser Traian|date=2010|publisher=Friedrich Pustet|location=Regensburg|isbn=9783791721729|page=41|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, a daughter called [[Ulpia Marciana]] and a son, the future Roman Emperor [[Trajan]].&lt;ref name=stro41/&gt; He was the maternal grandfather to [[Salonina Matidia]]; a maternal uncle to praetor [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer]] and a paternal great-uncle to [[Hadrian]].

==Career==
Traianus was possibly a senator by the reign of [[Claudius]].&lt;ref name=stro41/&gt; Before 67 AD, Traianus might have commanded a legion under the Roman General [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]]. Under [[Vespasian]] (who was the Roman Governor of [[Judea]]), Traianus commanded the ''[[Legio X Fretensis|Legio X ''Fretensis'']]'' during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] between 67-68 AD. During this time he came into favour with the future emperor.

As a result of his military successes, Vespasian awarded Traianus the [[Roman governor|governor]]ship of an unknown Roman [[Roman province|province]] and a [[Roman consul|suffect consulship]]. Paul Gallivan dated M. Ulpius Traianus the Elder to 70 based on his arrangement of the fragments of tablet E of the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/638472 "The Fasti for A. D. 70-96"], ''[[Classical Quarterly]]'', 31 (1981), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; however, subsequent recovery of fragments allowed Ladislav Vidman to date Ulpius Traianus' tenure to September–October 72.&lt;ref&gt;Ladislaus Vidman, ed., ''Fasti Ostienses'', Second edition (Prague: Academia, 1982), pp. 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed governor of Cappadocia-Galatia (70/71 AD). He then served as governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] in 73/74 AD, followed by a term as proconsul of [[Roman Asia]] in 79/80 AD. At an unspecified time he served as Governor of [[Hispania Baetica]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Eck, "Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139", ''Chiron'', '''12''' (1982), pp. 281-362&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Syria, Traianus prevented a [[Parthia]]n invasion.

==Legacy==
Traianus lived out his final years in honor and distinction. Indirect evidence suggests that he may have died before his son became emperor in 98 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett (1997), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Around 100 AD his son Trajan founded a colony in [[North Africa]]. This colony became a town and was called ''Colonia Marciana Ulpia Traiana Thamugadi'' (modern [[Timgad]], [[Algeria]]). His son named this town in honour of him, his late wife and his daughter. The colony’s name is also a tribute to his sister and his paternal ancestors. In 113 AD, Traianus was deified by his son, and his [[Aulic titulature|titulature]] reads ''divus Traianus pater''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3834">[[File:Ujigami jinja08s3s4500.jpg|thumb|275 px|Ujigami Shrine in Uji, [[Kyoto Prefecture]]]]
The {{nihongo|'''nagare-zukuri'''|流造|streamlined roof style}} or {{nihongo|'''nagare hafu-zukuri'''|流破風造|streamlined gabled style}} is a traditional [[Shinto shrine]] architectural style characterized by a very asymmetrical [[gable]]d roof ({{nihongo|''kirizuma-yane''|切妻屋根}}) projecting outwards on one of the non-gabled sides, above the main entrance, to form a portico (see photo).&lt;ref name="ko"&gt;[http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=248 History and Typology of Shrine Architecture], Encyclopedia of Shinto accessed on November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the feature which gives it its name. It is the most common style among shrines all over the country. That the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof's ridge (non gabled-side) makes it belong to the {{nihongo|''[[hirairi]]'' or ''hirairi-zukuri''|平入・平入造}} style.

==Design==
Sometimes its basic layout, consisting of an elevated {{nihongo|core|母屋|[[moya (architecture)|moya]]}} partially surrounded by a veranda called ''[[Hisashi (architecture)|hisashi]]'' (all under the same roof), is modified by the addition of a room in front of the entrance.&lt;ref name="ko"/&gt; A ''nagare-zukuri'' ''[[honden]]'' (sanctuary) varies in roof ridge length from 1 to 11 ''[[ken (architecture)|ken]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The ''ken'' is the distance between one supporting pillar and another, a quantity which can vary from shrine to shrine and even within the same building.&lt;/ref&gt; but is never 6 or 8 ''ken''.&lt;ref name="jana"&gt;JAANUS, [http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/n/nagarezukuri.htm Nagare-zukuri], accessed on December 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The most common sizes are 1 and 3 ''ken''. The oldest shrine in Japan, [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]]'s [[Ujigami Shrine]], has a ''honden'' of this type. Its external dimensions are 5x3 ''ken'', but internally it is composed of three {{nihongo|sanctuaries|内殿|naiden}} measuring 1 ''ken'' each.&lt;ref name="jana"/&gt;

==Variation==
===''Ryōnagare-zukuri''===
{{nihongo|''Ryōnagare-zukuri''|両流造|double streamlined roof style}} is an evolution of the ''nagare-zukuri'' in which the roof flows down to form a portico on both non-gabled sides.&lt;ref name=" ko"/&gt; Examples are the ''honden'' at [[Itsukushima Shrine]] and that at Matsuo Taisha in [[Kyoto]].

===''Kasuga-zukuri'' and ''nagare-zukuri''===
[[File:Udamikumari Shr Kami detail.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[honden]]'' at [[Uda Mikumari Shrine]] Kami-gū is made of 3 joined ''Kasuga-zukuri'' units]]While superficially completely different, the ''nagare-zukuri'' style actually shares an ancestry with the second most popular style in Japan, the ''[[kasuga-zukuri]]''.&lt;ref name="NKS"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nihon Kenchiku-shi|editor=Fujita Masaya, Koga Shūsaku|publisher=Shōwa-dō|date=April 10, 1990|edition=September 30, 2008|isbn=4-8122-9805-9|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two for example share pillars set over a double-cross-shaped foundation and a roof which extends over the main entrance, covering a veranda. (The ''Kasuga-zukuri'' is the only ''[[tsumairi]]'' style to possess this last feature.) The foundation's configuration is typical not of permanent, but of temporary shrines, built to be periodically moved. This shows that, for example, both the ''nagare-zukuri'' [[Kamo Shrine]] and Kasuga Taisha used to be dedicated to a mountain cult, and that they had to be moved to follow the movements of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="NKS"/&gt; 

The styles also share a veranda in front of the main entrance, which makes it likely they both evolved from a simple gabled roof.

May 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a Bachelor of Arts degree (magna cum laude) from [[Pembroke College (Brown University)]]&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Nancy Tuber to Be Wed June 29|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was elected into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;  In 1958, she married [[C. Peter R. Gossels]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gossels|first=C. Peter R.|title=Who's Who|year=2001|publisher=Marquis|pages=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have three children: Lisa R. Gossels, who was honored by the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2001 which awarded her an Emmy for her film, ''The Children of Chabannes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Children of Chabannes|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt020831|accessdate=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy D. Gossels, a casting director, film producer and teacher; and Daniel J. Gossels, an investment banker.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

==Artistic career==
Gossels worked at ''The Atlantic Monthly'' from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref name="Harvard Alumni Report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Harvard Class of 1952: 10th Anniversary Report|year=1962|publisher=Harvard University|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gossels subsequently served as associate editor of ''Child Life Magazine'' from 1958 to 1960&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; and as a reporter and columnist for the ''Cochituate/Wayland/Weston Town Crier'' from 1962 to 1964.

Gossels began her artistic career as a painter, but over time found that her painting was becoming more and more sculptural. In 1986, Gossels and Brenda Zaltas exchanged ideas about designing outdoor sculptures from found metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Myrna Chandler|title=The Art of Menorot|newspaper=Home for the Holidays|date=November 12, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that the metal shapes reminded them of menorahs and embarked on a new career. Although they worked separately, they shared a vision and often showed their work together in art exhibits and galleries.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adair|first=Jeff|title=Artist's work getting national exposure|newspaper=The Sudbury Town Crier|date=February 21, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1980s, Gossels has received national attention for her unique "found metal" sculptures, both religious and non-religious, which "have been shown in museums, galleries and selected juried exhibitions" across the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier"/&gt; including the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]], [[Yeshiva University Museum]], the [[National Museum of American Jewish History]] in Philadelphia, Mizel Museum in Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlock|first=Marty|title=Hardware wears well with artwork of Gossels|newspaper=The Wayland-Weston Town Crier|date=December 22, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Flagler Museum]] in Palm Beach.&lt;ref name="Wayland Town Crier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Susan L.|title=Bringing Menorahs to Life|newspaper=The Wayland Town Crier|date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the In the Spirit Studio / Gallery in [[New York City]] featured her aluminum and brass [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] titled, ''Brave New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the Spirit of Chanukah|newspaper=Newsday|date=November 20, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCalls featured Gossels' ''Reflections'', a [[Chanukah]] lamp with bronze mirror back, in its December 1990 article, "The Art of the Menorah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Phyllis|title=The Art of the Menorah|newspaper=McCalls|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the General Assembly of the Council of Jewish Federations, [[Combined Jewish Philanthropies]] included a gift shop that displayed "unique Jewish artworks from throughout the world," including Gossels' menorah works created from industrial metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivin|first=Marcia|title=Federation Meeting in Boston a Memorable Experience|newspaper=Jewish Reporter Metrowest|date=December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Gossels was named a "Copley Artist" by the [[Copley Society of Art]], the oldest art association in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copley Society of Art|url=http://www.copleysociety.org/about/artists/4775/610/nancy_lee_gossels_ca.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305065915/http://www.copleysociety.org/about/artists/4775/610/nancy_lee_gossels_ca.html|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to qualify for this honor, an artist must meet the demanding standards for membership in the society and must have his or her work accepted into five different juried shows produced by the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gossels selected as Copley Artist|newspaper=Wayland/Weston Town Crier|date=February 15, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossels received her art training at the DeCordova Museum School in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]]. She also took classes with Boston area artists Glenda Tall and George Dergalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adair|first=Jeff|title=Artist creates unique menorahs|newspaper=Wayland/Weston Town Crier|date=January 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her works are also represented in a growing number of private collections.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier" /&gt;

==Liturgical work==
In addition to her sculpture, Gossels is a poet. According to an interview in the ''Wayland Town Crier'', designing sculptural pieces made her realize "the connection between the written word and the visual piece."&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier" /&gt;

While serving as a member of the National Commission on Worship of the Jewish reform movement between 1976 and 1980 and as Vice President of [http://www.bethelsudbury.org Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley] in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], Gossels composed and edited (with Joan S. Kaye and her husband, C. Peter R. Gossels) the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book for the Sabbath and Festivals, ''[[Vetaher Libenu]]'', which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vetaher Libenu|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many innovations contained in ''Vetaher Libenu'', Nancy Lee Gossels and Joan S. Kaye revised the traditional Hebrew translation of "Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha’olam," or "Praised are You, Adonai our God, Ruler to the Universe," to "Holy One of Blessing, Your Presence Fills Creation." This invocation is now used by many Reform congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Lawrence A.|title=Blessings and Their Translations {{!}} Current Jewish Liturgies|journal=60 Worship 134| date=March 1986 |pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Sidney|title=Finding a Spiritual Home: How a New Generation of Jews Can Transform the American Synagogue|year=2000|publisher=Jossey-Bass|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MET DP156677.jpg|thumb|Pichhwai at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]

'''Pichhwai''' are devotional pictures found on cloth or  paper which portray [[Lord Krishna]].   They originated in the Deccan,  India, and the villages of Aurangabad and [[Nathdwara]] in [[Rajasthan]] state.  The purpose of Pichhwais, other than artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. 

The word Pichhwai stands for hanging at the back (Sanskrit word “Pichh” means back and “wais” means hanging). Pichhwai paintings are big sized paintings done on cotton cloth using natural colours and are hung behind the idol of Lord Shrinath Ji to depict his ''leelas.'' 
 
Pichhwai have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors. The artists live mostly
in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. Often a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skilful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist. Pichhwai are hung behind Srinathji's idol at Nathdwara temple. 

Some prominent Pichhwai artists are Ghasi Ram Sharma, Gopilal Sharma, [[Narottam Narayan|Narottam Narayan Sharma]], Kanhaiyalal Sharma, [[B. G. Sharma]], Reva Shankar Sharma, Dwarkalal Sharma, Bitthaldas Sharma, Bhuralal Sharma, Raghunandan Sharma, Rajaram Sharma, Ghanshyam Sharma, and Nitin-Nilesh Sharma. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shrinath Ji|last=Julka|first=Anu|publisher=Partridge India|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theartistofnathdwara.org/content/artists.html|title=The Artists of Nathdwara|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 

The Pichhwai in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was a gift of The Friends of Asian Art in 2003 and may be seen in Gallery 243. It is 97 5/8 x 103 1/8 inches (248 x 262 cm).  (Accession #2003.177)

A '''''poustinia''''' ({{lang-ru|пустынь}}) is a small sparsely furnished cabin or room where a person goes to [[Prayer in Christianity|pray]] and [[Fasting#Roman Catholicism|fast]] alone in the presence of [[Trinity|God]]. The word ''poustinia'' has its origin in the [[Russian language|Russian]] word for [[desert]] (пустыня). A person called to live permanently in a poustinia is called a ''poustinik'' (plural: ''poustiniki''). 

== Origins ==

Originally a [[Russian Orthodox]] tradition, the poustinia was introduced to [[Roman Catholic]] spirituality by the Catholic [[social activist]] [[Catherine Doherty]] in her best-selling book ''Poustinia: Christian Spirituality of the East for Western Man''&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Doherty (1975), ''Poustinia''. {{ISBN|0-87793-084-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; first published in 1975.

Although originating with ancient ''[[starets|startsy]]'' (wise Russian elders, sg. ''starets''), Doherty's popular book made the concept of poustinia accessible to modern Western people. In it, she describes the poustinia as "an entry into the desert, a lonely place, a silent place, where one can lift the two arms of prayer and penance to God in atonement, intercession, reparation for one's sins and those of one's brothers.... To go into the poustinia means to listen to God. It means entering into [[kenosis]] &amp;mdash; the emptying of oneself." She promotes the poustinia as a place where anyone &amp;mdash; in any walk of life &amp;mdash; can go for 24 hours of silence, solitude and prayer. Ultimately, however, the poustinik's call is to the desert of one's own heart wherein he dwells with God alone, whether in the workplace or in a solitary locale. 

A poustinia cabin or room generally consists of a bed, a table and chair, a [[crucifix|cross]], and a [[Bible]].

== Poustinik ==
A ''poustinik'' is one who has been called by [[Trinity|God]] to live life in the desert (''poustinia''), alone with God in the service of humanity through prayer, fasting, and availability to those who might call upon him or her. Those called to life in the ''poustinia'' were not uncommon in Russia prior to the suppression of Christianity in the early 20th century.  

In this [[Eastern Christian]] expression of the [[hermit|eremitic vocation]] poustiniks are not solitary but are part of the local community to which they are called. The poustinik is a servant of God and God's people, in communion with the Church. Historically, one who experienced the call 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...to the poustinia had first, after securing the blessing of their [[spiritual director]], to find a village. He generally did this through [[pilgrimage]] and [[prayer]]. Once having discovered the village to which he felt God drawing him, the poustinik went to the elders and asked permission to live there as a poustinik. Permission was happily given, as Russians were glad to have a poustinik praying for them.&lt;ref name=madonnahouse&gt;[http://www.madonnahouse.org/field/ottawa.html Madonna House, Ottawa, Ontario]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poustinik lives alone praying for his own salvation, the salvation of the world, and particularly for the community that God has blessed for him to be a member.  Traditionally,  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The poustinik was also available to the people. When there were special needs, such as a fire to fight or hay to bring in, the poustinik would help. And whenever anyone had something they wanted to talk about&amp;mdash;a question about prayer, a problem, a special joy or sorrow&amp;mdash;they could go to the poustinik.&lt;ref name=madonnahouse/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poustinik is one who listens, and shares the love of Christ with all whom he encounters, as well as a cup of tea or some food; whatever he has he shares, as God has shared all with him.&lt;ref name=madonnahouse/&gt;

==History and origin==
[[File:Rathwa Tribe male playing flute in Gair fair at Kawant, Chhota Udaipur.jpg|thumb|Rathwa Tribe male playing flute in Gair fair at Kawant, Chhota Udaipur]]
The Rathwa derive their name from the word ''rathbistar'', which means an inhabitant of a forest or hilly region. They are said to have immigrated from [[Madhya Pradesh]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and are now found in the [[talukas]] of Chhota Udepur, Kawant, Jetpur-Pavi, Sankheda, Nasvadi and Bodeli in [[Baroda| Chhota Udepur District]] and some Talukas of Panchmahal District.  

==Present circumstances==
The community is endogamous, and consist of a number of exogamous clans, the main ones being the Hamania, Thebaria, Mahania, Kothari Baka and Fadia. They are mostly small- and medium-scale farmers. Many Rathwa are landless agriculture labourers, working on the lands of the [[Patidar]] community. The community follow their own '''folk (Traditional) religion'''. Their customs are similar to other tribal communities of the region such as the [[Patanwadia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They are classified as a scheduled tribe in 3 states: [[Gujarat]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref name=list&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of the riyasat is [[Grand Mufti|Reis-ul-ulema]] (Grand Mufti).{{sfn|Zravkovski|2014|p=230}}

== History ==

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], all Muslims were subjected to the [[shaykh al-Islām]], the supreme religious authority, even though the [[sultan]] maintained the title of [[kaliph]]. After [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian]] occupation of [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1878, general [[Josip Filipović]], who led the occupation, received instructions that Bosnian Muslims should become independent from the shaykh al-Islām in [[Istanbul]]. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities had in plan to make this separation look like a local initiative.

After Filipović failed to do so, [[Gyula Andrássy]], at the time foreign minister of Austria-Hungary, tried to do the same through joint Austro-Hungarian Ministry of Finance, which was responsible for Bosnia and Herzegovina, headed by [[Béni Kállay]], and governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Josip Filipović. Andrássy saw this as a political instrument to strengthen the position of the Austro-Hungarian authorities in newly occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnian Muslims fiercely{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=July 2017}} opposed to this move of the Austrian-Hungarian authorities. The conflict reached its peak when the Ottoman [[Sublime Porte]] named [[Ahmed Şükrü]], a former [[Rumelia]]n [[kazasker]], a new Bosnian-Herzegovinian mufti on 18 June 1880. They based their decision on the [[Novi Pazar Convention]] of 1879 between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, in which, among other things, Austria-Hungary committed to respect Bosnian Muslims' religious freedoms, while Bosnian Muslims received the right to maintain religions connections with shaykh al-Islām in Istanbul.

Bosnian Muslims opposed any separation from Istanbul. Austria-Hungary agreed that shaykh al-Islām could appoint religious officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but only from the local population. They asked from the Austrian-Hungarian ambassador in Istanbul to prevent Şükrü from taking the office of Bosnian-Herzegovinian Mufti. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities saw [[Husein Nur Hafizović]] as chief representative of Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina who was at the time supreme [[sharia]] judge in Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the end, Austrian-Hungarian authorities succeeded in preventing Şükrü from taking the office of mufti and shaykh al-Islām [[Uryanizade Ahmed Esad]] named [[Mustafa Hilmi Hadžiomerović]] a new Bosnian-Herzegovinian mufti. Hadžiomerović was known as suitable person for the Austro-Hungarian authorities. Immediately after the Austrian-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina, he called for Bosnian Muslims to accept military laws of the Austrian-Hungarian occupational administration. On 17 October 1882, emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] issued an imperial decree in which he proclaimed Hadžiomerović a [[Grand Mufti|reis-ul-ulema]] (grand mufti) of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This made Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina independent from the Ottoman religious authority, and nobody from the Ottoman Empire opposed this decision of the Austrian-Hungarian emperor.

After Hadžiomerović was named grand mufti, the institution of Riyasat, as main executive body of the Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established. It was a unique institution in all of the Islamic World. Béni Kállay's efforts of creating an independent Islamic community in Bosnia and Herzegovina were finally realised. The emperor had the right to name grand muftis and heads of [[majlis]]es. Other Islamic religious officials were named by the [[Land Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

'''Salok Mardana''' ({{lang-pa|ਸਲੋਕ ਮਰਦਾਨਾ}}) are two [[Salok]]s, present in Sikh religious text and eternal guru [[Guru Granth Sahib]] on page 553.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
There are three major views regarding authorship of these Shaloks:
* The Shalok was written by Guru Nanak in response to Bhai Mardana, on asking difference between Gurmukh and Manmukh.,&lt;ref&gt;ਇਸ ਸਲੋਕ ਮੈਂ ਸ੍ਰੀ ਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ ਮਰਦਾਨੇ ਕੇ ਪੂਛਨੇ ਸੇ ਤਿਸ ਕੇ ਪ੍ਰਤਿ ਗੁਰਮੁਖਤਾ ਅਰੁ ਮਨਮੁਖਤਾ ਕੀ ਮਦਰਾ ਕਾ ਰੂਪੁ ਬਰਨਨ ਕਰਤੇ ਹੈਂ ਔਰੁ ਦੋ ਪਰਕਾਰ ਕੀ ਮਦਿਰਾ ਮਨਮੁਖੋਂ ਕੀ ਔਰੁ ਗੁਰਮੁਖੋਂ ਕੀ ਕਹੀ ਹੈ॥ ਪ੍ਰਥਮ ਮਨਮੁਖੋਂ ਕੀ ਮਦਿਰਾ ਕਹਤੇ ਹੈਂ॥: Fareedkoti Teeka, Adi Granth&lt;/ref&gt; When he asked about Intoxication of Gurmukh and Manmukh.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Mansukhani|first=Gobind Singh  |date=1982  |title=Indian classical music and Sikh kirtan|url= |location= |publisher=Oxford &amp; IBH |page=92 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The Shalok was written by [[Bhai Mardana]] and sung by Nanak
* The Shalok was written by Guru Nanak and Mardana title is given due to machismo nature of Shalok and have no relation with Bhai Mardana.

Although it is widely believed that these Shalok belong to Guru Nanak, as pen name ''Nanak'' is used in these Saloks.

==Saloks==
First Salok states: ''Shalok Mardana 1: The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the vessel, filled with the wine of sexual desire; the mind is the drunkard. Anger is the cup, filled with emotional attachment, and egotism is the server. Drinking too much in the company of falsehood and greed, one is ruined. So let good deeds be your distillery, and Truth your molasses; in this way, make the most excellent wine of Truth. Make virtue your bread, good conduct the ghee, and modesty the meat to eat. As Gurmukh, these are obtained, O Nanak; partaking of them, one's sins depart. ''

Second Salok states:
Marḏānā 1:The human body is the vat, self-conceit is the wine, and desire is the company of drinking buddies. The cup of the mind's longing is overflowing with falsehood, and the Messenger of Death is the cup-bearer. Drinking in this wine, O Nanak, one takes on countless sins and corruptions. So make spiritual wisdom your molasses, the Praise of God your bread, and the Fear of God the meat you eat. O Nanak, this is the true food; let the True Name be your only Support. ||2||

Third Stanza of Second shalok states: If the human body is the vat, and self-realization is the wine, then a stream of Ambrosial Nectar is produced. Meeting with the Society of the Saints, the cup of the Lord's Love is filled with this Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, one's corruptions and sins are wiped away. ||3||

''royal teacher'' and alternatively spelt ''hsayadaw'', ''sayado'', ''sayāḍo'' or ''sayāḍaw'') is a [[Burmese Buddhist titles|Burmese Buddhist title]] used to reference the senior monk or abbot of a monastery. Some distinguished sayadaws would often be referred to as a ''sayadawgyi'' ({{my|ဆရာတော်ကြီး}}, as a sign of reverence. The terms "sayadaw" and "sayadawgyi" originally corresponded to the senior monks who taught the former Burmese kings.  These sayadaws may be influential teachers of [[Buddhism]] and also important meditation practitioners. They usually are abbots of monasteries or monastery networks with a large number of resident monks and a lay following.

In [[Buddhism in Burma]], several honorific terms exist for Buddhist monks, reflecting their achievements and how many [[vassa]]s they have passed. The most frequently used terms, which are used as prefixes to the monks' [[dharma name]], include:
*"Bhaddanta"
*"Ashin"
*"Shin"
*"U"
*"Upazin"
*"Sayadaw"
*"Sayadawgyi"

A sayadaw may be known by his dharma name ({{my|ဘွဲ့}}), a qualified name, or by the name of his monastery. Thus, venerable [[Mingun Sayadaw]], who served as "Chief Respondent" at the [[Sixth Buddhist council]] in Yangon, could be addressed as:

* Mingun Sayadaw (in reference to his home monastery at [[Mingun]])
* U Vicittasarabhivamsa
* Sayadaw U Vicittasarabhivamsa
* Mingun Sayadaw U Vicittasarabhivamsa
* Tipitaka Sayadaw U Vicittasarabhivamsa
* Tipitakadhara Dhammabhandakarika Sayadaw U Vicittasarabhivamsa, in reference to being the first monk to be awarded the titles "Bearer of the [[Tripiṭaka]]" and "Treasurer of the Dhamma"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2278">'''Shahriyar I''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شهریار) was the sixth ruler of the [[Bavand dynasty]] from 817 to 825. He was the grandson and successor of [[Sharwin I]]. Before Shahriyar became ruler of the Bavand dynasty, he was taken as hostage by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to [[Baghdad]], where Shahriyar stayed for four years until he was allowed to return to [[Tabaristan]].

In 817, Sharwin I died, and Shahriyar succeeded him. After Shahriyar's coronation, the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]], sent him [[robes of honour]], and requested his and the [[Qarinvand]] ruler Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd's aid in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]]. Shahriyar declined the request, while Qarin accepted, and became successful in his campaign against the Byzantines.&lt;ref name="IbnIsfandiyar911"&gt;Ibn Isfandiyar, p. 145-156&lt;/ref&gt; Qarin was then bestowed with many honors by Al-Ma'mun. Shahriyar, jealous of Qarin's fame, began annexing some of the latter's territory. In 817, during the reign of Qarin's son [[Mazyar]], Shahriyar, with the aid of Mazyar's uncle Vinda-Umid, expelled the latter from Tabaristan, and seized all his territories. Shahriyar later died in 825, and was succeeded by his son [[Shapur (Bavandid ruler)|Shapur]].&lt;ref name="IbnIsfandiyar911"/&gt;

'''Sheikh''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|eɪ|k}} {{respell|SHAYK}}, {{IPAc-en|ʃ|iː|k}} {{respell|SHEEK}}; {{lang-ar|شيخ|Shaikh}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šayḫ}}'' {{IPA-ar|ʃæjx|}}, mostly pronounced {{IPA-ar|ʃeːx|}}, [[plural]] {{lang|ar|شيوخ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|šuyūḫ}}'' {{IPA-ar|ʃuju:x|}})—also [[transliteration of Arabic|transliterated]] '''Sheik''', '''Shykh''', '''Shayk''', and '''Shekh''' —is an [[honorific]] title in the [[Arabic]] language. It commonly designates the ruler of a [[tribe]], who inherited the title from his father. "Sheikh" is given to a royal male at birth, whereas the related title "Sheikha" is given to a royal female at birth.

==Etymology and meaning==
[[File:G1895 pg006 KURDISH SHEIKHS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] sheikhs, 1895]]
The word in Arabic stems from a [[Semitic root|triliteral root]] connected with age and aging: {{lang|ar|ش-ي-خ}}, ''shīn-yā'-khā'''. The title carries the meaning leader, [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]], or [[nobility|noble]], especially in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] within the [[Tribes of Arabia]], where ''shaikh'' became a traditional title of a [[Bedouin]] tribal leader in recent centuries. Due to the cultural impact of [[Arab people|Arab]] civilization, and especially through the spread of Islam, the word has gained currency as a religious term or general honorific in many other parts of the world as well, notably in [[Islamic culture|Muslim cultures]] in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Sufi term==
In [[Sufism]], the word ''Shaikh'' is used to represent a ''[[wali]]'' who initiates a particular ''[[tariqa]]'' which leads to [[Muhammad]], although many [[saints]] have this title added before their names out of respect from their followers. One prominent example is Shaikh [[Abdul Qadir Jilani]], who initiated the [[Qadiriyya]] order which relies strongly upon adherence to the fundamentals of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Abun-Nasr, Jamil M. (2007). ''Muslim Communities of Grace: The Sufi Brotherhoods in Islamic Religious Life''. Columbia University Press. p. 94. {{ISBN|978-0-231-14330-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional usage==

===Arabian Peninsula===
[[File:Sheikh Said and Sheikh Juma Al Maktoum.jpg|thumb|Sheikh [[Juma bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Juma Al Maktoum]] (left) and Sheikh [[Saeed bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum|Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum]] (right) of the [[Al Maktoum|Maktoum family]]]]
In the Arabian Peninsula, the title is used for [[royal family|royalty]], such as kings, princes, and princesses. For example, it was the term used in the West to refer to the [[monarch|leaders]] of [[Kuwait]]'s ruling [[House of Al-Sabah|Al-Sabah dynasty]], and in UAE [[Al Nahyan family|Al-Nahyan dynasty]]. The same applies to all the [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] countries. The term is used by almost every male and female (Sheikha) member of all [[Persian Gulf|the Gulf]] royal houses.

===Lebanon===
In Mount Lebanon, the title had the same princely and royal connotation as in the Arabian peninsula until the Ottoman invasion in 1516 since it represented an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] autonomous "[[sui iuris]]" ruler or tribal chief.&lt;ref&gt;A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered, 2001, Kamal Salibi&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an ancient families that holds the title of "[[sui iuris]]" sheikh is the [[Al-Chemor]] family ruling since 1211 CE in [[Koura District|Koura]] and [[Zgharta]] until 1747 CE,&lt;ref&gt;National News Agency - Ministry of Information Lebanese Republic, 2014 http://nna-leb.gov.lb/ar/show-report/371/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book Al-Sheikh Al-Chemor Al-Hakum Al-Akoura Al-Hakum Al-Zawyia, Ignatios Tannous Al-Khoury, Beirut, 1948, pg.123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tārīkh al-ṭāʼifah al-Mārūnīyah (Microform, 1890)". [WorldCat.org].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu Harmoush]] family which ruled the [[Chouf]] region until the [[Battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711 CE. After the Ottoman rule and the implementation of the [[Iltizam]] system, the title gained a [[Nobility|noble]] instead of royal connotation since it was bestowed by a higher authority, in this case the Ottoman appointed [[Emir]] who was nothing more than a [[mültezim]] or tax collector for the [[empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Lebanon's Predicament, 1987, Samir Khalaf&lt;/ref&gt; Some very influential [[Maronite]] families -who had the title bestowed upon them in chronological order- are El Hachem of Akoura (descendants of The [[Hashemite]] Family, since 1523), [[El-Khazen]] (since 1545), Hubaysh of [[Kisrawan]], and  [[Douaihy]] of [[Zgharta]]. Other families who are nowadays addressed or known as "Sheikhs" were not traditionally rulers of provinces, but instead they were high-ranking officials at the service of the [[Emir]] at that time.

===Maghreb===
In the [[Maghreb]], during the [[Almohad]] dynasty, the caliph was also counseled by a body of shaykhs. They represented all the different tribes under their rules, including [[Arabs]], ([[Bedouins]]), [[Andalusians]] and [[Berbers]] and were also responsible for mobilizing their kinsmen in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpjwF--kPL4C&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=almohad%20organization&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;ei=5nEuTcuKDIyKvgOT_7zOCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=almohad%20organization&amp;f=false|title=Africa from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth Century|first1=Djibril Tamsir|last1=Niane|first2=Unesco International Scientific Committee for the Drafting of a General History of|last2=Africa|date=1 January 1984|publisher=UNESCO|access-date=19 February 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Africa===
[[File:Cheikh Tidiane Gaye dirigeant le sermon de Korité 2010.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Senegal]]ese Sheikh Tidiane Gaye giving an Islamic lecture in [[Louga]].]]
In [[West Africa]], sheikh is a common title for those of Royal Bloodlines and Muslim scholars and leaders. Among Islamic communities in [[Senegal]], [[Timbo]], [[Niger]] and [[Gambia]], among other areas, the title is usually spelled as ''Cheikh''.

One of the most notable Royal families of West Africa belongs to Abdul-Rahman ibn Ibrahim Sori, who was a Torodbe Fulani Muslim ruler (Emir) born in 1762 in the city of Timbo, now located in Guinea. His father, Almami Ibrahim Sori consolidated the Islamic confederation of Futa Jallon in 1776, with Timbo as its capital, where Abdul Rahman lived and studied. He was learned in the Islamic sciences and could speak at least 4 different African languages, in addition to Arabic.

Abdul-Rahman ibn Ibrahim Sori Was sold into slavery and became an American citizen in Natchez, Mississippi. His title of Emir was reinstated upon his freedom by United States John Quincy Adams upon his return to Africa, Liberia.

Emir Abdul-Rahman ibn Ibrahim Sori's descendants, Sheik Dr. Artemus Gaye of Monrovia, Liberia and Sheika Karen Chatman of Natchez, Mississippi, maintain their official Royal titles.

===South Asia===
{{main|Sheikh (caste)}}
[[File:Sheikh Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani.jpg|thumb|[[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[Sheikh Syed Abdul Qadir Jilani]], a prominent [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholar.]]
In South Asia it is not an ethnic title but an occupational title{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} generally attributed to Muslim trading families with rarely any Arab lineage. After the advent of Islam in South Asia,  ([[Brahmin]]s, [[Rajput]]s, [[Khatri]]s, [[Kayastha]]s and [[Shudras]]) tribes also converted to Islam and adopted the title. In [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]] the [[Hindu]] [[Brahmins]], [[Kshatriya]], [[Rathores]], [[Bhattis]], [[Chauhans]], [[Rangrez]] and other [[Rajput]] converted by different [[Ismaili]] Pirs to [[Islam]]. [[Ismaili]] [[Pir (Sufism)|Pirs]] gave the new converts of Punjab the [[hereditary]] title of [[Ismaili Shaikh|Shaikh]] as well as the [[Muslims]] who immigrated from Arabia and settled in Punjab adopted this title.

=== Iran ===
From the perspective of Iran (which includes Islamic view, too), the word or title of Sheikh possesses diverse meanings, among the individuals who are aged, wise, scientist; and totally it has been a honorable title who was/is used for the elders/learned (scholars), such as: Sheikh al-Rayees [[Avicenna|Abu Ali Sina]], Sheikh [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid|Mufid]], Sheikh [[Morteza Ansari]], etc. The ones (Islamic scholars) who are from the Islamic prophet Muhammad's offspring/descendants, are called [[Sayyid]]/[[Sayyid|Seyyed]] instead of Sheikh, such as Seyyed [[Ali Khamenei]] and Seyyed [[Ali Sistani]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.porseshkadeh.com/Question/24036/%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA Who/what is Sheikh?] porseshkadeh.com Retrieved 28 Oct 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==For women==
Historically, [[ulema|female scholars]] in [[Islam]] were referred to as ''shaykhah'' (Arabic: {{rtl-lang|ar|شيخة}}) (alt. ''shaykhat''). Notable ''shaykha'' include the 10th-century [[Fakhr-un-Nisa|Shaykhah Fakhr-un-Nisa Shuhdah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaykhah Shuhdah, Fakhr-un-Nisa|url=http://www.haqislam.org/shaykhah-shuhdah/|website=Haq Islam|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 18th-century scholar [[Fatima al-Fudayliya|Al-Shaykha Fatima al-Fudayliyya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Siddiqi|first1=Muhammad Zubayr|title=Hadith Literature Its origin, development and special features: Women Scholars of Hadith|journal=The Islamic Texts Society Cambridge|date=1993|pages=117–123|url=http://www.muslimliga.de/archiv/womenhadith.html|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A daughter or wife or mother of a sheikh is also called a ''shaykhah''. Currently, the term ''shaykhah'' is commonly used for women of ruling families, in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] with the exception of Oman.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[File:Knesset Menorah Shema Inscription.jpg|thumb| ''Shema Yisrael'' at the [[Knesset Menorah]] in [[Jerusalem]]]]
'''''Shema Yisrael''''' (or '''''Sh'ma Yisrael'''''; {{lang-he-n |שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל}}; "Hear, [O] Israel") are the [[Incipit |first two words]] of a section of the [[Torah]], and is the title (better known as '''The Shema''') of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening [[Jewish services |Jewish prayer services]]. The first verse encapsulates the [[Monotheism |monotheistic]] essence of [[Judaism]]: "Hear, O Israel: the [[YHWH |{{LORD}}]] our God, the {{LORD}} is one" ({{Lang-he-n |שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָֽד׃}}), found in {{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|6:4|HE}}. Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the [[prayer]] service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a ''[[mitzvah]]'' (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their [[last words]], and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Bedtime Shema  |website=MyJewishLearning.com
|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/bedtime-shema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Chabad.org
|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3694182/jewish/Why-Say-Shema-at-Bedtime.htm
|title=Why Say Shema at Bedtime? - Didn't we just say it in Maariv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verse is sometimes alternatively translated as "The {{LORD}} is our God; the {{LORD}} is one" or "The {{LORD}} is our God, the {{LORD}} alone." (Biblical Hebrew rarely used a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] in the present tense, so it has to be inferred; in the Shema, the syntax behind this inference is ambiguous.) The word used for "the {{LORD}}" is the [[tetragrammaton]] YHWH.

The term "Shema" is used by extension to refer to the whole part of the daily prayers that commences with ''Shema Yisrael'' and comprises [[Book of Deuteronomy |Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Deuteronomy|6:4–9|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb ||Deuteronomy|11:13–21|HE}}, and [[Book of Numbers |Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Numbers|15:37–41|HE}}. These sections of the Torah are read in the [[weekly Torah portion]]s ''[[Va'etchanan]]'', ''[[Eikev]]'', and ''[[Shlach]]'', respectively.

==History==
Originally, the ''Shema'' consisted of only one verse: {{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|6:4|HE}} (see Talmud [[Sukkah (Talmud) |Sukkah]] 42a and [[Berakhot (Talmud) |Berachot]] 13b). The recitation of the Shema in the liturgy, however, consists of three portions: {{bibleverse ||Deuteronomy|6:4–9|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb ||Deuteronomy|11:13–21|HE}}, and [[Book of Numbers |Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Numbers|15:37–41|HE}}. The three portions are already mentioned in the Mishnah (Berachot 2:2). The three portions relate to central issues of Jewish belief. In the Mishnah (Berakhot 2:5) the reciting of the shema was linked with re-affirming a personal relationship with God's rule. Literally, reciting the shema was stated as "receiving the kingdom of heaven." ["Heaven" is a metaphor for God. The best texts of the Mishnah, Kaufmann and Parma, do not have the addition "yoke" that is found in later printed Mishnahs: "receive the {yoke of the} kingdom of Heaven." The original statement appears to have been "to receive the kingdom of Heaven".]

Additionally, the [[Talmud]] points out that subtle references to the [[Ten Commandments]] can be found in the three portions.  As the Ten Commandments were removed from daily prayer in the [[Mishnaic]] period (70–200 CE), the Shema is seen as an opportunity to commemorate the Ten Commandments.

There are two larger-print letters in the first sentence ('ayin ע and daleth ד) which, when combined, spell "עד".  In [[Hebrew (language) |Hebrew]] this means "witness". The idea thus conveyed is that through the recitation or proclamation of the Shema one is a living witness testifying to the truth of its message. Modern [[Kabbalah |Kabbalistic schools]], namely that of the [[Arizal |Ari]], teach that when one recites the last letter of the word "'ecḥad'" (אחד), meaning "one", he is to intend that he is ready to "die into God".{{Citation needed |date= November 2009}}

==Content==

===''Shema Yisrael''===
[[File:1st paragraph of Shema.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The first paragraph of the Shema seen in a [[Tefillin]] scroll]]
The first, pivotal, words of the Shema are, in the original {{lang-he-n|שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵינוּ יְהוָה אֶחָֽד׃}}, which can be transliterated: ''Sh'ma Yisra'el, [[YHWH]] 'eloheinu, YHWH 'eḥad''.

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] teaches that the [[Tetragrammaton]] (י-ה-ו-ה), [[YHVH]], is the [[ineffability|ineffable]] and actual name of [[God in Judaism|God]], and as such is not read aloud in the Shema but is traditionally replaced with אדני, Adonai ("{{LORD}}"). For that reason, the Shema is recited aloud as:

:''Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Ecḥad'' - "Hear, O Israel: the {{LORD}} is our God, the {{LORD}} is One."

The literal word meanings are roughly as follows:
:''Sh'ma'' — ''listen'', or ''hear and do'' (according to the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum]], ''accept'')
:''Yisrael'' — Israel, in the sense of the people or congregation of Israel
:''Adonai'' — often translated as "{{LORD}}", it is read in place of the [[YHVH]] written in the Hebrew text; Samaritans say Shema, which is Aramaic for "the [Divine] Name" and is the exact equivalent of the Hebrew "ha-Shem", which Rabbinic Jews substitute for "Adonai" in a non-liturgical context such as everyday speech.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
:''Eloheinu'' — the plural 1st person possessive of {{script|Hebr|אֱלֹהִים}} ''Elohim'', meaning “''our God''”.
:''Echad'' — the unified and cardinal number ''one'' {{script|Hebr|אֶחָד}}

This first verse of the Shema relates to the [[monarch|kingship]] of God. The first verse, "Hear, O Israel: the {{LORD}} our God is one {{LORD}}," has ever been regarded as the confession of belief in the One God. Due to the ambiguity of the possible ways to translate the [[Hebrew]] passage, there are several possible renderings:

:"Hear, O Israel! Adonai is our God! Adonai is One!" and,
:"Hear, O Israel! Adonai is our God – Adonai alone."

Many commentaries have been written about the subtle differences between the translations. There is an emphasis on the oneness of God and on the sole worship of God by Israel. There are other translations, though most retain one or the other emphases.

===''Baruch Shem''===

בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד - "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever”

The second line is a rabbinic addition and is recited silently during congregational worship (except on [[Yom Kippur]], when it is recited aloud). It was originally a liturgical response in use in the Temple when the name of God was pronounced and took the form of ''Baruch shem k’vod l’olam'', "Blessed be his glorious name" (Psalm 72:19). However, in time the words ''malchuto'' ("His kingdom") and ''va’ed'' ("for ever and ever") were added. ''Malchuto'' was introduced by the rabbis during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule as a counter to the claim of divine honors by Roman emperors. ''Va’ed'' was introduced at the time of the Second Temple to contrast the view of the ''[[Heresy in Judaism|minim]]'' (heretics) that there is no life after death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oztorah.com/2011/10/baruch-shem-the-2nd-line-of-the-shema-ask-the-rabbi/|title=OzTorah » Blog Archive » Baruch Shem: The 2nd line of the Shema – Ask the Rabbi|website=www.oztorah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''V'ahavta''===
The following verses are commonly referred to as the ''V'ahavta'' according to the first word of the verse immediately following the ''Shema'', or in [[Classical Hebrew]] ''V'ahav'ta'' meaning "and you shall love...". They contain the command to love God with all one's heart, soul, and might ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:5|NKJV}}). The [[Talmud]] emphasizes that you will, at some point, whether you choose to or not, and therefore uses "shall" - future tense - love God.&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"&gt;[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt05.htm The Complete Hebrew Bible (Tanach) based on JPS 1917 Hebrew-English translation] Deuteronomy 6, accessed 29 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Then verse 7 goes on to remind the community to remember all the commandments and to "teach them diligently to your children and speak of them when you sit down and when you walk, when you lie down and when you rise",&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre.org"/&gt; to recite the words of God when retiring or rising; to bind those words "on thy arm and thy head" (classically Jewish oral tradition interprets as ''[[tefillin]]''), and to "inscribe them on the door-posts of your house and on your gates" (referring to ''[[mezuzah]]'').

===''V'haya im shamoa''===
The passage following the ''Shema'' and ''V'ahavta'' relates to the issue of reward and punishment. It contains the promise of reward for serving God with all one's heart, soul, and might (Deut 11:13) and for the fulfillment of the laws. It also contains punishment for transgression. It also contains a repetition of the contents of the first portion -but this time spoken to the second person plural, (Whereas the first portion is directed to the individual Jew, this time it is directed to the whole community, all the Jews).

===''Vayomer''===
The third portion relates to the issue of redemption. Specifically, it contains the law concerning the [[tzitzit]] (Numbers 15:37-41) as a reminder that all laws of God are obeyed, as a warning against following evil inclinations and in remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. For the prophets and rabbis, the exodus from Egypt is [[paradigm]]atic of Jewish faith that God redeems from all forms of foreign domination. It can be found in the portion "Shlach Lecha" in the book of Numbers.

===Summary===
In summary, the content flows from the assertion of the oneness of God's kingship. Thus, in the first portion, there is a command to love God with all one's heart, soul, and might, and to remember and teach these very important words to the children throughout the day. Obeying these commands, says the second portion, will lead to rewards, and disobeying them will lead to punishment. To ensure fulfillment of these key commands, God also commands in the third portion a practical reminder, wearing the ''[[tzitzit]]'', "that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God."

The full content verse by verse, in Hebrew, English transliteration, and English translation, can be found on the jewfaq.org website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/shema.htm|title=Judaism 101: Shema|website=www.jewfaq.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second line quoted, "Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever", was originally a congregational response to the declaration of the Oneness of God; it is therefore often printed in small font and recited in an undertone, as recognition that it is not, itself, a part of the cited Biblical verses. The third section of the Shema ends with Numbers 15:41, but traditional Jews end the recitation of the Shema by reciting the first word of the following blessing, ''Emet'', or "Truth" without interruption.

==Jewish women and the Shema==
{{Main|Women in Judaism}}
In [[Orthodox Judaism]], women are not required to daily recite the Shema (as a command from the Torah),&lt;ref&gt;[Mishnah Berurah, O.C. 106:1 §7]&lt;/ref&gt; as with other time-bound requirements which might impinge on their traditional familial obligations, although they are obligated to pray at least once daily without a specific liturgy requirement, and many fulfill that obligation through prayers like the Shema.

[[Conservative Judaism]] generally regards Jewish women as being obligated to recite the Shema at the same times as men.

[[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] do not regard gender-related traditional [[Halakha|Jewish ritual requirements]] as necessary in modern circumstances, including obligations for men, but not women, to pray specific prayers at specific times. Instead, both genders may fulfill all requirements.

==Accompanying blessings==
The Benedictions preceding and following the ''Shema'' are traditionally credited to the members of the [[Great Assembly]]. They were first instituted in the liturgy of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

According to the Talmud, the reading of the Shema morning and evening fulfils the commandment "You shall meditate therein day and night". As soon as a child begins to speak, his father is directed to teach him the verse "Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob" (Deut. 33:4), and teach him to read the Shema (Talmud, Sukkah 42a). The reciting of the first verse of the Shema is called "the acceptance of the yoke of the kingship of God" (''kabalat ol malchut shamayim'') (Mishnah Berachot 2:5). [[Judah ha-Nasi]], who spent all day involved with his studies and teaching, said just the first verse of the Shema in the morning (Talmud Berachot 13b) "as he passed his hands over his eyes" which appears to be the origin of the Jewish custom to cover the eyes with the right hand whilst reciting the first verse.

The first verse of the Shema is recited aloud, simultaneously by the [[hazzan]] and the congregation, which responds with the rabbinically instituted ''Baruch Shem'' ("Blessed be the Name") in silence before continuing the rest of Shema. Only on [[Yom Kippur]] is this response said aloud. The remainder of the Shema is read in silence. [[Sephardi]]m recite the whole of the Shema aloud, except the ''Baruch Shem''. [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]] also recite the whole of the first paragraph of the Shema aloud.

===Shacharit===
During ''[[Shacharit]]'', there are two blessing before the Shema and one thereafter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mishnah, Berachos 1:4 http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.4/en/Open_Mishnah?lang=bi&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers, two before and one after, are based on the [[Mishnah]] Tractate [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berachos]], Chapter 11, which states: "In the morning one blesses two before and one after," though there is a question in [[Jewish law]] as to whether one recites these blessing ''on'' the Shema, or ''surrounding'' the Shema. The conclusion that has been drawn is that they are to be blessing ''surrounding'' the Shema, because the structure is similar to that of blessings of the [[Torah]], and there is doubt as to whether such blessings would actually ''enhance'' the Shema.&lt;ref&gt;With all your heart: the Shema in Jewish worship, practice and life By Meir Levin, {{ISBN|1-56871-215-4}}, page 207-212&lt;/ref&gt;

The two blessings that are recited before the Shema are [[Yotzer ohr]]'' and [[Ahava Rabbah|Ahava Rabbah/Ahavat Olam]]. The blessing after is known as [[Emet Vayatziv]].

===Maariv===
During ''[[Maariv]]'', there are two blessings before the Shema and two after.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The two before are [[HaMaariv Aravim]] and [[Ahavat Olam]]. The two after are [[Emet V'Emunah]] and [[Hashkiveinu]]. [[Ashkenazi]]m add [[Baruch Hashem L'Olam (Maariv)|Baruch Hashem L'Olam]] outside of Israel on weekdays.

Overall, the three blessings in the morning and four in the evening which accompany the Shema sum to seven, in accordance with the verse in Psalms: "I praise You seven times each day for Your just rules."&lt;ref&gt;Psalms 119:164 http://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.119.164/he/Tanach_with_Ta'amei_Hamikra?lang=bi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bedtime Shema==
Before going to sleep, the first paragraph of the Shema is recited. This is not only a commandment directly given in the Bible (in [[Deuteronomy]] 6:6–7), but is also alluded to from verses such as "Commune with your own heart upon your bed" ([[Psalms]] 4:4).

Some also have the custom to read all three paragraphs, along with a whole list of sections from Psalms, [[Tachanun]], and other prayers. Altogether this is known as the ''K'riat Shema she-al ha-mitah''. According to [[Arizal]], reading this prayer with great concentration is also effective in cleansing one from sin. This is discussed in the [[Tanya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otzar770.com/library/display_page.asp?nPageNumber=23&amp;ilSC=40&amp;nBookId=108&amp;cPartLetter=B|title=[Otzar770 - Book page view]|website=otzar770.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other instances==
The exhortation by the [[Kohen]] ("priest") in calling Israel to arms against an enemy (which does not apply when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is not standing) also includes Shema Yisrael ({{Citation | title = [[Deuteronomy]] | at = 20:3}}; {{Citation | title = Talmud Sotah | at = 42a}}).

According to the Talmud, [[Rabbi Akiva]] patiently endured while his flesh was being torn with iron combs, and died reciting the Shema. He pronounced the last word of the sentence, ''Eḥad'' ("one") with his last breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Talmud Berachot | at = 61b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Since then, it has been traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their [[last words]].

[[Roi Klein]] (d. 2006), a major in the [[Israel Defense Forces |IDF]], said the Shema before jumping on a live [[grenade]] to save his fellow soldiers,&lt;ref name= "Lubotzky"&gt;{{cite book |last= Lubotzky |first= Asael |title= [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon]]|year=2016 |publisher= [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] |isbn=978-1-59264-417-9 |pages= 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the traditional Jewish practice of reciting the Shema when one believes one is going to die.

=== Music ===
[[Arnold Schoenberg]] used it as part of the story to his narrative orchestral work ''[[A Survivor from Warsaw]]'' (1947).

In ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'', a musical based on true events, the main character [[Leo Frank]], wrongly accused of the murder of a child worker at the pencil factory he manages, recites the Shema Yisrael as a vigilante gang kidnap and hang him in the final scenes of the work.

Pop versions have been published by [[Mordechai ben David]] and [[Sarit Hadad]].

In ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]'', Max Cohen and Lenny Meyer can be seen reciting the first three verses of the Shema.

In ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman]]'', [[Anthony Quinn]], as the fictional Pope Kiril, explores the back streets of Rome disguised as a simple priest, and recites the Shema at the bedside of a dying Roman Jew.

Reggae singer [[Matisyahu]] recites the Shema in his songs "Got no water" and "Tel Aviv'n".

[[Yaakov Shwekey]] in his "Shema Yisrael," used the story of Rabbi [[Eliezer Silver]]'s saving Jewish children hidden in Christian monasteries following the Holocaust by reciting the first line of the Shema.

Singer [[Justin Bieber]] says the Shema before each public performance with his manager Scooter Braun, who is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/09/justin-bieber-tween-evang_n_820993.html |title= Justin Bieber: Tween Evangelist? |date=9 February 2011 | work = Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine Unity of the Shema in Hasidic philosophy==
{{See also|Jewish philosophy|Kabbalah|Hasidic philosophy}}

[[Image:Schneur Zalman of Liadi.jpg|thumb|115px|right|[[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] articulated Divine Unity in [[Hasidic philosophy]]]]
The second section of the [[Tanya]] brings the mystical [[panentheism]] of the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]], the [[Baal Shem Tov]], into philosophical explanation. It outlines the Hasidic interpretation of God's Unity in the first two lines of the Shema, based upon their interpretation in [[Kabbalah]]. The emphasis on Divine Omnipresence and [[Divine immanence|immanence]] lies behind Hasidic joy and ''[[devekut]]'', and its stress on transforming the material into spiritual worship. In this internalisation of Kabbalistic ideas, the Hasidic follower seeks to reveal the Unity and hidden holiness in all activities of life.

Medieval, rationalist [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] (exponents of ''Hakirah''–rational "investigation" from first principles in support of Judaism), such as [[Maimonides]], describe Biblical monotheism to mean that there is only one God, and his essence is a unique, simple, infinite Unity. [[Jewish mysticism]] provides a philosophic paradox, by dividing God's Unity into God's essence and [[Emanationism|emanation]]. 
In Kabbalah and especially Hasidism, God's Unity means that there is nothing independent of his essence. The new doctrine in [[Lurianic Kabbalah]] of God's ''[[tzimtzum]]'' ("withdrawal") received different interpretations after [[Isaac Luria]], from the literal to the metaphorical. To Hasidism and [[Schneur Zalman]], it is unthinkable for the "withdrawal" of God that "makes possible" Creation, to be taken literally. The oyxmoron of ''Tzimtzum'' only relates to the [[Ohr|Ohr Ein Sof]] ("Infinite Light"), not the [[Ein Sof]] (Divine essence) itself. God's infinity is revealed in both complementary infinitude (infinite light) and finitude (finite light). The "withdrawal" was only a concealment of the Infinite Light into the essence of God, to allow the latent potentially finite light to emerge after the God limiting ''tzimtzum''. God himself remains unaffected ("For I, the Lord, I have not changed" [[Malachi]] 3:6). His essence was One, alone, before Creation, and still One, alone, after Creation, without any change. As the ''tzimtzum'' only limits God to a concealment, therefore God's Unity remains Omnipresent. In the Baal Shem Tov's interpretation, [[Divine providence (Judaism)|Divine providence]] affects every detail of Creation. The "movement of a leaf in the wind" is part of the unfolding Divine presence, and is a necessary part of the complete ''[[Tikkun olam|Tikkun]]'' (Rectification in Kabbalah). This awareness of the loving Divine purpose and significance of each individual and his [[free will]], awakens mystical love and awe of God.

Schneur Zalman explains that God's divided Unity has two levels, an unlimited level and a limited one, that are both paradoxically true. The main text of medieval Kabbalah, the [[Zohar]], describes the first verse of the Shema ("Hear Israel, the Lord is God, the Lord is One") as the "Upper level Unity", and the second line ("Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever") as the limited "Lower level Unity". Schneur Zalman gives the Chabad explanation of this. In his Kabbalah philosophy, all Creation is dependent on the limited, [[Divine immanence|immanent]], potentially finite, "[[Ohr|Light that Fills all Worlds]]", that each Creation receives continually. All is ''bittul''–nullified to the light, even though in our realm this complete dependence is hidden. From this perspective, of God knowing the Creation on its own terms, Creation exists, but the true essence of anything is only the Divine spark that continuously recreates it from nothing. God is One, as nothing has any independent existence without this continual flow of Divine Will to Create. This is the [[pantheistic]] Lower Level Unity.

In relation to God's essence, Creation affects no change or withdrawal. All Creation takes place "within" God. "There is nothing but God". The ability to create can only come from the infinite Divine essence, represented by the [[Tetragrammaton]] name of God. However, "It is not the essence of the Divine, to create Worlds and sustain them", as this ability is only external to the Infinite essence "outside" God. Creation only derives from God's revelatory antropomorphic "speech" (as in [[Genesis 1]]), and even this is unlike the external speech of Man, as it too remains "within" God. From this upper perspective of God knowing himself on his own terms, the created existence of Creation does not exist, as it is as nothing in relation to Zalman's philosophically constructed concept of God's essence. This [[monistic]] [[acosmism]] is the "Upper Level Unity", as from this perspective, only God exists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/6240/jewish/Shaar-Hayichud-Vehaemunah.htm English translation and commentary on the second section of Tanya: ''Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah-Gate of Unity and Faith''] from Chabad.org.

==In Christianity==
{{see also |Christian views on the Old Covenant}}
The ''Shema'' is one of the [[Quotations from the Hebrew Bible in the New Testament |Old Testament sentences quoted in the New Testament]]. The [[Gospel of Mark |Gospel of]] {{bibleref |Mark|12:29–31|KJV}} mentions that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] considered the opening exhortation of the Shema to be the first of his two [[Great Commandment |greatest commandments]] and linked with a second (based on Leviticus 19:18b): "The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment. And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." In {{bibleref|Luke|10:25-27|}} the Shema is also linked with Leviticus 19:18, only by the questioner, before Jesus' agreement. The verses Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 19:18b both begin with ''ve'ahavta'', "and you shall love". In [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]], it appears that this connection between the two verses was already part of cultural discussion or practice.

Theologians [[Carl Friedrich Keil]] and [[Franz Delitzsch]] noted that "the heart is mentioned first (in Deuteronomy 6:5), as the seat of the emotions generally and of love in particular; then follows the soul (''nephesh'') as the centre of personality in man, to depict the love as pervading the entire self-consciousness; and to this is added, "with all the strength," i.e. of body and soul".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/6.htm Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament] on Deuteronomy 6, accessed 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shema'' has also been incorporated in Christian liturgy, and is discussed in terms of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;See Brian J. Wright, "Deuteronomy 6:4 and the Trinity: How Can Jews and Christians Both Embrace the 'Echad' of the Shema?" https://www.academia.edu/12230043/Deuteronomy_6_4_and_the_Trinity_How_Can_Jews_and_Christians_Both_Embrace_the_Echad_of_the_Shema&lt;/ref&gt; In the Catholic Liturgy of the Hours, the ''Shema'' is read during the Night Prayer or ''Complines'' every Saturday, thereby concluding the day's prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://divineoffice.org/sun-np1/?date=20181124|title=Divine Office – Liturgy of the Hours of the Roman Catholic Church (Breviary)  » Welcome to the Divine Office Community!|website=divineoffice.org|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anglican]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] in use in Canada since 1962, has included the Shema in its Summary of the Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/holy-communion/|title=The Order for the Administration of The Lord's Supper or Holy Communion|date=7 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, when the [[Anglican Use]] version of the BCP was adapted for use in [[Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter|Canada]], it has been recited by Roman Catholics as well.

The [[Orthodox Church of the Culdees]] utilize the Shema in the Daily Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://christsassembly.com/2015/02/jesus-said-the-first-comandment-is-the-shama-culdee-liturgical-prayer/ |title= Liturgical BCP Prayer, "The Shama": A Prayer of Christendom and of the Culdees | publisher = Orthodox Church of the Culdees (Celtic) | work = Christ’s assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Islam ==
The words used in the Shema prayer are similar to the words of [[Al-Ikhlas|Sura 112]] (Al-Tawhid or Monotheism) in [[Quran]]. The words "{{lang|ar|أَحَدٌ}}" in Arabic is identical to the word "{{Hebrew|אֶחָד}}" in Hebrew.

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], '''Solomon's Temple''', also known as the '''First Temple''', was the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Holy Temple]] ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית־הַמִּקְדָּשׁ}}: ''Beit HaMikdash'') in [[History of Jerusalem#Independent Israel and Judah .28House of David.29 period|ancient Jerusalem]] before its destruction by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Siege of Jerusalem of 587 BCE]] and its subsequent replacement with the [[Second Temple]] in the 6th century BCE.

The Hebrew Bible states that the temple was constructed under [[Solomon]], king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel and Judah]] and that during the [[Kingdom of Judah]], the temple was dedicated to [[Yahweh]], and is said to have housed the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Jewish historian [[Josephus]] says that "the temple was burnt four hundred and seventy years, six months, and ten days after it was built".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jew. Ant. 10.8.5''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the religious sensitivities involved, and the politically volatile situation in [[Jerusalem]], only limited archaeological surveys of the [[Temple Mount]] have been conducted.

===Architectural description===
[[File:Plan of Soloman's Temple.jpg|thumb|Plan of Solomon's Temple, published 1905]]
[[File:SolomonsTemple.png|thumb|right|Plan of Solomon's Temple with measurements]]The Temple of Solomon is considered to be built according to [[Phoenicia]]n design, and its description is considered the best description of what a Phoenician temple looked like.&lt;ref name="Finkelstein"&gt;According to Finkelstein in ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', the description of the temple is remarkably similar to that of surviving remains of Phoenician temples of the time, and it is certainly plausible, from the point of view of archaeology, that the temple was constructed to the design of [[Phoenicians]].&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed descriptions provided in the [[Tanakh]] are the sources for reconstructions of its appearance. Technical details are lacking, since the scribes who wrote the books were not architects or engineers.&lt;ref name="devaux"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Vaux|first1=Roland|last2=McHugh|first2=John, ed.|title=Ancient Israel: Its Life and Institutions|date=1961|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the descriptions have inspired [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|modern replicas of the temple]] and influenced later structures around the world.

Reconstructions differ; the following is largely based on ''[[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]'' and the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'':{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

====Holy of Holies====
The [[Holy of Holies]], or ''Kodesh haKodashim'' in Hebrew, (1 Kings 6:19; 8:6), also called the "Inner House" (6:27), (Heb. 9:3) was 20 [[cubit]]s in length, breadth, and height. The usual explanation for the discrepancy between its height and the 30-cubit height of the temple is that its floor was elevated, like the ''[[cella]]'' of other ancient temples.&lt;ref name=devaux/&gt; It was floored and wainscotted with [[Cedrus libani|cedar of Lebanon]] (1 Kings 6:16), and its walls and floor were overlaid with [[gold]] (6:20, 21, 30) amounting to 600 talents (2 Chr. 3:8) or roughly 20 metric tons. It contained two [[cherub]]im of olive-wood, each 10 cubits high (1 Kings 6:16, 20, 21, 23–28) and each having outspread wings of 10 cubits span, so that, since they stood side by side, the wings touched the wall on either side and met in the center of the room. There was a two-leaved door between it and the Holy Place overlaid with gold (2 Chr. 4:22); also a veil of [[tekhelet]] (blue), [[purple]], and [[crimson]] and fine [[linen]] (2 Chronicles 3:14; compare [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 26:33). It had no windows (1 Kings 8:12) and was considered the dwelling-place of the "name" of God.

The ''Kodesh haKodashim'' (the Holy of Holies) was prepared to receive and house the Ark (1 Kings 6:19); and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark, containing the original tablets of the [[Ten Commandments]], was placed beneath the cherubim (1 Kings 8:6).

====Hekhal====
The ''Hekhal'', or Holy Place, (1 Kings 8:8–10), is also called the "greater house" (2 Chr. 3:5) and the "temple" (1 Kings 6:17); the word also means "palace",&lt;ref name=devaux/&gt; was of the same width and height as the Holy of Holies, but 40 cubits in length. Its walls were lined with cedar, on which were carved figures of cherubim, palm-trees, and open flowers, which were overlaid with gold. Chains of gold further marked it off from the Holy of Holies. The floor of the Temple was of fir-wood overlaid with gold. The door-posts, of olive-wood, supported folding-doors of fir. The doors of the Holy of Holies were of olive-wood. On both sets of doors were carved cherubim, palm-trees, and flowers, all being overlaid with gold (1 Kings 6:15 et seq.)

=====Etymology=====
The noun ''hekhal'' ({{lang-he|היכל}}, borrowed from Sumerian [[wikt:𒂍𒃲|𒂍𒃲]] (É.GAL) "big house") means "a large building". This can be either the main building of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (that is the [[nave]], or sanctuary, of the Temple), or a palace such as the "palace" of [[Ahab]], king of [[Samaria]], or the "palace" of the King of Babylon.

Hekhal is used 80 times in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Of these, 70 refer to the House of the {{LORD}} (in Hebrew Bible בֵּית יְהוָה ''beit Yahweh''), the other 10 are references to palaces. There is no reference to any part of the [[tabernacle]] using this term in the Hebrew Bible.

{{Quote|In the year that king [[Uzziah]] died. I saw the {{LORD}} sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the ''hekhal'' (sanctuary).|''[[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]]'' {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|6:1|HE}}.}}

=====Use in architecture=====
In older English versions of the Bible, including the [[King James Version]], the term ''temple'' is used to translate ''hekhal''. In modern versions more reflective of archaeological research, the distinction is made of different sections of the whole Temple. Scholars and archaeologists generally agree on the structure of Solomon's Temple as described in 1 Kings 6:3–5, with the main building, the ''hekhal'', in English now sometimes called "the sanctuary", the ''[[devir]]'', the inner sanctuary, and finally the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Schäfer]] ''The Origins of Jewish Mysticism''. 2011. p. 59: "Scholars have long observed that this three-part structure resembles the structure of Solomon's Temple as described in 1 Kings 6:3, 5: the hekhal (sanctuary), the devir (inner sanctuary) or qodesh ha-qodashim (Holy of Holies)..."&lt;/ref&gt;

This main building was between the outer altar, where most [[Korban|sacrifices]] were performed, and inside at the far end was the entry to the Holy of Holies, originally containing the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. The main hekhal contained a number of sacred ritual objects including the [[Menorah (Temple)|seven branched candlestick]], the [[inner altar]] for incense offerings (also called the "Golden Altar"), and the [[Showbread|table of the showbread]].

The same architectural layout of the temple was adopted in synagogues leading to the ''hekhal'' being applied in [[Sephardi]] usage to the Ashkenazi [[Torah ark]], the equivalent of the [[nave]].&lt;ref&gt;Meir Ben-Dov, ''The Golden Age: Synagogues of Spain in History and Architecture'', 2009: "Among [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic Jewry]], even though these two were the main foci of the synagogue, the terms used for them were different. The hekhal (literally, "the Temple") was known as the aron ha-kodesh (literally, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porch====
The ''Ulam'', or porch, acted as an entrance before the Temple on the east (1 Kings 6:3; 2 Chr. 3:4; 9:7). This was 20 cubits long (corresponding to the width of the Temple) and 10 cubits deep (1 Kings 6:3). (ESV 2 Chr. 3:4) notes that this porch was 120 cubits high. The description does not specify whether a wall separated it from the next chamber. In the porch stood the two pillars [[Jachin and Boaz]] (1 Kings 7:21; 2 Kings 11:14; 23:3), which were 18 cubits in height.

====Chambers====
Chambers were built around the Temple on the southern, western and northern sides (1 Kings 6:5–10). These formed a part of the building and were used for storage. They were probably one story high at first; two more may have been added later.&lt;ref name=devaux/&gt;

====Courts====
According to the Bible, two courts surrounded the Temple. The Inner Court (1 Kings 6:36), or Court of the Priests (2 Chr. 4:9), was separated from the space beyond by a wall of three courses of hewn stone, surmounted by cedar beams (1 Kings 6:36). It contained the [[Altar (Bible)|Altar of burnt-offering]] (2 Chr. 15:8), the [[Molten Sea|Brazen Sea]] laver (4:2–5, 10) and [[Bronze laver (Temple)|ten other lavers]] (1 Kings 7:38, 39). A brazen altar stood before the Temple (2 Kings 16:14), its dimensions 20 cubits square and 10 cubits high (2 Chr. 4:1). The Great Court surrounded the whole Temple (2 Chr. 4:9). It was here that people assembled to worship. (Jeremiah 19:14; 26:2).

====Molten Sea====
{{main article|Molten Sea}}
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Molten Sea or Brazen Sea ({{lang|he|ים מוצק}} "[[:wikt:יצק|cast metal]] [[:wikt:ים|sea]]") was a large basin in the Temple for [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ablution]] of the priests. It is described in {{Bibleverse|1 Kings|7:23-26|KJV}} and {{Bibleverse|2 Chronicles|4:2-5|KJV}}. It stood in the south-eastern corner of the inner court. According to the Bible it was five [[cubit]]s high, ten cubits in diameter from brim to brim, and thirty cubits in circumference. The brim was "like the calyx of a lily" and turned outward "about an hand breadth"; or about four inches. It was placed on the backs of twelve [[ox]]en, standing with their faces outward. The [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] states that it contains 2,000 baths (90 cubic meters), while Chronicles (2 Chr. 4:5–6) states it can hold up to 3,000 baths (136 cubic meters) and states that its purpose was to afford opportunity for the purification by immersion of the bodies of the priests.

The fact that it was a wash basin which was too large to enter from above lends to the idea that water would likely have flowed from it down into a subcontainer beneath. The water was originally supplied by the [[Gibeonites]], but was afterwards brought by a conduit from [[Solomon's Pools]]. The molten sea was made of [[brass]] or [[bronze]], which Solomon had taken from the captured cities of [[Hadarezer]], the king of [[Zobah]] ({{Bibleverse|1 Chronicles|18:8|KJV}}). [[Ahaz]] later removed this laver from the oxen, and placed it on a stone pavement ({{Bibleverse|2 Kings|16:17|KJV}}). It was destroyed by the [[Babylon|Chaldeans]] ({{Bibleverse|2 Kings|25:13|KJV}}).

The lavers, each of which held "forty baths" (1 Kings 7:38), rested on portable holders made of bronze, provided with wheels, and ornamented with figures of lions, [[cherub]]im, and palm-trees. The author of the books of the Kings describes their minute details with great interest (1 Kings 7:27–37). Josephus reported that the vessels in the Temple were composed of [[orichalcum]] in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. According to 1 Kings 7:48 there stood before the Holy of Holies a golden [[Altar (Bible)#Altar of Incense|Altar of Incense]] and a table for [[showbread]]. This table was of gold, as were also the five candlesticks on each side of it. The implements for the care of the candles–tongs, basins, snuffers, and fire-pans–were of gold; and so were the hinges of the doors.

===Dedication===
{{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:10-66|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|6:1-42|NKJV}} recount the events of the temple's dedication. When the priests emerged from the holy of holies after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with an overpowering cloud which interrupted the dedication ceremony,&lt;ref name=PComm&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_kings/8.htm Pulpit Commentary on 1 Kings 8], accessed 2 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; "for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord" (1 Kings 8:10–11; 2 Chronicles 5:13, 14). Solomon interpreted the cloud as "[proof] that his pious work was accepted":&lt;ref name=PComm /&gt;
:The Lord has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.
:I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever. (1 Kings 8:12-13)
The allusion is to {{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:2|NKJV}}:
:The Lord said to [[Moses]]:
:Tell your brother [[Aaron]] not to come just at any time into the sanctuary inside the curtain before the mercy seat that is upon the ark, or he will die; for I appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

Solomon then led the whole assembly of Israel in [[Prayer of Solomon|prayer]], noting that the construction on the temple represented a fulfilment of God's promise to [[David]], dedicating the temple as a place of prayer and reconciliation for the people of Israel and for foreigners living in Israel, and highlighting the [[paradox]] that God who lives in the heavens cannot really be contained within a single building. The dedication was concluded with [[Korban|sacrifices]] said to have included "twenty-two thousand bulls and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:10-66|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
Because of the religious and political sensitivities involved, no archaeological excavations and only limited surface surveys of the Temple Mount have been conducted since [[Charles Warren]]'s expedition of 1867–70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Warren |authorlink=Charles Warren |url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundjerus00warruoft |title=Underground Jerusalem: An Account of Some of the Principal Difficulties Encountered in Its Exploration and the Results Obtained.

* An [[ostracon]] (excavated prior to 1981), sometimes referred to as the [[House of Yahweh ostracon]], was discovered at [[Tel Arad]], dated to 6th century BCE which mentions a temple which is probably the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521227179 |page=397 |author=T.

* A thumb-sized [[ivory pomegranate]] (which came to light in 1979) measuring {{convert|44|mm|in}} in height, and bearing an ancient Hebrew inscription "Sacred donation for the priests in the House of ---h,]", was believed to have adorned a sceptre used by the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in Solomon's Temple.

Since then, it has been proven that one of the letters was indeed carved prior to the ancient break, and the status of the other two letters are in question. Some paleographers and others have continued to insist that the inscription is ancient, some dispute this so the authenticity of this writing is still the object of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |title=Fudging with Forgeries |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |date=November–December 2011 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=56–58 |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |issn=0098-9444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another artifact, the [[Jehoash Inscription]], which first came to notice in 2003, contains a 15-line description of King Jehoash's ninth-century BCE restoration of the Temple. Its authenticity was called into question by a report by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which said that the surface patina contained microfossils of [[foraminifera]]. As these fossils do not dissolve in water, they cannot occur in a calcium carbonate patina, leading initial investigators to conclude that the patina must be an artificial chemical mix applied to the stone by forgers.  As of late 2012, the academic community is split on whether the tablet is authentic or not. Commenting on a 2012 report by geologists arguing for the authenticity of the inscription, in October 2012, [[Hershel Shanks]] (who believes the inscription is genuine) wrote the current situation was that most Hebrew language scholars believe that the inscription is a forgery and geologists that it is genuine, and thus "Because we rely on experts, and because there is an apparently irresolvable conflict of experts in this case, [[Biblical Archaeology Review|BAR]] has taken no position with respect to the authenticity of the Jehoash Inscription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |title=Authentic or Forged?

* By 2006, the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]] had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from soil removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the [[Solomon's Stables]] area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period [[bulla (seal)|bulla]], or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing which includes the name ''Netanyahu ben Yaush.'' Netanyahu is a name mentioned several times in the Book of Jeremiah while the name Yaush appears in the [[Lachish letters]]. However, the combination of names was unknown to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1350 |title=Building Remains From The Time Of The First Temple Were Exposed West Of The Temple Mount |publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority |date=March 13, 2008 |quote=a personal Hebrew seal made of a semi-precious stone that was apparently inlaid in a ring.

The surface of the seal is divided into three strips separated by a double line: in the upper strip is a chain decoration in which there are four pomegranates and in the two bottom strips is the name of the owner of the seal, engraved in ancient Hebrew script.

The two names are known in the treasury of biblical names: the name נתניהו (Netanyahu) is mentioned a number of times in the Bible (in the Book of Jeremiah and in Chronicles) and the name יאש (Yaush) appears in the Lachish letters. The name Yaush, like the name יאשיהו (Yoshiyahu) is, in the opinion of Professor Shmuel Ahituv, derived from the root או"ש which means “he gave a present” (based on Arabic and Ugaritic). It is customary to assume that the owners of personal seals were people that held senior governmental positions. It should nevertheless be emphasized that this combination of names – נתניהו בן יאוש (Netanyahu ben Yaush) – was unknown until now. |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shragai |first=Nadav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=776621 |title=Temple Mount dirt uncovers First Temple artifacts |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contemporary temples==
There is archaeological and written evidence of three Israelite temples, either contemporary or of very close date, dedicated to Yahweh (Elephantine temple, probably Arad too), either in the [[Land of Israel]] or in Egypt. Two of them have the same general outline as given by the Bible for the Jerusalem Temple.

==Freemasonry==
Rituals in [[Freemasonry]] refer to King Solomon and the building of his Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lodgechelmsford.com/ |title=Lodge Chelmsford No 261 |publisher=Lodgechelmsford.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masonic buildings, where Lodge members meet, are sometimes called 'temples'; an allegoric reference to King Solomon's Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Invalid Input |url=http://www.masons.org.au/index.php |title=Freemasons NSW &amp; ACT – Home |publisher=Masons.org.au |date= |accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kabbalah==
[[Kabbalah]] views the design of the Temple of Solomon as representative of the metaphysical world and the descending light of the creator through [[Sefirot]] of the [[Tree of life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. The levels of the outer, inner and priest's courts represent three lower worlds of Kabbalah. The [[Boaz and Jachin]] pillars at the entrance of the temple represent the active and passive elements of the world of [[Atziluth]]. The original [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] and its seven branches represent the seven lower Sephirot of the Tree of Life. The veil of the Holy of Holies and the inner part of the temple represent the Veil of the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]] on the Tree of Life, behind which the [[Shekhinah]] or Divine Presence hovers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Way of Kabbalah'', Warren Kenton, Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi, Weiser Books, 1976, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==

The [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is mentioned in verse 7 of the surah [[Al-Isra]] in the Quran; commentators of Quran such as [[Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur]] &lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ashur, Muhammad al-Tahir. "al-Tahrir wa'l-tanwir". Al-Dar Al-Tunasia Publication. Tunisia. 1984. vol. 15, p. 13 &lt;/ref&gt; postulate that this verse refers specifically to the Temple of Solomon.

== Popular culture ==
Solomon's Temple appears in ''[[Solomon and Sheba]]'' (1959) and in the novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' (1885). It also appears in the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' where the main character [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] deal with [[Robert IV de Sablé|Robert de Sablé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowden |first=Oliver |author-link=Oliver Bowden |title=Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=5unqr93gYBQC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Penguin UK]] |date=June 23, 2011 |pages=464 |isbn=9780141966717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=François |last=Dansereau |first2=Ivan |last2=Lowe |first3=James |last3=Nadiger |first4=Nitai |last4=Podar |first5=Megan |last5=Sutton |first6=Johathan |last6=Whelton-Pane |first7=William |last7=Wright |title=Assassin's Creed Encyclopedia |publisher=[[UbiWorkshop]] |date=November 2011 |pages=256 |isbn=978-2-924006-03-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears too on ''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]'' (2014) where the [[Knight Templar]] [[Jacques de Molay]] is burned and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worley |first=Seth |title=Assassin's Creed Unity (Video Game Review) |url=http://www.biogamergirl.com/2014/11/assassins-creed-unity-video-game-review.html |access-date=January 10, 2018 |publisher=[[BioGamer Girl Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowden |first=Oliver |author-link=Oliver Bowden |title=Assassin's Creed: Unity |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=7V8mBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Penguin UK]] |date=November 20, 2014 |pages=480 |isbn=9781405918855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The BioLogos Foundation''' is a Christian [[advocacy group]] established by [[Francis Collins]] in 2007.

Francis Collins served as its president until he resigned on August 16, 2009 to become the 16th Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The presidency was then assumed by [[Darrel Falk]], succeeded in January 2013 by Deborah Haarsma .

==Response==
The BioLogos Foundation has drawn criticism from both [[creationist]]s and [[atheist]]s. In response to a ''[[Time Magazine]]'' article about the foundation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1895284,00.html Time Magazine piece]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Coyne]], a professor of biology at the University of Chicago and [[Secularism|secularist]], calls the foundation the "latest endeavor to forcibly marry science and faith" and "embarrassing in its single-minded fervor to prove that conservative Christianity and evolution are really good buddies."&lt;ref&gt;

BioLogos has also received praise and positive responses. Supporters of The BioLogos Foundation include ''Washington Post'' columnist [[Kathleen Parker]], who claims the Foundation's goal of "helping fundamentalists evolve can only be good for civilization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kathleen |last=Parker |title=An Evolution for Evangelicals |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/08/AR2009050802383.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 10, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Druid Network''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[druid]]ic ([[neo-pagan]]) organisation providing a source of information and inspiration about modern Druidic traditions, practices and their histories.&lt;ref name=WID /&gt; It was founded in February 2003 by [[Emma Restall Orr]], a  leading voice in British Druidry.&lt;ref name="AAEOFTDN" /&gt;

==History==
The Druid Network was created to act as an internet framework making tangible the spirit-web that is the global community of the Druid tradition and other natural philosophies and Paganisms. Like a sacred well, the Network aims to offer a blend of inspiration and information, yet not only from words presented as articles and ideas. In the spirit of the oral tradition of our ancestors and our heritage, the power of the Druid Network is in the encounters it enables between individuals, soul to soul, mind to mind : people walking together upon the same road.

A major project of The Druid Network is called [[Honouring the Ancient Dead]], a programme developed in cooperation with the [[Manchester Museum]] (U.K.) for the proper and dignified treatment of human remains at ancient archaeological sites in the United Kingdom.  The programme has been reported on in "British Archaeology" (Issue 77, July 2004)&lt;ref name="BAHAD" /&gt; and "The New Statesman," (6 November 2006.)

==Organization==
The structure of the Network is based on Druidic and pagan tenets.&lt;ref name="DEIANDMY" /&gt; It therefore claims no hierarchy, but for administrative purposes numerous categories of membership are constitutionally defined, as are lines of communication. The governing Committee consists of selected Staff Members, chosen by the previous Committee from all applicants.

The Network comprises working project areas on four continents as well as its British home:  Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania.&lt;ref name="GGTDN" /&gt; The Network does not, however, simply focus on members. They work for the wider Druid community and the world at large through teaching and programmes in areas of ethics, ecology, and spirituality.  The website offers members and non-members alike a large variety of options for active engagement.

The heart of The Druid Network is the Druid Order of the Yew,&lt;ref name="DOOTY" /&gt; a community of Druid Priests bound together by their pledges of Commitment to their Communities across the several continents of the Network.&lt;ref name="CPTDN" /&gt;

Across the globe many Druid Groves and other Druidic organisations are affiliated with The Druid Network. The Druid Network Across North America is composed of sixteen Regions, most headed by Regional Coordinators.  Its purpose is to assist Druid Groups and individuals in the practice of Druid spirituality, to seek to define what Druidry means in North America, and to identify and coordinate programs for social action and ethical awareness.  Similar manifestations of the Network can be found in Spain, the Netherlands, France, Brazil, and Oceania.

The Druid Network organises the Lammas Games an annual bardic festival of sports, songs and storytelling.&lt;ref name="LAMG" /&gt; The Druid Network also has a collection of "expressions" of Druidry that contains services to aid its community with inspiration regarding current issues, environmental ideas, ethical living choices, a tradition named PaganDASH and a pagan prison minister service.&lt;ref name="EOD" /&gt;

==Charity status==
In September 2010, the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] agreed to register The Network as a charity.&lt;ref name="BBC20101002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CCEW" /&gt; Right-wing tabloid columnist Melanie Phillips reacted by writing in the [[Daily Mail]] as the decision being "a joke". In response a 4,000 strong petition was taken to the newspaper and the press complaints commission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/misc/4612/druids_recognised_daily_mail_angry.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costumes==
Houses are built of [[wattle and daub]] or [[lumber]], usually with [[thatch]]ed roofs. Traditional men's clothing consists of shirt, short pants, neckerchief, hat, and [[wool]] [[poncho]]. Traditional women's clothing is a blouse or long overdress (''[[huipil]]''), [[indigo]] dyed skirt (''enredo''), cotton sash, and shawl.&lt;ref name=ebrit&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (2009), ''Tzotzil''.

Accessed on 2009-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:San Cristobal - Indianische Straßenhändlerinnen.jpg|thumb|Two Tzotzil women on a street in San Cristobal]]
Based on linguistic and archaeological data, scholars believe that the common ancestors of the contemporary Tzotzil and [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]] peoples entered Chiapas between 100 BCE and 300 CE. According to Spanish chronicles, just before the [[Spanish conquest|Spanish Conquest]] the Tzotzil exported [[quetzal]] feathers and [[amber]] to the [[Aztec empire|Aztec]] capital of [[Tenochtitlán]]. They also produced [[salt]] from wells near [[Ixtapa]] and traded it throughout the Chiapas highlands, and continued to do so after the Conquest.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;

The Spanish conquerors met comparatively little resistance in Chiapas. In 1522, the Zinacantán lord [[Cuzcácuatl]] sought the Spaniards with an offer of allegiance, and his subjects afterwards helped Spanish commander [[Luis Marín]] to subdue neighboring tribes. On the other hand, the natives from Chamula fought hard against the Spaniards. They and the natives of [[Huixtlán]] eventually fled leaving nothing that the invaders could make use of. Unable to obtain service or tribute from those people, the Spaniards returned to the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coast, and the Tzoltzil returned to their lands and lifestlyle. Other Spanish incursions in the following decade generally spared the Tzotzil, but their numbers were greatly diminished by diseases and hunger. Many villages were focibly relocated, and the natives were assigned as vassals to the ''encomiendas'' (land grants) given by the Spanish crown to the conquerors.&lt;ref name=obre/&gt;

After the Spanish conquest, the Tzotzil were for centuries exploited as laborers, first by the Spaniards and then by the [[Ladino people|''Ladinos'']] (urban Spanish-speaking people of Spanish and native descent) who own most of the land and dominate commerce. During most of this period, a rigid [[casta|caste system]] sharply divided the natives from the Ladinos, with very different rights and obligations. The oppression led them to revolt in 1528, 1712, and 1868.&lt;ref name=obre/&gt; The situation of the Tzoltzil worsened considerably in 1863, when laws enacted by [[Benito Juárez]] stripped the Indian towns of their corporate lands, forcing many Zinacantecos to become debt-indentured laborers on farms owned by the Ladinos.

The sense of national pride has become stronger among the Tzotzil since 1940, as natives have increasingly began to occupy local administrative posts and used their cultural identity for political purposes. While sizable Tzotzil communities have appeared in some towns, other Tzotzil towns have been undergoing "reindianization" as the formerly dominating Ladino minorities have migrated to larger cities.&lt;ref name=obre/&gt;

With the collapse of coffee prices in the 1980s, sustainable employment has been hard for many people in the highlands to find. As both population and foreign tourism have risen, the sale of artisan goods has replaced other economic activities. Tzotzils usually sell their products in the nearby cities of [[San Cristóbal de las Casas]], [[Comitán]], and [[Simojovel]]. Recently, and increasingly, many Maya from the highlands of Chiapas have found migration to other parts of Mexico and [[Illegal immigration to the United States]] a way to break away from [[subsistence farming]] and abysmal wages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Issues surrounding social integration persist, especially with the Ladinos. Support for the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] movement,&lt;ref name=potw/&gt; as well as for other non-violent opposition groups such as [[Las Abejas]],&lt;ref&gt;Tavanti, Marco. Las Abejas: Pacifist Resistance and Syncretic Identities in a Globalizing Chiapas. New York: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; is strong among the Tzotzil.

== Native religion ==

A Spanish chronicler described Zinacantan as a pueblo with "an infinite number of gods; they worshiped the sun and offered sacrifices to it, and to the full rivers, to the springs, to the trees of heavy foliage, and to the high hills they gave incense and gifts .. . their ancestors discovered a stone bat and considered it God and worshiped it" (Ximenez 1929-1931, 360).&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;

The Tzotzil conceive the World as a square, at whose center is the "navel", a mound of earth located in the ceremonial center. The world rests on the shoulders of the ''Vashak'', analogous to the [[Four-Corner Gods]] or Sky-Bearers of the ancient Maya. This cosmic model is reflected in the ceremonial circuits around houses and fields performed by priests, which proceed counterclockwise around the four corners and end in the center, where offerings are made to the gods. The Tzotzil Underworld inhabited by a race of dwarfs, created by the gods during their attempts to create mankind.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;

The Sun is "Our Father Heat", and the Moon is "Our Holy Mother". The planet [[Venus]] is called "Sweeper of the Path" as it precedes the Sun in his path around the World. Local hills and mountains lare the homes of the ancestral couples, the ''Totilme'il'' or "Fathers-Mothers", the most important Tzotzil gods. The next most important deity is the Earth Lord. In modern times, he is pictured as a large fat and rich Ladino living underground, who owns all land and its natural resources. A Tzotzil who uses any of those resources — water holes, trees, mud for his home, [[limestone]] for [[lime (material)|lime]] — is expected to compensate the Earth Lord with appropriate offerings in a ceremony.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;

The Tzotzil believe that each human being has two souls, a ''ch'ulel'' and a ''wayhel''. The ''ch'ulel'' is an inner, personal soul, located in the heart and blood, placed in the unborn embryo by the ancestral gods. It is composed of thirteen parts, and a person who loses one or more of these parts must have a curing ceremony performed by a shaman to recover them. "Soul loss" may be caused by fright of falling down or seeing a demon on a dark night; as a punishment by the ancestral gods for misbehavior; or by being sold into slavery to the Earth Lord, through evil witchcraft.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt; At death, the inner soul leaves the body and goes to the ''Katibak'', the world of the dead in the center of the earth. There it will remain for the same length of time it had been in the human world, reliving his life in reverse, younger and younger, until it is assigned by the ancestral gods to another newborn of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=guiteras&gt;{{cite book | last=Guiteras-Holmes |first=Calixta | title=Los peligros del alma: visión del mundo de un tzotzil | location=México | publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica | year=1965 }} As cited by Alfredo López Austin (1997), p. 146 and following.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.131,198–9}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=Alfredo López |authorlink=Alfredo López Austin |year=1997 |title=Tamoanchan, Tlalocan: Places of Mist |series=Mesoamerican Worlds series |translator=Bernard R.

People who have drowned, have been murdered, or were struck by lightning do not go to Katibak.&lt;ref name=guiteras/&gt;{{rp|p.42–3}} Animals and trees too have ''ch'ulel'' soul, which goes through the same cycle.&lt;ref name=guiteras/&gt;{{rp|p.249}}

The other soul, the ''wayjel'', is an animal-spirit companion, shared with a ''chanul'', a wild animal. Throughout each person's life, whatever happens to the animal spirit also happens to the person and vice versa. These animal-spirit companions, consisting of [[jaguars]], [[ocelots]], [[coyotes]], and smaller animals such as [[squirrel]]s and [[opossum]]s, are kept by the ancestral gods in four corrals inside the "Senior Large Mountain" in the east side of the world. If the animal spirit is let out of its corral by the ancestral gods, the person is in mortal danger and must undergo a lengthy ceremony to round up the ''chanul'' and return it to its corral.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt; Only human beings have a ''wayhel'' soul.&lt;ref name=guiteras/&gt;{{rp|p.249}}

Each town is associated to a sacred mountain. The god [[Manojel-Tojel]] created humans by leading them out of the caves of the original hills.&lt;ref name=guiteras/&gt;{{rp|p.237}} According to myth, each one of the patron-gods "installed himself in a hill, by order of the gods of the four corners of the earth".{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;{{rp|p.35}}

Yahwal Balamil is a god who lives inside the earth. He rides a deer with serpent [[bridle]]s, and frees the water-filled clouds from inside the earth through caves. He announces himself with the croaking of frogs".&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;{{rp|p.35,94}}

===Syncretism===
In the centuries since the [[Spanish conquest]], under the influence of [[Catholicism]], the Tzotzil have come to associate the Sun with God the Father or Jesus Christ and the Moon with the Virgin Mary. They also revere carved wooden or plaster images and pictures of Catholic saints, dressed in a mixture of colonial- Zinacanteco-style dresses.&lt;ref name=vogt/&gt;

===Other Religions===

====Islam====
A small proportion of Tzotzils have converted to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latina.com/lifestyle/our-issues/documentary-indigenous-mexicans-converted-islam Latina Magazine, JANUARY 5, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Winti''' &lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;is an [[Afro-Surinamese]] traditional religion that originated in [[South America]] and developed in the [[Dutch Empire]]; this resulted in the syncretization of the religious beliefs and practices of [[Akan people|Akan]] and [[Fon people|Fon]] slaves (with the gods such as Leba or Legba, Loko and Aisa or Ayizan) with Christianity. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nieuwe West-Indische gids|author=Rijksuniversiteit te Utrecht Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies|publisher=Nijhoff|year=1979|volume=53&amp;ndash;55|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The foundation of Winti based on three principles: the belief in the supreme creator called '''Anana Kedyaman Kedyanpon'''; the belief in a pantheon of spirits called ''Winti''; and the [[Ancestor veneration|veneration of the ancestors]]. There is also a belief in ''Ampuku'' (also known as ''Apuku'') which are [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorph]]ic forest spirits. An Ampuku can possess people (both men and women) and can also pass itself off as another spirit.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Ampuku can also be water spirits, and are known in such cases as ''Watra Ampuku''.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Out of Slavery: A Surinamese Roots History|author=Wim Hoogbergen|publisher=LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2008 |isbn=9783825881122|pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of Winti ==
Winti is described according to C. Wooding (a Winti expert) as:

"...an Afro American religion, within which the belief in personified supernatural beings occupies a central position. These personified supernatural beings can take possession of a human person, switch off their consciousness, as it were, and thereby reveal things concerning the past, present and future as well as cause and/or heal illnesses of a supernatural nature."&lt;ref&gt;Wooding, Ch.J. (1972). ''Winti: een Afroamerikaanse godsdienst in Suriname; een cultureelhistorische analyse van de religieuze verschijnselen in de Para''. Meppel: Krips.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Winti expert (H.J.M. Stephen, 1985) describes Winti as:

"...primarily a religion, which means that respect for the divine, worship and prayer are central. In addition, it has a strong magical aspect, which often has been emphasized too one-sidedly and unfairly. Magic involves the influence of earthly events by supernatural means."

==History of Winti==
During [[Atlantic slave trade|slavery]], members of various West African tribes were brought to [[Suriname]]. They came from kingdoms that had certain religious aspects in common, like the belief in a supreme creator God who lives far away from the people, leaving the world to gods or spirits who are less powerful than him, and the belief in an immortal human soul and the related ancestor worship.

After the abolition of slavery in 1863, a ten-year period of economic slavery followed known as 'De Periode van Staatstoezicht' (the period of State Supervision). The period of state supervision ended in 1873 and was followed by a very long period of mental and cultural slavery. The former slaves and their descendants were forced to convert to Christianity and for nearly 100 years (1874–1971) practicing Winti was forbidden by law. They were also forced to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]], education in their own language 'Sranan Tongo' was forbidden, and children were not allowed to speak Sranan Tongo in schools.

==The soul==
It is believed that a human being has three spiritual aspects, the ''Dyodyo'', ''Kra'', and ''Yorka''. Through these aspects human beings are integrated into the supernatural world. The ''Dyodyo'' are the supernatural parents who protect their children and may be higher or lower spirits. They received the pure soul, the ''Kra'', from '''Anana''' and give that to a child. The ''Kra'' and ''Dyodyo'' determine your reason and mentality, while the biological parents provide blood and the physical body. ''Yorka'', the other spiritual part, absorbs the life experiences. After the death of the physical body, the ''Kra'' goes back to the ''Dyodyo'' and the ''Yorka'' goes to the realm of the dead.

==Pantheons==

There are four Pantheons or groups.
*1. The Earth pantheon with the ''Goron Winti''.
*2. The Water Pantheon with ''Watra Winti''.
*3. The Forest Pantheon with ''Busi Winti''.
*4. The Sky Pantheon with ''Tapu Winti''.

Certain groups of [[maroon (people)|maroons]] also distinguish a fifth pantheon, the realm of the death.
