'''Amberbaken''', or '''Mpur''' (also known as ''Kebar, Ekware,'' and ''Dekwambre''), is a divergent language of New Guinea. It is not closely related to any other language, and though Ross (2005) tentatively assigned it to the [[West Papuan languages]], based on similarities in pronouns, ''Ethnologue'' and ''Glottolog'' list it as a [[language isolate]].&lt;ref name=e21&gt;{{e21|AKC|Amberbaken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glottolog/&gt; Amberbaken or Mpur has a complex tonal system with 4 lexical tones and an additional contour tone, a compound of two of the lexicals. Its tonal system is somewhat similar to the nearby Austronesian languages of [[Mor language (Austronesian)|Mor]] and [[Ma'ya language|Ma'ya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muysken |first=Pieter  |date= |title=From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9p4rl09ec0C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=tonal+papuan+languages&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_JtSyxG0Qh&amp;sig=Kj2_na6GEdqwWWG-uEiFhrggsw8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT39qal4PQAhULrVQKHUdgDmYQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=tonal%20papuan%20languages&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |page=134 |isbn= 9789027231000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aminata Sow Fall''' (born 1941) is a [[Senegal]]ese-born author. While her native language is [[Wolof language|Wolof]], her books are written in [[French language|French]]. She is considered "the first published woman novelist from francophone Black Africa".&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Busby]], ''[[Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent]]'' (1992), London: Vintage, 1993, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
She was born 1941 in [[Saint-Louis, Senegal]], where she grew up before moving to [[Dakar]] to finish her secondary schooling. After this, she did a degree in Modern Languages in [[France]] and became a teacher upon returning to Senegal.&lt;ref name=UWA&gt;[http://aflit.arts.uwa.edu.au/SowFallAminata.html "Aminata Sow Fall"], The University of Western Australia/French, 25 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
She was a member of the Commission for Educational Reform responsible for the introduction of African literature into the French syllabus in Senegal, before becoming director of La Propriété littéraire (The Literary Property) in [[Dakar]] (1979–88).&lt;ref name=UWA /&gt; She was appointed the first woman president of Senegal's Writer's Association in 1985.

{{globalize|date=December 2010}}
In [[parliament]]ary politics, the term '''balance of power''' may describe a parliamentary situation in which a member or a number of members of chamber are in a position by their uncommitted vote to enable a party to attain and remain in [[minority government]], and the term may also be applied to the members who hold that position. The members holding the balance of power may guarantee their support for a government by either joining it in a [[coalition government]] or by an assurance that they will vote against any [[motion of no confidence]] in the government or abstain in such a vote. In return for such a commitment, such persons may demand legislative or policy commitments from the party they are to support. A person or party may also hold a balance of power in a chamber without any commitment to government, in which case both the government and opposition groupings may on occasion need to negotiate that person's legislative support.

==Australia==

===House of Representatives===
In the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]] of the 74 seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[United Australia Party|United Australia]]/[[National Party of Australia|Country]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] won 36 seats, the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] won 32, the [[Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist)|Non-Communist Labor Party]] won 4, and there were two [[Independent politician|independents]], leaving the United Australia government of [[Robert Menzies]] without a majority in the lower house. The Coalition continued in government with the support of the two independents. The following year, the Non-Communist Labor Party, a breakaway Labor faction associated with former [[New South Wales]] premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]], was readmitted to the Labor Party, and after the removal of Menzies by his own party, the independents in [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] switched their support to Labor, allowing Opposition Leader [[John Curtin]] to form a [[minority government]] until his landslide [[Australian federal election, 1943|reelection in 1943]].

After the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives, both the Labor Party and the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] held 72 seats, and there was one [[Australian Greens|Greens]], one MP was a member of the [[National Party of Western Australia]] (which is not part of the Liberal/National Coalition), and four independents. After several weeks of negotiations, Labor Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] eventually retained power after signing separate [[confidence and supply]] agreements with the Greens and three of the independents. The agreements required the non-government party to support the government in a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] and on [[Appropriation bill|supply bills]], in return for the passage of some legislation, such as setting up an [[emissions trading scheme]] in the case of the Greens (see [[Gillard Government#Minority government|Gillard Government§Minority government]]). The Labor minority government was able to govern for the full term of the house.

===Senate===
:{{see also|Constitution of Australia|Constitutional history of Australia|Federation of Australia}}
The [[Australian Senate|Senate]], which serves as the nation's upper house and as a house of review, was established on the basis of ensuring that the smaller Colonies joining the Commonwealth were given equal representation, as required under the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900.&lt;ref name="aph-Faulkner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop34/c10.htm |title=A Labor Perspective on Senate Reform |author=Faulkner, John |authorlink=John Faulkner |work=Publications, Australian Senate |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603054858/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop34/c10.htm |archivedate=3 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cccs.law.unimelb.edu.au/files/EvansSenateSSRN.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Australian Senate |author=Evans, Simon |publisher=Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies, [[The University of Melbourne]] |year=2006 |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1901 and 1918, Senators were elected on a [[first past the post]] system, changing to each state voting as one electorate on a [[Ranked voting systems|preferential system]] from 1918 until 1948. During this period, the majority party in the lower house also generally had a commanding majority in the Senate.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Since 1949, Senators are elected on the basis of achieving a [[Single transferable vote|transferable quota]] in each State or Territory.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; In more recent years, this method of election has generally resulted in a multi-party mix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/sys_gov.html |title=Australia's system of government |work=About Australia |publisher=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, [[Commonwealth of Australia]] |date=February 2008 |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, Senators were more inclined to vote along State lines, with some exceptions.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

The Senate has the power to reject, amend or defer bills passed by the [[Australian House of Representatives|lower house]], thus obliging the government of the day to negotiate with minor parties in the Senate (or the opposition) in order to pass its legislation. The Australian Senate cannot directly bring down a government, though it can pass an indicative motion of no confidence and has the power to defer or block [[Appropriation bill|supply bills]], as notoriously occurred in [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|the constitutional crisis of 1975]] which was precipitated, in part, by the deferment of supply through a manipulated balance of power.&lt;ref name="aph-Faulkner"/&gt;

==Canada==
Compared to other [[Westminster System]]s, minority governments are far more common in Canada.  Much of this is credited to the relatively uneven electoral demographics of the country, with most national parties relying on regional bases.  Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, minority Parliaments were quite common in Canada, and produced many subsequent political compromises through political cooperation, mostly between the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada]], which included the [[Canada Pension Plan]] and [[Universal Healthcare]] during the tenure of [[Lester B. Pearson]].  After the 1980 election, minority governments became less common in Canada for the next several decades, but the 2004 general election returned Canada to minority government, and the subsequent general elections of 2005-06 and 2008 would also result in minority governments, but the 2011 general election gave [[Stephen Harper]]'s Conservatives a clear majority in the House of Commons for the first time since the merging of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] and the [[Canadian Alliance]].

Despite the frequency of minority governments, however, coalitions are rare to nonexistent in Canadian democracy, especially in federal politics, and especially in the modern era.  A notable exception was the political crisis that arose during the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], in which the three opposition parties attempted to form a coalition government to oust the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], which held a minority mandate in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. This coalition failed, however, due to Governor-General [[Michaëlle Jean]]'s resulting prorogation of Parliament until January 2009.

At the provincial level, by contrast, coalitions have governed in the provincial Parliaments of [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]] and [[British Columbia]].

==United Kingdom==
The normal UK response to a "hung" or "balanced" parliament is the formation of a minority government. Coalitions or even formal agreements by one party to support the government of another party are rare.

'''1847-1852''' [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] 325, [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] 292, [[Repeal Association|Irish Repeal]] 36, [[Irish Confederate]] 2, [[Chartism|Chartist]] 1. Total seats 656.

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1847]] produced a House of Commons in which no group had a clear majority. Candidates calling themselves Conservatives won the largest number of seats.  However, the split among the Conservatives between the majority of Protectionists, led by [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], and the minority of free traders, known also as the [[Peelites]], led by former prime minister [[Sir Robert Peel]], left the Whigs, led by prime minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in a position to continue in government.

The Irish Repeal group won more seats than in the previous general election, while the Chartists' [[Feargus O'Connor]] gained the only seat the party would ever hold.

'''1885-1886''' [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] 319, Conservative 249, [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] 86, Others 16. Total seats 670.

As a result of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885]] there was no single party with a majority in the House of Commons. The Irish Nationalists, led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] had the balance of power.

The Conservative minority government (led by [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|the Marquess of Salisbury]]), which had come to office earlier in the year after the  Parnellites and dissident Liberals had defeated the Liberal government of [[William Ewart Gladstone|W.E. Gladstone]], improved its position in the election but not sufficiently to obtain a majority. During the general election Parnell had called on Irish voters in Britain to vote Tory (i.e. Conservative).

However, as Gladstone was willing to propose a measure of [[Home Rule]] for Ireland which Salisbury opposed, Parnell decided to bring down the Conservative ministry when the new parliament met. A Liberal minority government came into office in January 1886.

'''1892-1895''' Conservative and [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] 313, Liberal 272, Irish Nationalists 81, Others 4. Total seats 670.

The situation was similar to that in 1885-86. Following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1892]], although the Irish Nationalists were split between pro and anti-Parnellite factions, they all still preferred the pro-Home-Rule Liberals to the anti-Home-Rule Unionists of Salisbury. The Conservative government was defeated early in the new parliament and Gladstone formed a new Liberal minority government.

'''1910-1915''' [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910]] Liberal 274, Conservative and Liberal Unionist 272, Irish Nationalists 82, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] 40, Other 2. Total seats 670.

[[United Kingdom general election, December 1910]] Liberal 272, Conservative and Liberal Unionist 271, Irish Nationalists 84, Labour 42, Other 1. Total seats 670.

The Liberal government of [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]] continued in office as a stable minority administration. Despite strains, both the Irish and Labour members preferred a Liberal government to a Conservative one. This continued to be the case until Asquith formed a Liberal-Conservative-Labour coalition to prosecute the First World War.

'''1923-1924''' [[United Kingdom general election, 1923]] Conservative 258, Labour 191, Liberal 158, Others 8. Total seats 615.

The 1923 general election led to the defeat of the Conservative government of [[Stanley Baldwin]]. The Labour Party of [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed a minority government in January 1924. Although the party with the balance of power (Asquith's Liberals) appeared to be in a very strong position, the Labour leaders made a deliberate decision not to reach any agreement with the Liberals. As the Liberal Party did not want to join forces with the Conservatives and could not afford a quick general election, they were left in the awkward position of having to vote with the government on measures they had not been consulted about.

The Labour government eventually fell when, in a debate about alleged political interference in a decision whether to prosecute a Communist newspaper editor, the Conservative Party abandoned its own motion and voted for a Liberal one which thus passed and caused the resignation of the Labour government.

'''1929-1931''' [[United Kingdom general election, 1929]] Labour 287, Conservative 260, Liberal 59, Others 9. Total seats 615.

The situation was similar to 1923-1924. However the Labour Party was the largest party in the House of Commons, so the Liberals (now led by [[David Lloyd George]]) could abstain without bringing down the new Labour minority government.

As the world economic situation worsened, MacDonald had some discussions with Lloyd George. These led to a government bill to introduce the Australian style [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]] electoral system. This measure was being obstructed by the Conservative Party and dissident Labour politicians and had not become law before the Labour government fell. A National government was formed, in 1931, with the support of a part of the Labour Party and Conservative and Liberal leaders.

'''February - October 1974''' [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974]] Labour 301, Conservative 297, Liberal 14, Others 23. Total seats 635.

This election led to the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] losing its majority, with [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour Party winning four more seats. However no two parties (other than Conservative and Labour) could jointly provide a majority in the House of Commons. The balance of power was held jointly by the Liberals and others ([[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Scottish National Party]], with the Northern Irish members)&amp;mdash;who were unlikely to act together.

Heath entered into discussions with the Liberal leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]]. No agreement was reached, mostly because Heath was not prepared to agree to electoral reform.  Also, the Liberals were not keen to support a government which had just lost an election (although it did narrowly win the popular vote). In any event, a Conservative-Liberal coalition would have been a minority government and would have needed the support of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (which had recently broken with the Conservatives) to command a bare majority of seats.

Heath resigned and Wilson then formed a minority government.

'''2010–2015''' [[United Kingdom general election, 2010]] Conservative 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57, Others 29. Total seats 650.

This election led to [[David Cameron]]'s Conservative Party being the largest party with no majority. The balance of power was held jointly by the Liberal Democrats and others (the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], [[Plaid Cymru]] and [[Scottish National Party]], with the Northern Irish members)&amp;mdash;who were unlikely to act together.

Labour incumbent Gordon Brown and Cameron announced their intentions to enter discussions with the Lib Dem leader [[Nick Clegg]], open to signing a deal to allow a government to be formed. Having stated before the election that the party with the largest number of seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour were also held, but Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as a stumbling block to formulating a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. Thus, Brown announced that he would step down as Labour leader by September 2010. With Labour attempting to form its own coalition government, the Conservatives promised the Liberal Democrats a referendum on changing the voting mechanism to the Alternative Vote (AV) system. In response Labour said that they would introduce AV then hold a referendum asking the public to approve it.

However, by 11 May, the possibility of a [[Lib-Lab deal]] was looking unlikely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued, and after concluding that he would not be able to form a government, Gordon Brown announced his resignation on the evening of 11 May. Cameron became Prime Minister and announced his intention to form a coalition government, the first since the Second World War, with the Liberal Democrats. As one of his first moves, Cameron appointed Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister. Later that day, the two parties jointly published the [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]] specifying the terms of the coalition deal.

'''Bats''' (also '''Batsi''', '''Batsbi''', '''Batsb''', '''Batsaw''', '''Tsova-Tush''') is the endangered language of the [[Bats people]], a [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] minority group, and is part of the [[Nakh languages|Nakh]] family of [[Caucasian language]]s. It had 2,500 to 3,000 speakers in 1975.

There is only one dialect. It exists only as a spoken language, as the Bats people use [[Georgian language|Georgian]] as their written language. The language is not mutually intelligible with either [[Chechen language|Chechen]] or [[Ingush language|Ingush]], the other two members of the Nakh family.

==History==
Until the middle of the 19th century, the Tsovians lived in [[Tushetia]], the mountain region of Northeast Georgia. They were expected to have come settled with Tush people in mid centuries later became assimilated with other Tush people and now are known as one of four tush subgroups. The [[Tsova Gorge]] in Tushetia was inhabited by four Bats communities: the Sagirta, Otelta, Mozarta and Indurta. Later they settled on the [[Kakhetia Plain]], in the village of [[Zemo-Alvani]], where they still live. Administratively they are part of the [[Akhmeta]] district of Georgia.

==Classification==
Bats belongs to the [[Nakh languages|Nakh]] family of [[Northeast Caucasian languages]].

==Geographic distribution==
Most speakers of Bats live in the village of [[Zemo-Alvani]], on the [[Kakhetia Plain]], in the [[Akhmeta]] district of Georgia. There are some families of Bats in [[Tbilisi]] and other bigger towns in Georgia.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
Bats has a typical triangular five-vowel system with short–long contrast (except for '''u''', which has no long form). Bats also has a number of diphthongs, '''ei''', '''ui''', '''oi''', '''ai''', '''ou''', and '''au'''.&lt;ref&gt;HG1994{{Citation broken|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All vowels and diphthongs have nasalized allophones that are the result of phonetic and morphophonemic processes; this is represented by a superscript '''n''', as in '''kʼnateⁿ''' ''boy-&lt;small&gt;GEN&lt;/small&gt;''.

=== Consonants ===
Bats has a relatively typical consonant inventory for a Northeast Caucasian language. Unlike its close relatives, [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]], Bats has retained the lateral fricative /ɬ/.

==Grammar==
{{Expand section|date=September 2012}}
The first grammar of Bats – ''Über die Thusch-Sprache'' – was compiled by the [[Germany|German]] [[oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Anton Schiefner]] (1817–1879) making it into the first grammar of any indigenous Caucasian languages based on sound scientific principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Tuite]] (2007). [http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/tuitekj/caucasus/IberoCaucasian.pdf The rise and fall and revival of the Ibero-Caucasian hypothesis], pp. 7-8. ''Historiographia Linguistica'', 35 #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noun classes===
Traditional analyses posit that Bats has eight [[noun class]]es, the highest number among the Northeast Caucasian languages—however, a more-recent analysis gives only five classes.&lt;ref name=HG1994/&gt; This analysis (not unlike analyses of [[Lak language|Lak]]) yields the grouping shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
! Label !! Sg. !! Pl. !! Description !! Members
|-
| M      || '''v''' || '''b''' || male humans   || '''mar''' "husband" &lt;br&gt; '''ʕuv''' "shepherd" &lt;br&gt; '''voħ''' "son"
|-
| F      || '''j''' || '''d''' || female humans || '''nan''' "mother" &lt;br&gt; '''pstʼu''' "wife" &lt;br&gt; '''joħ''' "daughter"
|-
| D      || '''d''' || '''d''' || various       || '''bader''' "child" &lt;br&gt; '''kʼuit’ĭ''' "cat" &lt;br&gt; '''dokʼ''' "heart" &lt;br&gt; '''ditx''' "meat"
|-
| Bd     || '''b''' || '''d''' || animals       || '''carkʼ''' "tooth" &lt;br&gt; '''maiqĭ''' "bread" &lt;br&gt; '''qʼar''' "rain"
|-
| J      || '''j''' || '''j''' || various       || '''pħu''' "dog" &lt;br&gt; '''ča''' "bear" &lt;br&gt; '''matx''' "sun"
|-
| *Bd/J  || '''b''' || '''j''' || body parts (15 nouns) || '''bak''' "fist" &lt;br&gt; '''bʕarkʼ''' "eye" &lt;br&gt; '''čʼqʼempʼŏ''' ‘throat’
|-
| *D/J   || '''d''' || '''j''' || body parts (4 nouns)|| '''batʼr''' "lip", '''larkʼ''' "ear" &lt;br&gt; '''tʼotʼ''' "hand", '''čʼamaǧ''' "cheek"
|-
| *B/B   || '''b''' || '''b''' || only 3 nouns || '''borag''' "knit slipper" &lt;br&gt; '''čekam''' "boot" &lt;br&gt; '''kakam''' "autumn wool"
|}
Under this analysis, the additional three classes are examples of ''inquorate gender'', where the number of items displaying this behavior are insufficient to constitute an independent grouping. Furthermore, they can be explained as inflecting as one class in the singular, and another in the plural, e.g. the B/B group agrees as if it belonged to Bd class in the singular, but male human class in the plural.

===Noun cases===
Batsbi makes use of nine [[noun case]]s total, though in the majority of nouns the [[Ergative case|ergative]] and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] case have a common form.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Cases !! Singular  !!  Plural  !!  Singular  !!  Plural
|-
| [[Nominative case|Nominative]] || nekʼ || nekʼi || cokʼal || cokʼli
|-
| [[Genitive case|Genitive]]
| nekʼe&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;  
| nekʼa&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
| cokʼle&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
| cokʼla&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| [[Dative case|Dative]]         || nekʼen || nekʼin || cokʼlen || cokʼlin
|-
| [[Ergative case|Ergative]], &lt;br&gt; [[Instrumental case|Instrumental]] ||  nekʼev || nekʼiv || cokʼlev || cokʼliv
|-
| Contacting || nek’ex || nekʼax || cokʼlex || cokʼlax
|-
| [[Allative case|Allative]] || nekʼegŏ || nekʼigŏ || cokʼlegŏ || cokʼligŏ
|-
| [[Adverbial case|Adverbial]] || nekʼeǧ || nekʼiǧ || cokʼleǧ || cokʼliǧ
|-
| Commitive
| nekʼci&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;br&gt; nekʼeci&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
| nekʼici&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
| cokʼleci&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
| cokʼlici&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
! !! colspan="2" | ''“knife”'' !! colspan="2" | ''“fox”''
|}

===Numerals===
Like most of its relatives, Batsbi's numerals are [[vigesimal]], using 20 as a common base. This is mainly evident in the construction of higher decads, so that 40  '''šauztʼqʼ''' formed from 2 × 20 and 200 '''icʼatʼqʼ''' is 10 × 20.&lt;ref name=HG1994/&gt; When modifying nominals, the numeral precedes the noun it modifies.

In Bats, as in the its closest relatives [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]], the number '''Dʕivʔ''' ''"four"'' actually begins with a noun-class marker, represented by '''D''' (by default, or another capital for the other classes). This marker will agree in class with the class of the nominal which the number modifies, even if that nominal is not overtly expressed and only apparent through pragmatic or discursive context, as in '''Vʕivʔev''' ''"four (males)"''. This is seen in the word ''"four"'' itself as well as its derivatives.

===Verbs===
Bats has explicit inflections for [[Agent (grammar)|agentivity]] of a verb; it makes a distinction between '''{{IPA|as woʒe}}''' ''I fell down'' (i.e. through no fault of my own) and '''{{IPA|so woʒe}}''' ''I fell down'' (i.e. and it was my own fault).

The '''Chinese family of scripts''' are writing systems descended from the Chinese [[Oracle Bone Script]] and used for a variety of languages in East Asia. They include [[logosyllabic]] systems such as the [[Chinese script]] itself (or ''hanzi'', now in two forms, [[Traditional Chinese|traditional]] and [[Simplified Chinese|simplified]]), and adaptations to other languages, such as [[Kanji]] ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]), [[Hanja]] ([[Korean language|Korean]]), [[Chữ nôm]] ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]) and [[sawndip]] ([[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]]). More divergent are [[Tangut script|Tangut]], [[Khitan large script]], and its offspring [[Jurchen script|Jurchen]], as well as [[Yi script]] and possibly Korean [[Hangul]], which were inspired by Chinese although not directly descended from it. The partially deciphered [[Khitan small script]] may be another. In addition, various phonetic scripts descend from Chinese characters, of which the best known are the various [[kana]] syllabaries, the [[zhuyin]] [[semi-syllabary]], [[nüshu]], and some influence on hangul.{{sfnp|Zhou|1991}}

The Chinese scripts are written in various [[calligraphic hand]]s, principally [[Seal script]], [[Clerical script]], [[Regular script]], [[Semi-cursive script]], and [[Grass script]]. (See [[Chinese calligraphy]] and [[Chinese script styles]].) Adaptations range from the conservative, as in Korean, which used Chinese characters in their standard form with only a few local coinages, and relatively conservative Japanese, which has coined a few hundred new characters and used traditional character forms until the mid-20th century, to the extensive adaptations of Zhuang and Vietnamese, each coining over 10,000 new characters by Chinese formation principles, to the highly divergent [[Tangut script]], which formed over 5,000 new characters by its own principles.

{{main|Chinese character}}

=== Origins ===
[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapula.jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Ox scapula inscribed with Oracle Bone Script, the ancestor of the Chinese family of scripts]]
[[File:Chinese inscription on a bronze ware.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]], on a bronze vessel dated to the early [[Western Zhou]] period, 11th century BC]]
The earliest Chinese writing consists of divinatory texts inscribed on ox [[scapula]]e and tortoise [[plastron]]s found at the last [[Shang dynasty]] capital near [[Anyang]] and dating from 1200 BC.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|p=31}}
This [[Oracle Bone Script]] shows extensive simplification and linearization, which most researchers believe indicates an extensive period of development.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=58}}
Although some [[Neolithic signs in China|Neolithic symbols]] have been found on pottery, jade or bone at a variety of sites in China, there is no consensus that any of them are directly related to the Shang oracle bone script.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=35–39}}
[[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze inscriptions]] from about 1100 BC are written in a developed form of the script and provide a richer body of text.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=61–62}}

Each character of the early script represents a word of [[Old Chinese]], which at that time was uniformly monosyllabic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=58}}
The strategies used are traditionally classified into six categories (六書 ''liùshū'' "six writings") first recorded in the second century dictionary ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''.
Three of these categories involved a representation of the meaning of the word:
# Pictograms (象形字 ''xiàngxíngzì'') represent a word by a picture (later stylized) such as {{linktext|日}} ''rì'' "sun", {{linktext|人}} ''rén'' "person" and {{linktext|木}} ''mù'' "tree".
# Ideograms (指事字 ''zhǐshìzì'') are abstract symbols such as {{linktext|三}} ''sān'' "three" and {{linktext|上}} ''shàng'' "up".
# Semantic compounds (會意字 ''huìyìzì'') combine simpler elements to indicate the meaning of the word, as in {{linktext|林}} ''lín'' "grove" (two trees).
Evolved forms of these characters are still in among the most commonly used today.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|pp=411–412}}

Words that could not be represented pictorially, such as abstract terms and grammatical particles, were denoted using characters for similar-sounding words (the [[rebus]] strategy).
These phonetic loans (假借字 ''jiǎjièzì'') are thus new uses of existing characters rather than new graphic forms.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=59–62}}
An example is {{linktext|來}} ''lái'' "come", written with the character for a similar-sounding word meaning "wheat".{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=61}}
Sometimes the borrowed character would be modified slightly to distinguish it from the original, as with {{linktext|毋}} ''wú'' "don't", a borrowing of {{linktext|母}} ''mǔ'' "mother".{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|pp=413–414}}

Phono-semantic compounds (形聲字 ''xíngshēngzì'') were obtained by adding semantic indicators to disambiguate phonetic loans.
This type was already used extensively on the oracle bones, and has been the main source of new characters since then.
For example, the character {{linktext|其}} originally representing ''jī'' "winnowing basket" was also used to write the pronoun and modal particle ''qí''.
Later the less common original word was written with the compound {{linktext|箕}}, obtained by adding the symbol {{linktext|竹}} ''zhú'' "bamboo" to the character.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=60}}
Sometimes the original phonetic similarity has been obscured by millennia of sound change, as in {{linktext|格}} ''gé'' &lt; *''krak'' "go to" and {{linktext|路}} ''lù'' &lt; *''graks'' "road".{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=329}}
Many characters often explained as semantic compounds were originally phono-semantic compounds that have been obscured in this way.
Some authors even dispute the validity of the semantic compound category.{{sfnp|Boltz|1994|pp=72, 147–149, 153–154}}

The sixth traditional category (轉注字 ''zhuǎnzhùzì'') contained very few characters, and its meaning is uncertain.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=69}}

=== Styles ===
{{main|Chinese script styles}}
Development and simplification of the script continued during the [[Zhou dynasty|Western Zhou]] and [[Spring and Autumn period]]s, with characters becoming less pictorial and more linear and regular, with rounded strokes being replaced by sharp angles.
During the [[Warring States period]], writing became more widespread, with further simplification and variation, particularly in the eastern states.
After the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] unified China, its more conservative [[seal script]] became the standard for the whole country.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=58, 61–63}}
A simplified form known as the [[clerical script]] became the standard during the [[Han dynasty]], and later evolved into the [[regular script]] still used today.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=63, 65–67}}
At the same time [[semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]]s developed.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=70}}

The [[Traditional Chinese]] script is currently used in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.
Mainland China and Singapore use the [[Simplified Chinese]] variant.

=== Dialectal writing ===
Until the early 20th century, formal writing employed [[Literary Chinese]], based on the vocabulary and syntax of [[Four Books and Five Classics|classical works]].
The script was also used less formally to record local varieties, which had over time diverged from the classical language and each other.
The logographic script easily accommodated differences in pronunciation, meaning and word order, but often new characters were required for words that could not be related to older forms.
Many such characters were created using the traditional methods, particularly phono-semantic compounds.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=74–77}}

== Adaptations for other languages ==
The Chinese script was for a long period the only writing system in East Asia, and was also hugely influential as the vehicle of the dominant Chinese culture.
Korea, Japan and Vietnam [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adopted Chinese literary culture]] as a whole.
For many centuries, all writing in neighbouring societies was done in [[Classical Chinese]], albeit influenced by the writer's native language.
Although they wrote in Chinese, writing about local subjects required characters to represent names of local people and places.
Later they sought to use the script to write their own languages.
Chinese characters were adapted to represent the words of other languages using a range of strategies, including
* representing loans from Chinese using their original characters,
* representing words with characters for similar-sounding Chinese words,
* representing words with characters for Chinese words with similar meanings,
* creating new characters using the same formation principles as Chinese characters, especially phono-semantic compounds, and
* creating new characters in other ways, such as compounds of pairs of characters indicating the pronunciation of the initial and final parts of a word respectively (similar to Chinese ''[[fanqie]]'' spellings).
The principle of representing one monosyllabic word with one character was readily applied to neighbouring languages to the south with a similar [[analytic language|analytic]] structure to Chinese, such as [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]].
The script was a poorer fit for the polysyllabic [[agglutinative]] languages of the north-east, such as [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] languages.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=111–136}}

=== Korean ===
{{main|Hanja|Hangul}}
Chinese characters adapted to write Korean are known as ''Hanja''.
From the 9th century, [[Korean language|Korean]] was written using a number of systems collectively known as [[Idu script|Idu]], in which Hanja were used to write both Sino-Korean and native Korean roots, and a smaller number of Hanja were used to write Korean grammatical morphemes with similar sounds. 
The overlapping uses of Hanja made the system complex and difficult to use, even when reduced forms for grammatical morphemes were introduced with the [[Gugyeol]] system in the 13th and 14th centuries.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=116–117}}

The [[Hangul]] alphabet introduced in the 15th century was much simpler, and specifically designed for the sounds of Korean.
The alphabet makes systematic use of modifiers corresponding to features of Korean sounds.
Although Hangul is unrelated to Chinese characters, its letters are written in syllabic blocks that can be interspersed with Hanja. 
Such a [[Korean mixed script]] became the usual way of writing the language, with roots of Chinese origin denoted by Hanja and all other elements rendered in Hangul. Hanja is still used (but not very commonly like the Japanese) and is required in both North and South Korea.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=118–122}}

Historically, a few characters were coined in Korea, such as 畓; these are known as ''[[gukja]]'' (國字).

=== Japanese ===
[[File:Katakana origine.svg|thumb|right|Katakana with ''man'yōgana'' equivalents (segments of ''man'yōgana'' adapted into katakana shown in red)]]
[[File:Hiragana origin.svg|thumb|right|Development of hiragana from ''man'yōgana'']]
{{main|Japanese writing system}}
Chinese characters adapted to write [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words are known as [[kanji]].
Chinese words borrowed into Japanese could be written with the Chinese character, while Japanese words could be written using the character for a Chinese word of similar meaning.
Because there have been multiple layers of borrowing into Japanese, a single kanji may have several readings in Japanese.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=122–129}}

Other systems, known as [[kana]], used Chinese characters phonetically to transcribe the sounds of Japanese syllables.
An early system of this type was [[Man'yōgana]], as used in the 8th century anthology ''[[Man'yōshū]]''.
This system was not quite a [[syllabary]], because each Japanese syllable could be represented by one of several characters, but from it were derived two syllabaries still in use today.
They differ because they sometimes selected different characters for a syllable, and because they used different strategies to reduce these characters for easy writing: the angular [[katakana]] were obtained by selecting a part of each character, while [[hiragana]] were derived from the cursive forms of whole characters.
Such classic works as [[Lady Murasaki]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' were written in hiragana, the only system permitted to women of the time.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=129–132}}

Modern Japanese writing uses a composite system, using kanji for [[word stem]]s, hiragana for inflexional endings and grammatical words, and katakana to transcribe non-Chinese loanwords.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=132–133}}

A few hundred characters have been coined in Japan; these are known as ''[[kokuji]]'' (国字), and include natural phenomena, particularly fish, such as 鰯 (sardine), together with everyday terms such as 働 (work) and technical terms such as 腺 (gland).

=== Vietnamese ===
{{main|Chữ nôm}}
[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] was first written from the 13th century using the ''Chữ nôm'' script based on Chinese characters, but the system developed in a quite different way than in Korea or Japan.
Vietnamese was and is a strongly analytic language with many distinct syllables (roughly 4,800 in the modern standard language), so there was little motivation to develop a syllabary.
As with Korean and Japanese, characters were used to write borrowed Chinese words, native words with a similar sound and native words with a similar meaning.
In the Vietnamese case, the latter category consisted mainly of early loans from Chinese that had come to be accepted as native.
The Vietnamese system also involved creation of new characters using Chinese principles, but on a far greater scale than in Korea or Japan.
The resulting system was highly complex and was never mastered by more than 5% of the population.
It was completely replaced in the 20th century by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=73–84}}{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=119–125}}

=== Zhuang ===
{{main|Sawndip}}
[[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] has been written using [[Sawndip]] for over a thousand years. The script uses both Chinese characters and new characters formed using the traditional methods, as well as some formed by combining pairs of characters to indicate the pronunciation of a word by the ''fanqie'' method.{{sfnp|Holm|2008}} The number of new created characters is similar in scale to the Chu nom of Vietnam. Even though an official alphabet-based writing system for Zhuang was introduced in 1957, Sawndip is still more often used in less formal situations.&lt;ref&gt;《广西壮族人文字使用现状及文字社会声望调查研究》 "Research into survey of the scripts used by Zhuang in Guangxi" 唐未平 Tang Weiping http://www.doc88.com/p-644582398739.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
Several peoples in southwest China recorded laws, songs and other religious and cultural texts by representing words of their languages using a mix of Chinese characters with a similar sound or meaning, or pairs of Chinese characters indicating pronunciation using the ''[[fanqie]]'' method.
The languages so recorded included [[Hmongic languages|Miao]], [[Mienic languages|Yao]],{{sfnp|Lemoine|Chiao|1991|p=509}} [[Bouyei language#Ancient Bouyei script|Bouyei]],{{sfnp|Snyder|2008|p=378}} [[Kam language|Kam]],{{sfnp|Yang|Edmondson|2008|p=580}} [[Bai language|Bai]]{{sfnp|Wang|2004|p=279}} and [[Hani language|Hani]].{{sfnp|Zhou|1991}}
All these languages are now written using Latin-based scripts.

Chinese characters were also used to transcribe the Mongolian text of ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''.

== Scripts influenced by Chinese ==
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - edict plate 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze edict plate with Tangut characters]]
Between the 10th and 13th centuries, northern China was ruled by foreign dynasties that created scripts for their own languages.
The [[Khitan large script]] and [[Khitan small script]], which in turn influenced the [[Tangut script]] and [[Jurchen script]], used characters that superficially resemble Chinese characters, but with the exception of a few loans were constructed using quite different principles.
In particular the Khitan small script contained phonetic sub-elements arranged in a square block in a manner similar to the more sophisticated Hangul system devised later for Korean.{{sfnp|Sofronov|1991}}

Other scripts in China that borrowed or adapted some Chinese characters but are otherwise distinct include [[Geba script]], [[Sui script]], [[Yi script]] and the [[Lisu language#Lisu syllabary|Lisu syllabary]].{{sfnp|Zhou|1991}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">[[Image:Cunningham.jpg|thumb|Cunningham downhaul]]

In [[sailing]], a '''cunningham''' or '''cunningham's eye''' is a type of [[downhaul]] used on a [[Bermuda rigged]] sailboat to change the shape of a sail. It is named after its [[inventor]], [[Briggs Cunningham]], a victorious [[America's Cup]] [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] and [[yacht]] builder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/05/sports/briggs-cunningham-96-racecar-pioneer-and-sailing-champ.html |title=Briggs Cunningham, 96, Racecar Pioneer and Sailing Champ |author=Barbara Lloyd |date=July 5, 2003 |work=Obituaries |publisher=''The New York Times'' |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cunningham differs from a typical downhaul in the way that it attaches to the sail. The system usually consists of a line which is secured at one end to the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] or [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] below the [[Parts of a sail#The edges|foot]] of the mainsail. It is then passed through a [[cringle]] in the [[Parts of a sail#The edges|luff]] of the sail near the foot, but above the [[Parts of a sail#The corners|tack]], and then led down on the other side to a fitting on the mast or boom or on [[deck (ship)|deck]].

The tension in the luff of the sail is adjusted using a combination of the [[halyard]] and the cunningham (where fitted). The primary advantage of adjusting the cunningham is the speed and ease with which the luff tension can be changed while sailing or racing. By either hauling or easing the line, the tension in the luff can be changed, thereby shifting the point of maximum [[draft (sailing)|draft]] of the sail forward or aft respectively, optimizing sail shape and thus performance. It is a fine control which is used more frequently on racing sailboats than on cruising or day-sailing boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingcourse.com/keelboat/sail_shape.htm|title=Sail shape|author=|date=|work=|publisher=U.S. Sailing|accessdate=15 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805225103/http://www.sailingcourse.com/keelboat/sail_shape.htm|archivedate=5 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Desakota''' is a term used in [[urban geography]] used to describe areas in the extended surroundings of large cities, in which urban and agricultural forms of land use and settlement coexist and are intensively intermingled.

The term was coined by the urban researcher Terry McGee of the [[University of British Columbia]] around 1990. It comes from [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''desa'' "[[village]]" and kota "[[city]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Stephen |last=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate: Reflecting on Urban Form in Southeast Asia |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desakota areas typically occur in Asia, especially [[South East Asia]]. Examples can be found in the urbanised regions of [[Java]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Terry G. |last=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ in an Era of Volatile Globalization |work=Critical Reflections on Cities in Southeast Asia |year=2002 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; the densely populated, delta-shaped areas on the peripheries of the [[Jakarta]] agglomeration ("[[Jabodetabek]]"), but also the extended metropolitan regions of [[Bangkok]] or [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=Reconstructing ›The Southeast Asian City‹ |year=2002 |pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desakota areas are situated outside the periurban zones, from which daily commuting is easily possible, i.e. more than 30 or 50&amp;nbsp;km off the city centre. They often sprawl alongside arterial and communication roads, sometimes from one agglomeration to the next. They are characterised by high population density and intensive agricultural use (especially [[Paddy field|wet-rice cultivation]]), but differ from densely populated rural areas by more urban-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=McGee |title=The Emergence of ''Desakota'' Regions in Asia. |year=1991 |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria are: developed transport networks, high population mobility, increasing activity outside the agricultural sector, the coexistence of many different forms of land use, more female participation in paid labour, and unregulated land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Chia |first1=Lin Sien |first2=Martin |last2=Perry |title=Introduction |work=Southeast Asia Transformed: A Geography of Change |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |place=Singapur |year=2003 |isbn=981-230-119-4 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their rambling extent and indistinct boundaries, the emergence of Desakota regions brings difficulties for the administration, as uniform plans, regulations or designs are hardly viable. Desakota regions are characterised by high mobility of goods and services and rapid change in patterns of settlement. They usually elude the division in functually specialised zones that is conventionally applied in urban geography. Completely different forms of use, as e.g. traditional agriculture, large scale and cottage industry, amusement parks and golf courses, shopping centres and retail parks, and forms of settlement from [[shanty town]]s to [[gated community]] coexist in them close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Cairns |title=Troubling Real-estate |year=2002 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside South East Asia, areas with comparable features have been described in China,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Guldin |title=Desakotas and Beyond |year=1997 |pages=48, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Daniel Z. |last1=Sui |first2=Hui |last2=Zeng |title=Modeling the dynamics of landscape structure in Asia’s emerging desakota regions: A case study in Shenzhen |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |volume=53 |issue=1–4 |year=2001 |pages=37–52 |doi=10.1016/s0169-2046(00)00136-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Yichun |last1=Xie |first2=Michael |last2=Batty |authorlink2=Michael Batty |first3=Kang |last3=Zhao |title=Simulating Emergent Urban Form: Desakota in China |series=CASA Working Paper |number=95 |publisher=Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1267/1/paper95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, Japan, Taiwan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=C.S. |last1=Stone |first2=Chang-Liang |last2=Chi |title=Contesting Urban and Rural Space in Desakota Regions of Taiwan — A Case Study of I-Lan County |journal=[[Environment and Urbanization ASIA]] |year=2012 |volume=3 |number=1 |pages=93–120 |doi=10.1177/097542531200300106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Hebbert |title=''Sen-biki'' amidst ''Desakota'' |year=1994 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Descriptive Color Names Dictionary''''' is a dictionary of [[color terms|color names]] used for mass-market clothing and consumer merchandise, such as those in [[mail order]] catalogs. It relates each color name to one or more [[Color chart#color selection cart|color swatches]] in the ''Color Harmony Manual'', a [[color atlas]] based on the [[Ostwald color system]]. The book was edited by Helen Taylor, Lucille Knoche, and Walter Granville, and was published by the [[Container Corporation of America]] in 1950 and distributed free to owners of the ''Color Harmony Manual''.

The editors decided to use the ''Color Harmony Manual'' and the Ostwald system as a basis for their dictionary because it is easy to relate to basic color names, includes the [[gamut|color gamut]] of most mass-market products, and has easily removable double-sided (one glossy, one matte) color chips. Because [[colorimetry|colorimetric]] coordinates of the ''Color Harmony Dictionary'' were published, the names can also be easily related to other color order systems.

== Choice of names == 

The editors chose the names for the dictionary and their corresponding colors by comparing the chips in the ''Color Harmony Manual'' to physical products advertised with color names, and also made reference to a number of already published color dictionaries. Where names referred to natural objects they examined those objects directly.

'''Edwin Davis French''' (1851–1906) was a [[bookplate]] engraver, who produced at least 330 engravings beginning in 1893.

Born in [[North Attleboro]], [[Massachusetts]], his artistic career had begun in 1869 with [[silver]] engraving for the [[Whiting Manufacturing Company]]. Later, he became a founding member and trustee of the [[American Fine Arts Society]]. Two men who influenced French's work were [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Charles W. Sherborn]]. Many of his patrons belonged to the [[Grolier Club]].

He was interested in [[constructed language]]s and was active in the [[Volapük]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catnyp.nypl.org/record=b3839685|title=Edwin Davis French papers, 1892–1904|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also learned [[Esperanto]].

His obituary in the ''New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://localwiki.org/hsl/Edwin_Davis_French|title=E. D. French Dead|work=New York Times, Dec 10, 1906|accessdate=Dec 14, 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt; relates:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. French's hobby was universal language, for he was a facile linguist. He was Secretary of the Volapük Society of America, and had a considerable library in that language. Esperanto (sic) and [[Idiom Neutral]] similarly attracted him. He was a member of the American Fine Arts Society, the International Academy of Volapük, Ex-Libres Society of London, Ex-Libres Verein of Berlin, the Grolier Club, National Arts Club, Club of Odd Volumes, and Bibliophile Society.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

French had suffered from poor health most of his life, having left [[Brown University]] in his sophomore year because of it, and eventually succumbed to [[tuberculosis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2751">'''Elin Brandell''' (14 August 1882- 27 June 1963), was a Swedish journalist and author. As a journalist, she was known under her signatures ''Opolitiska frun'' (Mrs Apolitical), ''Regan'' and ''Clementine''.

Elin Brandell was the daughter of professor [[Pontus Henriques]] (1852–1933) and married in 1908 to journalist Simon Brandell. She was employed at ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' in 1906-1937. Elin Brandell belonged to a club called ''Ligan'' ('The Gang') of female journalists including [[Elin Wägner]], [[Gerda Marcus]], [[Ester Blenda Nordström]], [[Ellen Rydelius]], [[Ellen Landquist]], [[Agnes Lindhagen]], [[Tora Bonnier]] and [[Célie Brunius]]. In 1912, she became the first woman to be given a foreign trip scholarship by ''[[Publicistklubben]]''.

Elin Brandell belonged to the elite of the Swedish press during her career and was well known celebrity. Her style is described as neutral but witty and intellectual. She is foremost known as ''Opolitiska frun'' ('Mrs Apolitical'), the signature under which she covered the debates in parliament from the gallery of the [[Riksdag]]. The MP [[Ivar Anderson]] recalled how it was regarded as a distinction for an MP to be portrayed by her: 
:"When I was elected to the Riksdag I was made aware of Elin Brandell, Mrs Apolitical of the ''Dagens Nyheter'', who had her customary seat at the gallery. I admired her elegant style, her ability to observe and her wit. Einar Rosenborg of DN accompanied her at least during the greater debates. I think it was above all he who encouraged Elin Brandell and advised her in her Riksdag [[Causerie]]s. She did not actually engage in any political comments but had her strength in the skillful descriptions of the atmosphere and her quick, witty and often rather ambushing personality analysis. She was quite a celebrity and one could see how the gentlemen of the chamber glanced longingly toward her as mention by Mrs Apolitical was a distinction, whether she delivered appreciation or criticism. I was myself once or twice given the honor, but I can only recall the occasion when she ironically let me know that I was as neat as the breast pin of a scarf."&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690-1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690-1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11043">'''Film promotion''' is the practice of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] specifically in the [[film industry]], and usually occurs in coordination with the process of [[film distribution]]. Sometimes called the '''press junket''' or '''film junket''', film promotion generally includes press releases, advertising campaigns, merchandising, franchising, media and interviews with the key people involved with the making of the film, like actors and directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=what is a press junket ?|url=http://www.stonecircle.tv/stone-circle-faqs/what-is-a-press-junket/|website=Stone Circle|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with all business, it is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk; [[movie studio|film studio]]s will invest in expensive [[marketing]] campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle. Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget. Publicity is generally handled by the distributor and exhibitors.

==Techniques ==

=== In theaters ===

* [[Film trailer|Trailer]]s are a mainstay of film promotion, because they are delivered directly to movie-goers. They screen in theatres before movie showings. Generally they tell the story of the movie in a highly condensed fashion compressing maximum appeal into two and half minutes.
* [[Film poster]]s
* [[Slideshow]]s - stills, trivia, and trivia games from the film, shown between movie showtimes.
* [[Standee]]s (freestanding paperboard life-size images of figures from the film)
* Cardboard 3D displays, sometimes producing sound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/12/28/cool-theater-displays-wall-e-and-indiana-jones-4/ |title= Cool Theater Displays: Wall-E and Indiana Jones 4 |first=Alex |last=Billington |publisher=FirstShowing.net |date=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television and radio===
* Hollywood movie distributors spend about $4 billion a year to buy paid advertising (30-second TV commercials, newspaper ads, etc.) and over half that total is placed on broadcast and cable TV, which are the main vehicles for advertising movies to audiences. TV is effective because it is an audio-visual medium – like film – and can deliver a vast audience quickly, which is crucial because films typically don’t linger in theaters more than 4–6 weeks, according to ''Marketing to Moviegoers: Second Edition''.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* Product placement: paid active or passive insertion (as on-set posters, and [[action figure]]s) of film brand in drama or sitcom shows, or as passing mentions in dialogue. For example, [[20th Century Fox]] commissioned an ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]''-themed motorcycle, featured on two episodes (2:17, 2:18) of ''[[American Chopper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/od/irobot/a/robotsl070704.htm |title=Interviews with Shia LaBeouf and Paul Teutul Jr. About "I, Robot"|publisher=About.com|first= Rebecca |last=Murray |date=July 7, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' was placed throughout an episode of the TV show ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2005/12/69775 |title=TV Writes Must Sell, Sell, Sell |first=David |last=Cohn|publisher=[[Wired Magazine]]|date=December 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extended placement: full episodes of television talkshows (''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]''), entertainment news programs (''[[Entertainment Tonight|ET]]''), or network news programs (''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''), devoted to compensated exposure of the film, stars, clips, director, etc.
** In addition, interviews with actors and directors which are filmed en masse at a hotel with local and national entertainment reporters which are featured on [[local news]] shows, programs on cable networks, and series such as [[Byron Allen]]'s series of entertainment series like ''[[Entertainment Studios]]''.
* Production and paid broadcast of [[making-of|behind-the-scenes documentary-style shows]], the type of which are mainly produced for [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and [[Starz (TV network)|Starz]]
* Advance trailers, longer previews, or behind-the-scenes footage on rental videos and DVDs

===Internet===
* Virtual relationship hyperlink marketing, wherein a major search engine (like Yahoo's main page) offers articles seemingly presenting interesting news related items, but which are actually back-end loaded with a links page containing multiple "mental references" to film characters, storylines or products. Example: Bond, Transformers, etc..., are connected to scientific invention news stories about advanced weaponry or robotics discoveries, which quickly leads the reader to pages loaded with the latest 007 or Megatron movie clip or art director's fantastical ideas and designs, thus hooking readers with a "bait and switch" story.
* Creation of standalone studio-sponsored per-film websites such as "example-the-movie.com".
* '''Online digital film screeners''': These digital film screeners have the benefit of letting you send individual copies of your film or a promo to the press, sales agents, distributors etc. Using them its simple to send individually controlled copies of your film to various recipients with different expiry dates. Along with the security of individual expiry dates, you can see reports of who viewed your film and track their viewing of the film.
* [[Viral marketing]]: free distribution of trailers on movie-oriented [[website]]s and video user-generated-content websites, and rapid dissemination of links to this content by email and blogs. Includes alleged leakage of supposed "rushes" and "early trailers" of film scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-30/tech/girl.dragon.tattoo.trailer_1_trailer-leak-dragon-tattoo?_s=PM:TECH/ |title=Mysterious 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' trailer leaked online |publisher= CNN.com|first= Doug |last=Gross |date=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the efforts go further such as in the lead time to the successful premiere of the film, ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' which was preceded by several original [[film short]]s on [[YouTube]] over a number of years while the film was in production.
* Creation of [[Internet marketing|Internet Marketing]] campaign using Paid Advertisement and [[Social media marketing|Social Media Marketing]]

===Print===
* Paid [[advertisements|advertisement]] in newspapers, magazines, and inserts in books.
* Cross-promotion of original book or novelization, including special printings, or new cover jackets ("Now a major motion picture.")
* Comic special editions or special episodes

===Merchandising===
* Paid co-branding (''[[Eragon]]'' in ''[[American Chopper]]''-two episodes), or co-advertising ([[Aston Martin]] and [[James Bond]] films)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2002/11/21/news/james_bond/ |title=The Business of Bond |publisher=[[CNN Money]] |first=Lara |last=Magzan|date=November 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a product with the film
* Promotional giveaways: branded [[drink cup]]s, [[promotional toy|toys]], or food combinations at [[fast food chain]]s

===Promotional tours and interviews===
Film actors, directors, and producers appear for television, cable, radio, print, and online media [[interview]]s, which can be conducted in person or remotely. During film production, these can take place ''on set''.  After the film's premiere, key personnel make appearances in major market cities or participate remotely via satellite [[videoconference]] or telephone.  The purpose of interviews is to encourage journalists to publish stories about their "exclusive interviews" with the film's stars, thereby creating "[[marketing buzz]]" around the film and stimulating audience interest in watching the film.

When it comes to [[feature film]]s picked up by a [[major film studio]] for international distribution, promotional tours are notoriously grueling. Key cast and crew are often contracted to travel to several major cities around the world to promote the film and sit for dozens of interviews.  In every interview they are supposed to stay "on message" by energetically expressing their enthusiasm for the film in a way that appears candid, fun, and fresh, even though it may be their fifth or sixth interview that day.  They are expected to disclose just enough juicy "behind-the-scenes" information about the filmmaking process or the filmmakers' artistic vision to make each journalist feel like he or she got a nice [[Scoop (term)|scoop]], while at the same time tactfully avoiding disclosure of anything truly negative or embarrassing.

===Audience research===
There are seven distinct types of research conducted by film distributors in connection with domestic theatrical releases, according to "Marketing to Moviegoers: Second Edition." Such audience research can cost $1 million per film, especially when scores of TV advertisements are tested and re-tested. The bulk of research is done by major studios for the roughly 170 major releases they mount each year that are supported by tens of millions of advertising buys for each film. Independent film distributors, which typically spend less than $10 million in media buys per film, don’t have the budget or breadth of advertising materials to analyze, so they spend little or nothing on pre-release audience research.
When audience research is conducted for domestic theatrical release, it involves these areas:
*Positioning studies versus other films that will premiere at the same time.
*Test screenings of finished or nearly finished films; this is the most well known.
*Testing of audience response to advertising materials.
*Tracking surveys of audience awareness of a film starting six weeks before premiere.
*Exit surveys questioning film goers about their demographic makeup and effectiveness of marketing.
*Title testing in an early stage.
*Concept testing that would occur in development phase of a film before it is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing can play a big role in whether or not a film gets the green light. Audience research is a strong factor in determining the ability of a film to sell in theaters, which is ultimately how films make their money. As part of a movie's [[Marketing strategy]], audience research comes into account as producers create promotional materials. These promotional materials consistently change and evolve as a direct consequence of audience research up until the film opens in theaters.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Paul, and Janet Wasko.

A '''grinder''' is a crew member on a yacht whose duties include operating manual winches (called "coffee grinders") that raise and trim the sails and move the boom.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news |last= Fountain|first= Henry|date= 13 February 2010|title= Motors Have Muscled Out the Grinders|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/sports/14grinder.html|newspaper= New York Times|location= |access-date= 5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a physically demanding role with a significant impact on a racing yacht's overall performance.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first= SN|last2=Hume |first2= PA|last3=Cronin|first3=JB |last4=Slyfield |first4=D| date= September 2009 |title= Strength and power determinants of grinding performance in America's Cup sailors.|url= |journal= Journal of strength and conditioning research|publisher= |volume= 23|issue= 6|pages= 1883-9|doi= 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181b2ba55|PMID = 19675468}}&lt;!--|access-date=27 July 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AC50]] class yachts used in the [[America's Cup]] competition have four positions (on each side) for grinders.  These must be continuously operated to generate the [[hydraulic pressure]] needed by the yacht's controls.  Until 2017, the machinery was arm operated winches.  However, in 2017 [[Team New Zealand]] changed their grinding system to pedal operated positions similar to exercise bikes.  This change reportedly gained a 40% increase in power delivered to the hydraulic system.&lt;ref&gt;Miles Dilworth, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sailing/2017/05/15/oracle-team-usa-americas-cup-defenders-copy-kiwis-surprise-move/ "Oracle Team USA: America’s Cup Defenders copy Kiwis in surprise move to pedal power"], ''The Telegraph'', 15 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous Tweets''' is a website that records [[minority language]] [[Twitter]] messages to help indigenous speakers contact each other. It was founded in March 2011 by Kevin Scannell, who does research in [[computational linguistics]] in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at [[Saint Louis University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], United States.&lt;ref name="Faculty webpage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://borel.slu.edu/ |title=Kevin Scannell's website |author=Scannel, Kevin |year=2012 |publisher=[[Saint Louis University]] |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yaron"&gt;{{cite news|title=האם האינטרנט יציל את הקולות שהוא משתיק? |author=הארץ |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/captain/spages/1222723.html |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |language=Hebrew |date=2011-03-29 |accessdate=2011-04-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y943YffU?url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/captain/spages/1222723.html |archivedate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The website's purpose is to enable minority language speakers to communicate on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite news|title=Micro-blogging in a mother tongue on Twitter |author=Lee, Dave |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9450488.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2011-04-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y92GGfsm?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/click_online/9450488.stm |archivedate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its homepage, the website displays a list of minority languages it has cached. After selecting a language, the user is brought to a table of everyone who is tweeting in that language. Indigenous Tweets provides the profile picture of each Twitter user and statistics about each person's number of followers. In addition to providing statistics about the percentage of tweets a person writes in different languages, Indigenous Tweets has a selection of the trending topics in the various minority languages.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

==History==
At the website's inception in March 2011, it cataloged 35 languages.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; On April 16, 2011, it recorded tweets in 76 minority languages.&lt;ref name="Martín"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rastreando lenguas minoritarias |author=Martín, Javier |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/Rastreando/lenguas/minoritarias/elpepirtv/20110416elpepirtv_1/Tes |newspaper=[[El País]] |date=2011-04-16 |accessdate=2011-04-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y95DGRxa?url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/Rastreando/lenguas/minoritarias/elpepirtv/20110416elpepirtv_1/Tes |archivedate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 26, 2011, the website supported 82.&lt;ref name="Manuel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kapampangan is 7th online |author=Manuel, Mark Anthony |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/315736/kapampangan-7th-online |newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2011-04-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yKHlZNUV?url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/315736/kapampangan-7th-online |archivedate=2011-04-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cataloged languages include the "esoteric" [[Gamilaraay language|Gamilaraay]] and the "better-known" [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]] and [[Basque language|Basque]],&lt;ref name="Ungerleider"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preserving Indigenous Languages Via Twitter |author=Ungerleider, Neal |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1747283/indigenous-tweet-preserving-indigenous-languages-via-twitter |journal=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-04-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y96DjcdE?url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1747283/indigenous-tweet-preserving-indigenous-languages-via-twitter |archivedate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which have the first and second most Tweeters, respectively.&lt;ref name="Mears"&gt;{{cite news|title=Basque second most tweeted minority language on Twitter |author=Olwen, Mears |url=http://www.eitb.com/news/technology/detail/639242/basque-second-most-tweeted-minority-language-twitter/ |publisher=[[EITB]] |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2011-04-22 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5y96lDFef?url=http://www.eitb.com/news/technology/detail/639242/basque-second-most-tweeted-minority-language-twitter/ |archivedate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Welsh language|Welsh]] is ranked third on Indigenous Tweets.&lt;ref name="Mears"/&gt;

I view things like Twitter and social media as an opportunity for smaller languages. A site like Indigenous Tweets is a good example of a website that allows people to connect and communicate and use their language in a natural way online.|source=Kevin Scannell, April 2011&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;}}
Indigenous Tweets employs a data bank of words and phrases from the minority languages to locate people who speak those languages. In an April 2011 interview with [[BBC News]], Scannell said that he has spent 8 years building a data bank of around 500 languages by reviewing blogs, newspapers, and websites.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

Indigenous Tweets gathers data through Twitter's [[application programming interface|API]] by searching a data bank of words and phrases from the minority languages.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; The website's search engine cannot decipher the language of a tweet when a word is in more than one language. To avoid this conundrum, Scannell inputs words that are unique to the language.&lt;ref name="Martín"/&gt;

'''Jeju''' ('''Cheju''') or '''(Jejueo)''' is a [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic language]] spoken in the [[Jeju Province]] of [[South Korea]]. It differs greatly from the [[Korean dialects]] of the mainland. [[Korean dialects|Standard Korean]] is the most common form of communication in Korea, whereas the Jeju dialect is considered a very local language. The Jeju language is mainly understood and spoken by the older generation. As of October 2014, the Jeju National University Foreign Language Institute has made efforts to save the fading language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studentlanguagepreservation.org/jeju-island-dialect.html|title=Jeju Island Dialect|website=Student Advocates for Language Preservation|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, only a relatively small group, consisting of around, or even fewer than, ten thousand individuals actively speak the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/jeju/about/|title=About the Jeju-eo Talking Dictionary|website=talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[UNESCO]] Atlas of the World's Endangered Languages, the Jeju language is listed as ''critically endangered'', the highest level of being endangered. Only 5,000–10,000 people speak the Jeju language, all of whom are above 70–75 years of age. Without a province-wide teaching mechanism of the Jeju language for the youth, the language may be extinct within 2–4 decades, making it a language in grave peril unless a teaching-mechanism is established by either the government or an educational institution in Jeju-do.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name is transcribed ''Jeju'' in [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]] and ''Cheju'' in [[McCune–Reischauer]]. In Korean, it is known as {{lang|ko|제주 방언}} ({{lang|ko|濟州方言}}) ''Jeju bang-eon'' or {{lang|ko|제주 사투리}} ''Jeju saturi'' "Jeju dialect", as {{lang|ko|제주어}} ({{lang|ko|濟州語}}) ''Jejueo'' "Jeju language",&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004870902 '제주어' 유네스코 소멸위기 언어 등록], Yonhap News, 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt; or as {{lang|ko|제주말}} ''Jejumal'' "Jeju speech". The last term, ''mal'' means both "language" and "dialect".

==Classification==
Although many South Koreans, including those who speak Jeju, consider it a dialect of the Korean language, it can be considered a separate language because it is mutually unintelligible with the Korean dialects on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Janhunen|first=Juha|authorlink=Juha Janhunen|title=Manchuria: An Ethnic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfJiAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Finno-Ugrian Society|isbn=978-951-9403-84-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] are also incorporated into Jeju, indicating further separation from Standard Korean.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jeju is characterized by a heavy accent containing many informal words and phrases, considered to be Korean slang.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/8409|title=Did you know Jejueo is endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recognized as a distinct language locally and by UNESCO.&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt; [[Glottolog]] also classifies it as a distinct language.  Government support of this language is provided through the Jeju Ministry of Education, and institutional support is provided by the Jeju Preservation Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/8409|title=Jejueo|last=|first=|date=|website=The Endangered Languages Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
There are around 5,000–10,000 fluent speakers today.&lt;ref name=unesco /&gt; Jeju was once spoken across Jeju Island, apart from the Chuja islands in the former [[Bukjeju County]] (currently [[Jeju City]]), where the ''Chuja dialect'', a variety of the [[Jeolla dialect]], is spoken. It also survives in diasporic enclaves in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{ELL2|Korea, Republic of (South): Language Situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic efforts have been carried out in an attempt to revitalize the language, such as the publication of a Jeju-eo-to-Korean dictionary and the establishment of the [[Jeju Peace Institute|Jeju Development Institute]]. However, it has been difficult to see progress due to a widening [[Culture gap|cultural]] and [[Generation gap|generational]] gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu/jeju/about/|title=About the Jeju-eo Talking Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=talkingdictionary.swarthmore.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, [[UNESCO]] added Jeju to its ''Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger'' as a "critically endangered language".&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_interactive_atlas_adds_two_more_endangered_languages/|title=New interactive atlas adds two more endangered languages|last=|first=|date=12 August 2010|website=www.unesco.org|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
The phonetic properties of obstruents in Jeju dialect is similar to Seoul Korean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Taehong|last2=Jun|first2=Sun-Ah|last3=Ladefoged|first3=Peter|year=2002|title=Acoustic and aerodynamic correlates of Korean stops and fricatives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447001901536|journal=Journal of Phonetics|volume=30|issue=2|pages=193–228|doi=10.1006/jpho.2001.0153|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unintelligibility of Jeju comes in larger part from other components of grammar such as morphosyntactic and/or lexical differences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; e.g. differences in the vowel system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Taehong|last2=Jun|first2=Sun-Ah|last3=Jung|first3=Seung-Chul|last4=Ladefoged|first4=Peter|year=2001|title=The Vowels of Cheju|url=http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE02191749|journal=Korean Journal of Linguistics|volume=26|issue=4|pages=810–816|issn=1229-4039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 9 vowels:

{| class=wikitable
| {{IPA|i}} ㅣ
| {{IPA|ɨ}} ㅡ
| {{IPA|u}} ㅜ
|-
| {{IPA|e}} ㅔ
| {{IPA|ə}} ㅓ
| {{IPA|o}} ㅗ
|-
| {{IPA|ɛ}} ㅐ
| {{IPA|a}} ㅏ
| {{IPA|ɒ}} ㆍ
|}

Jeju maintains the a''rae-a'' vowel ㆍ {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, which has been lost from standard Korean.

Presumably pronounced similar to modern ㅓ, but with less opening at the back of the throat.

Theㆍvowel formed a medial of its own, or was found in the diphthong ㆎ ''arae-ae'', written with the dot under the consonant and ㅣ to its right.

This vowel is not entirely obsolete outside of Jeju, as it can be found in various brand names. It is often just an aesthetic replacement for the ㅏ vowel in standard Korean.

=== Historical changes ===
* Middle Korean {{IPA|*kj}} &gt; Jeju {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}} (e.g. {{IPA|*kjər}} &gt; {{IPA|[t͡ɕəl]}} 'wave')
* Middle Korean {{IPA|*əːj}} &gt; Jeju {{IPA|[i]}} (e.g. {{IPA|*kəːj}} &gt; {{IPA|[ki]}} of [kiŋi] 'crab')

==Pragmatics==
A notable difference between Jeju and the dialects of mainland Korea is a lack of speech formality or honorific deference. For example, while a speaker of the [[Gyeonggi dialect]] might say {{lang|ko|안녕하세요}} ''annyeong haseyo'' ("Hello") or {{lang|ko|반갑습니다}} ''ban'gapseumnida'' ("Pleasure to meet you") to an older person, a speaker of the Jeju dialect would say {{lang|jje|반갑수다}} ''ban'gapsuda'', which would be roughly equivalent to "Howdy" or "Nice ta meet ya" in Gyeonggi dialect. In mainland Korea, it would be inappropriate for a child to say this to an adult, but this usage is normative in Jeju. This is also what caused a further division of language between Jeju island and mainland Korea; Jejueo was dubbed inferior to the standard Korean because of its casual tone and lack of the formal morphemes such as 요 (yo) in 안녕하세요 (an-nyong ha-sae-yo "hello").&lt;ref&gt;Suyeon, Ju. (2014). "Jeju Island Dialect." ''Student Advocates for Language Preservation.''Retrieved from https://www.studentlanguagepreservation.org/jeju-island-dialect.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Jeju preserves many archaic words which have been lost elsewhere, and has borrowed foreign words that are not found in standard Korean. Many words come from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/jeju.htm|title=Jeju|last=|first=|date=|website=www.omniglot.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==

===Verb===
;Present tense
Jeju honorifics differ from Standard Korean. Where the standard has declarative ㅂ니다 ''-mnida'', Jeju has 암/엄수다 ''-amsuda'' or ''-eomsuda.'' Where Korean has interrogative ㅂ니까? ''-mnikka?'', Jeju has 암/엄수과? ''-a/eomsugwa?''

|{{lang|jje|적엄수과?}}
|{{lang|ko|적습니까}}, {{lang|ko|적고 있습니까?}}
|writing?
|}

Stative verbs ("adjectives") are similar. Where standard has ㅂ니다/까 ''-mnida/mnikka'' or 습니다/까 ''-seumnida/seumnikka'', Jeju has 우다/꽈 ''-uda/uggwa'' or 수다/꽈 ''-suda/suggwa''.

'''Jijeli''', or '''Jijel Arabic''', is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken specifically in the [[Jijel Province]] in northeastern [[Algeria]], but traces of it reach parts of the neighboring [[Skikda]] and [[Mila Province]]s. It is quite different from all the other Arabic dialects spoken in eastern Algeria and has probably survived into present times because of the geographic enclavement of that mountainous area and the difficulty of terrestrial connections with the rest of the country for centuries.

Jijel is a relic of the [[Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects]] (resulting from the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]] in the 7th and 8th centuries) once spoken over all of [[Constantine, Algeria]] but later mixed with [[Bedouin]] [[Hilalian dialects]] brought by the invasion of the [[Banu Hilal]] in the 11th century.

Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects remained intact only in a small area around [[Jijel]] while they were heavily mixed with bedouin dialects in the areas of Constantine, [[Mila, Algeria|Mila]], [[Collo]] and [[El Milia]]. Pre-Hilalian dialects also remain in the urban areas of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], [[Rabat]], Tlemcen, Constantine and [[Tunis]]. Tlemcen Arabic and Jijel Arabic remain very close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieiop.com/pub/05caubet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306161259/http://www.ieiop.com/pub/05caubet.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jijel Arabic is also amongst the most Berber-influenced Arabic dialects of [[Algeria]].

'''José María Sánchez Carrión''' (born 1952, in [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]) is a Spanish linguist, specialised in [[Basque language]], [[sociolinguistics]]&lt;ref&gt;VILLENA PONSODA, Juan Andrés (2006): "The Iberian Peninsula", in AMMON, Ulrich et al. (2006): ''Sociolinguistics: an international handbook of the science of language and society'', Volume 3, 2nd ed., Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, p. 1805. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mZtDIhWzFeUC&amp;pg=PA1805&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[historical linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;TRASK, Robert Lawrence (1997): ''The history of Basque'', London: Routledge, p. 69. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OiemTo_t5r8C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq]&lt;/ref&gt; He is an associate member of [[Euskaltzaindia]] since 1983. Despite being the best known local academic proponent of reversing language shift measures, he has never held a stable university post in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].&lt;ref&gt;GARDNER, Nicholas (2002): ''Basque in education in the Basque Autonomous Community'', Vitoria-Gasteiz: Gobierno Vasco, p. 54. [http://www.hezkuntza.ejgv.euskadi.net/r43-573/en/contenidos/informacion/dia6/en_2027/adjuntos/Basque_in_Education_i.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicknamed '''Txepetx''' ([[wren]] in Basque language), he is an Anglo-Germanic Philology graduate from the [[University of Salamanca]] and Basque Philology doctorate from the [[University of the Basque Country]], he has served as a Spanish teacher in [[Scotland]], scientific English teacher at the [[University of Granada]], Basque teacher in a rural school of [[Navarre]], and professor of modern languages and literature of Secondary Education in the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] and elsewhere in Spain.

His research on sociolinguistics, the theory of [[bilingualism]] and existential linguistics, includes the following works: ''El estado actual del vascuence en la provincia de Navarra (1970)'' [The current state of Basque language in Navarre (1970)] (1972), "Bilingüismo, diglosia y contacto de lenguas" [Bilingualism, diglossia, and language contact] (''ASJU'', 1974), ''Lengua y pueblo'' [Language and people] (1980) with articles from 1977 originally published in ''[[Punto y Hora de Euskal Herria]]'' magazine, "El marco sociológico y espacial en una situación bilingüe" [The sociological and spatial context in a bilingual setting] (UPV/EHU, 1980), and ''El espacio bilingüe'' [The bilingual space] (1981).

Sánchez Carrión's insistence on the necessity of compacting Basque speakers has been often cited by advocates of the territorial principle of [[linguistic rights]]. Significantly the only article in the 1982 [[Basque Autonomous Community]] Law for the Normalisation of the use of the [[Basque language]] based on the territorial principle, was declared [[unconstitutional]] by the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;GARDNER, Nicholas (2002): ''Basque in education in the Basque Autonomous Community'', Vitoria-Gasteiz: Gobierno Vasco, p. 55. [http://www.hezkuntza.ejgv.euskadi.net/r43-573/en/contenidos/informacion/dia6/en_2027/adjuntos/Basque_in_Education_i.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Far removed from the variational sociolinguistics as from ideological interpretations, he attempts to answer with new perspectives to the problem of why and how languages live and die. He's been a proponent of [[ecolinguistics]] since the mid-eighties of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;SÁNCHEZ CARRIÓN, José María (1985): ''La nueva sociolingüistica y la ecología de las lenguas'', Donostia-San Sebastián: Eusko Ikaskuntza. [http://www.eusko-ikaskuntza.org/en/publications/la-nueva-sociolinguistica-y-la-ecologia-de-las-lenguas/art-10317/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his most notorious work is his doctoral thesis ''Un futuro para nuestro pasado'' [A future for our past] (1987), as it has offered to many Basque language loyalists a theoretical framework for their activity.&lt;ref&gt;URLA, Jacqueline (2008): "Kafe Antzokia: The Global meets the Local in Basque Cultural Politics", in ROSEMAN, Sharon R. &amp; PARKHURST, Shawn S. (2008): ''Recasting Culture and Space in Iberian Contexts'', New York: State University of New York, pp. 259–261. [https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4GVDXb4b0C&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Further expanding the [[sociohistorical linguistics]] approach of his doctoral thesis, he wrote "Las lenguas vistas desde la historia versus la historia vista desde las lenguas" [Languages seen from the point of view of history versus history seen from the point of view of languages] (EI-SEV, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;XI Basque Studies Congress: Donostia 1991.

Sánchez Carrión's importance for the Basque studies was stressed early on by scholar [[Koldo Mitxelena]],&lt;ref&gt;SALABURU ETXEBERRIA, Pello (2008): ''Koldo Mitxelena: selected writings of a Basque scholar'', Reno: Center for Basque Studies, University of Nevada, p. 75. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YFoNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=carrion#search_anchor]&lt;/ref&gt; and this acknowledgment has continued thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;AMORRORTU, Estibaliz (2003): ''Basque sociolinguistics: language, society, and culture'', Reno: University of Nevada Press, pp. 47 &amp; 54.

[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/hr5018.doc.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; where it presented the book ''The Basque experience'', which makes extensive use of Sánchez Carrión's sociolinguistics.&lt;ref&gt;GARABIDE ELKARTEA (2010): ''The Basque experience: some keys to language and identity recovery''.

In 2013 he published a book about religion and theology entitled ''Le code Jean le Baptiste'' [Code John the Baptist] translated into French by Alain Masson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/12972334/jose_maria_sanchez_carrion/ ''Bibliothèque nationale de France'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kpee''' language, ''Kpeego'', commonly called '''Numu''' (''Noumoukan''), is a [[Mande languages|Mande language]] spoken by blacksmiths (''[[Blacksmiths of western Africa|numu]]'') in [[Burkina Faso]]. It is thought to be similar to [[Ligbi language|Ligbi]] in Ghana, but no comparison has been done.

{{Translation sidebar}}'''Interpreting''' is a [[Translation studies|translational]] activity in which one produces a first and final translation on the basis of a one-time exposure to an expression in a [[Source language (translation)|source language]].

The most common two modes of interpreting are simultaneous interpreting, which is done at the time of the exposure to the source language, and consecutive interpreting, which is done at breaks to this exposure.

Interpreting is an ancient human activity which predates the invention of writing.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=9}} However, the origins of the profession of interpreting date back to less than a century ago.{{Sfb|Gaiba|1998|p=27}}

=== Historiography ===

Research on the numerous sides of the [[history]] of interpreting is quite new.{{Sfn|Woodsworth|Delisle|2012|p=248}} For as long as most scholarly interest was given to professional conference interpreting, very little academic work was done on the practice of interpreting in history, and until the 1990s, only a few dozen publications were done on it.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=152}}

Considering the amount of interpreting activities that is assumed to have occurred for thousands of years, historical records are limited.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=154}} Moreover, interpreters and their work have usually not found their way into the history books.{{Sfn|Woodsworth|Delisle|2012|p=247}} One of the reasons for that is the dominance of the [[Writing|written text]] over the spoken word (in the sense that those who have left written texts are more likely to be [[Recorded history|recorded]] by [[Historian|historians]]).{{Sfn|Woodsworth|Delisle|2012|p=248}}{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=152}} Another problem is the tendency to view it as an ordinary support activity which does not require any special attention,{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=152}} and the [[social status]] of interpreters, who were sometimes treated unfairly by [[Scribe|scribes]], [[Chronicle|chroniclers]] and historians.{{Refn|Interpreters were often ethnic and cultural mixtures, women, slaves or members of a “subcaste” (such as the Armenians and Jews in British India), as well as victims of kidnappings, conflict and political upheaval.{{Sfn|Woodsworth|Delisle|2012|p=248}}|group=note}}{{Sfn|Woodsworth|Delisle|2012|p=248}}  

Our knowledge of the past of interpreting tends to come from [[Letter (message)|letters]], chronicles, [[Biography|biographies]], [[Diary|diaries]] and [[Memoir|memoirs]], along with a variety of other [[Document|documents]] and [[Literature|literary works]], many of which (and with few exceptions) were only incidentally or marginally related to interpreting.{{Sfn|Woodsworth|Delisle|2012|p=247}}{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=152}}

== Etymology ==
Many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages have words for 'interpreting' and 'interpreter'.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=9}} Expressions in [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages denoting an interpreter can be traced back to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], around 1900 BCE.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=9}} The Akkadian root ''targumânu''/''turgumânu'' also gave rise to the term [[dragoman]] via an etymological sideline from [[Arabic]].{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|pp=9–10}}

The English word ‘interpreter’, however, is derived from [[Latin]] ''interpres'' (meaning ‘expounder’, ‘person explaining what is obscure’), whose semantic roots are not clear.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=10}} Some scholars take the second part of the word to be derived from ''partes'' or ''pretium'' (meaning ‘price’, which fits the meaning of a ‘middleman’, ‘intermediary’ or ‘commercial go-between’), but others have suggested a [[Sanskrit]] root.{{Sfn|Pöchhacker|2016|p=10}}

===Consecutive===
In consecutive interpreting (CI), the interpreter starts to interpret when the speaker pauses. Therefore, the time needed is much greater (possibly double the time needed). Traditionally, the interpreter will sit or stand near the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.conference-interpreters.ca/Differences-Consecutive-Simultaneous-Interpreters.html|title=Consecutive and Simultaneous Interpretering|last=|first=|date=|website=www.conference-interpreters.ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022142526/https://www.conference-interpreters.ca/Differences-Consecutive-Simultaneous-Interpreters.html|archive-date=2016-10-22|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consecutive interpretation can be conducted in a pattern of short or long segments according to the interpreter's preference. In short CI, the interpreter relies mostly on memory whereas, in long CI, most interpreters will rely on [[interpreting notes|note-taking]]. The notes must be clear and legible in order to not waste time on reading them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imiaweb.org/uploads/pages/228_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Consecutive interpreting of whole thoughts, rather than in small pieces, is desirable so that the interpreter has the whole meaning before rendering it in the target language. This affords a truer, more accurate, and more accessible interpretation than where short CI or simultaneous interpretation is used.

An attempt at consensus about lengths of segments may be reached prior to commencement, depending upon complexity of the subject matter and purpose of the interpretation, though speakers generally face difficulty adjusting to unnatural speech patterns.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On occasion, document [[translation|sight translation]] is required of the interpreter during consecutive interpretation work. Sight translation combines interpretation and translation; the interpreter must render the source-language document to the target-language as if it were written in the target language. Sight translation occurs usually, but not exclusively, in judicial and medical work.

Consecutive interpretation may be the chosen mode when bilingual listeners are present who wish to hear both the original and interpreted speech or where, as in a court setting, a record must be kept of both.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

When no interpreter is available to interpret directly from source to target, an intermediate interpreter will be inserted in a relay mode, e.g. a Greek source language could be interpreted into English and then from English to another language. This is also commonly known as double-interpretation. Triple-interpretation may even be needed, particularly where rare languages or dialects are involved. Such interpretation can only be effectively conducted using consecutive interpretation.

=== Simultaneous ===
[[File:Simultandolmetscheranlage.jpg|thumb|Simultaneous interpreter's station (Televic Conference) at the [[European Court of Justice]]]]

Simultaneous interpretation (SI) suffers the disadvantage that if a person is performing the service the interpreter must do the best he or she can within the time permitted by the pace of source speech. However they also have the advantages of saving time and not disturbing the natural flow of the speaker.  SI can also be accomplished by software where the program can simultaneously listen to incoming speech and speak the associated interpretation. With a software-based interpretation system the speaker does not have to pause or wait for the interpreter before speaking additional sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.speechgear.com|title=SpeechGear's simultaneous language interpretation software|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529025553/http://www.speechgear.com/|archive-date=2010-05-29|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common form is extempore SI, where the interpreter does not know the message until he or she hears it.

Simultaneous interpretation using electronic equipment where the interpreter can hear the speaker's voice as well as the interpreter's own voice was introduced at the Nuremberg trials in 1945. The equipment facilitated large numbers of listeners, and interpretation was offered French, Russian, German and English.&lt;ref&gt;http://translationexcellence.com/history-simultaneous-interpretation/&lt;/ref&gt; The technology arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman [[Edward Filene]] and British engineer [[Alan Gordon Finlay]] developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinitytranslations.com/simultaneous_interpretation_blog.html|title=The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment|last=|first=|date=|website=Infinity Translation Services|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227064330/http://www.infinitytranslations.com/simultaneous_interpretation_blog.html|archive-date=2017-02-27|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2017-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Kapp attended a conference with simultaneous translation in 1935 in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;‘I would switch about, listening to the speeches in French, in German, in Italian and marvel at this, to me, novel device.’ Kapp, ''Time Will Tell'', Verso, 2003, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; As it proved successful, IBM was able to sell the equipment to the United Nations. SI using software-based systems was introduced by SpeechGear in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"In my view as a trained linguist, this is a quantum leap in technology. This product is the crown jewel of machine translation." Memorandum for the Record for the U.S Marines submitted by LTC Carrol, USMC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wired Magazine:  &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/news/2003/03/58150&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio &lt;nowiki&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/programs/allthings/listings/atc20030407.shtml&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ideal setting for oral language, the interpreter sits in a sound-proof booth and speaks into a microphone, while clearly seeing and hearing the source-language speaker via earphones. The simultaneous interpretation is rendered to the target-language listeners via their earphones.

===The progressive shift from consecutive to simultaneous===
[[Pavel Palazchenko]]'s ''My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter'' gives an excellent short history of modern interpretation and of the transition from its consecutive to simultaneous forms:

{{Quotation|In the nineteenth century, there was little need for interpretation, at least in European diplomacy, since French was the lingua franca of international relations and [was] spoken by all diplomats and most heads of state and government. The change came after World War I. [[Harold Nicolson]], in his famous book about the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], wrote that the reason interpretation became necessary—and appropriate—was that U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] "were no linguists." This, of course was before [[IBM]] engineer [[Alan Gordon Finlay|Gordon Finley]] [''sic.''] patented the idea and equipment for simultaneous interpretation in 1926. The period between the two world wars was the heyday of consecutive interpretation.

The best practitioners of consecutive interpretation—such as [[:de:Anton Velleman|Antoine Wellemann]] [''sic.''], [[Jean Herbert]] and the Kaminker brothers—became legendary. The requirements and standards were very high. The interpreter was expected never to interrupt the speaker, who might speak for as much as twenty or thirty minutes, and even more. Interpreters used an intricate system for note-taking that combined symbols, abbreviations and acronyms with a heavy reliance on memory and intelligence to achieve results that were sometimes stunning. The world record is surely held by André Kaminker, who once interpreted a French diplomat's speech that lasted two and a half hours without interruption.

After the Second World War, although simultaneous interpretation began to be accepted and was used—for example, at the [[Nuremberg trial]] of Nazi war criminals—most of the veteran consecutive interpreters with [[League of Nations]] experience fiercely resisted the use of simultaneous interpretation at the [[United Nations]]. They argued that it was just not as good as the old way, that in addition to the problem of listening and speaking at the same time, the need to start interpreting before the end of a phrase or sentence—to say nothing of a full, meaningful passage—and the difference in the structure of various languages, meant that the simultaneous interpreter was condemned to produce a very flawed translation, in terms of content and particularly style.

There was some truth to that argument, especially during the initial years when interpreters were just beginning to master the new method. But ''amour propre'' was probably also a factor in the debate. Almost every leading consecutive interpreter was something of a prima donna, a star used to shining in front of large and often powerful audiences. I suspect that such people resented the relative obscurity of quietly toiling in the interpreter's booth.

The debate went on until about 1951, with some proponents of "la noble consécutive" adamantly refusing to accept the inevitable. In the end, it was the expansion of the number of U.N. working languages from two (English and French) to five, including Russian, Chinese and Spanish, that proved decisive. Very simply, consecutive interpretation of a U.N. speech into four languages would take too much time. Given that ultimate argument, the last holdouts had to agree that simultaneous interpretation was the only way out. Most of them followed the principle [of] "if you can't beat them, join them" and became masterful practitioners of simultaneous interpretation.

Despite an awkward moment here and there, simultaneous interpretation soon became the accepted method at large international gatherings. It does have some disadvantages, including a need for technical equipment. Consecutive interpretation is, of course, more intimate, and its use in tête-à-tête discussions has never been seriously questioned. I believe that this pattern will hold for many years to come.}}

[[Pavel Palazchenko]], ''My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter'' (Pennsylvania University Press, 1997), pp.&amp;nbsp;32–33.

===Whispered===
Since time immemorial, whispering interpretation has been used, known in the trade by the French term ''chuchotage''. To avoid disturbing the original speaker and those present listening to the original speaker, the interpreter's voice is kept at a low volume. To do this, the interpreter and the person requiring interpretation must sit or stand in close proximity to one another. No actual whispering is involved as this is difficult to decipher as well as being too much of a strain on the voice: the interpreter uses normal 'voiced' speech at a low volume. Only one or at the most two people in need of interpretation can be accommodated, unless portable electronic equipment is used.

This form of interpretation puts a strain on the interpreter who has to sit for long periods leaning towards the person in need of interpretation.

==Types==

===Conference===
Conference interpreting refers to interpretation at a conference or large meeting, either simultaneously or consecutively. The advent of multi-lingual meetings has reduced the amount of consecutive interpretation in the last 20 years.

Conference interpretation is divided between two markets: institutional and private. International institutions (EU, UN, EPO, et cetera), which hold multilingual meetings, often favor interpreting several foreign languages into the interpreters' mother tongues. Local private markets tend to have bilingual meetings (the local language plus another), and the interpreters work both into and out of their mother tongues. These markets are not mutually exclusive. The [[International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC)]] is the only worldwide association of conference interpreters. Founded in 1953, its membership includes more than 2,800 professional conference interpreters, in more than 90 countries.

===Judicial===
{{See also|Legal translation}}

Judicial, legal, or court interpreting occurs in courts of justice, administrative tribunals, and wherever a legal proceeding is held (i.e., a police station for an interrogation, a conference room for a deposition, or the locale for taking a sworn statement). Legal interpreting can be the consecutive interpretation of witnesses' testimony, for example, or the simultaneous interpretation of entire proceedings, by electronic means, for one person, or all of the people attending. In a legal context, where ramifications of misinterpretation may be dire, accuracy is paramount. Teams of two or more interpreters, with one actively interpreting and the second monitoring for greater accuracy, may be deployed.

The right to a competent interpreter for anyone who does not understand the language of the court (especially for the accused in a criminal trial) is usually considered a fundamental rule of justice. Therefore, this right is often guaranteed in national constitutions, declarations of rights, fundamental laws establishing the justice system or by precedents set by the highest courts. However, it is not a constitutionally required procedure (in the United States) that a certified interpreter be present at police [[interrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7035&amp;context=jclc#page=27|title=Confessions and Culture: The Interaction of Miranda and Diversity|last=Einesman|first=Floralynn|date=1999|website=|publisher=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|page=26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922024515/http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7035&amp;context=jclc|archive-date=2017-09-22|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been especially controversial in cases where [[illegal immigrants]] with no English skills are accused of crimes.

In the US, depending upon the regulations and standards adhered to per state and venue, court interpreters usually work alone when interpreting consecutively, or as a team, when interpreting simultaneously. In addition to practical mastery of the source and target languages, thorough knowledge of law and legal and court procedures is required of court interpreters. They are often required to have formal authorization from the state to work in the courts – and then are called certified court interpreters.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The majority of state court systems utilize a certification exam developed and administered by the National Center for State Courts. Most non-native speakers of English use the term "sworn interpreter," which is calqued from a civil-law position title common throughout the world. However, there is no common law country{{Clarify|date=June 2012|reason=Does this refer to common law, i. e., case law, in general, or specifically to the common law of England and historically connected countries?}} that uses this term.&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions, the interpretation is considered an essential part of the evidence. Incompetent interpretation, or simply failure to swear in the interpreter, can lead to a mistrial.

===Escort interpreter===

In escort interpreting, an interpreter accompanies a person or a delegation on a tour, on a visit, or to a business meeting or interview. An interpreter in this role is called an ''escort interpreter'' or an ''escorting interpreter''. An escort interpreter’s work session may run for days, weeks, or even months, depending on the period of the client’s visit. This type of interpreting is often needed in business contexts, during presentations, investor meetings, and business negotiations. As such, and escort interpreter needs to be equipped with some business and financial knowledge in order to best understand and convey messages back and forth.

===Public sector===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Yanaon (Inde française)]] --&gt;

Also known as community interpreting, is the type of interpreting occurring in fields such as legal, health, and local government, social, housing, environmental health, education, and welfare services. In community interpreting, factors exist which determine and affect language and communication production, such as speech's emotional content, hostile or polarized social surroundings, its created stress, the power relationships among participants, and the interpreter's degree of responsibility – in many cases more than extreme; in some cases, even the life of the other person depends upon the interpreter's work.

===Medical===
Medical interpreting is a subset of public service interpreting, consisting of communication among Healthcare personnel and the patient and their family or among Healthcare personnel speaking different languages, facilitated by an interpreter, usually formally educated and qualified to provide such interpretation services. In some situations medical employees who are multilingual may participate [[part-time job|part-time]] as members of internal [[language bank]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/nyregion/15hospital.html|title=Queens Hospitals Learn Many Ways to Say 'Ah'|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|date=2005-04-15|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-09-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529184004/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/nyregion/queens-hospitals-learn-many-ways-to-say-ah.html|archive-date=2015-05-29|dead-url=|publisher=|pages=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on country/state specific requirements, the interpreter is often required to have some knowledge of medical terminology, common procedures, the patient interview and exam process. Medical interpreters are often [[culture|cultural]] liaisons for people (regardless of language) who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in hospital, clinical, or medical settings.

For example, in China, there is no mandatory certificate for medical interpreters as of 2012. Most interpretation in hospitals in China is done by doctors, who are proficient in both Chinese and English (mostly) in his/her specialty. They interpret more in academic settings than for communications between doctors and patients. When a patient needs English language service in a Chinese hospital, more often than not the patient will be directed to a staff member in the hospital, who is recognized by his/her colleagues as proficient in English. The actual quality of such service for patients or medical translation for communications between doctors speaking different languages is unknown by the interpreting community as interpreters who lack Healthcare background rarely receive accreditation for medical translation in the medical community. Interpreters working in the Healthcare setting may be considered [[Allied health professions|Allied Health Professionals]].

In the United States, however, providing a Medical Interpreter is required by law. Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity that receives Federal funds or other Federal financial assistance. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/special-topics/needy-families/civil-rights-requirements/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Because hospitals are federally funded, they are required by this law to provide a professional interpreter to any patient that may need one.

===Sign language===
[[Image:Interp.jpg|thumb|right|306px|Two [[sign language]] interpreters working for a school.]]

A sign language interpreter must accurately convey messages between two different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/interpreting-american-sign-language/|title=Interpreting American Sign Language|last=|first=|date=|website=National Association of the Deaf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708115012/https://www.nad.org/resources/american-sign-language/interpreting-american-sign-language/|archive-date=2017-07-08|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Robert M. (1978). "Sign Language Interpretation and General Theories of Language, Interpretation and Communication," in Gerver, D. &amp; H. W. Sinaiko (Eds.), ''Language Interpretation and Communication.'' London: Plenum Press, 109-117.&lt;/ref&gt; An interpreter is there for both [[deaf]] and [[hearing (person)|hearing]] individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sign.let.ru.nl/groups/slcwikigroup/wiki/731a5/deaf_studies.html|title=deaf studies|last=|first=|date=|website=sign.let.ru.nl|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129022725/http://sign.let.ru.nl/groups/slcwikigroup/wiki/731a5/deaf_studies.html|archive-date=2013-01-29|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Robert M. (1974). "A Communication Model of the Interpreting Process." ''Journal of Rehabilitation of the Deaf 7:3'' (Jan.), 3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of interpreting occurs when a hearing person speaks, and an interpreter renders the speaker's meaning into sign language, or other forms used by the deaf party(ies). The interpreting also happens in reverse: when a deaf person signs, an interpreter renders the meaning expressed in the signs into the oral language for the hearing party, which is sometimes referred to as voice interpreting or ''voicing''. This may be performed either as simultaneous or consecutive interpreting. Skilled sign language interpreters will position themselves in a room or space that allows them to be seen by the deaf participants and heard clearly by hearing participants, as well as be in a position to hear and/or see the speaker or speakers clearly. In some circumstances, an interpreter may interpret from one language to another whether that is English to [[British Sign Language]], English to [[American Sign Language]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to English to American Sign Language and so on.

Deaf individuals also have the opportunity to work as interpreters. If they are certified they are refereed to as a CDI (certified Deaf Interpreter), if not they would be called a DI (Deaf Interpreter). The [[deaf culture|Deaf]] individual will team with a hearing counterpart to provide interpretation for deaf individuals who may not know the same sign language used in that country, who have minimal language skills, are developmentally delayed, have other mental and/or physical disabilities which make communication a unique challenge, or request one. In other cases the hearing interpreter may interpret in the sign language, whichever kind of sign language the team knows and the deaf team will then interpret into the language in which the individual can understand. They also interpret information from one medium of language into another – for example, when a person is signing visually, the deaf interpreter could be hired to copy those signs into a deaf-blind person's hand and add visual information.

Some interpreters have been formally trained in an Interpreter Training Program (ITP), though this is not always required. ITP lengths vary, and are usually two or four years to obtain a degree or certificate. Graduate programs are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rid.org/interpreting/new_to_interpreting/index.cfm/AID/61|title=About Interpreting Education Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf, Inc.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151850/http://www.rid.org/interpreting/new_to_interpreting/index.cfm/AID/61|archive-date=2014-12-24|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, [[ASL interpreting|Sign Language interpreters]] have National and some states have aState level certifications. The [[Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf]] (RID), a non-profit organization, is known for its national recognition and certification process. In addition to training requirements and stringent certification testing, the RID members must abide by a Code of Professional Conduct, Grievance Process and Continuing Education Requirement. There are many interpreter-training programs in the U.S. The Collegiate Commission on Interpreter Education is the body that accredits Interpreter Preparation Programs. A list of accredited programs can be found on the CCIE web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccie-accreditation.org/accredited-programs/|title=Accredited Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=Commission On Collegiate Interpreter Education|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629183633/http://ccie-accreditation.org/accredited-programs/|archive-date=2017-06-29|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European countries and countries elsewhere have their own national association of Sign Language Interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accreditedlanguage.com/2016/08/17/types-of-sign-language-and-their-development/|title=Types of Sign Language and Their Development|last=|first=|date=|website=www.accreditedlanguage.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525144735/https://www.accreditedlanguage.com/2016/08/17/types-of-sign-language-and-their-development/|archive-date=2017-05-25|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have more than one national association due to regional or language differences. The European Forum of Sign Language Interpreters (efsli) is the umbrella organization of sign language interpreters in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efsli.org/about.php|title=About efsli...|last=|first=|date=|website=efsli.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902012017/http://www.efsli.org/about.php|archive-date=2012-09-02|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2012-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the professional association that recognizes and nationally certifies sign language interpreters is the [[Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada]] (AVLIC). Under AVLIC holds several affiliate chapters representing a specified region of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avlic.ca/|title=Welcome to AVLIC|last=|first=|date=|website=www.avlic.ca|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924074853/http://www.avlic.ca/|archive-date=2017-09-24|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sign language interpreters encounter a number of linguistic, environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can have an effect on their ability to provide accurate interpretation. Studies have found that most interpreter training programs do not sufficiently prepare students for the highly variable day-to-day stresses that an interpreter must manage, and there is an ongoing conversation in the interpreting field as to how to appropriately prepare students for the challenges of the job. Proposed changes include having a more robust definition of what a qualified interpreter should know, as well as a post-graduate internship structure that would allow new interpreters to work with the benefit of supervision from more experienced interpreters, much like the programs in place in medicine, law enforcement, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Robyn, Robert Q Pollard|date=January 2001|title=Application of Demand-Control Theory to Sign Language Interpreting: Implications for Stress and Interpreter Training|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/1.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAZ0wggGZBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGKMIIBhgIBADCCAX8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMQGmcgMfBy93idcJeAgEQgIIBUHGFjMb7ZH17ALiFjflSDM7tyRdL_0W5KHgtXK82u4UaRv4Hru8AstPRyoQWSthjHu20zIuskckjM-PIlDHYX29lHBIgsRprhwC_ykijFROFgLSD1PN4HgQvnQ5ZVCJqrcVmRUiuzsQpAN8M6RYrKZl8xIE4ltPE-GsQeqenBfydNhk0I2vwP5qUc2YEBmYZoBO7eRZy8xCIvg7lw-7srYZIaqFhhb1iVDnR1Y3Se0VL5PWazCNzhHgFyeOeOC-NW5fUSLlRYzWMc6Z43GPpJUyCFonKFQDBH3RgNO7OC0BoE1quBjIsL-6I7zZoBoGGuJKKA71Vm19kL3yDrL5B0gbdSGZKtOTFiYlUNqLBWhHknHb9IwB1zQ9eKrHPLqSscKOO1GgDFZ3y4VEb1iE7GQcQSKgrpfo5DTVl6Pb3NQmTHWZaByFTlRYnmfF5bK7sJg|journal=The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume= 6| issue = 1|pages=1–14|via=Oxford University Press}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===

By its very nature, media interpreting has to be conducted in the simultaneous mode. It is provided particularly for live television coverages such as press conferences, live or taped interviews with political figures, musicians, artists, sportsmen or people from the business circle. In this type of interpreting, the interpreter has to sit in a sound-proof booth where ideally he/she can see the speakers on a monitor and the set. All equipment should be checked before recording begins. In particular, satellite connections have to be double-checked to ensure that the interpreter's voice is not sent back and the interpreter gets to hear only one channel at a time. In the case of interviews recorded outside the studio and some current affairs program, the interpreter interprets what he or she hears on a TV monitor. Background noise can be a serious problem. The interpreter working for the media has to sound as slick and confident as a television presenter.

Media interpreting has gained more visibility and presence especially after the Gulf War. Television channels have begun to hire staff simultaneous interpreters. The interpreter renders the press conferences, telephone beepers, interviews and similar live coverage for the viewers. It is more stressful than other types of interpreting as the interpreter has to deal with a wide range of technical problems coupled with the control room's hassle and wrangling during live coverage.

==Modalities==

Interpreting services can be delivered in multiple modalities.The most common modality through which interpreting services are provided is on-site interpreting.

===On-site===

Also called "in-person interpreting" or sometimes colloquialized as "face-to-face", this delivery method requires the interpreter to be physically present in order for the interpretation to take place. In on-site interpreting settings, all of the parties who wish to speak to one another are usually located in the same place. This is by far the most common modality used for most public and social service settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ititranslates.com/what-are-the-benefits-of-hiring-a-professional-interpreter-or-translator Francesco Pagano "What Are The Benefits Of Hiring a Professional Interpreter or Translator? " Interpreters and Translators, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telephone===
{{main|Telephone interpreting}}
Also referred to as "over-the-phone interpreting," "telephonic interpreting," and "tele-interpreting," telephone interpreting enables interpretation via telephone. Telephone interpreting can be used in community settings as well as conference settings. Telephone interpreting may be used in place of on-site interpreting when no on-site interpreter is readily available at the location where services are needed. However, it is more commonly used for situations in which all parties who wish to communicate are already speaking to one another via telephone (e.g. telephone applications for insurance or credit cards, or telephone inquiries from consumers to businesses).

===Video===
{{main|Video Relay Service|Video Remote Interpreting}}

&lt;!-- Note: the following text is also resides within the articles: 'Sign language' and 'Telephone interpreting' --&gt;
Interpretation services via [[Video Remote Interpreting]] (VRI) or a [[Video Relay Service]] (VRS) are useful for spoken language barriers where visual-cultural recognition is relevant, and even more applicable where one of the parties is [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]] or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired (mute)]]. In such cases the direction of interpretation is normally within the same principal language, such as [[French Sign Language]] (FSL) to spoken French and [[Spanish Sign Language]] (SSL) to spoken Spanish. [[Multilingual]] [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]]s, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator, since [[sign language]]s are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own construction and [[syntax]], different from the aural version of the same principal language.

With video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, converse with the hearing party and vice versa. Much like [[telephone interpreting]], video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRI and VRS interpretation requires all parties to have the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary equipment]]. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera, in order to zoom in and out, and to point the camera toward the party that is signing.

[[File:2007 07 16 parlament europejski bruksela 45.JPG|thumb|300px|Interpreting booths in the [[European Parliament]] where interpreters simultaneously interpret debates between the 24 official [[languages of the European Union]].]]

The majority of professional full-time conference interpreters work for phone interpreting agencies, health care institutions, courts, school systems and international organizations like the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], or the [[African Union]].

The world's largest employer of interpreters is currently the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/scic/about-dg-interpretation/index_en.htm|title=What we do|last=|first=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205061114/http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/scic/about-dg-interpretation/index_en.htm|archive-date=2017-02-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which employs hundreds of staff and freelance interpreters working into the official [[languages of the European Union]] and some others. The [[European Union]]'s other institutions (the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Court of Justice]]) have smaller interpreting services.

The United Nations employs interpreters at almost all its sites throughout the world. Because it has only six official languages, however, it is a smaller employer than the European Union.

Interpreters may also work as freelance operators in their local, regional and national communities, or may take on contract work under an interpreting business or service. They would typically take on work as described above.

Militaries often use interpreters to better communicate with the local population. One notable example is the US military during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Associations==
There are a number of interpreting and translation associations around the world, including NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters), AIIC (The International Association of Conference Interpreters), CATTI (China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters), CTTIC (Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council), and the [[Institute of Translation &amp; Interpreting]], in the UK.

==Certifications==
No worldwide testing or certification agency exists for all types of interpreters. For conference interpretation, there is the International Association of Conference Interpreters, or AIIC.

Specific regions, countries, or even cities will have their own certification standards. In many cases, graduates of a certain caliber university program acts as a de facto certification for conference interpretation.

===CATTI===


The most recognized interpretation &amp; translation certificate in P.R.C. is China Accreditation Test for Translation and Interpretation, short for CATTI.
It is entrusted by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of P.R.C. It is a translation and interpretation professional qualification accreditation test which is implemented throughout the country according to uniform standards, in order to assess examinees' bilingual translation or interpretation capability.
CATTI was introduced in 2003. In later 2013, translation and interpreting tests of different levels in English, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Spanish and Arabic were held across the nation.

===Use of Translation and Interpretation Certificates===

Those examinees who pass CATTI and obtain translation and interpretation certificates acquire corresponding translation and interpretation professional titles.
* Senior translator or interpreter – professor of translation or interpretation

* Level 1 translator or interpreter – associate professor of translation or interpretation

* Level 2 translator or interpreter – translator or interpreter

* Level 3 translator or interpreter – assistant translator or interpreter

===CATTI's Influence===

Relevant institutions from Australia, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and other countries as well as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the region of Taiwan have established work ties with CATTI.

He is survived by his wife, Dr. Bhagwati Joshi, and sons, [[Anupam Joshi]], Anurag Joshi and Ashish Joshi. Upon his death, Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] called him "one of the most influential writers and commentators in Hindi in recent times".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmindia.nic.in/message/mcontent.asp?id=90 PM condoles passing away of Manohar Shyam Joshi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727072407/http://pmindia.nic.in/message/mcontent.asp?id=90 |date=27 July 2009 }} PM Messages, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IndiaNEWS&gt;[http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20060331/2511.htm PM condoles Manohar Shyam Joshi's death] indianews, 31 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Khushwant Singh]], the eminent author, editor and critic,"By the time he died in 2006, he was recognised as the first and the most innovative writer of Hindi."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090926/saturday/above.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Television===
He is often called "the Father of [[Indian Soap Opera]]s"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} being the writer of India's first television soap opera, ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]''. Made in 1982, when television was still a luxury item for the majority of Indians, the serial dealt with the everyday struggles of the middle-class India, making it an instant hit, especial because every Indian could identify with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/mar/30joshi.htm Buniyaad, Hum Log writer..] Rediff Movies, 30 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.rediff.com/movies/2006/mar/30sippy.htm The Making of Humlog] Rediff News, 30 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular creation was ''[[Buniyaad]]'' (1987–1988), directed by Ramesh Sippy, a serial based around the life a family displaced by the Partition of India in 1947; both went on to deeply influence an entire generation of Indians as well as the Indian television industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99dec19/sunday/head2.htm Prime time..] ''The Tribune'', 19 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years he wrote many more long running serials like ''[[Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne|Mungeri Lal Ke Hasin Sapney]]'', ''[[Kakaji Kahin]]'', ''[[Humrahi]]'', ''Zameen Aasman'' and ''Gatha''.

He was awarded the prestigious [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 2005 for Hindi, for his novel ''Kyap'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10306.htm#hindi Sahitya Akademi Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704045555/http://www.sahitya-akademi.org/sahitya-akademi/awa10306.htm |date=4 July 2007 }} Hindi 2005, Kyap (Novel).&lt;/ref&gt; an allegory of modern India, known for its sensitive portrayal of the [[Kumauni people|Kumaoni]] traditions of his home state of [[Uttarakhand]].

===Films===
He had a penchant for romance, subtle comedy and satire alike. This allowed him to write for cinema on a variety of subjects, like ''Hey Ram'', ''Appu Raja'', ''Papa Kahte Hain'' and ''Brashtachar''. He was a dubbing expert of much ability and dubbed for films like ''Appu Raja'' and ''[[Hey Ram]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Journalism===
He had a long stint as a journalist in broadcast and the print media. He worked first with [[All India Radio]], New Delhi, in the Hindi news section and then with the [[Films Division of India]] in Mumbai, where he wrote the scripts for many documentaries. This is when he started writing his famous landmark interviews with ordinary folks, which were serialised in the ''Sarika'' magazine. It was not long before he was handpicked by [[Sachchidananda Vatsyayan|Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan Agyeya]] for a new Hindi news magazine ''[[Dinmaan]]'', being brought out by the ''[[Times of India]]'' group. Agyeya was to be the editor and Joshi the assistant editor.

Later, he concurrently edited the leading Hindi magazine ''Saptahik [[Hindustan]]'', along with the English ''Weekend Review'' and, in late 70s, the ''Morning Echo'' weekly all brought out by the ''[[Hindustan Times]]''.&lt;ref name=ONE&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/2006/03/30/noted-litterateur-manohar-shyam-joshi-passes-away-1143725917.html Noted litterateur Manohar Shyam Joshi..] oneindia, 30 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

His journalistic writings have covered a wide range of topics from popular science and scintillating travelogues to astute political analyses. Until his death, he wrote an opinion column for ''[[Outlook Saptahik]]'', [[Hindi]] magazine from ''[[Outlook India]]''.

'''Media linguistics''' is the [[linguistics|linguistic]] study of media speech. It studies the functioning of [[language]] in the [[Mass media|media]] sphere, or the modern [[mass communication]] presented by print, audiovisual and networked media.

Media linguistics is being formed in the process of [[Differentiation (linguistics)|differentiation]] of [[linguistics]] as a general theory of language, and its term turned out to be in line with [[psycholinguistics]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[developmental linguistics]], [[legal linguistics]], [[political linguistics]], etc.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

== Object ==
Modern media linguistics examines not only the language of media, but also media speech. Media linguistics includes such discipline as ''media speech studies'' that examines (1) the speech behavior of [[mass communication]] participants and (2) specific areas, textures and genres of media texts. 

Thus, in principle, media linguistics seeks to explain the particular case of the functioning of language—in mass communications with its complex structure and diverse trends of change—amid the overall trends of language and speech culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010).  Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. &lt;I&gt;Language Problems and Language Planning, 34&lt;/i&gt;(2), 158-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Media linguistics is closely related to the contemporary media practices and intends to impact on them, in particular, by means of media education.

== In various countries ==
* In '''English-speaking countries''' the terms ''[[Media studies|media study]]'' and ''media [[discourse analysis]]'' are used, corresponding with such interdisciplinary approach as [[Critical discourse analysis]]. See, for example, [[Teun A. van Dijk]]'s book ''News as Discourse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= News as Discourse|year=1988|publisher= Hillsdale NJ: Erlbaum |isbn= 0-8058-0828-0 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240|author= Teun A. Van Dijk |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Germany''' such term as ''Medienlinguistik'' is typical.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Medienlinguistik]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In '''Russia''' active usage of the term ''Медиалингвистика'' is associated with the publications of T.G. Dobrosklonskaya, where English media speech is investigated. Russian media linguistics is the successor of different linguistic researches, which were designated as and called "the language of newspaper", "he language of radio", "the language of media".&lt;ref&gt;"Media Linguistics": a scientific web site: http://medialing.spbu.ru/world_of_medialinguistics/ and an international journal of the same name [http://medialing.ru https://medialing.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multimedia translation''', also sometimes referred to as Audiovisual translation, is a specialized branch of translation which deals with the transfer of [[Multimodality|multimodal]] and [[multimedia]]l texts into another language and/or culture.&lt;ref&gt;González, Luis Pérez. "Audiovisual Translation", in [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] and Gabriela Saldanha (eds.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Translation Studies'', London, 2009, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and which implies the use of a multimedia electronic system in the translation or in the transmission process.

==Application==
Multimedia translation can be applied to  various fields, including cinema, television, theatre, advertisement, audiovisual and mobile device communication.

Audiovisual text can be labeled as multimodal when produced and interpreted by applying a variety of [[Social semiotics|semiotic]] resources or ‘modes’.&lt;ref&gt;Baldry, Anthony and Paul J. Thibault. ''Multimodal Transcription and Text Analysis'', London &amp; Oakville: Equinox, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  When various modes, such as [[language]], [[image]], [[music]], [[colour]] and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] are combined together in different forms of media, with the major role attributed to the screen, audiovisual text can be described as multimedial.&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Multimedia'' [Interview]. Hightech (August 1991): 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this, called multimodal transcription, is used in cinema.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Christopher J.|year=2003|title=Multimodal Transcription in the Analysis, Translation and Subtitling of Italian Films|journal=The Translator|volume=9|issue=2|pages=191–205|doi=10.1080/13556509.2003.10799153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A film is broken down into frames, shots or phases.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Every frame, shot or phase is analyzed, looking for all the semiotic modalities operating within each one.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Academic study of multimedia translation==
The translation of multimedia creative works is a subject of academic research, a subtopic of [[translation studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Cintas, Jorge. ''New Trends in Audiovisual Translation''. Bristol/Buffalo/Toronto: Multilingual Matters. 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84769-154-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This interdisciplinary field draws from a wide range of theories, such as globalisation and post-globalisation theories, reception studies, relevance theory, social science and cultural studies, social psychology and deaf studies'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlović|first=Nataša|year=2004|title=Addressing Power and Solidarity in TV Subtitling|journal=Across Languages and Cultures|volume=5|issue=2|pages=211–232|doi=10.1556/Acr.5.2004.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Modes of translation==
This kind of translation is strongly influenced, both in the form and in the substance of its creative process, by the process and type of device employed. Specific limits are imposed by digital graphics, and by timing and mode of use.

=== Dubbing ===
[[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Dubbing]], sometimes known as "lip-synchrony", involves both the translation and its [[Synchronization|synchronisation]] as well as dubbing the actors' and actresses' performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isabel|first=Ana|last2=Bartolomé|first2=Hernández|last3=Cabrera|first3=Gustavo Mendiluce|year=2005|title=New Trends in Audiovisual Translation: The Latest Challenging Modes|url=http://www.miscelaneajournal.net/images/stories/articulos/vol31/bartolome31.pdf.|journal=Miscelánea|volume=31|pages=89–104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once considered the most comprehensive form of translation, dubbing follows the "timing, phrasing and lip movement of the original dialogue" as closely as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audiovisual Translation Theories, Methods And Issues|last=Pérez-Gonzalez|first=Luis|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this mode is usually interlingual, there are some cases of intralingual dubbing, but it is not very common.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Subtitling ===
The most extensively studied mode of multimedia translation, [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] is the linguistic practice showing written text on a screen that conveys "a target language version of the source speech."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consisting of many sub-types, the one most commonly used is interlinguistic subtitling, which is usually displayed in open [[Closed captioning|captions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In places where several languages are spoken, bilingual subtitles are used to show two different language versions of the source text at the same time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Voice over ===
[[Voice-over|Voice over]] involves the original [[soundtrack]] and the translation being broadcast simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the beginning, only the original can be heard, but the volume is lowered while the translated version becomes more noticeable until the end.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation gives a realistic effect, so it is usually used in documentaries or interviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voice over is considered a "cheap alternative to dubbing" so it is the first choice for translating films in former [[Communist state]]s and some countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Interpreting ===
[[Language interpretation|Interpreting]] is "the oral translation of an audiovisual product by only one speaker."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Interpreting consists of many different types, such as simultaneous, live, consecutive or prerecorded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode is usually used in live [[interview]]s and news broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Surtitling ===
[[Surtitles|Surtitling]] is similar to subtitling, however it consists of one continuous line displayed with no interruption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Becoming more frequent in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]] and [[Opera house|operahouses]], the translation is displayed either above the stage or on the backs of seats.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite being shown in real time, the translations are prepared in advance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Free commentary ===
Free commentary is the variation of an audiovisual source to an entirely new audience and the cultural factors or new goals involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is delivered with a spontaneous tone, so the end product is completely different from the original.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is generally no attempt to stay faithful to it, resulting in a translation that usually provides either more details or omissions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is generally used when literacy is not the main goal, such as in [[Children's television series|children's television shows]], [[Documentary film|documentaries]], humorous videos, [[Parody|film parodies]] and [[corporate video]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partial dubbing ===
Also known as "half-dubbing" or "concise synchronisation", consists of adding a prerecorded spoken text to the original [[soundtrack]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While not being a full translation, it provides the necessary information in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Narration ===
[[Narration]] consists of preparing, translating and condensing a text in advance which is then read by dubbing actors and actresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal is to provide a faithful, scripted summary of the original speech.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It can be pre-recorded or performed live.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The difference between narration and dubbing is that the text is being read, not performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Narration is also similar to voice over, but is different in that the final product is more condensed and is not always completely faithful to the original's style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Simultaneous translation ===
Also known as "sight translation", simultaneous translation is done on the spot from a prepared script in the target language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is different from interpretation in that "it takes this second foreign language as a pivot language".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is used when more elaborate methods of audiovisual translation are not an option, due to time or funding constraints.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, it is only used in film festivals and film archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Live subtitling ===
Also known as "real-time subtitling", it differs from regular subtitling in that the [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] are not prerecorded and are instead inserted on the spot.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia of translation is used for live broadcasts for those who are hard of hearing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A "respeaker" takes the original sound and dialogue of a live program or event and "respeaks" it into a speech recognition software.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This new version includes punctuation marks and specific features for this audience, which is then turned into subtitles with as little delay as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Subtitling for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (SDH) ===
[[Subtitle (captioning)#SDH|SDH]] is meant for those who have difficulty hearing the dialogue on a film or television show by helping them to "see" the sound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to subtitling, SDH adds additional information to complement the verbal dimension.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Originally, these subtitles were only available for films and pre-recorded broadcasts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the "growing number of legislative and regulatory provisions has set minimum quota requirements" for [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitling companies.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Audio description (AD) ===
[[Audio description|AD]] is meant for those who are blind, visually-impaired or partially-sighted and assists by providing a narration concerning the visual aspects of a film or television show, for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The AD track does not interfere with the original dialogue since it is inserted during silent parts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reader, known as an "audio describer", makes sure to balance what is necessary to the plot while not overwhelming the audience with excessive information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These particular descriptions would be recorded, but they can also be done live, (though still prepared in advance) such as in [[Theater (structure)|theatres]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation has become important in "ensuring the accessibility of audiovisual products to the visually impaired."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Animation ===
Animation involves translation as well as script writing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The translator takes silent images, such as cartoons, and creates a script from scratch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although similar to free commentary, it is different in that there is no previous script written in animation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Double version ===
Double versions are products that involve two or more languages in which each actor and actress plays their role in their own language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The final product is then dubbed and synchronised so that there is only one language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Remake ===
Remakes contextualise a film so that they are in accordance with the target audience and its culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These translations focus on values and ideology, so the linguistic aspect of the product is less of a priority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This mode of multimedia translation is mostly used for European films remade for American audiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Teaching==
Since the late 1990s, multimedia translation has found a role in education. B.A and M.A. classes on this subject have been established at several universities across Europe and the United States (Boston, Dallas, Forlì, Genova, Leeds, Londra, Pisa, Pittsburgh, Torino, Udine, Barcelona, Vigo, [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences|Winterthur]]).

'''Naro''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑr|oʊ}}, also '''Nharo''', is a [[Khoe languages|Khoe language]] spoken in [[Ghanzi District]] of [[Botswana]] and in eastern [[Namibia]]. It is probably the most-spoken of the Tshu–Khwe languages.  Naro is a trade language among speakers of different Khoe languages in [[Ghanzi District]]. There exists a [[dictionary]].

==Phonology==
Naro has the following consonant inventory, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] of Miller (2011) and the orthography of Visser (2001):&lt;ref&gt;Visser originally wrote the palatal clicks with a base of {{angle bracket|ç}}, but switched to {{angle bracket|tc}} to make the language more accessible from English-language typewriters and keyboards.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kg'' and ''kg’'' only contrast for some speakers: ''kx’ám'' "mouth" vs. ''k’áù'' "male". The flap ''r'' is only found medially except in loan words. An ''l'' is only found in loans, and is generally substituted by {{IPA|/ɾ/}} medially and {{IPA|/n/}} initially. Medial {{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} may be {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}; they occur initially only in ''wèé'' "all, both" and in ''yèè'' (an interjection).

Naro has five vowel qualities, ''a e i o u,'' which may occur long ''(aa ee ii oo uu),'' nasalized ''(ã ẽ ĩ õ ũ),'' [[pharyngealization|pressed]] ''(&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;),'' or combinations of these ''(&lt;u&gt;ã&lt;/u&gt;'' etc.). There are three tones, written ''á, a, à.'' Syllables are of the maximal form ''CVV,'' where ''VV'' is a long vowel, diphthong, or combination of vowel and ''m,'' and may take two tones: ''{{IPA|hḿm̀}}'' "to see"; ''{{IPA|hm̀m̀ a xám̀}}'' "to smell". The only consonant that can occur finally is ''m,'' except that long nasal vowels such as ''ãã'' may surface as [aŋ] ([ŋ] does not otherwise occur). Syllabic /n/ also occurs, as in ''nna.''

Below is an overview of Naro clicks in both orthography and IPA (Visser 2001). The [[dental click]] is represented by ''c''. [[alveolar click]] by ''q'', [[palatal click]] by ''tc'', and [[lateral click]] by ''x''. All examples are from Visser (2001).

==Naro Language Project==
The Naro Language Project is a project currently being undertaken by the Reformed Church in [[Dekar|D'kar]] that aims to describe and develop an understanding of the Naro language, increase literacy by teaching Naro speakers to read and write their language and translate the [[Bible]] into Naro. The project was started in the 1980s. The Naro language project has, as of 2007, translated 70% of the Bible into the Naro language.

'''Ormuri''' (Persian: زبان ارموری also known as ''Oormuri, Urmuri, Ormur, Ormui, Bargista, Baraks, and Baraki'')  is a  language spoken in [[Waziristan]]. It is primarily spoken in the town of [[Kaniguram]] in [[South Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]] by the [[Burki]] people. It is also spoken by a small group of people in [[Baraki Barak]] in [[Logar Province|Logar]], [[Afghanistan]]. The language belongs to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language group. The extremely small number of speakers makes Ormuri an [[endangered language]] that is considered to be in a "threatened" state.

Ormuri is notable for its unusual sound inventory, which includes a [[Alveolar trill#Raised alveolar non-sonorant trill|voiceless alveolar trill]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; that does not exist in the surrounding [[Pashto language|Pashto]]. Ormuri also has [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative|voiceless]] and [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative]]s (the voiceless being contrastive with the more common [[voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant|voiceless palato-alveolar fricative]]), which also exist in the [[Waziristani dialect]] of Pashto, but could have been adopted from Ormuri due to its close proximity.&lt;ref name="RKB" &gt;[http://www.khyber.org/publications/016-020/ormuri.shtml "Dying Languages; Special Focus on Ormuri"]. Originally published in ''Pakistan Journal of Public Administration; Volume 6. No. 2'' in December 2001. ''Khyber.ORG''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Ormuri is classified under the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Eastern Iranian]], [[Southeastern Iranian]], and [[Ormuri-Parachi]] language groups &lt;ref name=EDL&gt;[http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4930 Endangered Languages Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ETH&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ORU Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language status===
According to the [[Endangered Languages Project]], the language of Ormuri is highly threatened. The language is used for [[Face-to-face interaction|face-to-face communication]], however it is losing users.&lt;ref name=EDL /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACA&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/2019868/The_Ormuri_Language_in_Past_and_Present |title=The Ormuri Language in Past and Present |last=V.A. |first=Efimov |date=2011 |publisher=Forum for Language Initiatives |isbn=978-969-9437-02-1 |location=Islamabad |translator-last=Baart |translator-first=Joan L.G. |orig-year=1986 original Russian edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Ormuri''' language is used by the Ormur/Baraki tribe in parts of the [[Kaniguram]] Valley in [[Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]]. The language is also used in a small part of [[Logar Province]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="JAS"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=D. A. |date=1984 |title=Zoroastrian Traces along the Upper Amu Darya (Oxus) |journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland |issue=2 |pages=217–228 |jstor=25211708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroastrian Traces along the Upper Amu Darya (Oxus)]. D. A. Scott, ''The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland'', No. 2 (1984), pp. 217-228, Published by Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ormuri tribe===
An alternate name used by the Ormur people is [[Ormur|Baraki]]. It is believed that there were eight to ten thousand families in the [[Logar Province|Logar]] area at the beginning of the 19th century and approximately four to five hundred families in [[Kaniguram]] at the beginning of the 20th century. The Ormur tribe does not occupy an ethnically homogeneous territory. In Afghanistan, the Ormur people live in mixed communities with both Tajiks and Pashtun. Whereas, in Pakistan, the Ormur people live only with the Pashtuns.&lt;ref name=ACA /&gt;

Early history of the tribe can be traced in [[Herodotus]]' book. The Persian Emperor [[Darius Hystaspes]]; Governor of Egypt conquered the Greek colonies of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]] and [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in Libya and took them to Egypt on their return from expedition. At this time, the King returned from his Scythian campaign to his capital, Susa. The [[Barakis]] were given a village in [[Bactria]] to live in, later named Barke. After two thousand three hundred and fifty years, the village was still inhabited in 1891 within the same territory.&lt;ref name="RKB" /&gt;

===Ormuri language===
The name 'Ormur' (''orməṛ'') is originally derived from [[Pashto]] (meaning ''fire''). The first man to have made mention of the [[Ormur|Baraki]] language was [[Babur|Babar]], in his book ''[[Baburnama]]''. '''Ormuri''', also called Birki at the time was one of the eleven to twelve tongues that were observed by Babar while in the region of [[Kabul]]. It is known that many of the Ormuri speakers are at least bilingual or trilingual, speaking other tribal languages such as [[Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Dari language|Dari]], or Kaboli &lt;ref name="RKB" /&gt;

[[Pir Roshan]] (Bayazid Khan) was one of the first known [[Pashto]] prose writers and composers of [[Pashto]] alphabets who used several '''Ormuri''' words in his book "Khairul-Bayan." A few of the words that were used within his book were Nalattti (Pigs), Nmandzak of Mazdak (Mosque), Teshtan (Owner), Burghu (flout), Haramunai (ill-born), etc.

==Geographic distribution==
Ormuri is spoken primarily in the town of [[Kaniguram]] in [[South Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]]. A small population also speaks it in the town of [[Baraki Barak]] in [[Logar Province]], [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="RKB" /&gt; The language is sustained by nearly fifty adherents in [[Afghanistan]] and around five to six thousand speakers in [[Pakistan]] &lt;ref name=ACA /&gt;

[[File:FATA (8).jpg|thumb|right|200px|North (purple) and South (blue) Waziristan and surrounding [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] and provinces]]

===Dialects===
There are two dialects of Ormuri; one is spoken in Kaniguram, Waziristan, which is the more archaic dialect, and the other one in Baraki-Barak, Logar. The Kaniguram dialect is not understood in Baraki-Barak. The linguist [[Georg Morgenstierne]] wrote: {{quote|''While Kaniguram has borrowed freely from [[Waziristani dialect|Waziri Pashto]], the vocabulary of Logar has been influenced by other [[Pashto dialects]], and, to a still greater extent, by [[Persian language|Persian]]''.&lt;ref name="Ormuri"&gt;Daniel G. Hallberg (1992) ''Pashto, Waneci, Ormuri (Sociolinguistic Survey of Northern Pakistan, 4)''. National Institute of Pakistani Studies, 176 pp.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|969-8023-14-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The dialect of Kaniguram is currently strong, spoken by a relatively prosperous community of [[Ormur]] in an isolated part of the rugged [[Waziristan]] hills. However, the position of the dialect of Baraki Barak is not strong. Morgenstierne wrote he was told that:{{quote|''Ormuri was no longer spoken in Baraki Barak, the ancient headquarters of the Ormur tribe. Even a man said to be from this village denied the existence of any other language than Persian and Pashto in his native place.''&lt;ref name="Ormuri"/&gt;}}

The vowel system of Ormuri is characterized as heterogenous. The language consists of a subsystem of vowels that found native within Ormuri vocabulary, as well as a subsystem of vowels that is considered "borrowed vocabulary." The differences seen between the [[Logar Province|Logar]] and Kaniguram dialects are mainly based on the quality of vowels instead of the quantity.

The system is based on six phonemes: i, e, a, å, o, u.

&lt;ref name="ACA" /&gt;

The consonant system varies slightly between both the dialects of Kaniguram and Logar. The Logar native consonant system contains 25 phonemes, while the Kaniguram system has 27.

===Syllabic Patterns===
Proper '''Ormuri''' words will have the following syllabic patterns: V, VC, CV, CCV, (C)VCC, CVC, CCVC, CCVCC. Both dialects from Kaniguram and Logar have similar syllabic structure.

====Examples====
*''a''- this
*''un/wun''- so much
*''pe''- father
*''gri''- mountain
*''åxt''- eight
*''måx''- we
*''spok''- dog
*''breš''- burn
*''broxt''- burned
*''wroxt''- beard

At the end of certain words CC occurs as spirant/sonant + occlusive. When separating most words into syllables, a medial CC will be divided:
*''al-gox-tok''- to fall
*''kir-ží''- hen
*''er-zåk''- to come

===Morphology===
The language has undergone extensive change in comparison to its ancestral self. For nominal [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (nouns, adjectives, and pronouns), aspects of the Kaniguram dialect of [[grammatical gender]] has completely been lost in the Logar. In terms of the [[Verb|verbal morphology]], there is a greater variety of conjugations of [[Modal verb|modal]] and tense-aspect forms based on the present-tense stem. There is also a distinction made between masculine and feminine words based on the past-tense system. Finally, there is a greater number of distinctions between within the system of tense-aspect forms and there are different types of [[Ergative verb|ergative]] constructions.

There is a developed system of noun and verb inflections. Nominal parts of speech contains: Three numbers (singular, dual, and plural), three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and the verb has two vices (active and middle). There is the elimination of the category of case (loss in nouns, adjectives, numerals, and certain pronouns). There is also a complete loss of the category of gender, varying on the dialect (Complete loss in Logar and rudimentary masculine and feminine forms remain in Kaniguram). In Logar most original Ormuri nouns and adjectives have a simple stem ending in a consonant and a few nouns end in unstressed (or rarely stressed) -''a'' or -''i''. Whereas in Kaniguram, the stem usually ends in a consonant, but both nouns and adjectives may end in -''a'' or -''i''.&lt;ref name=ACA /&gt;

'''Salience''' is the state or condition of being prominent. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines salience as "most noticeable or important." The concept is discussed in [[communication]], [[semiotics]], [[linguistics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], and [[political science]]. It has been studied with respect to [[interpersonal communication]], [[persuasion]], [[politics]], and its influence on [[mass media]].

==Semiotics==

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]] (the study of signs or symbolism), ''salience'' refers to the relative importance or prominence of a part of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]. The salience of a particular sign when considered in the context of others helps an individual to quickly rank large amounts of information by importance and thus give attention to that which is the most important. This process keeps an individual from being overwhelmed with [[information overload]].

===Discussion===

Meaning can be described as the "system of mental representations of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] or [[phenomenon]], its properties and associations with other objects and/or phenomena. In the [[consciousness]] of an individual, meaning is reflected in the form of sensory information, [[image]]s and [[concept]]s."&lt;ref name="Bedny" /&gt; It is [[denotation (Semiotics)|denotative]] or [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]], but the sign system for transmitting meanings can be uncertain in its operation or conditions may disrupt the communication and prevent accurate meanings from being decoded.

Further, meaning is socially constructed and dynamic as the [[culture]] evolves. That is problematic because an individual's frame of reference and experience may produce some divergence from some of the prevailing social [[norm (sociology)|norms]]. So the salience of data will be determined by both situational and emotional elements in a combination relatively unique to each individual. For example, a person with an interest in [[botany]] may allocate greater salience to visual data involving plants, and a person trained as an [[architect]] may scan buildings to identify features of interest. A person's [[world view]] or ''Weltanschauung'' may predispose salience to data matching those views. Because people live for many years, responses become [[convention (philosophy and social sciences)|conventional]]. At a group or community level, the conventional levels of significance or salience are slowly embedded in the sign systems and culture, and they cannot arbitrarily be changed.
For example, the first thing seen in a poster may be the title or picture of a face.

==Communication studies==
The noun “salience” derives from the Latin word ''saliens -'' ‘leaping, or bounding’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, Vol. XIV|last=|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford.|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Latin Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a human embryo, the heart tissue is beating and leaping.  A Native American may pay no attention to Columbus Day protests until after instruction in tribal and historical Indian traditions (priming).  After gaining new cultural insights, these protests may become “salient.”

Salience, as a component of Communication and Social Psychology studies, asks the question of why something captures and holds our attention and why it is more readily available as a cognition than other facts, feelings, and emotions?  When a person perceives and reacts, they use the information and emotions most readily accessible.  This information is understood to be the most salient information. 
 
Social Influence is an area of intense study for Social Psychologists and Communication theorists.  Social Influence asks how and why, are people influenced to weaken a strongly held position, adopt a new position, change an attitude, or persuade someone?  The extent that the communicator can understand and harness the power of Social Influence is the extent that they can succeed in their goal.

Salience has been identified as one of the key ideas that guides our understanding of how to make a point of view stand out from among others and draw the receivers attention to the salient points of the encoded message.  Salience is then an important concept in several theories relating to Social Influence. Some areas of Communication and Social Psychology research that include the concept of salience as a component of their theory are: Persuasion Theory, Vested Interest, Summation Theory of Attitude Change, Group Salience, and Social Presence Theory.  The use of salience in these theories is summarized below:

'''Persuasion theory:''' Salience is the critical concept, along with agenda and spin, for the Persuasion theory of Professor Richard E. Vatz of Towson University as articulated in his book, /The Only Authentic Book of Persuasion/, (Kendall Hunt, 2012, 2013).  Salience, in his book and articles, is used as a measure of how reality is created for chosen audiences.  He claims (1973) (2013) that the struggle for salience (and agenda and meaning and spin) is the sine qua non of the persuasive process.&lt;ref name="Vatz" /&gt;

'''[[Vested interest (communication theory)]]''':  William Crano's states that, “Vested Interest refers to the extent to which an attitude object is hedonically relevant for the attitude holder” (Crano, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;131).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Article In:  Attitude strength: Antecedents and Consequences|last=Crano|first=William|publisher=Erlbaum|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=131–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for someone to have a vested interest in something, it must be perceived to affect their lives personally.  Things that in which we are highly vested also bear on our behavior (Crano, 1995), and it must be salient or leap out.  Vivid cues are more likely to grab our attention (McArthur &amp; Post, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McArthur|first=Leslie|last2=Post|first2=David|date=1976|title=Figural emphasis and person perception|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=13|pages=520–536|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If an attitude object is salient to us, our vested interest will be increased as well as the likelihood that our behavior and attitudes will be consistent (Sears &amp; Citrin, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tax revolt: Something for nothing in California|last=Sears|first=David|last2=Citrin|first2=Jack|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crano states, “Apparently, making an attitude object more salient enhances the salience of attitude-relevant outcomes as well. Vividness, priming, and similar operations may all enhance the salience of the self-interest implications of a position.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Crano, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;131). The stronger the salience of our attitude, the stronger will be the connection between our attitude object and our behavior.

'''Attitude Summation Theory''':  Fishbein posited that we have many beliefs about an attitude object (characteristics, attributes, values, and etc.).  Each belief held is argued to have an affective (feeling) and evaluative (value determining) component.  An attitude is then a mediated evaluative response (Fishbein, 1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fishbein|first=Martin|date=1963|title=An Investigation of the Relationships between Beliefs about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object|url=|journal=Human Relations|volume=16|issue=3|pages=233–239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These attitudes sum together to form our overall view of the attitude object and comes to the forefront (made salient) when we engage the attitude object.

Fishbein indicates that we can hold six to nine salient beliefs at a time (Cronen, 1973).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cronen |first1=V. E. |title=Belief, Salience, Media Exposure and Summation Theory |journal=The Journal of  Communication |date=1973 |volume=23 |pages=86–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those manifested during the attitude object encounter determine the prevailing attitude. Fishbein believed that the strongest held beliefs would be the most salient and come to the fore.  Cronen argued that salience is not intrinsically tied to strength, but is an independent attribute of attitude change, as some strongly held beliefs are non-salient (Cronen, 1973).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Group Salience''':  Group salience is a person's cognizance of fellow group members similarities and differences within a group interaction (Harwood et al., 2006).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harwood |first1=J. |last2=Hewstone |first2=M. |title=The Family and Communication Dynamics of  Group Salience |journal=The Journal of Family Communication |date=2006 |volume=6 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a group, communication is the primary way that we determine salience of attitudes. Other things such as physical attributes can be observed, but deeper feelings will have to be communicated within the group to make them salient (Harwood et al., 2006).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Coupland et al., suggest that communication processes represent an individual's identity within the group (Coupland et al., 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coupland |first1=J. |last2=Coupland |first2=N. |last3=Giles |first3=H. |last4=Henwood |first4=K. |title=Formulating age: Dimensions of  age identity in elderly talk |journal=Discourse Processes |date=1991 |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=87–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Social presence theory]] (SPT)''': SPT can be defined as, “The degree to which a person is perceived to be a real person in mediated communication.” (Gunwadena, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gunawardena |first1=C. N. |title=Social presence theory and implications for interaction collaborative  learning in computer conferences |journal=International Journal of Educational Telecommunications |date=1995 |volume=1 |issue=2/3 |pages=147–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an update on the original definition, developed by Short, Williams and Christie (1976),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Short |first1=J. |last2=Wiliams |first2=E. |last3=Christy |first3=B. |title=The social psychology of telecommunications |date=1976 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated, “The degree of salience of the other person in an interaction.”

'''What makes something salient?'''  How does the mind select, structure and impart meaning to stimuli?  People “develop and stabilize” cognitions about stimuli by an “examination of action, intention, ability and environment.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taytlor |first1=Shelly E. |last2=Fiske |first2=Susan T. |title=Salience, Attention, and Attribution: Top of the Head  Phenomena |journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |date=1978 |volume=11 |issue=249–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978, citing Heider, 1934, as their source, p.&amp;nbsp;250).  Individuals have limited cognitive resources and abilities to process and comprehend information and situational complexity.  A person cannot grasp every nuance of a stimuli required to assign its full and complete meaning.  Salience is the way researchers understand what information will most likely capture one's attention in a given situation and have the greatest influence on one's cognitions about the stimuli. Research has shown that the most salient information is not always the most accurate or important, but a “Top of the Head Phenomenon” (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;   People are not fully conscious of the extent to which salience affects them.  In experimental studies, individuals generated strong cognitions with only slight manipulation of stimuli.  When shown this fact, the participant reacted strongly to the idea that they made choices based on “trivial” information (Taylor &amp; Fiske, 1978).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

“Salience has generally been treated as a propriety [conforming to standard norms of morality and behavior] of a stimulus which allows it to stand out and be noticed” (Guido, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;114).&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guido |first1=Gianluigi |title=The Dichotic Theory of Salience: A Framework for Assessing  Attention and Memory |journal=European Advances in Consumer Research |date=1998 |volume=3 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guido developed the Theory of Dichotic Salience after a review of some 1,200 studies, which pointed to a “common origin among salience instances, by emphasizing the nature of prominence which is intrinsic to any salience construct” (Guido, 1998, Abstract, p.&amp;nbsp;114).&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;  According to this theory, a stimulus is “in-salient” if it is not in harmony with perceiver's worldview.  It is “re-salient” if it is in harmony with the perceiver's goals (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guido |first1=Gianluigi |title=The Dichotic Theory of Salience: A Framework for Assessing  Attention and Memory |journal=European Advances in Consumer Research |date=1998 |volume=3 |pages=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salience is a construct that depends on the ability of the mind to access the feelings or emotions (affect) generated by the salient stimulus.  The activation in memory of cognitions that relate to and evaluate the stimulus.  And finally, the availability of these mental resources to engage the stimulus (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

A [[schema (psychology)]] is a cognitive framework or concept through which one organizes and interprets information. Schemas provide shortcuts in sorting and interpreting the enormous quantity of information generated in one's environment.  The limitation of such a construct, is that it may cause one to exclude pertinent facts and feelings about a situation.  Instead one may focus on only those that harmonize with one's biases, beliefs and ideations.

Schemas are very useful as they help one to decide about things with very little information.  This simplification filters how one allocates cognitive resources.  It also allows one to learn more readily and rapidly, if the learning fits within an already established schema.  A schema allows for quick access to stored cognitions and filtering through pre-established algorithms, which saves time in processing and retrieving information.  Because they are so useful and reliable in helping one make sense of the world, schemas can be hard to change.   Thomas Kuhn (1962), in his book, [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]], talks about how scientists, considered the most rationale and fact driven professionals, can be so committed to their schemas that they ignore or misinterpret relevant data gathered from experiments that is contrary to their notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kuhn |first1=Thomas S. |title=The structure of scientific revolutions |date=1962 |publisher=University of Chicago  Press |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One challenge for communicators is to find a way to break through these hardened perceptions in order to persuade.  Making an idea salient is one of the keys.

Guido's Principle one is [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure-ground]], which is the means the perceptual field from which people direct their attention towards something that stands out.  Figurality is the brightness, [[complexity]], and energy (movement) of a stimulus.  It is thought that these aspects trigger cognitions and thought processes in the brain that lead to salience.  Brightness includes the magnitude and the colors of the object.  Studies have shown that bright, vibrant colors more easily capture the attention and are easier to remember (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;
 
Complexity builds upon the contextual factors (the number of perceptible qualities about the stimulus object that one can distinguish) and learning (what we perceive as unfamiliar).  Complexity is the interaction of the familiarity, unfamiliarity, and the number of aspects of the stimulus object that we can resolve.  Complexity is the interaction of these stimuli interact to engage affect and cognitions developed about the object (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  Movement of an object engages sensory receptors, which when sparked, send stimuli to the body and brain.  Moving pictures, signs and eyes are used to capture our attention and make us pay attention (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

Novelty is the “isolation” of the stimulus from other stimuli (objects).  This isolation or uniqueness sets it apart from other objects in the background, so that it can be noticed (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  This can also be expressed as comparative distinctiveness (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Higgins |authorlink1=E. Tory Higgins |editor1-last=Higgins |editor1-first=E. Tory |editor2-last=Kruglanski |editor2-first=Arie W. |title=Social Psychology: Handbook of Basic Principles |date=1996 |publisher=The Guilford Press |location=New York |pages=133–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Guido's Principle two is Unusuality, which can be broken down into statistical novelty (unique and unfamiliar), unexpectancy, out of role behaviors, negativity and extremity (emotional impact).  Novelty is the degree that one has no experience with the stimuli.  Unexpectancy is a result of learning.  We have developed an expectation that is violated (Guido, 1998).&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;  Negativity is our gut reaction.  Extremity is the emotional impact of the Negativity. Each of these contributes to making something salient.

'''Accessibility and Salience'''.  When we evaluate a situation, what comes first to our minds?  The things that come to mind are those that are most accessible (most readily recalled and those that are most salient (Kreech and Crutchfield, 1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kreech |first1=D. |last2=Crutchefield |first2=R. S. |title=Theory and Problems of Social Psychology |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our beliefs and thoughts vary in salience. Salient beliefs are most easily activated in the cognitive processes and are more easily recalled, and are therefore more accessible (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;

Salience is determined by stimuli, such as brightness, contract, situational properties, schemas, expectations, arousal, and properties of the interpreter (e.g., need state, enduring beliefs, and motivations).   The interconnectedness of these stimuli causes the brain to be activated and information salient to the situation recalled and acted upon.

Information stored in memory, that is accessible, can be recalled either by a cue or free association.  Information that is not accessible, cannot be recalled and therefore is not available for use in interpreting a situation.  Higgins (1996) defines a memory's [[activation potential]] as having three properties: 1. the possibility that the knowledge can be recalled (not repressed or lost), 2. how easily accessible is it, and 3.the intensity or the energy of the memory.&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  To the extent that memories are available, accessible, and have sufficient effect is the extent that these memories will be activated and that knowledge is brought to bear on the situation at hand.

Cramer (1968, p.&amp;nbsp;82) defines [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] as "a change in antecedent conditions which is specifically designed to increase the probability of a particular response given to a particular stimulus".  The process of priming can activate a particular memory to bring it to the fore so that it can be engaged in a communication or social influence situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cramer |first1=P. |title=Word Association |date=1968 |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Priming has been shown to increase accessibility of relevant knowledge (Higgins, 1996).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  Priming is, then, any event that causes increased accessibility and availability of a framework of knowledge (schema) useful for that particular situation.

In journalism, priming is associated with framing.  When an author writes an article to persuade, he or she frames certain information so that it is more salient to the reader (Weaver, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaver |first1=David H. |title=Thoughts on Agenda Setting, Framing, and Priming |journal=Journal of Communication |date=2007 |volume=57 |pages=142–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Framing including writing decisions about definitions of words and events, causal linkages, moral implications, and solution sets for the problem area (McCombs, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCombs |first1=M. |title=New frontiers in agenda setting: Agendas of attributes and frames |journal=Mass  Communication Review |date=1997 |volume=24 |issue=1–2 |pages=32–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Our minds sort information available using our agenda (framing) and stimulus (priming) for that situation and activate it to accomplish our purpose.

When one encounters a stimulus for the first time, the initial reaction is characterized as [[unconditioned response]].  An unconditioned response is one that “elicits a national, reflexive response.”  (Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;136).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weseley |first1=Alison J. |title=Barron's AP Psychology |date=2014 |publisher=Barron’s  Educational Series, Inc |location=New York |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent encounters will elicit a [[conditioned response]] has been developed through the learning that occurred with the intervening encounters with the stimulus.  This learning is bedrock knowledge on which one draws when responding to a given situation.  (Weseley &amp; McEntarffer, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weseley |first1=Alison J. |title=Barron's AP Psychology |date=2014 |publisher=Barron’s  Educational Series, Inc |location=New York |pages=136–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the first time one ate ice cream the experience was pleasant, the second experience will be informed from the firs.  The second experience will generate salient pleasant cognitions, salivation, and other biological responses that will reinforce the pleasant salience of the experience.  If on the other hand, the first encounter was negative (disgust, pain or nausea), the second encounter will generate the feeling of pain in the stomach awful memories of the first encounter. which will reinforce the negative salience of the first and second experience.

Another key aspect of whether a particular memory or knowledge will be activated is whether it is applicable to the situation.  If it is not applicable, it will not be salient and is unlikely to be activated for that situation.  “According to the synapse model…, the process begins with the stimulus, which increases the excitation level of stored knowledge as a function of the features of the match between the attended features of the stimulus and the features of the stored knowledge.” (Higgins, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;137).&lt;ref name="The Guilford Press"/&gt;  The stimulus information creates a pathway to the knowledge, which is then evaluated for a salience match to the stimulus.  If there is a match, then the knowledge will be activated.

Our minds and bodies are bombarded by relevant and irrelevant knowledge and experiences every day.  We will tune into salient ones (crane the ears to more fully hear enjoyable music) and tune-out non-salient ones (cover our ears from jackhammer noise).  There is difference between seeing something and looking at it.  In seeing, the capacity of our retina to take in the light energy is engaged and the brain processes that information into an image.  When one looks at an object, not only are visual perceptive capacities engaged, but other mental processes for evaluation and ordering of the object are activated (Skinner, 1974).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Skinner |first1=B. F. |title=About Behaviorism |date=1974 |publisher=Vintage Books a Division of Random House |location=New York |pages=113–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have gatekeeper mental mechanisms that allow certain information in and keeps others out. This discrimination process can be viewed a defensive mechanism the protects and enhances our life experience.  Our processes of making cognitions “also involve contingencies of reinforcement.” (Skinner, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;117).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"/&gt;  Skinner implies that reinforcement as “a special kind of stimulus control.”  (Skinner, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;119).&lt;ref name="About Behaviorism"/&gt;  Salience can be thought of as a reinforcement mechanism that make certain thoughts, feelings and emotions available, accessible, applicable and actionable within the context of the situation.

Esber and Haselgrove (2011) looked at the use of predictiveness and uncertainty on stimulus salience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Esber |first1=G. |last2=Haselgrove |first2=M. |title=Reconciling the influence of predictiveness and uncertainty  on stimulus salience: A model of attention in associative learning |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |date=2011 |volume=278 |issue=1718 |pages=2553–2561}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They cite the example of a bird watching the water for the presence of fish.  Through learning, the bird associates the ripples with the closeness of the fish, but they must be careful of the uncertainty that ripple is not caused by a crocodile.  The ripples are very salient, if they are caused by fish suitable for use as food.  The likelihood increases that the ripples will catch the attention of the bird and improve its probability of eating the fish, if the ripple cue is a predictor of fish behavior and presence.  The predictiveness of ripples reinforces its salience.  The Esber–Haselgrove model argues that (1) “stimuli acquire added salience to the degree that they predict motivationally relevant consequences”, and  (2) “a predictor of multiple reinforcers should have more salience than a predictor of just one.” (Esber &amp; Haselgrove, 2011, 2555-25557).&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;  So, for example, if ripples predict both the presence of fish and the increased likelihood that the fish can be caught, they will be much more salient to the bird, than if the ripples only predict the presence of the fish, but tell the bird nothing about the probability of making a catch.

Salience is a broad concept in the social sciences, that can cause confusion.  Part of the confusion lies in that different researchers use the same term to posit different ideas of what makes a particular stimulus salient.  When we encounter an object or idea, we may be draw to it for a variety of reasons.  It may be its brightness or intensity, its predictive capacity, or other features such as uniqueness or enormity that catches one's attention.

Once the attention is engaged, our brain will begin to process this information and make assessments and judgements about the encounter.  Our minds and bodies will activate useful memories, biological responses and feelings that were generated from prior encounters with the object of similar objects.  These memory-evaluative-feeling-biology responses will determine if the object is salient.  If it is salient, we will devote more cognitive processing resources to the encounter and it will enhance or protect us in that moment.

===Axioms of salience===
[[Communication]] scholars have found that a number of different factors have a direct effect on the salience of attitude objects.

====Direct experience====
[[William Crano]] posits that one's direct experience with an issue or attitude object increases the salience and consequently the [[wikt:potency|potency]] of that [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and the level of consistency between attitude and [[behavior]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

:For example: Consider two people: one with emphysema, one without. Both of whom share a negative attitude toward cigarette smoking. The person with emphysema would have a stronger attitude than his counterpart, and consequently would show greater consistency between his relevant attitude and behavior. It is posited by Crano that the attitude toward smoking of the person with emphysema may be more salient due to his direct experience with the consequence of smoking.

====Self-Interest====

The concept called ''[[Vested interest (communication theory)|vested interest]]'' by Crano is called ''self-interest'' by Sears (1997). It seems that "self-interest" is the more widely recognized term. Self-interest involves either perceived or actual personal consequences. That is, Crano (1997) argues that vested interest involves perceived personal consequences (p.&amp;nbsp;490), while Sears (1997, a critique of Crano) counter-argues that Crano's survey experiments define it objectively. Crano argues that vested interest should have a moderating effect on attitudes. Sears argues that, actually, evidence for this is conflicting: The survey literature has rarely found significant effects of self-interest, while the experimental literature finds significant effects. The literature is concerned with salience only marginally; it is actually about strength of attitudes (i.e. how well they correlate with behavior). It is about salience inasmuch as anything "strong" is "salient".

====Needs and aspirations====
The salience (prominence) of an [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] can also be measured by the [[relevance]] of an [[idea]] to that person's [[needs]] or aspirations.&lt;ref name="Tacos" /&gt; As ideals become more salient they become more [[accessible]], the more [[accessible]] the attitude object is the stronger the attitude toward the object. As [[accessibility]] increases, so does the likelihood of self-interested [[voting]] (Young).

:For example: In times of elections, issue relevant events are the focus of attention. Therefore, candidates, due to their aspiration for a certain political position are interest driven toward the salient events since they are favorable to their party.

===Policy making===
{{Confusing|section|date=August 2008}}

Political scientists agree that salience is relatively important in examining political [[policy]], because policies are not only determined by what issues are important to people but also by how important they are. This involves examining what issues are ignored and which are made "important." One research agenda that political scientists are concerned with understanding is "when and how salience and changes in salience matter for political action."

There are three related understandings of salience.

#The first ("classical") interpretation considers salience to be independent of the "[[status quo]]" and politicians’ ideal policies and programs. Although it says salience is independent of ideals, it does not say that salience is independent of preferences. This means, where there is a change in salience there is also a change in preferences. Often a player or policymaker's ideals may not be known but their preferences are usually revealed in their party's manifestos. Often policymakers cannot achieve their ideals but rather must choose between the offers on the table. They may prefer one over the other and this is where salience affects a party or a politician's position on an issue.
#The second ("[[valence (psychology)|valence]]") interpretation proposes that for certain issues salience is a very important factor. In other words, when there is a general [[consensus]] of [[principle]]s, the relative salience of various issues amongst the public determines the policy position of policy makers. This is due to constraints in policy making, where ideals are often induced, which policy makers view as the tradeoff space. For example, although "ideally" they may like to see low [[unemployment]] and low [[inflation]], they are usually constrained to pick a position on the "tradeoff" line. Thus, their ideal has been induced due to constraints. In these situations salience and policy position are almost interchangeable, because their "induced ideal" is their "favored allocation."{{Clarify|date=August 2008}} In the classical interpretation, salience would be used to describe the different levels of preference between positions on [[policies]].
#The third ("price") interpretation assumes that salience is not separate from ideals, as the classical view states, but that it is also not the same as ideals, as the valence view claims. This interpretation assumes that although a group of players, sharing benevolent preferences, all dissatisfied with the [[status quo]], may still value different aspects differently when considering policy change. The price interpretation is favored over the other two for three reasons. First, it is more applicable. Unlike the classical view, the price interpretation can be applied to a more wide-ranging set of situations. Second, the price interpretation uses both the classical point of view and ideals in its evaluation of salience. Not only do you need to know a player's weighted preferences but also their connection to their ideal point and the [[status quo]]. Therefore, a change in salience can reflect a change in ideal point, [[status quo]], or their weighted preferences. Third, this interpretation can be used to determine the elements stand in importance or worth. For example, players may organize and focus their time and energy into options with the biggest pay off. "That is they may look to see where they get the greatest ‘bang for their buck.’"&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;

==Public opinion==
McCombs and Shaw’s seminal “Chapel Hill study”, which researched salience and public opinion examined most of the agenda-setting research since the [[United States presidential election, 1968]] which has been concerned with how the public salience of the issue is related to [[mass media]]’s ranking of these issues in terms of frequency of coverage and news play. The main [[hypothesis]] examined in this study is the ranking of certain issues by the [[Mass media|media]], which, in time, becomes the public agenda. More importantly, the article searched whether the perceived public salience of the federal budget deficit is significantly related "to the amount of public knowledge about the issue, direction of public opinion regarding one possible solution to the issue, the strength of that opinion and political behavior such as writing letters, signing petitions, voting, etc." The result of this study concluded that "even though the federal deficit issue was one of the more salient to newspaper and voters during the 1988 [[election]], it (the federal budget deficit) was not as emotional or [[drama]]tic as some of the other highly salient issues such as [[drug abuse]] or [[environmental pollution]]. Thus it seemed likely that public opinion regarding a solution to the federal budget deficit might be rather evenly split and would likely be more stable during the month of interviewing than would opinion on some of the other more dramatic issues being emphasized in news media coverage and political advertisements." In other words, issues that directly involve subjects, in this study, would conclude to be more salient than issues that do not involve them directly.

==Marketing stimuli==

Although salience is a stimulus response, is it a stimulus quality or an absolute quality?&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt; Salience plays an important role in intergroup communication. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, "Group salience is a key variable both in influencing quality of intergroup contact and in moderating the effects of intergroup contact on prejudicial attitudes."

In their study of family communication and intergroup relationships, "Group salience is an individual’s awareness of group memberships and respective group differences in an intergroup encounter (e.g., the salience of race in an interracial conversation)."&lt;ref name="Harwood" /&gt; This study carefully examines the dynamics of intergroup relationships with respect to communication in a family context. Their study involved communicative aspects associated with age salience in the grandparent&amp;nbsp;– grandchild relationship, the extent to which various dimension of communication predicts measures of salience, relational or inter-family proximity, and attitudes towards aging. According to Harwood, Raman and Hewstone, "Communication phenomena that were positively correlated with measures of age salience were negatively related to relational closeness. Only one communication measure (grandparents talking about the past) moderated the relationship between quality of contact with grandparent and attitudes toward older people. Specific communicative dimensions emerged that warrant further investigation in this and other intergroup contexts."&lt;ref name="Harwood" /&gt;

Salience also from an applied communicative perspective plays an important role in our [[Consumer]]- [[Marketing]] world. In Gianluigi Guido's book, ''The Salience of Marketing Stimuli: an incongruity&amp;nbsp;– salience hypothesis on consumer awareness'', "salience triggered by an external physical stimuli, like all marketing stimuli are before being internalized by consumers&amp;nbsp;– to explain and predict the conditions under which a marketing stimulus, is able to achieve its communication outcomes in term of processing and memory."&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt; The book clearly defines the history of the definition of salience and the ambiguities of arriving at an accurate definition. It also utilizes various theories to best define salience in our marketing world. Of the many theories, Guido uses aspects of Incongruity theory, [[Schema (psychology)|Schema]] theory and an information processing model referred to as the In-salience hypothesis emphasizes the nature of prominence of salience.

Marketing plans have become quite intricate and detailed in many ways.  Analysts and industry experts used a myriad of tools to collect information from would be customers, previous customers and others in order to fashion the sales message of a particular product.  This level of detailed work has evolved over time, but in many ways the same resources and information are gathered and used to achieve result of a sale.  The marketing strategy feeds into one of the final products most people get to experience: the commercial.  The commercial embodies the elements of the marketing strategy in language, affective response, and attitude change.  Marketing plans in the modern age also look at the international customer when creating plans and formulating strategy.  “An evolutionary perspective of internationalization of the firm has been adopted by a number of authors in the areas of international economics and international management. The theory of the international product lifecycle, propounded by Vernon and others, identifies a number of phases in the internationalization process based on the location of production. In the initial phase, a firm exports to overseas markets from a domestic production base. As market potential builds up, overseas production facilities are established. Low cost local competition then enters the market, and ultimately exports to the home market of the initial entrant, thus challenging its international market position.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Craig |first=C.Samuel |last2=Douglas |first2=Susan P. |date=December 1996 |title=Responding to the challenges of global markets: Change, complexity, competition and conscience |journal=The Columbia Journal of World Business |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=6–18 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5428(96)90028-9 |issn=0022-5428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"This model is part of wider Dichotic theory of salience, according to which a stimulus is salient either when it is incongruent in a certain context to a perceiver's schema, or when it is congruent in a certain context to a perceiver's goal. According to the four propositions of the model, in-salient stimuli are better recalled, affect both attention and interpretation, and are moderated by the degree of perceivers' comprehension (i.e., activation, accessibility, and availability of schemata), and involvement (i.e., personal relevance of the stimuli). Results of two empirical studies on print advertisements show that in-salient ad messages have the strongest impact in triggering ad processing which, in turn, leads to consumer awareness."&lt;ref name="Guido" /&gt;

The field of marketing is continually being studied and researched.  Anshular &amp; Kumar, Williams &amp; Schmidt, Holden, Kuznetsov &amp; Whitelock, and Huang &amp; Chan have researched and published works regarding the language of marketing.  Although the research is ongoing and adaptive to the customer, the research has been able to study points of importance to the consumer.  Marketing requires an approach that carefully designs messages (commercials), utilizing  signs and symbols to resonate with a potential buyer or customer.  Nike's swoosh, Michael Jordan's jump-man image, Ford/GMC Cadillac logos are all signs that most people can quickly grab and discern the message being laid out.  In the world of marketing having this power and ability gives you a significant edge in comparison to the competition.  Van Der Lans, Pieters, and Wedel write based on their research “we estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by consumers’ search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing activities such as advertising.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Lans|first=Ralf|last2=Pieters|first2=Rik|last3=Wedel|first3=Michel|date=September 2008|title=Research Note—Competitive Brand Salience|journal=Marketing Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=922–931|doi=10.1287/mksc.1070.0327|issn=0732-2399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using computer based langue to design extraction tools as part of the user experiences.  Language errors that exists in projects can be passed on and further create issues for the next group.  From this view issues to be fixed, ID’d and solutions set up to combat such issues. In the IT world, coding language is very important and therefore errors must be monitored well throughout the process.

Internet Alcohol Vendors unlike traditional brick and mortar stores are established to reach a wider market.  With this intent state officials and competitors have both started cases in court as further regulating the practice of internet alcohol sales.  Internet sales give buyers reduced discounts in many forms while offering very little in security and accountability.  The case brought against the industry favored further regulation keying in on individuals underage age having access to and buying alcohol online.  The courts pushed back against the plaintiff lacking substantial information to make the case.  The marketing language used was focused on reduced taxes based on quantity purchased and reduced or zero fees for shipping.  Customers were connected to this message and therefore drawn to the product and made significant purchases.

Russian viewpoint of marketing focused on the battle against capitalism, the west and specifically USA.  Marketing language focused on the economics of each nation and how to improve it in an ever-changing world.  Marketing was studied in the west by Russian students and translated for Russians to understand. Bad language came from translators who took artistic leisure with the material.  Based on this context things were changed and missed when information was being relayed created huge shifts in understanding of the original material.

The difference between the English alphabet and Chinese logographical system offer a unique challenge in brand creation, marketing and language.

Therefore, to define salience as appropriate as possible using the information, it would be apt to define it such that, salience is that [[intrinsic]] concept of the perceived or interpreted prominence of an attitude, and its manifestation on our choices.

Salience in marketing based on the research reviewed, can be categorized as a stimulus quality. What that means is the customers’ needs have to be calculated and adjusted towards through the entire planning and execution of the plan.  The overall goal of the messenger should be to create a message which adapts to the customer's affective responses, rewarding it with more info, then finally providing a product which would best arrive at the predetermined feel.  Most consumers when asked about a marketing campaign are able to identify it clearly from the point of view of a commercial. These commercials capture the essence of the message being sent to all recipients.  Products such as make up, cars, clothing, coffee, food, shoes etc. are all designed to create and provide an affective reaction from the recipient. The process of engaging with the customer seeks a cognitive connection.  Customers will have to be grouped based on the item in order to predict affective responses.  With this in mind, the focus is placed on imagery, affective responses from the consumer. How does this make you feel, do you empathize, how would you feel about using this product, etc.  Marketing messages that have a significant affective component are able to connect better with people and yield greater outcome.

Identity salience can affect the consumer.  This display can be explain using “Identity theory posits that identities are arranged hierarchically and that salient identities are more likely to affect behavior than those that are less important. We propose that identity salience may play an important role in relationships that are distinguished by a minimum of two characteristics. First, though most theoretical and empirical research in relation-ship marketing focuses on characteristics of successful business-to-business relationships, such as trust and commitment (Morgan and Hunt 1994), many exchange relationships involve individuals. It is not unusual for organizations to attempt to develop long-term relationships with consumers on an individual basis. We argue that in contexts in which one partner is an individual, for example, business-to consumer marketing, identity salience may be an important construct that mediates relationship-inducing factors, such as reciprocity and satisfaction, and relationship marketing success."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnett|first=Dennis B.|last2=German|first2=Steve D.|last3=Hunt|first3=Shelby D.|date=April 2003|title=The Identity Salience Model of Relationship Marketing Success: The Case of Nonprofit Marketing|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=67|issue=2|pages=89–105|doi=10.1509/jmkg.67.2.89.18614|issn=0022-2429|citeseerx=10.1.1.659.532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity gets tied to brands, products and places for some people.  There are generations of family sports team supporters, airline users, vacation goings and even restaurant patrons.  These key items become a foundation block of self-identification and perception.

The vehicle industry uses certain symbols as part of its marketing campaign. Most of these are touched on from different manufacturers in their efforts to win over customers.  These are also common messages points that are used to make the sale and acquire the vested interest of the customer.  For e.g. comfort (leather seating), roominess (cabin space), reliability, safety, performance, on/off-road handling, award winner by category, insurance companies or other entity.  The best part of all the campaign is the dealership experience.  This experience is the affective piece of the process.  The initial being cognitive and schema connection, followed by the affective which aims at nudging the customer towards affirming the purchase.  Customer attitudes can be influenced by a myriad of variables, therefore the marketing campaign is aimed at skewing enough of those variables towards to nearest dealer or once most capable of making the sale. “Specifically, research on behavioral synchrony suggests that people express greater feelings of attraction when they share their visual gazes, body postures (Chartrand &amp; Lakin,2013), and more recently, their language style in writing or speech (Ireland &amp; Pennebaker,2010)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Cathy R.|last2=Kersten|first2=Mike|date=2016-03-15|title=Mortality salience increases language style matching and well-being|journal=Self and Identity|volume=15|issue=4|pages=452–467|doi=10.1080/15298868.2016.1154888|issn=1529-8868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salience as a stimulus quality is a significant piece of the marketing, sales and commercial strategy.  Manufacturers use celebrities, athletes, and other professionals as a way of drawing your attention to their product through stimulus.  When it comes to car buying, many people refer to a past memory, this stimuli is different with each person but overall the quality and richness of that response is what connects to the brand in a way nothing else does.  Care makers go through periods of recycling pieces of nostalgia to connect new drivers to those of yesteryear.  Granpa is able to drive his mustang next to a grandson who favors the new model with a few modifications.  A suit maker is able to dress members of the same family for 3 generations and just as many weddings and formal events.

The stimulus quality is the strongest connection between all these events and the company or product creator able to take advantage of this, is most likely to achieve success.  “Research concerning stimulus characteristics, which include information content and format, suggests that consumers utilize more nutrition information when it Is presented in an easily processed form (Levy et al. 1985; Muller 1985; Russo et al. 1986; Scammon 1977).(Moorman, 1990)”  Stimulus qualities continually change and therefore needs to be studied and adaptations made in order to attain the best marketing end results.  Cultural viewpoints of marketing and advertising is important across industries in many parts of the world.  In the US alcohol sales are restricted to individuals ages 21 and greater, that rule isn’t universal and some in nations around the world are trying to cope with the effects of marketing and ad campaigns (O’Brian &amp; Carr 2016).”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=Kerry S.|last2=Carr|first2=Sherilene M.|date=2016-09-07|title=Commentary on de Bruijnet al.(2016): Effective alcohol marketing policymaking requires more than evidence on alcohol marketing effects-research on vested interest effects is needed|journal=Addiction|volume=111|issue=10|pages=1784–1785|doi=10.1111/add.13489|pmid=27605080|issn=0965-2140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marketing messages are important based on the roles of the recipient.  In the example of a mom she’s expected to judge the quality of goods and purchase based on the needs of children even though the good may not directly be marketed to and for her.  “Noting the incongruence between the self-interested, utility maximizing persona one is expected to portray in the workforce, and the selﬂess, nurturing persona widespread among mothers, Hays argues that the latter identity in fact reveals a deep-seated cultural ambivalence towards economistic principles and behaviours.”&lt;ref&gt;de Laat, K., &amp; Baumann, S. (2016). Caring consumption as marketing schema: representations of motherhood in an era of hyperconsumption. Journal Of Gender Studies, 25(2), 183-199. doi:10.1080/09589236.2014.927353&lt;/ref&gt;

le form schema based on social norms and roles.  These roles are enforced individual beliefs and boosts perceptions is supposed to be doing, sometimes those expectations hold true and in others it doesn’t.  Social identity theory has been used while creating marketing strategies regarding women. Marketing strategies with products aimed at women should have like minds as part of the planning and creative process. Women across cultures and backgrounds experience similar stimuli but not on the same wave.  Products like shoes, makeup, clothing and others geared specifically for women have messages focused on stimuli response of “feel good”.  Moms receive and are sent messages of safety and security of their children, a measure of style and the look and presentation of a strong woman.  Marketing towards men are designed to inspire the feel of strength, leadership, vision, connection to nature, and feeling of ruggedness.

The Language used in marketing is important because it is potentially the most important reason why someone makes a purchase/acquires a product.  Research has shown that analytics aren’t always the best predictor of sales or consumer connection with a product. Social identity theory can be used to evaluate the roles of individuals while creating the strategy.  Depending on this solely will lead one astray without the addition of other pieces of information.  Shema allows the consumer to receive each detail of a commercial/ad campaign in a way that energizes particular stimuli and therefore puts each person into the “driver seat” of an experience.

The cognitive perspective spells out information which must be received, processed and analyzed and solutions south.  Salience in marketing searches for the affective or stimulus response.  A combination of efforts which both harvests information and processes it carefully if very important.  Things such as age group, buying power, shopping frequency, socioeconomic status are all important.  Once a product is created and during its testing phase the response which users and customers alike will be its feel.  In the new age of tech data, appliances and complex machinery, marketing will still need to focus its efforts on such products and how consumer stimuli reacts to the product.  The best engineers can create something that's amazing with all its bells and whistles, but its up to the perception of the customer to evaluate its usefulness and fit into his/her lifestyle.

The growing tech industry with the power of achievement is quickly advancing virtual reality.  VR can be experienced in the home without leaving to try or test any product prior to purchase.  "The mural isn't just about aesthetics. Visitors will be instructed via signs to download an app to view the mural's augmented reality features. Downloading the app will also unlock a special coupon at The Elephant Room. It's a marketing tactic that Moody believes can drive foot traffic to the bar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tschanz|first=Dirk Schart, Nathaly|title=Kapitel 6  Praxiswissen: Von der Idee zur App|date=2017|work=Augmented und Mixed Reality|pages=153–172|publisher=UVK Verlagsgesellschaft mbH|isbn=9783739803845|doi=10.24053/9783739803845-154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With this power marketing analysts and executives can craft messages and commercial aimed at each person with a unique and authentic feel.  Information and data points are being collected and tested now. Video games offer a chance into the virtual world medical training and some groups in government and the military are adopting the technology to better achieve results.  Crafting the message and spreading it out the masses will take less effort in the future, messages can be adapted to fit all manner of permutations each person may have.  There may finally be an era of error free messaging with a direct link into the internet, show rooms of fashion designers, engineers at car factories and all other sorts of products.  Testing in the virtual world would be far less tasking on legions of people.

Humans in general respond greatly to stimuli and we offer this through the reactions generated. Marketing lends help in this manner by studying the patterns of behavior and crafting products for sale.  The messaging is not always clear, succinct, and wide reaching.  Research is still ongoing regarding how best to reach the customer in order to pitch and complete a sale.  Those who are successful have crafted tools to help measure key things like salience in messaging and reaction to products.  In the new age, the data collected will be very important while outfitting each member of the consuming public.  Being able to craft a message or medium that can quickly adapt to each person virtually is of great importance.  Online markets are gaining followership daily as more money spending moves to the digital realm.  Perception and reception of the message is still the single most important part of any marketing strategy and should not be treated lightly.

The '''Scots Wikipedia''' ({{lang-sco|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is the [[Scots language]] version of [[Wikipedia]], and is run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. It was established on 23 June 2005, and first reached 1,000 articles in February 2006, and 5,000 articles in November 2010. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, it has about {{formatnum:{{#expr:{{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|sco}} round -3}}}} [[encyclopedia article|articles]].&lt;ref name=Meta&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Wikipedias|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias|work=meta.wikimedia.org|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots Wikipedia is one of eight Wikipedias written in an [[English languages|Anglic language]] or English-based pidgin/creole, the others being the [[English Wikipedia]], the [[Simple English Wikipedia]], the [[Old English Wikipedia]], the [[:pih:Mien_Paij|Pitkern-Norfuk]] Wikipedia, the [[Tok Pisin]] Wikipedia, the [[Jamaican Patois]] Wikipedia, and the [[Sranan Tongo]] Wikipedia.

==Reception==
By February 2008, the site contained 2,200 articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Learnin's jist a wee click awa | date = 25 February 2008 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-175269362.html | work = [[Daily Mirror]] | accessdate = 2012-07-31}} {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had already outpaced other Wikipedias, such as [[Maori Wikipedia]] and [[Kashmiri Wikipedia]].  Reported reception, however, was mixed, with ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'''s literary editor describing it as "convoluted at best, and an absolute parody at worst,"&lt;ref name=scotsun&gt;{{cite news|last=Horne |first=Marc |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scots-finds-home-on-gey-muckle-website-1-1430165 |title=Scots finds home on gey muckle website |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|date=24 February 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ted Brocklebank]], culture spokesman for the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish Tories]], described it as a "cheap attempt at creating a language."&lt;ref name=scotsun/&gt;  However, Dr Chris Robinson, director of the ''[[Dictionary of the Scots Language]]'', spoke more positively of the site, noting: "The fact it is doing well gives a lie to all those people who decry Scots and try to do it down."&lt;ref name=scotsun/&gt; And Jane C Hu of [[Slate.com]] describes how it is regarded as a "joke" by some and goes on to debate whether Scots is really its own language or just a dialect of English, and therefore whether someone who [[m:Proposals_for_closing_projects/Closure_of_Scots_Wikipedia|proposed to delete the Wikipedia]] because it was a "joke project" was right or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/08/05/despite_disputes_over_whether_scots_is_separate_language_or_dialect_of_english.html|title=The Free Enclopaedia That Awbody Can Eedit: Scots Wikipedia Is No Joke|author=Jane C.

A '''service rig''' is a mobile platform loaded with oil industry service equipment that can be driven long distances within the oil fields to service wells.&lt;ref name="BeckerParker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K.

''Service Rig Drive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several specialized types of service rigs: the carrier, the pumptruck, the doghouse, a 5-ton equipment truck and several crew vehicles. The rigs usually travel in a convoy, because all of the component rigs are needed for proper oil well servicing. The crew use the equipment on the rigs to provide a variety of services, including completions, work-overs, abandonment's, well maintenance, high-pressure and critical sour-well work and re-entry preparation.

Offshore oil rigs are serviced by floating versions of the same equipment.

==Vehicles/Equipment==

The Rig, or Carrier, is a mobile truck with a derrick and a cab for one driver. The carrier can also be trailer-mounted, enabling it to be towed behind a prime mover. Traditionally, trailer-mounted service rigs are much larger and heavier, with greater capacities.&lt;ref name="InvestmentsTeufel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fisher Investments|author2=Andrew Teufel|author3=Aaron Azelton|title=Fisher Investments on Energy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RyWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=15 January 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-47873-8|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once secured on location, the derrick is elevated to standing position with the use of hydraulics. After that, the rest of the rig can be assembled and the service process initiated.

The Pumptruck has a large tank on the rear, and is used to pump fluid and store fluid from the well during different stages of the maintenance process. It is assembled using a series of pipes and operated with valves and pressure systems.

The Doghouse is a portable building used by the crew members to suit up, eat lunch, and assemble during meetings and breaks. It holds the communications and emergency equipment, a washroom, and has a storage space for inventory and tools. This space is referred to as the Light Plant, and in some occasion's a tool room, the Light Plant contains a diesel generator to provide electricity for lights and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servicerigdrive.ca/live/FAQs+%3A+Service+Rig+vs+Drilling+Rig "The Service Rig and Supporting Equipment"]. ''Service Rig Drive''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5 Ton is a large truck which carries tools and other equipment, including the B.O.P.'s(blow-out preventer), tongs, a rod table, and extra pipe. It also pulls the doghouse from one location to the next.

==Crew Members==
The crew members on service rigs each have specialized experience and expertise. The entry-level workers are junior floor hands&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troymedia.com/2015/07/02/a-solution-to-the-oil-industrys-vacant-jobs-paradox/ "A solution to the Alberta vacant jobs paradox']. ''Troy Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; called roughnecks; they do most of the heavy work on the rig floor, as well as hauling pipe, maintaining equipment and cleaning up.  Derrickhands are more experienced workers who assemble the pump truck, monitor circulations and handle pipe and rods on the elevated tubing board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71021182 "Occupations and Educational Programs"]. ''Alberta Learning Information Service''&lt;/ref&gt;  The most experienced member of a service rig crew is the driller, who runs the control panel next to the rig floor, controls the height of the derrick, monitors the roughnecks and derrickhands, and sees that the job is done efficiently but safely.

Each service rig has a manager called a Toolpush, who orders and monitors supplies, monitors and records the progress of each job and schedules the crew's time.  At times there is also a representative present from the oil company whose wells are being serviced.

Service rig crew's are often under the supervision of a Consultant who is contracted through said oil company and reviews safety and job tasks with the crew, and organizes the process of moving from each well and ensuring the 
completion of the job.

Jobs on service rigs are often more stable than those on drilling rigs, because maintenance is an ongoing process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihsmaritime360.com/article/16218/ezion-may-see-demand-rise-for-liftboats-service-rigs "Ezion may see demand rise for liftboats, service rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801230428/http://www.ihsmaritime360.com/article/16218/ezion-may-see-demand-rise-for-liftboats-service-rigs |date=2015-08-01 }}.

'''Smartcat''' is a [[computer-assisted translation]] [[web app]] that enables collaborative translation.

==History==
Smartcat was originally developed as a [[Computer-assisted translation|CAT]] tool in 2012–2015 as an in-house solution by ABBYY Language Solutions, a linguistic service provider within the [[ABBYY]] group of companies. The impetus for its development was that ABBYY LS had “felt constrained by translation technologies that had existed for the last 15 years” and wanted a solution that would let them “manage projects with dozens of collaborators, including project managers, translators, editors, and so on” while being “intuitive, cloud-based, scalable, and powerful.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://smtc.at/no-seats|title=Why we don’t count seats: On Licenses, Monkeys, and Cognitive Biases — The Smartcat Blog|last=|first=|date=2017-04-05|work=The Smartcat Blog|access-date=2017-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214202757/https://smtc.at/no%2Dseats|archive-date=2018-02-14|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Smartcat spun out of ABBYY LS to become a separate company and attracted $2.8 mln in investments from Ilya Shirokov (ex-[[Chief executive officer|CEO]] at [[Odnoklassniki]] and founder of [[Yandex]]-acquired social network MoiKrug.ru).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slator.com/ma-and-funding/smartcat-raises-usd-2-8m-seed-round-russian-vc/|title=SmartCAT Raises USD 2.8m Seed Round From Russian VC → slator.com|date=2016-07-20|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABBYY LS’s founder and CEO Ivan Smolnikov also left the company to fully focus on Smartcat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://roem.ru/20-03-2017/245418/smolnikov-yesorno/|title="Interview with Ivan Smolnikov" → Roem.ru|date=2017-03-20|access-date=2017-05-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasons for the separation were that the “translation automation business turned out far from being complementary to that of a language services provider” and that “some translation companies had been wary of using a service being developed by a competitor.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As of July 2018, the platform has around 200,000 freelancers in its marketplace&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartcat.ai|title=Smartcat — Translation ecosystem that makes it easy for companies and talents to connect and collaborate|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=May 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provides an “app store” that allows integrating one’s Smartcat account with third-party tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartcat.ai/appstore/|title=Smartcat Store|website=www.smartcat.ai|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monetization ==
Unlike most CAT tools{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}, Smartcat does not charge for user-based licenses, because it believes that “counting seats just doesn’t fit in the translation business, where more than 90% of the headcount in companies are freelancers and where new collaboration projects with a different number of them are set up on a daily basis.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Instead, Smartcat’s monetization is mostly based on the above-mentioned 10% commission charged on top of the rates of freelancers listed in and hired through its marketplace (which rates are decided upon and set by freelancers themselves)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smtc.at/academy-fe07-txt|title=FE07. Understanding Smartcat Marketplace|website=Smartcat Community|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in case of hiring companies from the LSP marketplace, 10% of the order price{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Apart from that, the company also offers paid subscriptions for premium support and standalone (non-Cloud) installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smartcat.ai/plans/|title=Plans and Pricing Smartcat|website=www.smartcat.ai|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Branding and marketing ==
In 2017, the Smartcat has undergone a rebranding, adopting the tagline of “Connecting Purple” (a pun on [[Nokia]]’s “Connecting People”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.smartcat.ai/topic/409-%E2%80%9Cconnecting-purple%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Ctranslation-ecosystem%E2%80%9D-what%E2%80%99s-in-the-words/|title="Connecting Purple" and "Translation Ecosystem": What’s in the words?|website=Smartcat Community|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and positioning itself as a “translation '''ecosystem''' that makes it easy for companies and talents to '''connect and collaborate'''” (emphasis by Smartcat).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the “ecosystem” approach, the company claims to underline that all of its users, whether customers or translators, are “equally important participants of the whole system, a system that can only thrive if all its members thrive.”&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Smartcat pays a great deal of attention to working with individual translators through various community initiatives such as a diversely developed community portal (under the tagline of “Let’s talk translation”),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smtc.at/community|title=Smartcat Community|website=Smartcat Community|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; free courses and webinars for translators,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smtc.at/academy|title=Smartcat Academy – Crowdcast|last=|first=|date=|website=Crowdcast|access-date=2017-05-12}}{{dead link|date=June 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a peer review-based certification process to elect “Senior Translators”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smtc.at/senior-translators|title=Looking for Talent: 5 Reasons to Become a Smartcat Senior Translator — The Smartcat Blog|date=2017-04-07|work=The Smartcat Blog|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document formats==

Smartcat supports a variety of input formats, including text documents, presentations, spreadsheets, scanned documents and images (including a paid OCR service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.smartcat.ai/topic/16-how-much-for-machine-translation-and-image-recognition-ocr/?do=findComment&amp;comment=21|title=How much for machine translation and image recognition (OCR)?|website=Smartcat Community|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) , HTML pages, resource files, industry-standard bilingual formats, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://smartcat.ai/Help/freel/en/faq_en.htm|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=smartcat.ai|access-date=2017-05-12}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also claims to support [[SDL Trados]] packages, which allows using it as an environment to work on projects originally intended for SDL Trados, including generation of return packages to be further handled in Trados,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smtc.at/trados-packages|title=Trados Packages in Smartcat! — The Smartcat Blog|date=2016-09-21|work=The Smartcat Blog|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the degree of such support has been contested by [[SDL plc|SDL]] representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://multifarious.filkin.com/2016/12/27/all-that-glitters-is-not-gold/|title=All that glitters is not gold…|date=2016-12-27|website=multifarious|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''surface subgroup conjecture''' of [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]] states that the fundamental group of every closed, irreducible [[3-manifold]] with infinite [[fundamental group]] has a surface subgroup.  By "surface subgroup" we mean the fundamental group of a closed surface not the 2-sphere. This problem is listed as Problem 3.75 in [[Robion Kirby]]'s problem list.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robion Kirby]], [http://math.berkeley.edu/~kirby/problems.ps.gz ''Problems in low-dimensional topology'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming the [[geometrization conjecture]], the only open case was that of closed [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]]s.  A proof of this case was announced in the summer of 2009 by [[Jeremy Kahn]] and [[Vladimir Markovic]] and outlined in a talk August 4, 2009 at the FRG (Focused Research Group) Conference hosted by the University of Utah. A preprint appeared in the arxiv.org server in October 2009.&lt;ref name=kahn/&gt; Their paper was published in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' in 2012
.&lt;ref name=kahn&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4007/annals.2012.175.3.4 | arxiv = 0910.5501| title = Immersing almost geodesic surfaces in a closed hyperbolic three manifold| journal = Annals of Mathematics| volume = 175| issue = 3| pages = 1127| year = 2012| last1 = Kahn | first1 = J. | last2 = Markovic | first2 = V. | authorlink2 = Vladimir Markovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2012, Kahn and Markovic were given the [[Clay Research Award]]s by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] at a ceremony in [[Oxford]].

In [[literary theory]], a '''text''' is any object that can be "read", whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing.  It is a coherent set of [[Sign (semiotics) | signs]] that transmits some kind of informative [[message]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuri Lotman]] - The Structure of the Artistic Text&lt;/ref&gt; This set of symbols is considered in terms of the informative message's ''content'', rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented. 
 
Within the field of [[literary criticism]], "text" also refers to the original information content of a particular piece of writing; that is, the "text" of a work is that primal symbolic arrangement of letters as originally composed, apart from later alterations, deterioration, commentary, translations, [[paratext]], etc.  Therefore, when literary criticism is concerned with the determination of a "text", it is concerned with the distinguishing of the original information content from whatever has been added to or subtracted from that content as it appears in a given textual document (that is, a physical representation of text).

Since the [[history of writing]] predates the concept of the "text", most texts were not written with this concept in mind. Most written works fall within a narrow range of the types described by text theory. The concept of "text" becomes relevant if and when a "coherent written message is completed and needs to be referred to independently of the circumstances in which it was created."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Origin of the term==
The word '''text''' has its origins in [[Quintilian]]'s [[book]] on speeches, with the statement that "after you have chosen your
words, they must be weaved together into a fine and delicate fabric", with the Latin for fabric being ''[[wikt:textus#Participle|textum]]''.&lt;ref name="dm"/&gt;

==Uses of the term for analysis of work practice==
Relying on literary theory, the notion of text has been used to analyse contemporary work practices. For example, Christensen (2016)&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, L.R. (2016). On Intertext in Chemotherapy: an Ethnography of Text in Medical Practice. Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW): The Journal of Collaborative Computing and Work Practices. Volume 25, Issue 1, pp 1-38 &lt;/ref&gt; rely on the concept of text for the analysis of work practice at a hospital.

[[File:Translating the wiki way.webm|thumb|400px|thumbtime=16:00|Niklas Laxström presents, ''Translating the wiki way: Simple, fast, fun'', Wikimania 2012|alt=Niklas Laxström]]

translatewiki.net was made available by Niklas Laxström&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikimedia.org|website=blog.wikimedia.org|title=Niklas Laxström, language engineer and Wikimedian|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=1 November 2014}}{{unreliable source?|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as localisation platform for all languages of [[MediaWiki]] around June 2006, when it was named Betawiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Besides translation, it was developed with the characteristics of an [[integrated development environment]] for MediaWiki (Nukawiki in 2005&lt;ref name=celebrates/&gt;), with a focus on improvement of [[internationalisation]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the end of 2007 Siebrand Mazeland joined the management of the website, which was moved to the current domain {{url|translatewiki.net}}.

In April 2008, it already supported over 100 languages for MediaWiki and 200 of its extensions, "making it one of the most translated software projects ever", as well as [[FreeCol]]. Since then, while being an independent volunteer project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gómez Fontanills |first1=David |last2=Mörth |first2=Karlheinz |year=2012 |title=Panorama of the wikimediasphere |journal=Digithum |volume= |issue=14 |pages= |publisher=[[University of Cataluna]] |doi= |url=http://journals.uoc.edu/index.php/digithum/article/download/n14-gomez/n14-gomez-eng |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330160112/http://www.uoc.edu/ojs/index.php/digithum/article/viewFile/n14-gomez/n14-gomez-eng |archivedate=30 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work

In 2012, its translation memory engine expanded to all Wikimedia projects using Translate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2013, the Translate platform underwent a major revamp through the "Translate User eXperience" project, or "TUX", including "changes in navigation, editor look and feel, translation area, filters, search, and color &amp; style".&lt;ref name=tux/&gt;

The '''Waorani''' (Huaorani) language, commonly known as '''Sabela''' (also ''Wao, Huao, Auishiri, Aushiri, Ssabela'' ; [[endonym|autonym]]: '''Wao Terero'''; pejorative: ''Auka, Auca'') is a vulnerable [[language isolate]] spoken by the [[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] people, an [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] group living in the [[Amazon Rainforest]]  between the [[Napo River|Napo]] and [[Curaray River]]s in [[Ecuador]]. A small number of speakers with so-called [[Uncontacted people|uncontacted]] groups may live in [[Peru]].

==Phonology==
Huaorani distinguishes [[nasal vowel]]s from oral ones. Syllable structure is (C)V, with frequent vowel clusters.

==Dialects==

Huaorani has three dialects: ''Tiguacuna (Tiwakuna), Tuei (Tiwi Tuei, Tiwi),'' and ''Shiripuno.''

==Genetic relations==
Sabela is not known to be related to any other language.  However, it forms part of [[Terrence Kaufman]]'s [[Yawan languages|Yawan]] proposal.

==Status==
Huaorani is considered endangered due to growing bilingualism in Quechua and Spanish and diminishing Huaorani usage among youth.&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{E18|auc|Sabela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documenting Language, Culture, and Cognition: Language and Space among the Waorani|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/sites/default/files/assets/documents/linguistics/2012_Fawcett.pdf|first=Alexia Zandra|last=Fawcett|publisher=Anthropology and Linguistic Department, Bryn Mawr College|date=May 2012|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Armenian language}}

'''Western Armenian''' ([[Classical Armenian orthography|Classical spelling]]: {{Lang|hy|արեւմտահայերէն}}, ''arevmdahayerên'')&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced ''arevmtahayeren'' in Eastern Armenian and spelled արևմտահայերեն in the [[Armenian orthography reform|reformed orthography]].&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the two [[standard language|standardized]] forms of [[Armenian language|Modern Armenian]], the other being [[Eastern Armenian]]. Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were spoken in the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as [[Western Armenia]]. Following the extermination of the Armenian population during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915 Standard (literary) Western Armenian is now spoken, almost exclusively, in the [[Armenian diaspora]] communities around the world, while the spoken or dialectal varieties of Western Armenian currently in use include [[Homshetsi dialect|Homshetsi]], spoken by the [[Hemshin peoples]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victor A.

Forms of the [[Karin dialect]] of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia, mostly in [[Gyumri]], [[Artik]], [[Akhuryan]], and around 130 villages in the [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] province,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baghdassarian-Thapaltsian|first=S.

[[Nakhichevan-on-Don]] Armenians speak another Western Armenian variety based on the dialect of [[Armenians in Crimea]], where they came from in order to establish the town and surrounding villages in 1779 ([[:hy:Նոր Նախիջևանի բարբառ|Նոր Նախիջեւանի բարբառ]]).

Western Armenian dialects are currently spoken also in [[Gavar]] (formerly Nor Bayazet and Kamo, on the west of [[Lake Sevan]]), [[Aparan]], and [[Talin, Armenia|Talin]] in Armenia ([[Mush dialect]]), and by the large Armenian population residing in [[Abkhazia]], where they are considered to be the first or second ethnic minority, or even equal in number to the local Abkhaz population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/islam-tekushev/unlikely-home|title=An unlikely home|author=Islam Tekushev|publisher=[[openDemocracy]]|date=5 January 2016|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mostly a diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries. Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian outside Armenia and Georgia at less than one million.

==Distinguishing forms of Armenian==
Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian are, for the most part, mutually intelligible for educated or literate users of the other, while illiterate or semi literate users of lower registers of each one may have difficulty understanding the other variant. An example of differences in phonology, the "b" in Eastern Armenian is pronounced "p" in Western Armenian, similarly with "g" in Eastern Armenian that is pronounced "k" in Western Armenian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/armenian.htm|title=Armenian alphabet, language and pronunciation|website=Omniglot.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same goes for "d" in Eastern Armenian that is pronounced "t" in Western Armenian and "dj" in Eastern Armenian that is pronounced "tch" in Western Armenian.

==Speakers==
Western Armenian is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] spoken by part of the population of [[Armenia]] in dialectal forms, Armenians of [[Abkhazia]], most Armenians in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and the [[Armenian diaspora]], mainly in [[North America]] and [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], most of the [[Middle East]] except for [[Iran]], and [[Rostov-on-Don]] in [[Russia]]. It is spoken by only a small percentage of [[Armenians in Turkey]] as a first language, with 18 percent among the community in general and 8 percent among younger people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/en/politics/2010/09/29/r-melqonyan-book/|title=Turkologist Ruben Melkonyan publishes book "Review of Istanbul's Armenian community history"|first=Helix Consulting|last=LLC|website=Panorama.am|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Armenian was at one point the dominant Armenian variety. After the genocide, Western Armenia was wiped clean of Western Armenians. Those who fled to Eastern Armenia today speak either Eastern Armenian, or have a diglossic situation between Western Armenian dialects in informal usage and an Eastern Armenian standard. The only Western Armenian dialect still spoken in Western Armenia is the [[Homshetsi dialect]], as [[Hemshin peoples|the people who speak it]] did not fall victim to the Armenian Genocide due to being Muslim.

On 21 February 2009 [[International Mother Language Day]] has been marked with the publication of a new edition of the ''Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger'' by [[UNESCO]] where the Western Armenian language in Turkey is defined as a '''[[endangered language|definitely endangered language]]'''.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Culture Sector], UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bianet.org/english/kategori/english/112728/unesco-15-languages-endangered-in-turkey|title=UNESCO: 15 Languages Endangered in Turkey, by T.

====Differences in phonology from Classical Armenian====
The differences in phonology between Western Armenian and [[Classical Armenian]] phonology include the distinction of [[Stop consonant|stops]] and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]].

First, while [[Classical Armenian]] has a three-way distinction of stops and affricates: one voiced and two voiceless — a plain version and an [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated one]] — Western Armenian has kept only a two-way distinction — one voiced and one aspirated. For example, Classical has three bilabial stops: {{IPA|/b/}} {{angbr|բ}}, {{IPA|/p/}} {{angbr|պ}}, and {{IPA|/pʰ/}} {{angbr|փ}}; Western Armenian, two bilabial stops: {{IPA|/b/}} {{angbr|պ}} and {{IPA|/pʰ/}} {{angbr|բ}}/{{angbr|փ}}.

Second, Western Armenian has shifted the Classical Armenian ''voiced'' stops and ''voiced'' affricates into ''aspirated'' stops and ''aspirated'' affricates, and replaced the ''plain'' stops and ''plain'' affricates with ''voiced'' ones.

Specifically, the following are the changes from Classical Armenian to Western Armenian:
# Bilabial stops:
## merging of Classical Armenian {{IPA|/b/}} {{angbr|բ}} and {{IPA|/pʰ/}} {{angbr|փ}} as {{IPA|/pʰ/}}
## voicing of Classical {{IPA|/p/}} {{angbr|պ}} to {{IPA|/b/}}
# Alveolar stops:
## merging of Classical Armenian {{IPA|/d/}} {{angbr|դ}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} {{angbr|թ}} as {{IPA|/tʰ/}}
## voicing of Classical {{IPA|/t/}} {{angbr|տ}} to {{IPA|/d/}}
# Velar stops:
## merging of Classical Armenian {{IPA|/ɡ/}} {{angbr|գ}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}} {{angbr|ք}} as {{IPA|/kʰ/}}
## voicing of Classical {{IPA|/k/}} {{angbr|կ}} to {{IPA|/ɡ/}}
# Alveolar affricates:
## merging of Classical Armenian {{IPA|/dz/}} {{angbr|ձ}} and {{IPA|/tsʰ/}} {{angbr|ց}} as {{IPA|/tsʰ/}}
## voicing of Classical {{IPA|/ts/}} {{angbr|ծ}} to {{IPA|/dz/}}
# Post-alveolar affricates:
## merging of Classical Armenian {{IPA|/dʒ/}} {{angbr|ջ}} and {{IPA|/tʃʰ/}} {{angbr|չ}} as {{IPA|/tʃʰ/}}
## voicing of Classical {{IPA|/tʃ/}} {{angbr|ճ}} to {{IPA|/dʒ/}}

As a result, a word like {{IPA|[dʒuɹ]}} 'water' (spelled {{angbr|ջուր}} in [[Classical Armenian]]) is cognate with Western Armenian {{IPA|[tʃʰuɹ]}} (also spelled {{angbr|ջուր}}). However, {{IPA|[tʰoɹ]}} 'grandson' and {{IPA|[kʰaɹ]}} 'stone' are pronounced similarly in Classical and Western Armenian.

==Orthography==
{{main|Classical Armenian orthography}}
Western Armenian uses [[Classical Armenian orthography]], also known as the traditional or Mashtotsian orthography. The [[Armenian orthography reform]] introduced in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and still used by most Eastern Armenian speakers from modern [[Armenia]] has not been adopted by Eastern Armenian speakers of Iran and their diaspora, and by Western Armenian, with the exception of periodical publications published in Romania and Bulgaria while under Communist regimes.

==Morphology==
===Nouns===
Western Armenian nouns have six [[grammatical case]]s: [[nominative case|nominative]] (subject), [[accusative case|accusative]] (direct object), [[genitive case|genitive]] (possession), [[dative case|dative]] (indirect object), [[ablative case|ablative]] (origin) and [[instrumental case|instrumental]] (means). Of the six cases, the nominative and accusative are the same, except for personal pronouns, and the genitive and dative are the same, meaning that nouns have four distinct forms for case. Nouns in Armenian also decline for number (singular and plural), but do not decline for gender (i.e. masculine or feminine).

Declension in Armenian is based on how the genitive is formed. There are several [[declension]]s, but one is dominant (the genitive in ''i'') while a half-dozen other forms are in gradual decline and are being replaced by the ''i''-form, which has virtually attained the status of a regular form:

===Articles===
Like English and some other languages, Armenian has definite and indefinite articles. The indefinite article in Western Armenian is {{IPA|/mə/}}, which follows the noun:

''mart mə'' ('a man', Nom.sg), ''martu mə'' ('of a man', Gen.sg)

The definite article is a suffix attached to the noun, and is one of two forms, either '''-n''' (when the final sound is a vowel) or '''-ə''' (when the final sound is a consonant). When the word is followed by '''al''' (ալ = also, too), the conjunction '''u''' (ու), or the present or imperfect conjugated forms of the verb '''em''' (to be); however, it will always take '''-n''':

: ''martə'' ('the man', Nom.sg)
: ''karin'' ('the barley' Nom.sg)
but:
: ''Sa martn e'' ('This is the man')
: ''Parin u charə'' ('The good and the bad')
: ''Inkn al'' ('He too')

The indefinite article becomes '''mən''' when it is followed by '''al''' (ալ = also, too) or the Present or imperfect conjugated forms of the verb '''em''' (to be):

: ''mart mə'' ('a man', Nom.sg)
but:
: ''Sa mart mən e'' ('This is a man')
: ''Mart mən al'' ('A man as well')

===Adjectives===
Adjectives in Armenian do not decline for case or number, and precede the noun:

: ''agheg martə'' ('the good man', Nom.sg)
: ''agheg martun'' ('to the good man', Gen.sg)

===Verbs===
{{Further|Armenian verbs}}
Verbs in Armenian are based on two basic series of forms, a "present" form and an "imperfect" form. From this, all other tenses and moods are formed with various particles and constructions. There is a third form, the preterite, which in Armenian is a tense in its own right, and takes no other particles or constructions.

The "present" tense in Western Armenian is based on three [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] ('''a, e, i'''):

{| class="wikitable"
| &amp;nbsp;
| ''sir'''el'''''&lt;br/&gt;(to love)
| ''xōs'''il'''''&lt;br/&gt;(to speak)
| ''gart'''al'''''&lt;br/&gt;(to read)
|-
| ''yes'' (I)
| ''sir'''em'''''
| ''xōs'''im'''''
| ''gart'''am'''''
|-
| ''tun'' (you.sg)
| ''sir'''es'''''
| ''xōs'''is'''''
| ''gart'''as'''''
|- valign=top
| ''an'' (he/she/it)
| ''sir'''ē'''''
| ''xōs'''i'''''
| ''gart'''a'''''
|-
| ''menk'' (we)
| ''sir'''enk'''''
| ''xōs'''ink'''''
| ''gart'''ank'''''
|-
| ''tuk'' (you.pl)
| ''sir'''ēk'''''
| ''xōs'''ik'''''
| ''gart'''ak'''''
|-
| ''anonk'' (they)
| ''sir'''en'''''
| ''xōs'''in'''''
| ''gart'''an'''''
|}

The present tense (as we know it in English) is made by adding the particle '''gə''' before the "present" form, except the defective verbs ''em'' (I am), ''gam'' (I exist, I'm there), ''unim'' (I have), ''kidem'' (I know) and ''gərnam'' (I can), while the future is made by adding '''bidi''':

: ''Yes kirk′ə gə gartam'' (I am reading the book or I read the book, Pres)
: ''Yes kirk′ə bidi gartam ''(I will read the book, Fut).

For the exceptions: bidi əllam, unenam, kidnam, garenam (I shall be, have, know, be able).
In vernacular language, the particle "gor" is added after the verb to indicate present progressive tense. The distinction is not made in literary Armenian.

: ''Yes kirk′ə gə gartam gor'' (I am reading the book)&lt;ref&gt;In vernacular language, the particle ''gor'' is added after the verb to indicate present progressive tense. The distinction is not made in literary Armenian.&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb without any particles constitutes the subjunctive mood, such as "if I eat, should I eat, that I eat, I wish I eat":

'''Yao''' is a [[Bantu language]] in [[Africa]] with approximately two million speakers in [[Malawi]], and half a million each in [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]]. There are also some speakers in [[Zambia]]. In Malawi, the main dialect is Mangochi, mostly spoken around [[Lake Malawi]]. In Mozambique, the main dialects are Makale and Massaninga. The language has also gone by several other names in English, including chiYao or ciYao (the prefixed form), Achawa, Adsawa, Adsoa, Ajawa, Ayawa, Ayo, Ayao, Djao, Haiao, Hiao, Hyao, Jao, Veiao, and waJao.&lt;ref name=e17/&gt;

In Malawi, most Yao speakers live in the Southern Region near the southeast tip of [[Lake Malawi]] and bordering [[Mozambique]] to the east. In Mozambique most speakers live in [[Niassa Province]] from the eastern shore of Lake Malawi (Lago Niassa) to the [[Lugenda River]] up to where it meets the [[Rovuma River]]. In [[Tanzania]] most speakers live in the south central, [[Mtwara Region]], Masasi district and in the Ruvuma Region, [[Tunduru]] district, east of Lake Malawi along the Mozambican border.

In common with very many vernacular languages in Africa, it has historically enjoyed little official recognition, and literary work in the region where Yao is spoken has taken place in such languages as Arabic, English, German and Portuguese.

== Phonetics and orthography ==

As in English, unvoiced [[plosives]] are breathed and voiced [[plosives]] are not. There are conventionally only five 'pure' vowels, viz. a, e, i, o, u, though there is some variation in vowel length. Yao is minimally [[tone (linguistics)|tonal language]], as is common in Bantu languages.

In each of the main three countries where Yao is spoken, the [[orthography]] differs widely, and there is a low literacy rate. In Tanzania, the orthography is based on that of [[Swahili language|Swahili]], whereas in Malawi it is based on that of [[Chewa language|Chewa]]. The Malawian form uses the following characters:

&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable"

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

[[Macron (diacritic)|Macrons]] can be used to prevent ambiguity that would otherwise arise due to the lack of representation of vowel length.&lt;ref name = "sanderson"&gt;Sanderson, Meredith (1922). ''A Yao Grammar''. Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ngunga"&gt;Ngunga, Armindo (2002). "Elementos de gramática da língua Yao". Imprensa Universitária, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Maputo.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grammar ==

Yao is an [[SVO language]]. Like all Bantu languages, Yao is [[agglutinative]], with a highly regular paradigm of verbal inflection, and its nouns placed in a variety of classes indicated by prefixes, these partially corresponding to actual categories of objects or people. To each class is associated a ''characteristic'', used in the formation of pronouns and ''concord links'', prefixes used before verbs governed by, and adjectives describing, a noun of the given class.

=== Noun classes ===

|-
| 16
| (pa-)
| pa
| locality (at)
|-
| 17
| (mu-, mwa-)
| mu
| locality (in)
|}

The corresponding concord links are identical to the nominal prefixes except in the cases of classes 1 and 2, which have concord links 'mb-' and 'a-' respectively. The convention of including classes 15b, 16 and 17 deviates from the traditional Bantu system, their prefixes being more properly prepositional or case determiners.

=== Verbal forms ===

The personal forms are given below, with informal forms given in brackets.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Personal form prefix
! English equivalent (pronoun)
|-
| n-, ni-
| I
|-
| (u-)
| (thou)
|-
| a-
| he, she, it, you
|-
| tu-
| we
|-
| m-, mu-, mw-
| you
|-
| ŵa-, a-
| they (he, you)
|}

There are affirmative and negative forms of the verb, each with approximately the following divisions:

==== Indicative mood ====

As in many Bantu languages, this is characterised by an ending 'a'. Present, immediate future, present perfect, past and past perfect tenses are distinguished, the last being irregular in formation.

==== Subjunctive mood ====
The subjunctive mood is similar in form to the indicative, but as in many Bantu languages, the final 'a' is changed to 'e'. It can be used as a polite imperative, and is usually associated with subordinate clauses.

==== Imperative ====
To form the 'ordinary' (often less polite) imperative, the simple stem may be used, or 'n' may be prefixed to the indicative, or the continuative suffixes '-ga' or '-je'  may be added.

=== Pronouns ===

The [[personal pronoun]]s relate only to classes 1 and 2. Other pronouns are formed from the class links. These pronouns, as a common Bantu feature, are absolute, in that they stand alone from the rest of the sentence: for nominative accusative and prepositional forms, affixes must be used. The third person pronouns depend on noun class, as explained above.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Absolute pronoun
! English equivalent (subject pronoun, object pronoun)
|-
| une
| I, me
|-
| (ugwe)
| thou, thee
|-
| uwe
| we, us
|-
| umwe
| you
|}

These forms may be combined according to certain normal Bantu laws of vowel elision with prefixes such as 'na' (with, and).

There are also several demonstratives, most of which form triples ('this one', 'that one nearby', and 'that one far away')-  that is, triple deixis is used.
