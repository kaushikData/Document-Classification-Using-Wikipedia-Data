''' SOLiD ''' (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection) is a [[Single-molecule sequencing|next-generation DNA sequencing]] technology developed by [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] and has been commercially available since 2006. This next generation technology generates hundreds of millions to billions of small sequence reads at one time.

This method should not be confused with "sequencing by synthesis," a principle used by Roche-454 [[pyrosequencing]] (introduced in 2005, generating millions of 200-400bp reads in 2009), and the [[Solexa]] system (now owned by Illumina) (introduced in 2006, generating hundreds of millions of 50-100bp reads in 2009)

These methods have reduced the cost from $0.01/base in 2004 to nearly $0.0001/base in 2006 and increased the sequencing capacity from 1,000,000 bases/machine/day in 2004 to more than 5,000,000,000 bases/machine/day in 2009. Over 30 publications exist describing its use first for nucleosome positioning from Valouev et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Valouev A, Ichikawa J, Tonthat T |title=A high-resolution, nucleosome position map of C. elegans reveals a lack of universal sequence-dictated positioning |journal=Genome Research |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=1051–63 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18477713 |pmc=2493394 |doi=10.1101/gr.076463.108|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; transcriptional profiling or strand sensitive RNA-Seq  with Cloonan et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Cloonan N, Forrest AR, Kolle G |title=Stem cell transcriptome profiling via massive-scale mRNA sequencing |journal=Nature Methods |volume=5 |issue=7 |pages=613–9 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18516046 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.1223|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; single cell transcriptional profiling with Tang et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Tang F, Barbacioru C, Wang Y |title=mRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=377–82 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19349980 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.1315|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately human resequencing with McKernan et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =McKernan KJ, Peckham HE, Costa GL |title=Sequence and structural variation in a human genome uncovered by short-read, massively parallel ligation sequencing using two-base encoding |journal=Genome Research |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=1527–41 |date=September 2009 |pmid=19546169 |pmc=2752135 |doi=10.1101/gr.091868.109|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
A library of DNA fragments is prepared from the sample to be sequenced, and is used to prepare clonal bead populations. That is, only one species of fragment will be present on the surface of each magnetic bead. The fragments attached to the magnetic beads will have a universal P1 adapter sequence attached so that the starting sequence of every fragment is both known and identical. Emulsion [[PCR]] takes place in microreactors containing all the necessary reagents for PCR. The resulting PCR products attached to the beads are then covalently bound to a glass slide.

Primers hybridize to the P1 adapter sequence within the library template. A set of four fluorescently labelled di-base probes compete for ligation to the sequencing primer. Specificity of the di-base probe is achieved by interrogating every 1st and 2nd base in each ligation reaction. Multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed with the number of cycles determining the eventual read length. Following a series of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and the template is reset with a  primer complementary to the n-1 position for a second round of ligation cycles.

Five rounds of primer reset are completed for each sequence tag. Through the primer reset process, each base is interrogated in two independent ligation reactions by two different primers. For example, the base at read position 5 is assayed by primer number 2 in ligation cycle 2 and by primer number 3 in ligation cycle 1.

==Throughput &amp; Accuracy==
According to ABI, the SOLiD 3plus platform yields 60 gigabases of usable DNA data per run. Due to the two base encoding system, an inherent accuracy check is built into the technology and offers 99.94% accuracy. The chemistry of the systems also means that it is not hindered by homopolymers unlike the Roche 454 FLX system and so large and difficult homopolymer repeat regions are no longer a problem to sequence.

==Applications==
Naturally the technology will be used to sequence DNA, but because of the high parallel nature of all next generation technologies they also have applications in [[transcriptomics]] and [[epigenomics]].

[[DNA microarray|Microarrays]] was once the mainstay of the transcriptomics the last ten years and array based technology has subsequently branched out to other areas. However, they are limited in that only information can be obtained for probes that are on the chip. Only information for organisms for which chips are available can obtained, and they come with all the problems of hybridizing large numbers of molecules (differing hybridizing temperatures). RNA-Seq transcriptomics by next gen sequencing will mean these barriers no longer hold true. Any organism's entire transcriptome could be potentially sequenced in one run (for very small bacterial genomes) and not only would the identification of each transcript be available but expression profiling is possible as quantitative reads can also be achieved.

[[Chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (ChIP) is a method for determining transcription factor binding sites and DNA-protein interactions. It has in the past been combined with array technology (ChIP-chip) with some success. Next gen sequencing can also be applied in this area. Methylation immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) can also be performed and also on arrays.

The ability to learn more about methylation and TF binding sites on a genome wide scale is a valuable resource and could teach us much about disease and molecular biology in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Abu 'Abdallah Muhammad''' (died 995) was the last ruler of the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarezm]] from 967 to 995. He was the son and successor of [[Abu Sa'id Ahmad]].

During the chaos that occurred among the [[Samanids]], Khwarazm was not affected by it. However, in 992, Abu 'Abdallah aided the Samanid ruler [[Nuh II]] against the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], and was granted several towns in northern [[Khurasan]], which included the important town of [[Abiward]]. Abu 'Ali Simjuri, the governor of Khurasan, however, refused to grant the latter the cities.
In 995, [[Ma'mun I ibn Muhammad]], the [[Ma'munids|Ma'munid]] ruler of [[Gurganj]], invaded the domains of Abu 'Abdallah and executed him, putting an end to Afrighid rule, and uniting the Khwarezm province under his rule.

== History ==

APCA was founded in Cape Town in 2002 after 28 palliative care trainers from across Africa met together and discussed the need for regional cooperation. The group produced the Cape Town Declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Palliative Care Trainers Declaration of Cape Town November 13, 2002|journal=Journal of Palliative Medicine|date=July 7, 2004|volume= 6|issue=: 3|pages=339–340|doi=10.1089/109662103322144637|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/109662103322144637|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which holds palliative care, pain and symptom control as a human right for every adult and child with life-limiting illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=APCA|title=About us|url=http://www.africanpalliativecare.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=20|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; APCA however was not formally founded until two years later in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=True Colours Trust|title=Partners: APCA|url=http://www.truecolourstrust.org.uk/palliative-care-in-africa/african-palliative-care-association/|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then APCA has continued to state palliative care as a human right, working with Human Rights Watch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Human Rights Watch|title=Easing Africa's Pain: The Need for Palliative Care|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/16/easing-africas-pain-need-palliative-care|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Open Society Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Open Society Foundation|title=Palliative Care is a human right|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/palliative-care-human-right-fact-sheet|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling on governments to live up to their responsibilities.

== Notable staff ==

Dr. Emmanuel Luyirika is the current executive director of APCA. He took up this position in August 2012. Before moving to APCA, Dr. Luyirika worked as clinical director, centre director and ultimately country director for Mildmay International in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ehospice|title=Merging medicine and management, Dr Emmanuel Luyirika|url=http://www.ehospice.com/africa/ArticlesList/MergingmedicineandmanagementDrEmmanuelLuyirika/tabid/1970/ArticleId/670/language/en-GB/View.aspx#.UaW7ZtIwdw8|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Faith Mwangi-Powell was the founding director of APCA and held that position until 2012. Since then she has gone on to become the senior program officer for global advocacy with the International Palliative Care Initiative of the Open Society Foundations. Dr. Faith holds a Ph.D. in women's health and development and has published over 20 peer reviewed papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Open Society Foundation |title=Staff |url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/people/faith-mwangi-powell |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020023954/http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/people/faith-mwangi-powell |archivedate=20 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Andean condor''' (''Vultur gryphus'') is a South American bird in the [[New World vulture]] family [[Cathartidae]] and is the only member of the [[genus]] '''''Vultur'''''. Found in the [[Andes]] mountains and adjacent Pacific coasts of western South America, the Andean condor is the largest flying bird in the world by combined measurement of weight and wingspan. It has a maximum wingspan of {{convert|3.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}{{sfn|Richard P. Reading|Brian Miller|2000}} exceeded only by the wingspans of four [[seabirds]] and [[water birds]]—the roughly {{convert|3.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} maximum of the [[wandering albatross]], [[southern royal albatross]], [[great white pelican]] and [[Dalmatian pelican]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson-Lees"&gt;{{cite book

It is a large black vulture with a ruff of white feathers surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.

The condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.

The Andean condor is a national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; It is threatened by habitat loss and by [[secondary poisoning]] from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Andean condor was described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The exact [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] placement of the Andean condor and the remaining six species of [[New World vulture]]s remains unclear.&lt;ref name="SACC"/&gt; Although both are similar in appearance and have similar [[ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World vultures]] evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world and are not closely related.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Condor des Andes mâle adulte.jpg|thumb|right| Andean condor, in Chilean national park [[Torres del Paine]]]]
The Andean condor is found in [[South America]] in the [[Andes]], including the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta|Santa Marta Mountains]]. In the north, its range begins in [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]], where it is extremely rare,&lt;ref name="BirdLife"/&gt; then continues south along the Andes in [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]], through [[Bolivia]] and western [[Argentina]] to the [[Tierra del Fuego]].&lt;ref name="Blake"/&gt; In the early 19th century, the Andean condor bred from western Venezuela to Tierra del Fuego, along the entire chain of the Andes, but its range has been greatly reduced due to human activity.&lt;ref name="Haemig "/&gt; Its habitat is mainly composed of open grasslands and alpine areas up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation. It prefers relatively open, non-forested areas which allow it to spot carrion from the air, such as the [[páramo]] or rocky, mountainous areas in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Andean Condor in flight.jpg|thumb|left|Soaring over [[Arequipa]] in southern [[Peru]]]]
The condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its [[primary feather]]s bent upwards at the tips.&lt;ref name="Hilty"/&gt; The lack of a large [[sternum]] to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft.&lt;ref name="Wehner"/&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] commented on having watched them for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Like other [[New World vulture]]s, the Andean condor has the unusual habit of [[urohidrosis]]: it often empties its [[cloaca]] onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through [[evaporative cooling|evaporation]] has been proposed as a reason for this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird.&lt;ref name=Sibley1991&gt;{{cite book

===Longevity===
Being a slowly-maturing bird with no known natural predators in adulthood, an Andean condor is a long-lived bird. Longevity and mortality rates are not known to have been extensively studied in the wild. Some estimations of lifespans of wild birds has exceeded 50 years. In 1983, the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] considered the longest-lived bird of any species with a confirmed lifespan was an Andean condor that died after surviving 72 years in captivity, having been captured from the wild as a juvenile of undetermined age.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Several species of [[parrot]] have been reported to live for perhaps over 100 years, but these (at least in 1983) were not considered authenticated.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Another early captive-held specimen of condor reportedly lived for 71 years.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; However, these lifespans have been exceeded by a male, nicknamed "Thaao", that was kept [[Beardsley Zoo]] in [[Connecticut]]. Thaao was born in captivity in 1930 and died on January 26, 2010, making him 79 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beardsleyzoo.org/node/150 Zoo Family Mourns Death of Oldest Living Andean Condor in Captivity | Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520105325/http://www.beardsleyzoo.org/node/150 |date=2012-05-20 }}.

'''Andre Bernard Gurode''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|d}}; born March 6, 1978) is a former [[American football]] [[Center (American football)|center]] and [[Guard (American football)|guard]] who played 11 seasons in the NFL. He played [[college football]] for the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], earning consensus [[All-America]]n recognition. The [[Dallas Cowboys]] selected him in the second round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]]. He is a five-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection, and has also played for the [[Baltimore Ravens]], [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Oakland Raiders]].

==Early years==
Gurode was born in [[Houston, Texas]].&lt;ref name=ProFootballReference.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurode on Pro-Football-Reference |work=fbref.com |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GuroAn20.htm|accessdate=2007-12-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071229021430/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GuroAn20.htm| archivedate= 29 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He played [[high school football]] at [[North Shore Senior High School (Texas)|North Shore High School]] in Houston.  As a senior, ''[[USA Today]]'', [[PrepStar]] and SuperPrep selected him as an honorable mention high school [[All-America]]. He was also named to the '' [[Houston Chronicle]]'' Top 100 List and made the [[Austin American-Statesman]] "Fab 55" team.  He earned All-Area honors as a senior (second team honors as a junior), and was All-District and All-Greater Houston as a junior and senior (when he also was his team's most outstanding offensive lineman).

Gurode lettered three times in [[basketball]] and four times in [[Track and field athletics|track]] with personal bests of 186' 0" in the [[Discus throw|discus]] and 54' 1" in the [[shot put]].

==College career==
Gurode attended the [[University of Colorado]], where he played for the [[Colorado Buffaloes football]] team from 1998 to 2001.  He was a four-year starter for the Buffaloes, playing both [[center (American football)|center]] and [[guard (American football)|guard]] on the [[offensive line]].  He started his first two and a half seasons at center, before moving to guard in the middle of his junior year.  As a junior in 2000, he started the first six games of the year at center and the final five games at guard.  He received the John Mack Award, as selected by the coaches for being Colorado's most outstanding offensive player and was also selected honorable mention All-[[Big 12 Conference]] honors while helping the Buffaloes to a 7–5 record and a win over the [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College Eagles]] in the [[Insight.com Bowl]].  As a senior, he started every game at right guard.

Gurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team [[All-America]]n as a senior in 2001.&lt;ref name=ncaarecordsbook&gt;''2011 NCAA Football Records Book'', [http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2011/Awards.pdf  Award Winners], National Collegiate Athletic Association, Indianapolis, Indiana, p. 11 (2011).  Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.

He earned a degree in ethnic studies from the University of Colorado, where he was a member of the school's "Academic Starters" team.

==Professional career==

===2002 NFL Draft===
Gurode initially projected as a [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and was ranked the best available in the [[2002 NFL Draft]], along with [[Kendall Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/players.php?genpos=OG&amp;draftyear=2002&amp;sortorder=tsxpos&amp;order=ASC |title=2002 Draft OG Ranking |work=NFLDraftScout.com |accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as an early second round pick,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2002/draft/players/99600.html |title=Andre Gurode Draft Profile |work=Sports Illustrated |date=April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually selected 37th overall by the [[Dallas Cowboys]].

}}

===Dallas Cowboys (2002–2010)===
Gurode was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the second round of the [[2002 NFL Draft]] as a [[Center (American football)|center]]. He started fast by becoming the first rookie in club history to start at [[Center (American football)|center]] on opening day.

It is believed [[2002 NFL season|2002]] was the first time a [[NFL]] franchise had five African-American starters on their [[offensive line]], when the Cowboys lined up Gurode at [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]], [[Tackle (American and Canadian football)|tackle]]s [[Flozell Adams]] and [[Solomon Page]], [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guard]]s [[Larry Allen]] and [[Kelvin Garmon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://a.espncdn.com/nfl/columns/pasquarelli_len/1417470.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gurode also became part of history as the starting [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]] on the Cowboys [[offensive line]] that helped [[Emmitt Smith]] eclipse [[Walter Payton]] as the [[NFL]]'s all-time leading rusher, playing against the [[Seattle Seahawks]] on October 27. While he started the first six games of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]] at [[Center (American football)|center]], Gurode was moved to help compensate for the number of injuries along the [[offensive line]], compiling another eight starts at [[Guard (American football)|right guard]].

In [[2003 NFL season|2003]], [[Bill Parcells]] was hired as the Cowboys [[head coach]] and decided that Gurode's best position was at [[Guard (American football)|guard]], starting 15 games at that position in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and 13 games in [[2004 NFL season|2004]] with mixed results, before getting benched for the final two games.

At the start of the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], Parcells accepted he made a misjudgment by moving Gurode to [[Guard (American football)|guard]] and switched him back to [[Center (American football)|center]], with the Cowboys also signing [[Marco Rivera]] to take his place at [[Guard (American football)|guard]]. That season, he was a versatile backup, playing behind [[Al Johnson (guard)|Al Johnson]] at [[Center (American football)|center]] and Rivera at [[Guard (American football)|right guard]].

In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], he rededicated himself to football and won the starting center job again, over [[Al Johnson (guard)|Al Johnson]]. On October 1, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], in the third quarter of a game against the [[Tennessee Titans]], Titans [[defensive tackle]] [[Albert Haynesworth]] stomped on Gurode's head. Haynesworth's cleats caused a laceration requiring thirty stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsline.com/nfl/story/9700905 |title=Titans DT Haynesworth nailed with five-game suspension |publisher=Associated Press |work=Sportsline.com |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=2008-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628222456/http://sportsline.com/nfl/story/9700905 |archivedate=June 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth was ejected, and subsequently suspended by the NFL for five games without pay.

Following the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]], Gurode was named to his first [[2007 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] as an injury replacement. On February 20, [[2007 NFL season|2007]], the Cowboys re-signed Gurode to a six-year contract worth US$30 million including a $10 million signing bonus.

Gurode developed into one of the league's most respected [[Center (American football)|centers]] since returning to being a full-time starter in [[2006 NFL season|2006]], and has been selected to the [[All-Pro]] Team ([[2007 All-Pro Team|2007]], [[2009 All-Pro Team|2009]]), as well as to five straight [[Pro Bowl]]s ([[2006 Pro Bowl|2006]], [[2007 Pro Bowl|2007]], [[2008 Pro Bowl|2008]], [[2009 Pro Bowl|2009]], [[2010 Pro Bowl|2010]])

He had offseason left knee surgery and missed the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]] training camp and three out of four preseason games.  With the emergence of second-year player [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]], he was released after the preseason following failed negotiations regarding a restructured contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurode's departure shows Garrett means business |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2011/08/29/3321072/gurodes-departure-shows-garrett.html?storylink=digger-topic |author=Jaime Aron |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Ravens (2011)===
Gurode reportedly visited the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[New England Patriots]] [http://bleacherbumsports.net/2011/09/02/pats-to-work-out-gurode/] before signing a 1-year, $3 million contract with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on September 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravens sign Pro Bowl center Andre Gurode to one-year contract |url=http://news.bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view/20110905ravens_sign_pro_bowl_center_andre_gurode_to_one-year_contract/srvc=home&amp;position=recent |author=Jamison Hensley |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Bears (2012)===
On November 27, 2012, the [[Chicago Bears]] signed Gurode after losing guards [[Lance Louis]] and [[Chris Spencer (American football)|Chris Spencer]] to injuries sustained in a game against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on November 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bears add veteran lineman Gurode |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/chi-chicago-bears-sign-andre-gurode-20121127,0,2615470.story |author=Brad Biggs |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2012-11-27 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was waived by the Bears on December 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Gould-among-three-Bears-played-on-injured-reserve/12d03969-41b4-4d61-8eda-d89419979835|title=Gould among three Bears played on injured reserve|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2012-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oakland Raiders (2013)===
On July 26, 2013, Gurode signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jerry |last=McDonald |title=Oakland Raiders sign veteran lineman Andre Gurode |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/raiders/ci_23742202/oakland-raiders-sign-veteran-lineman-andre-gurode |work=San Jose Mercury News |date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of the 2013 NFL season Gurode became a free agent.

==Biography==
Arkady Ruderman was born in 1950 in [[Minsk]], capital of the [[Byelorussian SSR]].&lt;ref name=bfi1&gt;{{

Ruderman first gained fame in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1988 for his reporting on attempts by the [[Communist Party of Belorussia|communist authorities of BSSR]] to play down the [[centennial]] celebration of the [[Jew]]ish [[painting|painter]] [[Marc Chagall]]. Ruderman went on to direct several documentaries about the underside of the Soviet Union. His work won him accolades at the 1988 and 1989 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet film festivals]]. In November 1988 Ruderman was the first Russian TV journalist to interview [[Alexander Dubček]], the former leader of [[Czechoslovakia]] who was deposed by Soviet forces after the [[Prague Spring]] uprising of 1968.&lt;ref name=rfe&gt;{{

In September 1992 Ruderman traveled to [[Tajikistan]] to film a documentary for [[Channel One (Russia)|Ostankino]] about [[Davlat Khudonazarov]], a fellow filmmaker and opposition candidate in the [[Tajikistani presidential election, 1991|1991 Tajikistani presidential elections]]. At the time the [[Civil war in Tajikistan]] was raging and journalists had become the target of murder. On 22 September 1992 Ruderman was killed while traveling by car along the road from [[Nurek Dam]] to the capital [[Dushanbe]], an area that at the time was experiencing heavy fighting between government and opposition forces. The government ruled Ruderman's death a vehicular accident, but the circumstances surrounding his death remain a mystery and his name is listed by the [[Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations]] as one of the journalists murdered in Tajikistan.&lt;ref name=cjes2&gt;{{

'''Blacksmith''' is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] and a [[Enemies of the Flash|rogue]] to [[Flash (comics)|the Flash III]] ([[Wally West]]). She first appeared in ''Flash: [[Iron Heights]]'' (2001).

==Fictional character biography==
For 15 years, '''Amunet Black''' has been running and operating the '''[[List of criminal organizations in DC Comics#Network II|Network]]''' an underground black market in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central]] and [[Keystone City]], the twin cities, for supervillains to buy, sell, or move contraband.  During that time, she had a brief marriage to [[Goldface]].  When they divorced, she stole the elixir that gave him his powers and changed it to gain the ability to merge metal with flesh and shape it to her will.  She was able to keep the Network hidden from the authorities and if any villain reformed or quit crime, she made sure the memories of the Network were erased from their minds.  When her ex-husband and criminal profiler Hunter Zolomon (the future [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]) were about to find out about the Network, she sent [[Trickster (comics)|the Trickster II]] to stop them.  Soon, with a vision of power, Blacksmith planned out her takeover of the twin cities, with her as the leader.

First, she organized a new group of rogues, which consisted of the [[Weather Wizard]], [[Mirror Master]] II, [[Magenta (comics)|Magenta]], [[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]], [[Girder (comics)|Girder]], [[Plunder (comics)|Plunder]], and Trickster II.  She made sure that her rogues were strong and had better control of their powers.  She had Magenta use her powers to keep Girder from rusting and taught the Weather Wizard better control with his wand.

Second, she and her rogues had Flash's allies removed or incapacitated. Mirror Master framed [[Pied Piper (comics)|Piper]] for the murder of his parents.  Plunder took out [[Chunk (comics)|Chunk]], shot his mirror image, Detective Jared Morillo, and assumed his identity.  Then, Mirror Master kidnapped [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and police officer Fred Chyre, trapping them in a mirror universe along with all the other cops of Keystone City.  The Rogues then removed the speedsters by giving [[Jesse Quick]]'s company financial trouble and then sent [[Jay Garrick]] to a hospital in [[Denver]] when his wife got sick.

Finally, Murmur and Mirror Master attacked radio stations and reprogrammed their antennas to broadcast a mirror shield around the twin cities to prevent anyone from coming in or getting out.

After everything had been put into place, Blacksmith and her rogues launched their takeover and began by attacking the Flash.  They attacked hard and fast, which left Flash tired and badly injured, but just as they were about to finish him off, they were stopped by [[Thinker (DC Comics)|the Thinker]], who wanted to use the Flash's brain to upload information.  After the Thinker was defeated, Blacksmith and the rogues resumed their plan and attacked Flash and Goldface.  They successfully trounced Flash while Goldface escaped. During the fight, Blacksmith used her power to transform her body into ebony metal, while villains in the Network began to loot and pillage the two cities.  Luckily, Goldface lead the people of the twin cities against the Network and Flash managed to defeat the Weather Wizard, Mirror Master, and Trickster II, before they escaped when [[Captain Cold]] froze the ground and Mirror Master used it to retreat.  With her rogues defeated, she tried a desperate attack by collapsing the bridge that connects Keystone City and Central City.  The Flash quickly managed to rebuild the bridge and finally defeat Blacksmith by stranding her on a barge in the middle of the river (she could not enter the water for fear of rusting her metal skin).  With her Network discontinued, she was sent to Iron Heights, where she was severely wounded by the escaping [[Gorilla Grodd]].  Although she survived her injuries, Blacksmith has not been seen since that incident, although she did show up for [[Captain Boomerang|"Digger" Harkness]]' funeral.

==Powers and abilities==

Blacksmith's body has been mutated to be the perfect fusion between organic and inorganic. This has given her the ability to fuse organic and inorganic matter. Blacksmith has used the ability to fuse an inorganic object into an opponent causing serious damage. Blacksmith has also used the ability to cause serious damage to inorganic structures.

==In other media==
[[Katee Sackhoff]] portrays Amunet Black aka Blacksmith in season four of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.

Accessed online 08 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Bobbi Trout was born on January 7, 1906 to Lola Trout and George Trout in [[Greenup, Illinois]]. One afternoon in 1918, Trout heard an [[aeroplane]] fly overhead. This incident started her interest in the field of aviation. Trout moved from [[Illinois]] to [[California]] with her family in 1920, when they purchased a service station. One day while tending the family business, Trout told her dreams to one of their patrons, W.E. Thomas, who coincidentally owned a [[Curtiss JN-4]]. Thomas asked Trout if she wanted a ride on the aircraft, which she did on December 27, 1922, taking off from [[Will Rogers#California memorials|Rogers Airport]] located in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|west Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=Deem /&gt;&lt;ref name=Di /&gt; Trout saved approximately $2,500 which she used to enter Burdett Fuller’s flying school (the Burdett Airlines, Inc., School of Aviation) on January 1, 1928. In one of her flight lessons, she was instructed by a young pilot to three-quarter turn at a low elevation, which resulted in the biplane spinning out of control.  The resulting crash wrecked the plane completely. This accident did not deter Trout from flying, and she completed her first solo flight on April 30, 1928 and received her solo certificate.&lt;ref name=Deem /&gt;

==Aviation career==
After getting her license, Trout flew a Golden Eagle at the [[Van Nuys Airport|Metropolitan Airport]] in Los Angeles as an official dedication on December 14, 1928. Trout followed this up on January 2, 1929, flying from the same airport for 12 hours and 11 minutes, shattering the previous record, held by [[Viola Gentry]], by more than 4 hours. This record was short lived, as aviator [[Elinor Smith]] broke the record once again on January 30, 1929.&lt;ref name=Moses&gt;Phyllis R. Moses, [http://womanpilot.com/?p=49 The Amazing Aviatrix Elinor Smith], ''Woman Pilot'', March 30, 2008. Accessed online 15 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith flew 13 and a half hours straight from [[Mitchel Air Force Base|Mitchel Field]] using an open cockpit, Bruner Winkle [[biplane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1981|pp=80–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determined to take back the record, Trout flew from [[Los Angeles International Airport|Mines Field]] on February 10, 1929, returning this time after more than 17 hours. This flight also broke the record for the first all-night flight by a woman as well as the new women's solo endurance record.&lt;ref name=Di&gt;Di Freeze {{cite web |url=http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0303005 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707102130/http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0303005 |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}, ''Remembering Bobbi Evelyn Trout'',March 2003. Accessed online 08 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joe /&gt; In the same year on June 16, Trout flew a 90 horse power Golden Eagle Chief to an altitude of 15,200 feet breaking the light class aircraft altitude record.&lt;ref name=Deem /&gt;&lt;ref name=Di /&gt;&lt;ref name=Joe /&gt; Modifying the same aircraft to use a 100 horse power engine, Trout flew from [[Clover Field]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] to the [[Women's Air Derby|first Women's Transcontinental Air Derby]] together with other women aviators including [[Amelia Earhart]].&lt;ref name=Di /&gt; During the 8 day course, they experienced difficulties navigating through the road maps, Trout, Earhart, Gentry and the other ladies managed to communicate under such circumstances this led to the development of the [[Ninety-Nines|Ninety-Nines: International Organization of Women Pilots]].&lt;ref name=Deem /&gt;&lt;ref name=Di /&gt;&lt;ref name=Joe /&gt;

In order to get more sponsorship, Trout asked starlet [[Edna Mae Cooper]] if she wanted to go with her to attempt another endurance run. They first attempted the flight on January 1, 1931 but due to technical problems they had to abort the flight. At their next attempt, they were successful in flying straight for 122 hours and 50 minutes, only to end the run on January 9, 1931 due to the spitting off fuel. This was another record broken by Trout, and was later recognized by [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] of [[Romania]], who representative gave her the Royal Decree and the aviation cross for pilots who made record flights, a distinction only given to two other pilots - [[Amelia Earhart]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]].&lt;ref name=Deem /&gt;

==Later life==
Trout celebrated her 80th birthday while being interviewed inside a helicopter over the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco, California]] on January 7, 1986. On May of that same year she was honored during the [[Gathering of Eagles Program]] at [[Maxwell Air Force Base]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]]. In 1999, she was also recognized as the only living participant from the first Women's Air Derby of 1929. Trout retired to [[San Diego, California]] and suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] on January 24, 2003. She never married and is survived by her sister-in-law Hazel Trout and her nephew Brook Trout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Celebrity Death Date by First Name | url=http://www.absolutenow.com/features/deathdate49.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728074807/http://www.absolutenow.com/features/deathdate49.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2011-07-28 | work=UGO Film &amp; Television | accessdate=2010-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bobbi met her Pilot face to face - January 24, 2003  | url=http://www.bobbitrout.com/noframes.asp?t=content&amp;f=223program.html | work=Bobbi Trout/Aviatrix Enterprises | accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarence Oscar "C. O." Erickson''' (December 17, 1923 &amp;ndash; June 28, 2017) was an American film producer and production manager who had nearly 60 years of experience working in [[Hollywood]].

Born in [[Kankakee, Illinois]] on December 17, 1923,&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2017/06/doc-erickson-dead-hitchcock-huston-blade-runner-groundhog-day-chinatown-1202122763/ C.O. “Doc” Erickson Dies: Hitchcock &amp; Huston Veteran Who Later Worked On ‘Chinatown’ &amp; ‘Groundhog Day’ Was 93]&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson began his career at [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1944, ultimately working his way up to production manager. Among the productions he managed during his time at Paramount were all five of the films that director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] made for the studio in the 1950s: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955), ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956) and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).&lt;ref name="thr"&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/co-doc-erickson-dead-dies-alfred-hitchcock-1202484167/ C.O. ‘Doc’ Erickson, Alfred Hitchcock Associate, Dies at 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erickson left Paramount to work with screenwriter and director [[John Huston]] as production manager on ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961) and ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]'' (1962). He later reteamed with Huston as associate producer of ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (film)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'' (1967). He was also associate producer of [[Richard C. Sarafian]]'s ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971) and [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), both of which featured Huston in supporting acting roles.

Erickson later served as both executive producer and production manager on several popular films of the 1980s and 1990s, including ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' (1980), ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' (1982) and ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993). He was also the executive producer of [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980) and executive in charge of production of [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). His later film credits included ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997), ''[[Return to Me]]'' (2000) and ''[[Windtalkers]]'' (2002).

Erickson died in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on June 28, 2017, due to [[heart]] complications. He was 93.&lt;ref name="thr"/&gt;

'''Christiane Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg-Kulmbach''' (15 October 1733 in [[Neustadt an der Aisch]] &amp;ndash; 8 October 1757 in [[Jagdschloss]] Seidingstadt in [[Straufhain]]) was a member of the Kulmbach-Bayreuth branch of the Franconian line of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] and was, by marriage, Duchess of [[Saxe-Hildburghausen]].

== Life ==
Christiane Sophie Charlotte was the only surviving child of Margrave [[Frederick Christian, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth|Frederick Christian of Brandenburg-Bayreuth]] from his marriage to [[Victoria Charlotte of Anhalt-Zeitz-Hoym|Victoria Charlotte]], the daughter of Prince [[Victor I, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym|Victor Amadeus Adolf I of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym]].

Christiane Sophie Charlotte was raised in Copenhagen, at the court of her aunt, Queen of Denmark [[Sophia Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Sophia Magdalene]] of Denmark, together with her cousin [[Princess Louise of Denmark (1726–1756)|Louise]].  After mediation by her aunt, Christiane married on 20 January 1757 at [[Christiansborg Palace]] to the Queen's former son-in-law Duke [[Ernest Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen|Ernest Frederick III]] of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

Christiane was describe as very pious; however, and unlike her predecessor (who had insisted on rigid court etiquette), she had a lavish lifestyle, with elaborate parties and had a special fondness for hunting. At the entrance of the former [[Jagdschloss]] Seidinstadt, two antlers are on display, from two deer she shot while hunting in 1757. She died in childbirth, four days after giving birth to Princess Marie Sophie Friederike Caroline, who died nine days later.

'''Connectionist temporal classification''' ('''CTC''') is a type of neural network output and associated scoring function, for training [[recurrent neural network]]s (RNNs) such as [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] networks to tackle sequence problems where the timing is variable. It can be used for tasks like on-line handwriting recognition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liwicki|first=Marcus|last2=Graves|first2=Alex|last3=Bunke|first3=Horst|last4=Schmidhuber|first4=Jürgen|date=2007|title=A novel approach to on-line handwriting recognition based on bidirectional long short-term memory networks|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.139.5852|journal=In Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or recognizing phonemes in speech audio. CTC refers to the outputs and scoring, and is independent of the underlying neural network structure. It was introduced in 2006.&lt;ref name="graves2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Graves |first=Alex |last2=Fernández |first2=Santiago |last3=Gomez |first3=Faustino |date=2006 |title=Connectionist temporal classification: Labelling unsegmented sequence data with recurrent neural networks |citeseerx=10.1.1.75.6306 |journal=In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2006 |pages=369–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The input is a sequence of observations, and the outputs are a sequence of labels, which can include blank outputs. The difficulty of training comes from there being many more observations than there are labels. For example in speech audio there can be multiple time slices which correspond to a single phoneme. Since we don't know the alignment of the observed sequence with the target labels we predict a probability distribution at each time step&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannun|first=Awni|date=2017-11-27|title=Sequence Modeling with CTC|url=https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/|journal=Distill|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.23915/distill.00008|issn=2476-0757}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A CTC network has a continuous output (e.g. softmax), which is fitted through training to model the probability of a label. CTC does not attempt to learn boundaries and timings: Label sequences are considered equivalent if they differ only in alignment, ignoring blanks. Equivalent label sequences can occur in many ways – which makes scoring a non-trivial task, but there is an efficient [[forward–backward algorithm]] for that.

CTC scores can then be used with the back-propagation algorithm to update the neural network weights.

Alternative approaches to a CTC-fitted neural network include a [[hidden Markov model]] (HMM).

In [[operations research]], '''cuckoo search''' is an [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]] developed by [[Xin-she Yang]] and Suash Deb

Some host birds can engage direct conflict with the intruding cuckoos. For example, if a host bird discovers the eggs are not their own, it will either throw these alien eggs away or simply abandon its nest and build a new nest elsewhere. Some cuckoo species such as the [[New World]] brood-parasitic [[Tapera]] have evolved in such a way that female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry in colors and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species &lt;ref&gt;R. B. Payne, M. D. Sorenson, and K. Klitz, The Cuckoos, Oxford University Press, (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Cuckoo search idealized such breeding behavior, and thus can be applied for various optimization problems.

== Metaphor ==
Cuckoo search (CS) uses the following representations:

Each egg in a nest represents a solution, and a cuckoo egg represents a new solution. The aim is to use the new and potentially better solutions (cuckoos) to replace a not-so-good solution in the nests. In the simplest form, each nest has one egg. The algorithm can be extended to more complicated cases in which each nest has multiple eggs representing a set of solutions.

CS is based on three idealized rules: 
# Each cuckoo lays one egg at a time, and dumps its egg in a randomly chosen nest;
# The best nests with high quality of eggs will carry over to the next generation;
# The number of available hosts nests is fixed, and the egg laid by a cuckoo is discovered by the host bird with a probability &lt;math&gt;p_a \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Discovering operate on some set of worst nests, and discovered solutions dumped from farther calculations.
In addition, Yang and Deb discovered that the random-walk style search is better performed by [[Lévy flight]]s rather than simple [[random walk]].

== Algorithm ==
The [[pseudo-code]] can be summarized as:

 Objective function: &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x}), \quad \mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_d); \, &lt;/math&gt;
 Generate an initial population of &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; host nests; 
 While (t&lt;MaxGeneration) or (stop criterion)
    Get a cuckoo randomly (say, i) and replace a solution by its solution by performing Lévy flights;
    Evaluate its quality/fitness &lt;math&gt;F_i &lt;/math&gt;
          [For maximization, &lt;math&gt;F_i \propto f(\mathbf{x}_i)&lt;/math&gt; ];
    Choose a nest among n (say, j) randomly;
    if (&lt;math&gt;F_i&gt;F_j &lt;/math&gt;),
           Replace j by the new solution;
    end if
    A fraction (&lt;math&gt;p_a&lt;/math&gt;) of the worse nests are abandoned and new ones are built;
    Keep the best solutions/nests;
    Rank the solutions/nests and find the current best;
    Pass the current best solutions to the next generation;
 end while

An important advantage of this algorithm is its simplicity. In fact, comparing with other population- or agent-based [[metaheuristic]] algorithms such as [[particle swarm optimization]] and [[harmony search]], there is essentially only a single parameter &lt;math&gt;p_a&lt;/math&gt; in CS (apart from the population size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). Therefore, it is very easy to implement.

==Random walks and the step size ==

An important issue is the applications of Lévy flights and random walks in the generic equation for generating new solutions

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_{t+1}=\mathbf{x}_t + s E_t, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; E_t &lt;/math&gt; is drawn from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unity standard deviation for random walks, or drawn from Lévy distribution for Lévy flights. Obviously, the random walks can also be linked with the similarity between a cuckoo's egg and the host's egg which can be tricky in implementation. Here the step size &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; determines how far a random walker can go for a fixed number of iterations. The generation of Lévy step size is often tricky, and a comparison of three algorithms (including Mantegna's&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Mantegna, Fast, accurate algorithm for numerical simulation of Lévy stable stochastic processes, Physical Review E, Vol.49, 4677-4683 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;) was performed by Leccardi&lt;ref&gt;M. Leccardi, Comparison of three algorithms for Levy noise generation, Proceedings of fifth EUROMECH nonlinear dynamics conference (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; who found an implementation of Chambers et al.'s approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chambers | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Mallows | first2 = C. L. | last3 = Stuck | first3 = B. W. | year = 1976 | title = A method for simulating stable random variables | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 340–344 | doi=10.1080/01621459.1976.10480344}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be the most computationally efficient due to the low number of random numbers required.

If s is too large, then the new solution generated will be too far away from the old solution (or even jump outside of the bounds). Then, such a move is unlikely to be accepted. If s is too small, the change is too small to be significant, and consequently such search is not efficient. So a proper step size is important to maintain the search as efficient as possible.

As an example, for simple isotropic random walks, we know that the average distance &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; traveled in the d-dimension space is
: &lt;math&gt; r^2=2 d D t, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;D=s^2/2\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the effective diffusion coefficient. Here &lt;math&gt; s&lt;/math&gt; is the step size or distance traveled at each jump, and &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is the time taken for each jump. The above equation implies that&lt;ref&gt;X.-S. Yang, Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Algorithms, 2nd Edition, Luniver Press, (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; s^2=\frac{\tau \; r^2}{t \; d}. &lt;/math&gt;
For a typical length scale L of a dimension of interest,  the local search is typically limited in a region of &lt;math&gt;r=L/10 &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\tau=1 &lt;/math&gt; and t=100 to 1000, we have &lt;math&gt;s\approx 0.01L &lt;/math&gt; for d=1, and &lt;math&gt;s \approx 0.001L &lt;/math&gt; for d=10.  Therefore, we can use s/L=0.001 to 0.01 for most problems. Though the exact derivation may require detailed analysis of the behaviour of Lévy flights.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gutowski,  Lévy flights as an underlying mechanism for global optimization algorithms,  ArXiv Mathematical Physics e-Prints, June, (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithm and convergence analysis will be fruitful, because there are many open problems related to metaheuristics&lt;ref&gt;X. S. Yang, Metaheuristic optimization: algorithm analysis and open problems, in: Experimental Algorithms (SEA2011), Eds (P. M. Pardalos and S. Rebennack), LNCS 6630, pp.21-32 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improved Cuckoo Search Algorithms ==

Convergence of Cuckoo Search algorithm can be substantially improved by generically replacing abandoned nests (instead of using the random replacements from the original method)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=Victoria Y.M.|last2=de Oliveira|first2=Rodrigo M.S.|last3=Affonso|first3=Carolina M.|date=2018-07-31|title=Cuckoo Search approach enhanced with genetic replacement of abandoned nests applied to optimal allocation of distributed generation units|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1049%2Fiet-gtd.2017.1992|journal=IET Generation, Transmission &amp; Distribution|volume=12|issue=13|pages=3353–3362|doi=10.1049/iet-gtd.2017.1992|issn=1751-8687}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Metabolism of phenolics ===
''Cunninghamella elegans'' can be used to study the metabolism of phenols. This type of molecules already have reactive and polar groups comprised within their structure therefore phases I enzymes are less active than phase II (conjugation) enzymes.

==== Metabolism of flavonoids ====
; Flavonols
In flavonols, an hydroxyl group is available in the 3- position allowing the [[glycosylation]] at that position. The biotransformation of [[quercetin]] yields three metabolites, including [[quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside]], [[kaempferol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside]] and [[isorhamnetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside]]. Glucosylation and O-methylation are involved in the process.&lt;ref name=Zi/&gt; 
; Flavones
In flavones, there is no hydroxyl group available at the 3- position. Conjugation, in the form of [[sulfation]] occurs at the 7- or 4'- positions. [[Apigenin]] and [[chrysin]] are also transformed by ''C. elegans'' and produce [[apigenin 7-sulfate]], [[apigenin 7,4′-disulfate]], [[chrysin 7-sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ibrahim | first1 = A. R. S. | title = Biotransformation of Chrysin and Apigenin by Cunninghamella elegans | doi = 10.1248/cpb.53.671 | journal = Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 53 | issue = 6 | pages = 671–672 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15930780| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glucosylation may nevertheless occur but in 3'- position, as happens during the microbial transformation of [[psiadiarabin]] and its 6-desmethoxy analogue, [[5,3′ dihydroxy-7,2′,4′,5′-tetramethoxyflavone]], by ''Cunninghamella elegans'' NRRL 1392 that gives the 3′-glucoside conjugates of the two flavones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; flavanones
As in flavones, there is no hydroxyl groups available at the 3- position for glycosylation in flavanones. Therefore, sulfation occurs at the 7- position. In compounds like 7-methoxylated flavanones like 7-O-methylnaringenin ([[sakuranetin]]), [[demethylation]] followed by [[sulfation]] occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

DEPT strategies are an experimental method of reducing the systemic toxicity of a drug, by achieving high levels of the active drug only at the desired site. This article describes the variations of DEPT technology.

==Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT)==
'''ADEPT'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bagshawe KD |title=Antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) for cancer |journal=Expert Rev Anticancer Ther |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=1421–31 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17069527 |doi=10.1586/14737140.6.10.1421 |url=http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737140.6.10.1421?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a strategy to overcome the problems of lack of [[tumor]] selectivity. An antibody designed/developed against a tumor [[antigen]] is linked to an [[enzyme]] and injected to the blood, resulting in selective binding of the enzyme in the tumor. When the discrimination between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels is sufficient, a [[prodrug]] is administrated into the blood circulation, which is converted to an active cytotoxic drug by the enzyme, only within the tumor. Selectivity is achieved by the tumor specificity of the antibody and by delaying prodrug administration until there is a large differential between tumor and normal tissue enzyme levels.

ADEPT has shown antitumor activity in animal tumor models of human [[choriocarcinoma]] and colonic and [[breast carcinoma]].

===ADEPT history===

The first pilot-scale clinical trial of ADEPT was carried out at [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[London]], using an anti-CEA F(ab′)2 antibody conjugated to the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagshawe KD, Sharma SK, Springer CJ, Antoniw P |title=Antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT): a pilot scale clinical trial |journal=Tumor Targeting  |volume=1 |pages=17–29 |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antibody used in the first ADEPT clinical trial was of murine origin and the enzyme was bacterial. Host antibodies to both components of the AEC were present in the blood of all non-immunosuppressed patients by day 10 after AEC infusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bagshawe KD, Sharma SK |title=Cyclosporine delays host immune response to antibody enzyme conjugate in ADEPT |journal=Transplant. Proc. |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=3156–8 |date=December 1996 |pmid=8962223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several patients received [[ciclosporin]] since it had been shown in rabbits that this could delay the appearance of host antibodies to soluble proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/bjc.1988.259 |vauthors=Ledermann JA, Begent RH, Bagshawe KD |title=Cyclosporin A prevents the anti-murine antibody response to a monoclonal anti-tumour antibody in rabbits |journal=Br. J. Cancer |volume=58 |issue=5 |pages=562–6 |date=November 1988 |pmid=3265331 |pmc=2246811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent, small-scale trial at the [[Royal Free Hospital]], London, used the same agents as in the Charing Cross Hospital trial but the protocol was modified to provide additional pharmacokinetic data and most patients received only a single course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;KD Bagshawe and M Napier, Early clinical studies with ADEPT. In: RG Melton and RJ Knox Editors, Enzyme-Prodrug Strategies for Cancer Therapy Kluwer Academic, London (1999), 199–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT)==
 {{Expand section|date=May 2013}}
GDEPT is a [[suicide gene]] therapy in which the enzyme required for prodrug conversion is produced within the target cell, using a gene delivered to it by gene therapy. When an [[adequate]] differential exists between the targeted cell and endogenous tissue, non-toxic prodrug is administered and is subsequently converted into its toxic form within the target cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Karjoo|first = Zahra|last2 = Chen|first2 = Xuguang|last3 = Hatefi|first3 = Arash|date = 2015-05-22|title = Progress and problems with the use of suicide genes for targeted cancer therapy|journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2015.05.009|issn = 1872-8294|pmc = 4758904|pmid = 26004498|volume=99|issue = Pt A|pages=113–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems that use viral vectors to deliver the gene are known as [[VDEPT]].

==Virus-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (VDEPT)==
 {{Expand section|date=May 2013}}
VDEPT is the term given to the use of a virus to deliver the gene for GDEPT. VDEPT can potentially be used to enhance the therapeutic potential of [[oncolytic viruses]].

== Lectin-directed Enzyme-Activated Prodrug Therapy (LEAPT) ==
LEAPT is a variant of DEPT in which the manipulation of carbohydrates on the surface of the enzyme is used to target the enzyme activity to the cell in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Mark A.|last2=Charlton|first2=Stuart T.|last3=Garnier|first3=Philippe|last4=Wang|first4=Xiang-tao|last5=Davis|first5=Stanley S.|last6=Perkins|first6=Alan C.|last7=Frier|first7=Malcolm|last8=Duncan|first8=Ruth|last9=Savage|first9=Tony J.|date=2004-10-05|title=LEAPT: Lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/101/40/14527|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|language=en|volume=101|issue=40|pages=14527–14532|doi=10.1073/pnas.0303574101|issn=0027-8424|pmc=521935|pmid=15448212|bibcode=2004PNAS..10114527R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows exploitation of the sometimes highly specific [[sugar]]-[[lectin]] interactions found in organisms, including humans. Proof-of-principle examples have shown delivery to target organs of enzymes that specifically release cytotoxics to treat tumours.

==Polymer-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (PDEPT)==
 {{Expand section|date=May 2013}}
PDEPT uses [[polymer-drug conjugates]], drugs contained within a polymer 'shell' such as [[pHPMA]] and designed to be released only by a specific enzyme.

==Clostridia-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (CDEPT)==
'''CDEPT''' is the use of [[Clostridia]] to convert [[prodrug]]s into active drug agents. CDEPT exploits the [[Tumor hypoxia|hypoxic]] environment of solid tumors to target drugs to tumors using [[anaerobic bacteria]] resident in the tumour to convert the pro-drug to the active form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahn|first=GO|author2=Brown, M|title=Targeting tumors with hypoxia-activated cytotoxins|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=May 1, 2007|volume=12|issue=8–12|pages=3483–501|pmid=17485316|doi=10.2741/2329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schellmann|first=N|author2=Deckert, PM |author3=Bachran, D |author4=Fuchs, H |author5= Bachran, C |title=Targeted enzyme prodrug therapies.|journal=Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry|date=September 2010|volume=10|issue=10|pages=887–904|pmid=20560876|doi=10.2174/138955710792007196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intravenously injected clostridial spores exhibit a specificity for tumours, colonising the hypoxic areas of the tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minton|first=NP|author2=Mauchline, ML |author3=Lemmon, MJ |author4=Brehm, JK |author5=Fox, M |author6=Michael, NP |author7=Giaccia, A |author8= Brown, JM |title=Chemotherapeutic tumour targeting using clostridial spores.|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date=October 1995|volume=17|issue=3|pages=357–64|pmid=7576773|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1995.tb00219.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The CDEPT strategy ===

Perhaps the most challenging issue in [[cancer treatment]] is how to reduce the side effects of the injected anti-cancer agents, which are of a high [[cytotoxicity]] potential. A widely used solution is to use [[enzyme]]s which are able to convert a relatively non-toxic prodrug precursor into the active drug form(s). Clostridial-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (CDEPT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.1995.tb00219.x  |vauthors=Minton NP, Mauchline ML, Lemmon MJ, etal |title=Chemotherapeutic tumour targeting using clostridial spores |journal=FEMS Microbiol. Rev. |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=357–64 |date=October 1995 |pmid=7576773 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the possible approaches.

Solid [[tumor]]s, in contrast to normal tissues, grow rapidly. As a result, the cancerous tissues may suffer from inadequate [[blood]] and [[oxygen]] supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001813-200202000-00002 |vauthors=Nuyts S, Van Mellaert L, Theys J, Landuyt W, Lambin P, Anné J |title=Clostridium spores for tumor-specific drug delivery |journal=Anticancer Drugs |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=115–25 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11901303 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0959-4973&amp;volume=13&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, clostridia can grow in tumor and destroy it specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown JM, Wilson WR |title=Exploiting tumour hypoxia in cancer treatment |journal=Nat. Rev. Cancer |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=437–47 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15170446 |doi=10.1038/nrc1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Originally, Parker and co-workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parker RC, Plumber HC, Siebenmann CO, Chapman MG |title=Effect of histolyticus infection and toxin on transplantable mouse tumours |journal=Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. |volume=66 |pages=461–5 |year=1947 |doi=10.3181/00379727-66-16124}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the injection of ''Clostridium histolyticum'' spores to the transplanted sarcomas of mice results in significant tumour lysis. Soon after, it was shown that a direct injection is not necessary, and that tumour colonization was readily obtained after intravenous administration of spores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malmgren RA, Flanigan CC |title=Localization of the vegetative form of ''Clostridium tetani'' in mouse tumors following intravenous spore administration |journal=Cancer Res. |volume=15 |issue=7 |pages=473–8 |date=August 1955 |pmid=13240693 |url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=13240693}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In CDEPT, a prodrug-converting enzyme expressed by a clostridial expression plasmid converts a prodrug into an active drug form within the tumor. While the prodrug is the inactive form and can be administrated to the blood, the  products of the prodrug cleavage are highly cytotoxic and show their effect only in the vicinity of tumor cells.

Difficulties in the engineering of clostridial strains have restricted the application of other enzyme prodrug systems. So far, two enzymes have been applied in CDEPT: [[cytosine deaminase]] and [[nitroreductase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minton NP |title=Clostridia in cancer therapy |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=237–42 |date=December 2003 |pmid=15035028 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro777}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been recently suggested that [[β-lactamase]]s, which are naturally found in Clostridia, can facilitate the application of the method significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tirandaz H, Hamedi J, Marashi SA |title=Application of beta-lactamase-dependent prodrugs in clostridial-directed enzyme therapy (CDEPT): a proposal |journal=Med. Hypotheses |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=998–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16797858 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.008 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-9877(06)00340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

'''''Final Destination 5''''' is a 2011 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Steven Quale]] and is the fifth installment of the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. It was written by [[Eric Heisserer]] and stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]] and [[Tony Todd]].

Despite [[The Final Destination|the previous film]] being originally announced as the final of the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011, which includes deleted scenes, documentaries and a parody music video by the cast.

The film received mostly positive reviews; the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise.

==Plot==

In April 2000, Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that "Death doesn't like to be cheated" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.

Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Meanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him, and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.

That evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe he has claimed Block's life.

Two weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, a fight breaks out between two passengers, Alex Browning and Carter Horton, revealing the plane he and Molly are on is Flight 180. Upon take-off, Sam overhears that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction, but it's too late, and both he and Molly are killed when the plane explodes. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a brain aneurysm that would have burst "any day now". As Nathan realizes he may still be in danger, the landing gear from Flight 180 breaks through the roof and crushes him.

===Writing===
According to Heisserer, ''Final Destination 5'' was always meant to be a [[prequel]], set before the first film; the idea having come from franchise producer Craig Perry. Heisserer said that one major problem he encountered while writing the film was coming up with good death sequences, believing that managing to do so in the world of ''Final Destination'' is "ridiculously hard". The inspiration for Olivia's death sequence involving [[LASIK]] [[eye surgery]] after his wife underwent the same type of surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thurman|first1=Trace|title=Taking the Blame: An Interview With Screenwriter Eric Heisserer!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3397692/eric-heisserer-interview/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) in the UK ruled that the original theatrical poster, which had been used on buses and trains during the summer, "was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children". It ruled that the advert must not appear in the original form again.

Warner Bros. countered by stating that the poster "accurately reflected the content of the film in an appropriate manner without causing excessive fear or distress". They also added that the poster's dark grey and black colors were "unlikely to engage the attention of young children", and that the "surreal" image did not feature people, blood or display any real-life violence.

The ASA, which had received 13 complaints, with three stating that their children (aged between 1 and 3) had been upset, ruled "We considered the image was likely to catch the attention of children, especially because it was shown on a poster on the Underground, where it was an untargeted medium. Because very young children might view this ad depicting violence, it was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16065584 | work=BBC News | title=Final Destination 5 poster banned by ASA | date=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''Final Destination 5'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] Disc on December 27, 2011. The Blu-ray Disc comes in two forms: the movie-only edition and the Blu-ray Disc/DVD/[[UltraViolet (system)|UltraViolet]] edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Destination 5 DVD, Blu-ray Details|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=21417}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Blu-ray#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]] edition was released exclusively through [[Best Buy]].

Before the film appeared in theaters, Fisher released a music video. Starring the main cast of ''Final Destination 5'' and featuring Fisher's original song "New Romance", the video parodied the 1990s sitcom ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' and included a clue to the plot of the film. Fisher, a fan of the show, and video director Dave Green watched every episode, and contemporary shows like ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]''. "We thought, 'Gosh wouldn't it be fun and subversive to have Final Destination-type deaths in this safe, [sitcom] world?'" Fisher, who plays a [[Zack Morris]]-like character, said. He joked, "I basically have always been looking for a way to dance with [[List of Saved by the Bell characters#Kelly Kapowski|Kelly Kapowski]] my whole life".&lt;ref name="semigran20110810"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/08/10/final-destination-5-star-miles-fisher/ | title='Final Destination 5' star Miles Fisher talks viral 'Saved by the Bell' spoof | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=2011-08-10 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Semigran, Aly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also stated "Calling anything the 'best 3D horror film' has the ring of crowning the world's tallest midget, but Quale uses 3D almost shockingly well."&lt;ref name="boxofficemagazine1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sparktech Software LLC |url=http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/reviews/2011-08-final-destination-5 |title=Final Destination 5 – Inside Movies Since 1920 |publisher=Boxofficemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for Toronto.com, Linda Barnard has stated "this could be a case where the 3-D-shot movie is worth the extra few bucks to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.com/article/695076--final-destination-5-die-already |title=Final Destination 5: Die, already – Movies, Review |publisher=Toronto.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual effects were praised for improving on the weak [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] from the previous installment. Betty Jo Tucker of ReelTalk Movie Reviews said in her review "The film boasts some of the best visual effects ever, especially the bridge-crumbling sequence at the beginning of the film."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22225">'''Futures techniques''' used in the multi-disciplinary field of [[futures studies]] by [[futurist]]s in Americas and Australasia, and [[futurology]] by [[futurologist]]s in EU, include a diverse range of forecasting methods, including anticipatory thinking, backcasting, simulation, and visioning&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the anticipatory methods include, the delphi method, causal layered analysis, environmental scanning, morphological analysis, and scenario planning.

== Anticipatory thinking protocols ==

=== Delphi method ===
{{main article|Delphi method}}

The Delphi method is a very popular technique used in Futures Studies.  It was developed by Gordon and [[Olaf Helmer|Helmer]] in 1953 at [[RAND]]. It can be defined as a method for structuring a group communication process, so that the process is effective in allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem&lt;ref&gt;von der Gracht, H.A., 2012. Consensus measurement in Delphi studies. Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79(8), pp.1525-1536.&lt;/ref&gt;.

It uses the iterative, independent questioning of a panel of experts to assess the timing, probability, significance and implications of factors, trends and events in the relation to the problem being considered. Panelists are not brought together but individually questioned in rounds. After the initial round, the panelists are given lists of anonymous answers from other panelists which they can use to refine their own views&lt;ref&gt;von der Gracht, H.A., 2008. The Delphi technique for futures research. The Future of Logistics: Scenarios for 2025, pp.21-68.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Studies employing Delphi method tend to be difficult to perform. The application of the Delphi method requires a great deal of attention to the selection of participating experts and the questionnaires have to be scrupulously prepared and tested in advance.  The initial preparation and follow-up rounds of questioning of the panelists tends to be time consuming&lt;ref&gt;von der Gracht, H.A., 2008. The Delphi technique for futures research. The Future of Logistics: Scenarios for 2025, pp.21-68.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Delphi's primary strength is its ability to explore, tranquilly and objectively, issues that require judgement. Unlike panel sessions, the iterative Delphi method allows the forecasting and assessment to be done without the effect of strong personalities or reputations influencing other panelists and also overcomes the difficulty of getting all experts together in a single time and place&lt;ref&gt;von der Gracht, H.A., 2012. Consensus measurement in Delphi studies. Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79(8), pp.1525-1536.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Causal layered analysis (CLA) ===
{{main article|Causal layered analysis}}

This method, developed by [[Sohail Inayatullah]], is one of the newest developments in Futures Studies. Causal layered analysis focuses on "opening up" the present and past to create alternative futures rather than on developing a picture of a particular future&lt;ref&gt;Inayatullah, S., 1998. Causal layered analysis: Poststructuralism as method. Futures, 30(8), pp.815-829.&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is concerned with the vertical dimension of futures studies, with the layers of analysis. CLA is based on the assumption that the way in which a problem is formulated changes the policy solutions and the actors in charge of initiating transformations&lt;ref&gt;Inayatullah, S., 1998. Causal layered analysis: Poststructuralism as method. Futures, 30(8), pp.815-829.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The key principle of the method is using and integrating different ways of knowing.

There are a number of  benefits arising from the application of this method&lt;ref&gt;Inayatullah, S., 2008. Six pillars: futures thinking for transforming. foresight, 10(1), pp.4-21.&lt;/ref&gt;. Causal layered analysis increases the range and richness of scenarios; leads to inclusion of different ways of knowing among participants in workshops; appeals to wider range of individuals through incorporation of non-textual and artistic elements; extends the discussion beyond the obvious to the deeper and marginal; and leads to the policy actions that can be educated by alternative layers of analysis&lt;ref&gt;Inayatullah, S., 2008. Six pillars: futures thinking for transforming. foresight, 10(1), pp.4-21.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Environmental scanning ===
{{main article|Environmental scanning}}

Environmental scanning is usually used at the start of a futures project. It aims at broad exploration of all major trends, issues, advancements, events and ideas across a wide range of activities&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35 &lt;/ref&gt;. Information is collected from many different sources, such as newspapers, magazines, Internet, television, conferences, reports, and also science-fiction books. Various tools and methodologies are used by large corporations to systematically scope their external environment. An example is the widely used FUTURE structure developed by [[Futures studies|Futurist]] [[Patrick Dixon]] described in his book ''[[Futurewise (book)|Futurewise]]'' - F ast, U rban, T ribal, U niversal, R adical, E thical.  Attention needs to be given to potential Wild Cards - low probability (or uncertain probability) but potentially high impact events.

Scanning is used to build up a comprehensive picture of factors that could impact strategy.

Four types of indicators can be examined in the process of environmental scanning:

# Lone signals (individual factors that might indicate change) 
# Landmark events (in various areas of life)
# Forecasts of experts 
# Statistical descriptions (to portray development of elements of the study).

=== Morphological analysis ===
{{main article|Morphological analysis (problem-solving)}}

[[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis]] is a technique developed by [[Fritz Zwicky]] (1966, 1969) for exploring all the possible solutions to a multi-dimensional, non-quantified problem complex.

As a problem structuring and problem solving technique, morphological analysis was designed for multi-dimensional, non-quantifiable problems where causal modeling and simulation do not function well or at all. Zwicky developed this approach to address seemingly non-reducible complexity. Using the technique of cross consistency assessment (CCA), the system however does allow for reduction, not by reducing the number of variables involved, but by reducing the number of possible solutions through the elimination of the illogical solution combinations in a grid box.

MA has also been employed for the identification of new product opportunities. The technique involves mapping options in order to attain an overall perspective of possible solutions. It comprises the two main activities: a systematic analysis of a current and future structure of the area including the gaps in that structure, stimulation for creation of new alternative, which could fill the gaps and meet any needs.

=== Scenario planning ===
{{main article|Scenario planning}}

Scenarios are one of the most popular and persuasive methods used in the Futures Studies. Government planners, corporate strategists and military analysts use them in order to aid decision-making. The term scenario was introduced into planning and decision-making by [[Herman Kahn]] in connection with military and strategic studies done by RAND in the 1950s.

It can be defined as a rich and detailed portrait of a plausible future world, one sufficiently vivid that a planner can clearly see and comprehend the problems, challenges and opportunities that such an environment would present&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .&lt;/ref&gt;.

A scenario is not a specific forecast of the future, but a plausible description of what might happen. Scenarios are like stories built around carefully constructed plots based on trends and events. They assist in selection of strategies, identification of possible futures, making people aware of uncertainties and opening up their imagination and initiating learning processes.

One of the key strengths of the scenario process is its influence on the way of thinking of its participants. A mindset, in which the focus is placed on one possible future, is altered towards the balanced thinking about a number of possible alternative futures.

=== Future history ===
{{main article|Future history}}

A '''future history''' is a postulated [[history]] of the [[future]]. Some authors for example [[science fiction]] writers construct as a common background for fiction. The author may include a [[Chronology|timeline]] of events for this history. A related field is [[alternate history]], which assumes that the event or events at a point in past history turned out differently (POD=point of departure) and then draws a fictional future timeline from that event.

=== Monitoring ===
It is a process that aims at evaluation of events, as they occur or just after&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;. It involves activities like scanning, detecting, projecting, assessing, responding and tracking. Monitoring is one of the fundamental activities performed by Futures Studies.

=== Content analysis ===
This technique is used for the systematic and objective study of the particular aspects of various ‘messages’. Such ‘messages’ can be found in books, journals, newspapers, private letters, publications of political parties, reports, surveys, interviews, television, Internet and so on. This method, in order to be reliable and valid, needs to be performed with high competency.

== Backcasting (eco-history)==
{{main article|Backcasting}}

It is a technique that often is pointed out as an opposite to forecasting. It involves identification of a particular scenario and tracing its origins and lines of development back to the present.

=== Back-view mirror analysis ===

It builds upon the assumption that any future oriented group process has to manage peoples’ difficulties in thinking into the future. These difficulties can arise from the fears as well as from the lack of experience in futures thinking.

Back-view mirror analysis allows dealing with the fears related to the future by creating a new perspective that looks to the past instead of starting the process in the present. The method is used to perform qualitative analysis of the past using both quantitative and qualitative data.

=== Cross-impact analysis ===
{{main article|Cross-impact analysis}}

The method was developed by Theodore Gordon and Olaf Helmer in 1966 in an attempt to answer a question whether perceptions of how future events may interact with each other can be used in forecasting.

As it is well known, most events and trends are interdependent in some ways. Cross-impact analysis provides an analytical approach to the probabilities of an element in a forecast set, and it helps to assess probabilities in view of judgements about potential interactions between those elements.

The technique can be used by individuals and groups at an elementary qualitative level as well as it can be employed to perform more complicated and intensive quantitative analysis. One of its strengths is that it forces the attention towards "chains of causality: x affects y; y affects z". On the other side it can be very fatiguing and monotonous.

== Futures workshops ==
{{main article|Futures workshops}}

Future workshops were developed by [[Robert Jungk]] in order to allow anybody to become involved in creating their preferred future rather than being subjected to decisions made by experts. Future workshops are very strongly action oriented. They aim, first to imagine the desired future, and then to plan it and implement it.

Future workshops have four distinctive phases:

#In the first preparatory phase the issue that will be considered is identified and the structure and details of sessions are arranged. 
# The operative phase involves clarification of the issue considered and articulation of negative experiences in the present situation. 
# In the fantasy stage participants verbalise their desires, dreams, fantasies and views about the future in a free idea generation session. The participants are asked to forget all the limitations and obstacles of the present reality. 
# The last step involves: analysis of the feasibility of ideas and solutions generated in the fantasy phase; recognition of limits and barriers for implementation and discovering how they can be overcome.

A similar method is found in Future Search.

=== Failure mode and effects analysis ===
{{main article|Failure mode and effects analysis}}

'''[[Failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA)''' is a safety analysis method first developed for [[systems engineering]] which examines potential failures in products or processes.  It may be used to evaluate [[risk management]] priorities for mitigating known threat-vulnerabilities.

FMEA helps select remedial actions that reduce '''cumulative impacts''' of life cycle consequences (risks) from a systems failure (fault).

=== Measured Action ===

'''Measured Action''' is an action that improves Production Capability by a measured amount, (e.g. if X hours of overtime then Y additional files transmitted). Measured actions enhance FMEA by perfectly matching calculated risks with calculated contingencies to ensure a specific outcome.

=== Futures biographies ===

This method, also called futures imagining, aims to create individual imaginaries, to gather peoples’ views on the future and to examine them in the study of collective future. Peoples’ expectations and opinions are considered as an important indication of possible goals and to possible directions that can influence peoples’ actions and in result steer the future.

=== Futures wheel ===
{{main article|Futures wheel}}

The method is a form of structured brainstorming that aims at identifying and packaging secondary and tertiary consequences of trends and events. A trend or event is placed in the middle of a piece of paper and then small spokes are drawn wheel-like from the centre. Primary impacts and consequences are written in circles of the first ring.

Then secondary consequences of each primary impact are derived forming the second ring. This ripple effect continues until there is a clear picture of implications that the event or trend can have. Futures wheel is a very simple but powerful technique for drawing out people's opinions and ideas. However, it is sensitive to underlying assumptions.

=== Relevance tree ===

It is an analytical technique that subdivides a large subject into increasingly smaller subtopics. The relevance tree has a form of a hierarchical structure that begins with a high level of abstraction and moves down with greater degree of detail in the following levels of the tree. It is a powerful technique that helps to ensure that a given problem or issue is broken into comprehensive detail and that important connections among the elements considered are presented in both current and potential situations.

== Simulation and modelling ==
{{main article|Simulation|Model (abstract)}}

Simulation and modelling are computer-based tools developed to represent [[reality]]. They are widely used to analyse behaviours and to understand processes. Models allow demonstration of past changes as well as the examination of various transformations and their impact on each other and other considered factors.

They can help to understand the connections between factors and events and to examine their dynamics. Simulation is a process that represents a structure and change of a system. In simulation some aspects of reality are duplicated or reproduced, usually within the model. 
The main purpose of simulation is to discern what would really happen in the real world if certain conditions, imitated by the model, developed.

Although modelling and simulation became even more popular with the development of computing technology, application of these techniques have certain limits. Models represent a simplification of a system that is being examined; therefore the results need to be carefully considered.

As the complexity of real systems increases models need to be more and more complex to represent the reality most accurately. In result, they may become increasingly difficult to understand and to be operated. Their complex nature can cause problems with using and managing results.

As models constitute a simpler version of reality, certain factors can be omitted, and in consequence can lead to mistakes. Such mistakes are not easy to be found and corrected.

=== Social network analysis ===
{{main article|Social network analysis}}

'''Social network analysis''' (also sometimes called ''network theory'') has emerged as a key technique in modern [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[Social Psychology]] and [[organizational studies]], as well as a popular topic of speculation and study.

Research in a number of academic fields have demonstrated that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals.

=== Systems engineering ===
{{main article|Systems engineering}}

An [[interdisciplinary]] approach to engineering systems that is inherently complex, since the [[behavior]] of and interaction among system components is not always [[well defined]].

Defining and characterizing such [[systems]] and subsystems, and the interactions among them, is the primary aim of systems engineering.  On ''very'' large programs, a [[systems architect]] may be designated to serve as an interface between the user/sponsor and systems engineer.

[[RADM]] [[Grace Hopper]], [[USNR]] was quoted as saying "Life was simple before [[World War II]]. After that, we had systems."

== Visioning ==

Visioning is a popular method in the studies of desirable futures and the one that gives emphasis to values. It is extensively used in urban planning. The visioning process is based on the assumption that images of the future lead peoples’ present behaviours, guide choices and influence decisions. Images of the future can be positive or negative and cause different responses according to the perceptions.

Vision is usually seen as a positive, desirable image of the future and can be defined as a compelling, inspiring statement of the preferred future that the authors and those who subscribe to the vision want to create.

There are a number of issues that need to be addressed while using the visioning method. Vision comprises peoples’ values, wishes, fears and desires. In order to make the visioning process work it is necessary to ensure that it is not making an idealistic wish-list; that vision is an image of the future shared by a whole community; and that the vision is translatable into reality.

== Trend analysis ==
{{main article|Trend analysis}}

Trend analysis is one of the most often used methods in forecasting. It aims to observe and register the past performance of a certain factor and project it into the future. It involves analysis of two groups of trends: quantitative, mainly based on statistical data, and qualitative, these are at large concerned with social, institutional, organisational and political patterns.

In the quantitative trend analysis data is plotted along a time axis, so that a simple curve can be established. Short term forecasting seems quite simple; it becomes more complex when the trend is extrapolated further into the future, as the number of dynamic forces that can change direction of the trend increases. This form of simple trend extrapolation helps to direct attention towards the forces, which can change the projected pattern.

A more elaborated curve that uses times series analysis can often reveal surprising historical and current data patterns. The qualitative trend analysis is one of the most demanding and creative methods in [[Futures Studies]].

As trends never speak for themselves, the identification and description of patterns is partly empirical and partly creative activity. The most challenging part of qualitative trends analysis is identification of a tendency early, as recognition of a mature trend is "relatively useless" in influencing anyone's behaviour.

=== Adaptive role-playing ===
{{main article|Role-playing}}

Although similar to [[decision theory]], [[game theory]] studies decisions that are made in an environment where various players interact. In other words, game theory studies choice of optimal behavior when costs and benefits of each option are not fixed, but depend upon the choices of other individuals.

[[Win-win game|ALL-WinWin]] collaborative efforts require [[decision making|group decision support systems]] (GDSS) that enable the [[knowledge management]] [[community of practice]] to assure [[sustainable]] mutually-beneficial results.

'''Flavia Galla''' (died 394) was an empress of the [[Roman Empire]] and a princess of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. She was the second [[Queen consort|empress consort]] of [[Theodosius I]]. She was the daughter of [[Valentinian I]] and his second wife [[Justina (empress)|Justina]].

== Family ==
Little is known of Galla, including her full name. ''Galla'' is the female [[cognomen]] for ''Gallus'' and, in [[Latin]], ''gallus'' could mean both an inhabitant of [[Gaul]] and a [[rooster]].

Galla is listed as one of four children of the marriage by [[Jordanes]]. Her paternal uncle [[Valens]] was Emperor of the Eastern Roman [[Byzantine Empire]] from 364 to his death in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] (9 August 378). Her father was emperor of the Western Roman Empire from 364 to his death on 17 November 375 and was previously married to [[Marina Severa]]. The only known child of that marriage was [[Gratian]], Western Roman Emperor from 375 to his assassination on 25 August 383. Her mother was previously married to [[Magnentius]], a [[Roman usurper]] from 350 to 353.&lt;ref&gt;DiMaio, Michael Jr., [http://www.roman-emperors.org/magnent.htm Magnentius (350–353 A.D) and Decentius (351–353 A.D.)], roman-emperors.org. Accessed 2012-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wend, David A., [http://www.oocities.org/athens/parthenon/7094/magn2.html Magnentius As Emperor], 2009-10-25, archived from geocities.com. Accessed 2012-5-29.&lt;/ref&gt; However both [[Zosimus]] and the fragmentary chronicle of [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]] report that Justina was too young at the time of her first marriage to have children.&lt;ref&gt;Lenski, Noel Emmanuel, Failure of Empire: Valens and the Roman State in the Fourth Century A.D., 2003, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Galla thus had no known maternal half-siblings.

Galla had three full-siblings. Her only brother was [[Valentinian II]], first co-emperor with Gratian from 375 and then the only legitimate Western Roman Emperor from 383 to his death by hanging on 15 May 392. His death was officially reported as a suicide but [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], his ''[[magister militum]]'', was suspected to have had a hand in it, an accusation found in the writings of [[Socrates of Constantinople]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], and [[Zosimus]]. [[Sozomen]] was less certain and mentioned both versions of how Valentinian II died.&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org"&gt;Roberts, Walter E., [http://www.roman-emperors.org/valenii.htm Valentinian II (375-92 A.D.)], roman-emperors.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her two sisters were Grata and Justa.&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org" /&gt; According to Socrates, both remained unmarried. They were probably still alive in 392 but not mentioned afterwards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]], Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage to Theodosius ==

Galla was cast into a role of significance because of conflict between three Roman emperors in the 380s. In 383, Gratian died while facing a major revolt under [[Magnus Maximus]]. Maximus proceeded to establish his control of a portion of the Roman Empire including [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]], [[Hispania]], and the [[Diocese of Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roman-emperors.org/madmax.htm Walter E. Roberts, "Magnus Maximus (383–388 A.D.)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ruling from his capital at [[History of Trier|Augusta Treverorum]] (Treves, [[Trier]]), he was able to negotiate his recognition by Valentinian II and Theodosius I starting in 384. Valentinian II's territory was effectively limited to [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italia]], ruling from [[Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]]).&lt;ref name="roman-emperors.org" /&gt;

In 387, the truce between Valentinian II and Maximus ended. Maximus crossed the [[Alps]] into the [[Po Valley]] and threatened ''Mediolanum''. Valentinian and Justina fled their capital for [[History of Thessaloniki|Thessaloniki]], capital of the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] and at the time the chosen residence of Theodosius. Galla accompanied them. Theodosius was then a widower, his first wife [[Aelia Flaccilla]] having died in 385 or 386.

Theodosius granted refuge to the fugitives. According to [[Zosimus]]'s account, Justina arranged for Galla to appear weeping before Theodosius and to appeal for his compassion. Galla was reportedly a beautiful woman and Theodosius was soon smitten and requested to marry her. Justina used this to her advantage, setting a condition for the marriage agreement under which Theodosius would have to attack Maximus and restore Valentinian II to his throne. Theodosius consented to Justina’s condition, the marriage probably taking place in late 387.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] (1849)&lt;/ref&gt;

The account was questioned by [[Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont|Tillemont]] as inconsistent with the [[piety]] of Theodosius. He suggested that the marriage took place in 386, prior to the beginning of hostilities. However, [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' considered Zosimus' account more likely, and later works, including the ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', followed Gibbons' interpretation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Empress ==
When Galla married Theodosius, she became both a Roman empress and a stepmother to Theodosius’ two sons from his first marriage, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. Arcadius was the eldest and had been declared an [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in January 383. He served as a nominal co-ruler to his father but was still approximately ten years old at the time of Galla's marriage.

In July and August of 388, the combined troops of Theodosius I and Valentinian II invaded the territory of Maximus under the leadership of [[Richomeres]], [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], [[Promotus]], and [[Timasius]]. Maximus suffered a series of losses and surrendered in [[Aquileia]]. He was executed on 28 August 388 along with his son and nominal co-ruler [[Flavius Victor]]. Elen, his wife, and his two daughters were spared. Justina's condition for the marriage had been met, however she died the same year, unable to witness the result of her efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century/Dictionary/J/Justina, empress|Justina's entry in the Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodosius installed Valentinian and his court at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] in Gaul, away from Milan and the influence of [[Ambrose]]. Theodosius appointed Arbogast as ''magister militum'' for the Western provinces. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Stephen &amp; Friell, Gerard, Theodosius: the Empire at Bay, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodosius spent the years 388–391 in Italia, while Galla and her stepsons remained in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]]. According to [[Marcellinus Comes]], in 390 Arcadius expelled her from the palace.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; However, since Arcadius was only thirteen, that decision could as well have belonged to those who governed in his name.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Zosimus reports her mourning over the death of her brother in 392.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; On August 22 of the same year, Arbogast declared [[Eugenius]] as an emperor without the approval of Theodosius. Negotiations with Theodosius to achieve recognition were unsuccessful and, on 23 January 393, Theodosius declared his second son Honorius, an Augustus, the implication being that Theodosius alone was legitimate emperor. Conflict between the two emperors began the following year, resulting in the [[Battle of the Frigidus]], on 5–6 September 394. Theodosius was victorious and gained control of the entire Roman Empire while Arbogast committed suicide and Eugenius was executed.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Walter E., [http://www.roman-emperors.org/eugene.htm Flavius Eugenius (392–394)], roman-emperors.org, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether Galla lived to see the victory is uncertain. According to Zosimus, she died in childbirth within the same year, the exact date unknown.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

[[Tillemont]] interpreted a passage of [[Philostorgius]] to identify Galla as an adherent of [[Arianism]], however the passage actually seems to mean that her mother was Arian. Galla herself is identified as an Arian in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

== Children ==
Galla had three children with Theodosius who were:
* Gratian, a son born in 388 and who died young;
* [[Galla Placidia|Aelia Galla Placidia]], a daughter (392–27 November, 450), her only child to survive to adulthood and who later became an empress in her own right. She married [[Ataulf]], king of the [[Visigoths]], and, after his death, [[Constantius III]];
* John, a son, who died with his mother in childbirth in 394.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, David, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/theo1.htm Theodosius I (379–395 A.D.)], roman-emperors.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GoPets''' was a [[virtual pet]] site that involved raising a customized [[3-D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] pet downloaded onto a user's computer.  GoPets was launched on August 4, 2005&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualworlddigest.com/what-is-gopets/ |title=What is GoPets? |accessdate=April 1, 2011 |author=Mike |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501070354/http://www.virtualworlddigest.com/what-is-gopets/ |archivedate=May 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed on November 8, 2009.&lt;ref name="GoPets will be shutdown November 7th"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://community.livejournal.com/gopets/43728.html | title=GoPets will be shutdown &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; November 7th | accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GoPets resided not only on their owners' computers, but also visited GoPets members around the world when sent, invited or when pets decide to travel on their own.&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?" /&gt;

To provide a means of communication among users who speak different languages, GoPets had a universal iconic language called "IKU." The GoPets service also contained chat services and a forum.&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?" /&gt;

==Basics==

===Pets===
Players on GoPets had the ability to create a pet. After selecting which animal they desire, they had the opportunity to customize their new GoPet by selecting from a list of pre-set colors and patterns.  Once the initial creation process was complete, the GoPet was brought into existence to reside on the player's [[Desktop metaphor|desktop]].

If players desired further customization, they could dress their pet up with unique [[clothing]] items, and equip different transportation vehicles such as cars or planes.  Many equipable items hold trainable animations that GoPets could be taught to use when their stats were at a certain level.

GoPets were social, and enjoyed interacting with other GoPets.  These interactions included conversations, games, and professions of love and friendship which may result in a communal dance.  GoPets loved to travel around desktops of players all around the world in search of other places where there were treated politely and affectionately.&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?" /&gt;

GoPets never died or became sick, despite the lack of care or how low their status might have become.  However, GoPets would respond negatively to ill care and leave their owners' desktop frequently. For example, when very tired, GoPets would fall asleep often.

===GoLand===
GoLand was a GoPets term referring to a players desktop.  New users were taken to a community desktop where books, food and clothing are able to be purchased.  A user could purchase their own piece of GoLand by using the GoLand Map and searching for either a camping site or a tier 1 land.  Camping sites were shown by a green paw, and only cost 1000 green shells; while the tier 1 lands were shown by an orange paw and cost 75 gold shells.  Camping sites only allowed 75 items to be placed onto the desktop, while a tier 1 land allowed 250 items for non-subscribers, and 400 items for premium subscribers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Players could decorate their desktop with countless objects and toys for GoPets to play and interact with.  GoPets could use many of the items by themselves.  One popular item was a bathtub, which GoPets would utilize when their cleanliness status is low. In addition to toys and food, GoPets owners could place decorative items on the desktop, such as trees, shrubs or ponds. They could also mark items for sale, allowing visitors to their desktop to purchase these items at will.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Currency===
The GoPets currency was known as the shell (they are simply colored seashells); green shells were the lowest denomination, pink shells were second, and gold shells were considered the most valuable. Gold Shells could be purchased for real money through Gopets, for $0.10 USD per shell. At the trading forum, some players traded shells for another, but the exchange rate could be rather outrageous ((100 gold shell: 500 pink shells: 20000 green shells)).  All types of shells, as well as numerous items, could be found in [[fortune cookies]]; Green Tea Fortune Cookies were given Daily to un-subscribed users, while special Premium Fortune Cookies were given to the Subscribers.&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?" /&gt;

The player's currency of Gold Shells to Pink Shells to Green Shells changed after GoPets discovered a flaw in their fortune cookie system which gave a higher payout of gold shells than a person who would buy the prepaid cards. Due to this, GoPets changed and revised the fortune cookie system making a daily maximum payout of 10 Gold Shells from pink fortune cookies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Pink shells could only be used by Subscribers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Gameplay==
Users could interact with the GoPets on their desktop, by feeding them, petting them, playing with them, sending them to other players.  GoPets could own micropets, little pets for your pets. Micropets included the Spring Butterfly, Baby Chick, Owl, Parrot, Penguin, and many others. Occasionally, micropets would make noise, and pets equipped with a micropet had their stats decreased at a faster pace.

GoPets provided a [[Child Safety]] Mode which, once activated, allows the guardian to establish a Protector ID that limited the functions available for underage users. Only the specified Protector ID was able to send gifts to that account. The child's information was not viewable to the public.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Mini games===
One of the GoPets stores is devoted completely to mini games. These small games can be purchased just like any other GoPets item and played on the owner's desktop. When a GoPets user purchases a mini game, it will appear in their Inventory. To play it, double-click on its Inventory icon. However, the most recently released games are downloaded and played independently of the GoPets' client.&lt;ref name="GoPets MiniGames page" /&gt;

Previously, there were three other mini games available: Freethrow Shootout, BullsEye, and SkeeBall. However, these games were retired. All games released after the retiring of these games had different rules, a different prize point payout, and were downloaded separately rather than within the Gopets client.&lt;ref name="GoPets MiniGames page" /&gt;

There were seven Mini Games available ."&lt;ref name="GoPets MiniGames page"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gopetslive.com/html/mini_game/minigame_index.html | title=GoPets MiniGames Page | accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, they are: Poker, [[Diner Dash 2]], Eets, CandyShot, Sudoku, Shangai, and Magic Ball.

GoDance, a rhythm game, was released for free to GoPets users. There was a forum dedicated to GoDance which includes the latest link to download the updated GoDance game as well as talk to other GoDancers.

==Community==
The GoPets service contained limited email and chat services, including a [[message board]]. Users could block other users, or add them as friends. They could also send Private Messages to them, and leave 'Testimonials' on their profile for all to see.

There was also a program called 'GoChat'. Though only Premium users could make private 'chat rooms', un-subscribed users could make public rooms. It featured font customization, with a number of fonts to choose from.&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?" /&gt;

==Charity==
GoPets users had the ability to give back to the community as well by buying certain items.  A portion of the shells used to purchase the items were donated to certain charities.  In addition to purchasing items, users could donate shells directly to the charities of their choice by visiting the Giving through GoPets page.&lt;ref name="Charity"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cambodia.net/malaria/01_06_06.htm | title=Get a ‘Pet,’ Find a Friend and Save Some Lives—All From Home | accessdate=April 1, 2011 | author=Maloy, John | date=June 1, 2006 | work=cambodia.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners and Licensed Products==

===MSN Partnership===
From summer 2007 to July 2009, GoPets was available on [[Windows Live Messenger]] via partnership with [[Microsoft]]. Players could access GoPets from MSN Messenger, playing the game and gaining access to a unique panda pet. Press coverage of the partnership referred to GoPets as "a global dog park for the 21st century" for how players could meet through their pets across global distances.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/jul07/07-18GoPetsPR.mspx&lt;/ref&gt; The GoPet ambassador to MSN Messenger was called Lily Panda.&lt;ref&gt;https://lily-panda.spaces.live.com/ {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123214031/https://lily-panda.spaces.live.com/ |date=January 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GoPets: Vacation Island===
In the Spring of 2007, Konami Digital Entertainment ([[Konami Corporation]]) released GoPets Vacation Island for the [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.konami.com/Konami/ctl3810/cp20104/si1725034/cl1/go_pets_vacation_island_working_title |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031133322/http://www.konami.com/Konami/ctl3810/cp20104/si1725034/cl1/go_pets_vacation_island_working_title |archivedate=2006-10-31 |df= }}"GoPets: Vacation Island." Konami. Oct 2006. Konami Digital Entertainment. Retrieved 7 Nov 2006&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Developed by 1st Playable Productions, the game would allow the player to make and visit friends, as well as play minigames, design foods and items and dress their pets up in clothing.  The DS game, like the web version, had IKU chat and minigames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/gopets/760916p1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312052903/http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/gopets/760916p1.html |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GoPets: Matchu Petchu===
In early 2007, One Nine Studios developed a mobile game called GoPets: Matchu Petchu, where players could play minigames on mobile phones and unlock a special monkey pet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneninestudios.com/gopets.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamecareerguide.com/news/12290/industry_vets_form_portable_.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premium accounts==
A premium account gave users extra benefits, but it was not required for the website. Users with premium accounts received discounts when buying gold shells. Instead of receiving ''green tea fortune cookies'' on a daily basis, premium account users received ''premium fortune cookies'', which gave out at least 1 gold shell and up to 2112. Premium users received a special item each month, for the extent of their subscription.  Premium users gained access to certain shops where they could purchase items such as the "Custom Creation Tool". This was used to create items of clothing and furniture with custom textures uploaded onto the client that could then be used on the user's pets or land.&lt;ref name="What is GoPets?" /&gt;

There were 2 different types of premium memberships available.  The first was the monthly GoPremium, which gives the premium user the premium item of the month.  The second was the yearly Premium Plus 12, which includes the premium item of the month for an entire year as well as an exclusive playset.  This system was time based meaning you can have at least 1 month of premium account. After the time limit has passed, the user's account reverts to the normal account but the user's items are still theirs to keep.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Awards==
On August 28, 2006 GoPets, Ltd. was selected as a Red Herring 100 Asia Winner for 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redherring.com/Home/17516 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070620152923/http://www.redherring.com/Home/17516 |archivedate=2007-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale==
In early November 2009 GoPets announced it had been sold to [[Zynga]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engagedigital.com/2009/10/31/zynga-acquires-gopets/ Zynga acquires GoPets&lt;/ref&gt; Zynga immediately closed GoPets down, around the time that Zynga launched their [[Pet Society]] clone, [[PetVille]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10408925-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical sign of gonadarche, and usually of [[puberty]].
* In girls, ovarian growth cannot be directly seen, so [[thelarche]] and growth acceleration are usually the first evidence of gonadarche.

Gonadarche should be contrasted with [[adrenarche]]. Gonadarche indicates that true central puberty has begun, while adrenarche is an independent maturational process only loosely associated with complete puberty.

'''Harvey Miguel Robinson''' (born December 6, 1974) is an [[Americans|American]] [[serial killer]] currently imprisoned on [[death row]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. He is one of the youngest serial killers in American history. He was 18 years old when he was apprehended for his crimes. He is also the first serial killer in the history of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="sheehan" /&gt;

==Background==
Robinson's father was an alcoholic who physically and emotionally abused Robinson's mother. The father eventually left the family. His father was later incarcerated for beating his girlfriend to death.

Before the murders, Robinson had frequently stolen female underwear.
== Crimes ==
The rape/murder victims were:&lt;ref name="update2010" /&gt;

*Joan Burghardt, a 29-year-old nurse's aide (August 1992)
*Charlotte Schmoyer, a 15-year-old newspaper carrier for ''[[The Morning Call]]'' (June 1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Snyder, Susan|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-06-11/news/2913099_1_elementary-schools-school-professionals-ritter|title=Call Carrier's Death Affects Many Students|publisher=''[[The Daily Call]]''|date=1993-06-11|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Schmoyer was a student at [[Louis E. Dieruff High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Casler, Kristin|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-06-11/news/2913050_1_charlotte-schmoyer-daughter-parents|title=`It's The Worst Nightmare I Could Imagine' Parents Struggle To Cope With Loss Of Daughter|publisher=''[[The Daily Call]]''|date=1993-06-11|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jessica Jean Fortney, a 47-year-old grandmother (July 1993)

Between the murders of Burghardt and Schmoyer, Robinson was arrested for burglary and served eight months in prison. After the murder of Schmoyer, he almost got apprehended when he was pulled over for a speeding violation. But Robinson received his speeding ticket and left.

==Capture==
Denise Sam-Cali was one of two of Robinson's victims who survived. The other was a five-year-old girl Robinson stalked for days; Robinson then broke in to her home and raped and choked her, then left her for dead.  Sam-Cali managed to break free of Robinson's grip and run outside. Robinson attempted to attack her again, but fled. Eventually, the police used Sam-Cali as bait to lure Robinson in to capture him. A shootout erupted between Robinson and a police officer. Robinson fled, but he was wounded. He went to the hospital, where he was arrested.

==Aftermath==
Robinson was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for his crimes. As of April 2006, his execution had been [[stay of execution|stayed]]. He was later resentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Joan Burghardt because he was 17 when the crime was committed.&lt;ref name="resentenced" /&gt; As of 2010 Robinson was to face another jury to decide the penalty for Charlotte Schmoyer.&lt;ref name="update2010" /&gt; On December 14, 2012, Robinson agreed to waive his appeal rights in the Schmoyer case in exchange for a life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Colin|last=McEvoy |url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/allentown/index.ssf/2012/12/allentown_serial_killer_spared.html|title=Allentown serial killer spared death penalty after waiving appeal rights|work=[[The Express-Times]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|location=Easton, Pennsylvania|date=December 14, 2012|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld Robinson's death penalty in the Fortney murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Colin|last=McEvoy | url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/allentown/index.ssf/2013/12/allentown_serial_killers_death.html|title=Allentown serial killer's death penalty verdict upheld| work= [[The Express-Times]]| publisher=[[Advance Publications]]| location=Easton, Pennsylvania|date=December 31, 2013|accessdate=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
The story of Robinson's crime spree was depicted in the 1996 film titled ''No One Could Protect Her'', with [[Joanna Kerns]] playing the part of surviving victim Denise Sam-Cali.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113991/ Internet Movie Database listing for ''No One Could Protect Her'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the story of Robinson's crime spree had also been told in the [[Investigation Discovery]] series ''[[Your Worst Nightmare]]''.[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4866232/?ref_=ttep_ep1]

He was also depicted on [[A&amp;E_(TV_channel)|A&amp;E]]'s ''[[Killer Kids]]''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3214244/?ref_=ttep_ep1] and [[Investigation Discovery]]'s ''[[Most Evil]]''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4316502/?ref_=ttep_ep6].

An '''immortelle''' is a long-lasting flower arrangement placed on graves in cemeteries.

They were originally made from natural dried flowers (which lasted longer than fresh flowers) or could be made from artificial materials such as china and painted [[plaster of paris]] or beads strung on wire arrangements. Unless made of a highly durable material (e.g. china), they would often be enclosed in a glass container (known as globes) to protect them from the weather. In some cases, they were embedded into the grave itself (e.g. on the concrete over the grave) while others were merely placed on or by the grave.

[[File:Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883.jpg|thumb|left|Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883]]
In ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', [[Mark Twain]] comments on burial practices in [[New Orleans]]: ''"They bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. ... Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'—which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars—kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler-iron."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Twain, Mark | author2=Roy J. Friedman Mark Twain Collection (Library of Congress) | title=Life on the Mississippi : with over 300 illustrations | publication-date=1883 | publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10904097 | accessdate=27 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immortelles were popular in Australia in the early 20th century. Being more expensive than fresh flowers, immortelles were normally left on graves by close family. They were purchased from undertakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article121047009 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[Inglewood Advertiser]] |location=Vic. |date=4 February 1916 |accessdate=27 December 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article151064590 |title=FUNERAL. |newspaper=[[Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser]] |location=Qld. |date=12 September 1929 |accessdate=27 December 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, plastic flowers have replaced immortelles as a long-lasting flower arrangement for use with graves. Therefore, immortelles will mostly only be seen on older graves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7999">[[Image:Ian and ivananywhere.jpg|thumb|Ian and IvanAnywhere in a meeting]]
'''IvanAnywhere''' is a simple, remote-controlled [[telepresence]] [[robot]] created by [[Sybase iAnywhere]] programmers to enable their co-worker, Ivan Bowman, to [[telecommute]] to work more efficiently. The robot enables Bowman to be virtually present at conferences and presentations, and to discuss product development with other developers face-to-face.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Worker&gt;{{cite news|last=Walcoff|first=Matt|title=The worker you have to plug in|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/sep/13/guardianweeklytechnologysection.news|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; IvanAnywhere is powered by SAP's mobile database product, [[SQL Anywhere]].

==IvanAnywhere evolution==
Ivan Bowman has been a software developer at Sybase/iAnywhere/SAP since 1993, and now is an Engineering Director at SAP Canada. In 2002 his wife received a job in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] approximately {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from his place of work in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], [[North America]]. His employers allowed him to [[Telecommunication|telecommunicate]] initially via email, instant messenger, and phone.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Worker /&gt;

Using speakerphone during meetings was less than ideal because Ivan could not see his co-workers' visual communication clues, or what they wrote on the white board. The first solution was a stationary [[webcam]] with a speaker, which was kept in the corner of the office. The problem with this method was that the webcam was just that – stationary.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaylord|first=Chris|title=Send your robot to work|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech-Culture/2008/0523/send-your-robot-to-work|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan could not see people if they were not standing near the webcam. More frustrating, perhaps, was that Ivan could hear distant conversations through the webcam's microphone, but was unable to contribute to the conversation if the impromptu meeting did not take place in his visual range.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Worker /&gt;

===Proof of concept===
In November 2005, iAnywhere programmer Ian McHardy and Director of Engineering Glenn Paulley (Ivan’s immediate manager) conceived the idea of IvanAnywhere after Glenn saw a television commercial for a remote controlled toy blimp.&lt;ref name=HeraldNews&gt;{{cite news|last=Jeffrey|first=Davene|title=Ivan the Mobile|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/31424-ivan-mobile|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=Herald News|date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, after considering different possible designs and getting through a number of deadlines related to iAnywhere releases, Ian started working on a proof-of-concept: a [[tablet computer]] and webcam mounted on a radio-controlled toy truck.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Worker /&gt;

In February 2007, even though the truck was challenging to drive and the webcam was only a few inches above the floor, Ivan was able to successfully drive the proof-of-concept from Halifax.

===Full version===
In May 2007, Ivan started using Ian's full version daily. The full version of IvanAnywhere consists of a wheeled base with 24-volt SuperDroid Robots motors. The motor and wheel assemblies support "tank drive" so that Ivan can negotiate through doorways and meeting rooms more easily. Above the motors sits a box filled with wires, various electronics, and batteries which power the robot for a full work day. The entire robot weighs approximately 40&amp;nbsp;kg.

A 1.5 meter (5&amp;nbsp;foot) aluminum bar supports a webcam with a gray foam ball mounted above it. The robot is equipped with a webcam, speakers, microphone, and a tablet computer with a live feed from Bowman's webcam to help coworkers to communicate with him more naturally. [[Infrared]] [[proximity sensor]]s keep the robot from bumping into walls and cubicles.

The tablet PC mounted on IvanAnywhere runs a [[SQL Anywhere]] database server. One of the tasks of the SQL Anywhere database is to retain monitoring statistics on a wide variety of controls and sensors on the robot. This is so that Ian can monitor how far the robot travels in any particular period, how many times the proximity sensors have halted the robot's motion, the robot's network connectivity uptime, and other related statistics.

Ivan "drives" the robot from his home office in Halifax using a two-joystick PC gaming console. One joystick controls the webcam, the other the robot's drive system.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

In October 2007, a digital camera was mounted on the bar so that Ivan could take high-resolution pictures of whiteboards, presentation slides, and overheads, or just look out the window.&lt;ref name=CSM/&gt;

The robot needs to be recharged at the end of every work day. Until recently, this required a Waterloo co-worker to plug it in before leaving for the night. In May 2008, Ian constructed a charging bay out of lumber that Ivan "drives" into - copper bars attached to the robot connect to copper springs on the charging unit which are directly connected to the battery charger and enabled through a relay circuit so that the charging bars are not live unless the robot is in the bay. The charging bay permits Ivan to recharge the robot at his convenience, and without assistance.

IvanAnywhere is very popular with other people in the building and the SAP Engineering floor has become a regular stop on visitor tours of the SAP building.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Worker /&gt;

==Challenges of Being a Robot==
Although most of Bowman's colleagues treat IvanAnywhere as one of their own, people who aren't used to the robot are sometimes uncomfortable talking to it instead of a human being.&lt;ref name=Guardian-Worker /&gt;

Dinsmore was born around 1771 or 1772 in [[Ireland]] and he emigrated to the United States during the late 1700s, where he became a naturalized American citizen on June 5, 1798. He was hired by Jefferson in [[Philadelphia]], who paid for Dinsmore's tools and travel expenses to [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=UVP&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lay|first1=K.

In the classic 1956 science fiction film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'', the extinct race of advanced beings of the planet Altair IV are known as the Krell.  The first human starship to land on Altair IV, the ''Bellerophon'', was destroyed, with the only survivors being Dr. Edward Morbius along with his wife (who later died of natural causes) and daughter.  In his isolation, Morbius became the lone researcher to ever study the extinct Krell.

==Description==

The Krell had reached an incredibly advanced stage of technological and scientific development, able to — among other things — reproduce down to the molecular level any matter for which they had a pre-existing sample to serve as a template.  Another Krell device that played a prominent role in the film was their "plastic educator," a device able to create a three-dimensional visualization of the operator's thoughts while acting directly on the brain to measure intelligence and impart knowledge. Although previously demonstrated to be fatal to humans, its use by Dr. Morbius had boosted his [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] such that he could understand some of the basic science of the Krell (allowing him, for instance, to "tinker together" the amazing [[Robby the Robot]].)  Morbious remarks that while his IQ has been boosted to over twice the human average, he would be a mentally handicapped "moron" compared to the Krell themselves.  Morbius also believed that the Krell, after millions of years of social advancement, were not only technologically but morally superior to humanity — a benevolent and noble race of scholars and pacifists, who had evolved beyond war and violence.  

Morbius, however, discovered that in a single day and night, 2,000 centuries past, the entire Krell race disappeared. In the time since, all above-ground evidence of their civilization had vanished.  He didn't know exactly what happened to them in this shockingly rapid cataclysmic event.  For that matter, Morbius did not know what the Krell looked like:  no record of their physical nature survived, except perhaps in the form of their characteristic arch which served as the doorway between rooms. This doorway, coming to a triangular point at the top and much wider at the middle than at the top and bottom, suggests a being of enormous girth.

During the events of the film, the starship C-57D arrives on Altair IV, 20 years after Morbius was trapped there.  After meeting them, Morbius gives the command crew a tour of the Krell's crowning achievement:  a vast underground {{convert|8,000|cumi|km3|adj=on}} machine of virtually unlimited power, so advanced that it could give physical form to any matter they could conceive of, by remotely scanning their brain synapses — creation at mere thought, moving beyond the need for a pre-existing physical template, but based on limitless imagination.  

The C-57D's Lt. "Doc" Ostrow later uses the plastic educator, causing fatal injury to his brain, but briefly allowing him to infer the cause of the Krell downfall:  "Monsters from the Id".  Commander Adams confronts Morbius with this and is able to piece together what happened:  the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Id]] is an ("obsolete" and outdated) term for the base subconscious mind, composed of raw, animalistic emotions like hate, lust, and jealousy.  The Krell machine was so advanced that it didn't just give physical form and life to their conscious thoughts, but their ''subconscious'' thoughts as well.  Even for the advanced Krell this Freudian personality characteristic, although long forgotten, had not been eliminated. When combined with the power of their machine, the unbridled emotions of their Ids were all at once willed into physical reality and let loose to eradicate the entire Krell race.  Upon this realization, Morbius laments that the "poor Krell", benevolent pacifists who had eradicated violent thoughts from their conscious minds for over a million years, had no way of even understanding what was slaughtering them.

*The 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 speech was used as a sample in 808state track 10x10.
*Science-fiction author [[Jamie Sawyer]] has used the name "Krell" for the hostile alien species in his ''Lazarus War'' series.
* In the web video series [[Yacht Rock (web series)|Yacht Rock]], "Krell krell krell krell" is the "space-god of seafaring and smooth music."

{{unsourced|section|date=June 2016}}
Reference: 1979 ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' Magazine Double-Issue (Volume 8 – Number 2 &amp; Volume 8 – Number 3)
MAKING FORBIDDEN PLANET – By Frederick S. Clarke and Steve Rubin

The steps leading up to the Krell door ... were designed to be separated by a smooth ramp in the middle.

In the article the cinematographer of the ''Forbidden Planet'' film, George Folsey states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Krell were originally frog-like in nature with two long legs and a big tail. They were never shown, but it was indicated in the original screenplay that the ramps between the steps were designed to accommodate their dragging tail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Context ==
The murder of journalists in the Dominican Republic is rare. Since 1997, only four journalists have been killed.&lt;ref name=newsmax/&gt; In Medina's case, there was no immediate motive, although Medina had criticized a political movement in San Pedro de Macorís Province.&lt;ref name=listindiario /&gt;

Journalists killed on air or in front of a camera have become more common since 2015. In the [[United States]], journalist [[Murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward|Alison Parker]] and camera operator [[Murders of Alison Parker and Adam Ward|Adam Ward]] were killed on air on August 26, 2015.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] has highlighted the danger to journalists.&lt;ref name=mediafiledc /&gt;

== Reactions ==
{{quote |text=I condemn the murder of Luis Manuel Medina and Leónidas Martínez. Such brutality spreads terror not only throughout the media community of the country concerned but through society at large. I urge the authorities to do all they can to bring those responsible for this crime to trial and support the media whose contribution to the informed public debate is indispensable to maintain respect for internationally recognized human rights, notably the basic right of freedom of expression. |author=[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/news/director-general-condemns-killing-radio-broadcasters-luis-manuel-medina-and-leonidas-martinez|title=Director-General condemns killing of radio broadcasters Luis Manuel Medina and Leónidas Martínez in the Dominican Republic|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote |text=We deeply regret today's events with the death of these communicators, a condemnable and painful act that has appalled the Dominican society. The investigations are underway and we will seek with all the tools at our disposal to find the truth. |author=Jean Rodriguez, Attorney General&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;}}

The Division '''Lycopodiophyta''' (sometimes called '''lycophyta''' or '''lycopods''') is a [[vascular plant|tracheophyte]] subgroup of the Kingdom [[Plant]]ae. It is one of the oldest lineages of extant (living) [[vascular plants]] and contains extinct plants like ''[[Baragwanathia]]'' that have been dated from the [[Silurian]] (ca. 425 million years ago).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rickards|first1=R.B.|title=The age of the earliest club mosses: the Silurian Baragwanathia flora in Victoria, Australia|journal=Geological Magazine|date=2000|volume=137|issue=2|pages=207–209|doi=10.1017/s0016756800003800}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-850065-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=McElwain, Jenny C. |author2=Willis, K.

''Biology of Plants'', Seventh Edition. 381-388.&lt;/ref&gt;  They differ from all other vascular plants in having [[microphyll]]s, leaves that have only a single vascular trace (vein) rather than the much more complex [[megaphyll]]s found in [[fern]]s and [[seed plants]].

* Class [[Lycopodiopsida]] – clubmosses and firmosses
* Class [[Isoetopsida]] – quillworts, scale trees, and spikemosses
* Class †&amp;nbsp;[[Zosterophyllopsida]] – extinct zosterophylls.

The extant orders each have a single family with a total of 12 genera and 1290 known species (Christenhusz &amp; Byng 2016&lt;ref name="Christenhusz-Byng2016"/&gt;).

==Evolution==
The members of this division have a long evolutionary history, and [[fossil]]s are abundant worldwide, especially in coal [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]]. In fact, most known [[Genus|genera]] are [[Extinction|extinct]]. The [[Silurian]] species ''[[Baragwanathia longifolia]]'' represents the earliest identifiable Lycopodiophyta, while some ''[[Cooksonia (plant)|Cooksonia]]'' seem to be related. ''[[Lycopodolica]]'' is another Silurian genus which appears to be an early member of this group.&lt;ref name="RaymondGenselStein2006"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Raymond |first=A. |last2=Gensel |first2=P. |last3=Stein |first3=W.E. |year=2006 |title=Phytogeography of Late Silurian macrofloras |journal=Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology |volume=142 |issue=3–4 |pages=165–192 |doi=10.1016/j.revpalbo.2006.02.005 |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fossils ascribed to the Lycopodiophyta first appear in the Silurian period, along with a number of other vascular plants. Phylogenetic analysis places them at the base of the vascular plants; they are distinguished by their [[microphyll]]s and by transverse dehiscence of their sporangia (as contrasted with longitudinal in other vascular plants). Sporangia of living species are borne on the upper surfaces of microphylls (called [[sporophyll]]s). In some groups, these sporophylls are clustered into [[strobilus|strobili]].

Devonian fossil trees from [[Svalbard]], growing in equatorial regions, raise the possibility that they drew down enough carbon dioxide significantly to change the earth's climate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/163982-tropical-fossil-forests-unearthed-in-arctic-norway&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]], tree-like Lycopodiophyta (such as ''[[Lepidodendron]]'') formed huge forests that dominated the landscape. The complex ecology of these tropical rainforests [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|collapsed]] during the mid [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] due to a change in climate.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{ cite journal | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike modern trees, leaves grew out of the entire surface of the trunk and branches, but would fall off as the plant grew, leaving only a small cluster of leaves at the top. Their remains formed many fossil [[coal]] deposits. In Fossil Park, [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], fossilized Lycopodiophyta trees can be found in [[sandstone]]. The trees are marked with diamond-shaped scars where they once had leaves.

The group also evolved roots independently from the rest of the vascular plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0445-z Stepwise and independent origins of roots among land plants | Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lycopodiophyta had their maximum diversity in the [[Upper Carboniferous]], particularly tree-like ''Lepidodendron'' and ''Sigillaria'', that dominated tropical wetlands. In [[Euramerica]] these became apparently extinct in the Late [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]], as a result of a transition to a much drier climate, to give way to conifers, ferns and [[Sphenopsida|horsetails]]. In [[Cathaysia]] (now South China) tree-like Lycopodiophytes survived into the [[Permian]]. Nevertheless, lycopsids are rare in the [[Lopingian]] (latest Permian), but regained dominance in the [[Induan]] (earliest Triassic), particularly ''[[Pleuromeia]]''. After the worldwide [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] Lycopodiophyta pioneered the repopulation of habitats as opportunistic plants. The heterogeneity of the terrestrial plant communities increased markedly during the Middle Triassic when plant groups like sphenopsids, ferns, pteridosperms, cycadophytes, ginkgophytes and conifers resurfaced and diversified quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Philippe|last1= Moisan|first2= Sebastian|last2= Voigt|year= 2013|title= Lycopsids from the Madygen Lagerstätte (Middle to Late Triassic, Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia)|journal= Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology|volume= 192|pages= 42–64|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235759091_Lycopsids_from_the_Madygen_Lagersttte_(Middle_to_Late_Triassic_Kyrgyzstan_Central_Asia)|accessdate= 2015-03-20|doi=10.1016/j.revpalbo.2012.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[Lycopodiopsida|Club-mosses]] are ''homosporous'', but the genera ''[[Selaginella]]'' and ''[[Isoetes]]'' are ''heterosporous'', with female spores larger than the male, and gametophytes forming entirely within the spore walls. A few species of ''Selaginella'' such as ''[[Selaginella apoda|S.&amp;nbsp;apoda]]'' and ''[[Selaginella rupestris|S.&amp;nbsp;rupestris]]'' are also [[Viviparity|viviparous]]; the gametophyte develops on the mother plant, and only when the sporophyte's primary shoot and root is developed enough for independence is the new plant dropped to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.no/books?id=TGAW17pnUj0C&amp;pg=SA6-PA63&amp;dq=%22Fertilisation+takes+place+in-situ.+In+the+monosporic+species+like+S.+apus+S.+rupestris%22&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2v6jW3KPeAhXBDywKHaErA3YQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fertilisation%20takes%20place%20in-situ.%20In%20the%20monosporic%20species%20like%20S.%20apus%20S.%20rupestris%22&amp;f=false Cryptogams: Algae, Bryophyta and Pterldophyta]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Martian''' is a native inhabitant of the planet [[Mars]]. Although the search for evidence of [[life on Mars]] continues, many [[science fiction]] writers have imagined what [[extraterrestrial life]] on Mars might be like. Some writers also use the word ''Martian'' to describe a [[Colonization of Mars|human colonist on Mars]].

==Martians in fiction==
{{Further|Mars in fiction|History of science fiction}}

The earliest known instances of the word "Martian", used as a noun instead of an adjective, were printed in late 1877. They appeared nearly simultaneously in England and the United States, in magazine articles detailing [[Asaph Hall]]'s discovery of the [[moons of Mars]] in August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter Jensen|title=The World's First Martian|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-worlds-first-martians-and-first.html|website=Early Sports and Pop Culture Blog|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next event to inspire the use of the noun ''Martian'' in print was the [[International Exposition of Electricity]], which was hosted in Paris in the year 1881. During the four months of the exhibition, many people visited to witness such technological marvels as the [[incandescent light bulb]] and the [[telephone]]. One visitor came away wondering what kind of world such innovations might engender in the next 200 years. Writing anonymously, s/he assembled some speculations in an essay titled "The Year of Grace 2081", which enjoyed wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Peter Jensen |title=The Future as Seen from the Dawn of the Electrical Age |url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/03/the-future-as-seen-from-dawn-of.html |website=Early Sports 'n Pop-Culture Blog |access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Martians enter the story late in the narrative. During a rest from international conflict on Earth, humans begin telecommunicating with Martians. "After a brief period passed in the exchange of polite messages", says the essayist, humans will decide to war with the Martians on some pretence of honor. The war that results is cataclysmic:

{{Quote|[Humans] will unite all their energies for the fabrication of mammoth engines which will discharge oceans of water, metal and fire right into the face of Mars.  In return, the Martians will pelt them with [[aerolith]]s weighing three thousand tons, which will chip whole mountains off the [[Himalayas]] and make a big hole where [[Mont Blanc]] now exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcgcAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA382 |chapter=The Year of Grace 2081 |title=Truth: A Weekly Journal, Volume X (Nos. 236 to 260) |location=London |date=1881 |page=383 |access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[W. S. Lach-Szyrma]]'s novel ''[[Aleriel, or A Voyage to Other Worlds]]'' (1883) was previously reputed to be the first published work to apply the word ''Martian'' as a noun. The usage is incidental; it occurs when Aleriel, the novel's protagonist, lands on Mars in a spacecraft called an "ether-car" (an allusion to [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which was once postulated as a gaseous medium in [[outer space]]). Aleriel buries the car in snow "so that it might not be disturbed by any Martian who might come across it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.inkyfool.com/2010/09/wladyslaw-lach-szyrma-and-first-martian.html |date = 16 September 2010 |title = Wladyslaw Lach-Szyrma and the First Martian |first = Mark |last = Forsyth |website = The Inky Fool |accessdate = 4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:War of the Worlds original cover bw.jpg|thumb|''War of the Worlds'' reprinted in the August 1927 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Fifteen years after Aleriel, [[H. G. Wells]]' landmark novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) was published by [[William Heinemann, Ltd.]], then a relatively new publishing house. The novel was revised numerous times,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and has since been translated into many languages. In the story, the [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martians]] are a technologically advanced race of [[octopus]]-like [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrials]] who invade Earth because Mars is becoming too cold to sustain them. The Martians' undoing is a fatal vulnerability to Earth bacteria.

In his book ''Mars and Its Canals'' (1906), astronomer and businessman [[Percival Lowell]] conjectured that an extinct Martian race had once constructed a vast network of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] to channel water to their settlements from Mars' [[polar ice cap]]s, [[Planum Australe]] and [[Planum Boreum]]. Lowell did not invent this [[Martian canal]] hypothesis, but he supported it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] refuted Lowell's conjecture in his own book ''Is Mars Habitable?'' (1907), in which he argues that neither the [[atmosphere of Mars]] nor [[Climate of Mars|its climate]] could sustain life as we understand it.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that Mars had [[canal]]s was based on observations [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] made through his [[reflecting telescope]]. Although the telescope's image was fuzzy, Schiaparelli thought he saw long, straight lines on the Martian surface; some astronomers came to believe that these lines were structures built by Martians. This idea inspired Lowell, who returned to the subject in ''Mars As the Abode of Life'' (1910), in which he wrote a fanciful description of what this Martian society may have been like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html |title=Life on Mars |last=Caplinger |first=Michael |date=April 1995 |website=msss.com |publisher=[[Malin Space Science Systems]] |accessdate=4 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527182311/http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his description was based on almost no evidence, Lowell's words evoked vivid pictures in his readers' imaginations.

One of the people Lowell inspired was [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], who began writing his own story about Mars in the summer of 1911. The story is a [[planetary romance]] in which an [[American Civil War]] veteran named [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] is transported to Mars when he walks inside a cave on Earth. He finds that Mars is populated by two species of warring [[humanoid]]s, and he becomes embroiled in their conflict. In February 1912, an American [[pulp magazine]] called ''[[The All-Story]]'' published Burroughs' story as the first installment of a [[serial novel]], which the editor titled ''[[Under the Moons of Mars]]'' (retitled ''A Princess of Mars'' in subsequent editions). The book was the first in Burroughs' [[Barsoom]] series.

Although the noun ''Martian'' can describe any organism from Mars, these and later works typically imagine Martians as a humanoid monoculture. ''Martian'', in this sense, is more like the word ''human'' than the word ''[[Earthling]]''. (Few writers describe a [[biodiverse]] Mars.) In science fiction, Martians are stereotypically imagined in one or more of the following ways: as [[alien invader]]s; as humanoids with a civilization that resembles one on Earth; as [[anthropomorphic]] animals; as beings with superhuman abilities; as humanoids with a lower intelligence than humans; as human colonists who adopt a Martian identity; and/or as an extinct race who possessed high intelligence.

===Martians as invaders of Earth===
[[File:Landingsite statue.JPG|thumb|200px|The Martian Landing Site monument in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey|West Windsor]], [[New Jersey]] commemorates the 1938 broadcast of the radio drama ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'', in which West Windsor is the first landing site of the Martian invasion. Many listeners believed the broadcast to be a news report.]]
{{See also|Alien invasion}}

H. G. Wells' novel ''The War of the Worlds'' (1898) and its various adaptations have been an extraordinary influence on science fiction writers for more than 100 years. Wells' [[Martian (The War of the Worlds)|Martians]] are a technologically advanced species with an ancient civilization. They somewhat resemble [[cephalopod]]s, with large, bulky brown bodies and sixteen snake-like tentacles, in two groups of eight, around a quivering V-shaped mouth; they move around in 100 feet tall tripod fighting-machines they assemble upon landing, killing everything in their path. They invade Earth because Mars is dying, and they need a warmer planet to live. They attack cities in southern [[England]], including [[London]], with a deadly [[heat-ray]] they fire from a camera-like device on an articulated arm attached to their tripods; they also employ chemical warfare, using a poisonous "black smoke" launched from gun-like tubes. Mankind is saved by Earth bacteria, which kill the Martians within three weeks of their landing on Earth.

In ''[[Last and First Men]]'' (1930) [[Olaf Stapledon]] revisited Wells' theme of Martian invasion. ''Last and First Men'' summarizes tens of thousands of years of invasions and war between Martians and humans. Eventually, humans destroy the Martians' empire.

[[William Cameron Menzies]]' film ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1953) fuses the tentacles of Wells' Martians with the idea of [[little green men]] to conceive a Martian Mastermind who enslaves tall, green, humanoid mutants. [[Tobe Hooper]]'s remake of the film was released in 1986,

In his 1955 [[comic novel]] ''[[Martians, Go Home]]'', [[Fredric Brown]] spoofs the Wellsian invasion, and reinterprets the Martian invader as a rude house guest with ulterior motives. Brown, too, employs the "little green men" [[Trope (literature)|trope]] to describe his annoying Martians.

Little green men recur in the 2009 video game ''[[Stalin vs. Martians]]'', a spoof of earlier [[strategy video game]]s. As the president of the [[Soviet Union]], the player defends Earth from Martian invasion. This time the caricature of the Martians appears to be influenced by [[H. R. Giger]].

In ''[[Spaced Invaders]]'' (1990), a group of Martians invade a town in the [[Midwestern United States]] during a re-broadcast of the Orson Wells' [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|1938 radio dramatization of ''The War of the Worlds'']].

In 1948, [[Warner Bros.]] introduced a new villain to their animated films: [[Marvin the Martian]], a short, slender figure with comically oversized eyes, hands, and feet, but with no visible mouth. His big, spherical head is either completely black or overshadowed by his crested helmet. His clothing is patterned on that of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[god of war]] in [[Roman mythology]]. In Marvin's film debut, ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'' (1948), he attempts to blow up Earth because it "obscures [his] view of [[Venus]]", but is thwarted by [[Bugs Bunny]].

Another film that imagines Martians as ineffectual invaders is ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996), a [[black comedy]] based on a [[Topps]] [[trading card]] series. Here, the Martian invaders are loud, irritating, and dim-witted, despite having oversized heads with extremely large, protruding brains. The film was written by [[Jonathan Gems]], and directed by [[Tim Burton]].

In the ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' story "Black Magic on Mars" (1950),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |story=Black Magic on Mars |title=[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] |volume= |issue=62 |date=January 1950 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conception of Martians is more grave: The Martian invaders Superman faces are led by a dictator called Martler, who is an admirer of [[Adolf Hitler]].

In "[[Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?]]", a 1961 episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', Martians attempt to colonize Earth, but are thwarted by [[Venusians]]. Here, the Martians are disguised as humans, but towards the end of the episode we see that they have three eyes.

In ''Mars Needs Moms'' (2007), a [[picture book]] by [[Berkeley Breathed]], Martians are squat, humanoid beings with antennae and skin color that varies by individual. When they travel to Earth, they wear transparent helmets and a bulbous, ribbed outer garment. In the story, a five-year-old boy learns to appreciate his mother after three Martians kidnap her while he sleeps. Writer-director [[Simon Wells]] and his wife Wendy adapted the picture book into the film ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' (2011).

===Martians as civilized humanoids===
{{See also|Anthropocentrism|Eurocentrism}}

In April 1911, about a year before ''The All-Story'' published the first installment of Burroughs' ''Under the Moons of Mars'', ''[[Modern Electrics]]'' began publishing [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s own romance, ''[[Ralph 124C 41+]]'', which takes place on Earth. Gernsback's Martians live among the humans on Earth; they are taller and physically stronger than humans, with green skin and large eyes. The serial wasn't republished as a book until 1925.


1923 saw the publication of ''[[Aelita (novel)|Aelita, or The Decline of Mars]]'', a novel that is equally science fiction and [[political fiction]]. Its author, Soviet Russian writer [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy]], tells a story of a Soviet engineer who builds a rocket and invites an acquaintance to accompany him in it to Mars. There they find a humanoid race of Martians who are the offspring of both an elder Martian species and of humans from [[Atlantis]]. The Martians live in a [[class society]]; the workers rise up against the [[ruling class]], but the revolution fails. All the while, Mars is entering a phase of [[climate change]] that threatens disaster for the population.

''Red Planet'' (1932), a play cowritten by [[John L. Balderston]] and John Hoare, also deals with radical environmental change on Mars, except in this case it occurs through [[terraforming]]. Balderston was one of the few playwrights of the 20th century to adopt Mars or Martians as a subject for the stage. He was, however, also a screenwriter who specialized in [[fantasy film]] and [[horror film]]. Many years later, [[United Artists]] bought a screen adaptation that Balderston and fellow screenwriter [[Anthony Veiller]] wrote. [[Harry Horner]] directed the film, called ''[[Red Planet Mars]]'', and it was released to cinemas in 1952. In the film, a scientist communicates with Martians by radio, and they tell him that Mars is a utopia. When the news circulates, it causes widespread unrest among the people of Western nations. The US government tries to silence further messages, then later announces that the Martians have informed them that they must all worship [[God]] in order to save themselves. After millions of people revolt against their governments, it seems the Martian communiques may have been a hoax.

[[Ray Bradbury]]'s novel ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1950) depicts Martians as a refined and artistic race of golden-skinned beings who closely resemble humans. The Martians are almost completely wiped out by the diseases brought to Mars by human invaders. At the end of the book, the human inhabitants of Mars realize that they are the new Martians. The novel's themes and its portrayal of Martians resemble Bradbury's 1949 short story "[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]".

Brothers [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim Thomas]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] teamed with [[Graham Yost]] to write ''[[Mission to Mars]]'' (2000), a film that depicts Martians as tall, feminine, peaceful humanoids who left Mars to escape the havoc caused by a massive [[meteorite]] impact.

Edmond Hamilton's "A Conquest of Two Worlds" describes Martians as humanoid creatures with stilt-like limbs and large, bulging chests and heads. They live in tribal groups centered on oases and occasionally fight among themselves. After an accidental confrontation sparks war, they are all killed or enslaved by the invading human population.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Edmond. "A Conquest of Two Worlds" in ''Wonder Stories'', February 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martians as anthropomorphic animals===
{{See also|Anthropomorphism}}

[[C. S. Lewis]] wrote, in ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' (1938), about three humans who visit Mars and meet three different kinds of intelligent native creatures: The hrossa (bipedal "otter" men), the sorns/séroni (lean white giants), and the pfifltriggi (dwarves). They are dying out, but are resigned to their fate. The books also describe a prey animal called hnakra, which is hunted. The planet is ruled by the Oyarsa, an "eldil" (supernatural beings/spirits) whose job is to be the guardian of the planet and ruler of its peoples.

In four stories by [[Eric Frank Russell]] published between the early 1940s and mid-1950s—and collected in''[[Men, Martians and Machines]]'' (1955)—a crew of humans and octopoid Martians are shipmates and compatriots on an interstellar voyage. During their travels, they encounter hostile aliens. Russell's Martians can survive in Earth-normal air pressures, but are more comfortable wearing low-pressure helmets and tease their shipmates about the soupy conditions on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Eric Frank|title=Men, Martians and Machines|date=1958|publisher=Berkeley Medallion|location=New York, NY, USA|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a writer for ''[[Doctor Who]]'', [[Brian Hayles]] created a Martian species of [[reptilian humanoid]]s called the [[Ice Warrior]]s, who move stiffly and speak in a husky whisper. Most of the Ice Warriors that the Doctor encounters are brutish and belligerent. As Mars' climate becomes less favorable to sustaining them, the Ice Warriors seek a new planet.  These reptilians debuted in ''[[The Ice Warriors]]'' (1967), a ''Doctor Who'' television serial about an impending [[ice age]] in Earth's future. As British scientists try to slow or avert a glacier encroaching on Great Britain, they find an Ice Warrior near their base, frozen in the glacier, and apparently in [[suspended animation]]. No one knows the being's identity, but they understand that it is probably from another planet. When the Ice Warrior revives, he attacks [[Jamie McCrimmon]] and kidnaps [[Victoria Waterfield]]. Other stories set in the future show the Martians eventually become more peaceful and are members of the Galactic Federation, though some want to return to their warlike ways.

===Human colonists as Martians===
{{See also|Colonization of Mars|Colonialism|Cultural hegemony}}

Many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s Martian characters are humans born and raised on Mars. In ''[[Red Planet (novel)|Red Planet]]'' (1949), boys attend a [[boarding school]] in a human colony on Mars. A population of native Martians tolerates them until the colony administrator threatens a Martian child. The Martians demand that the humans leave Mars, but a human doctor convinces them to reconsider.

In Heinlein's 1956 novel ''[[Double Star]]'', humans have colonized the solar system, and a politician on Mars faces the [[civil rights]] issue of granting a native Martian species (who are [[second-class citizen]]s) the [[right to vote]].

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Martian Time-Slip]]'' (1964), a human colony on Mars is trying to cope with arduous environmental conditions. They treat an aboriginal race, whom they call "Bleekmen", with casual racism. In ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' (1965), Mars has no indigenous life. To cope with the sterile habitat, the human colonists abuse drugs such as "Can-D" and "Chew-Z".

Dick previously published a shorter version of the story in 1963, called ''All We Marsmen''. Like Heinlein's ''Double Star'', ''All We Marsmen'' was conceived at a time in US history when many marginalized people were fighting especially vehemently for more civil rights. US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] into law on 2 July 1964.{{ref|a|1}}

''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990) is a science fiction [[action film]] about an apparently unsophisticated [[construction worker]] who turns out to be a [[freedom fighter]] from Mars who has been relocated to Earth. He later learns of an alien artifact that proves Mars harbored life before the human colonization.

The character designers for ''[[Futurama]]'', a comical American [[animated series]], imagine Mars after human colonization as being like the [[American frontier]]; native Martians inhabit zones analogous to [[Indian reservation]]s. One of the series principal characters, [[Amy Wong]], is a scientist of Chinese descent who was born on Mars. Her parents have amassed an enormous fortune and enterprise there.

Rebecca Bloomer's novel ''Unearthed'' (2011), the first in a series, describes a futuristic human colony on Mars amidst the populations of native Martians.

===Martians as an extinct race===
[[File:Mars Hubble.jpg|200px|thumb|A photograph of Mars captured by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] on 26 June 2001]]

For his [[Known Space]] series of novels, [[Larry Niven]] conceived humanoid Martians with a primitive [[material culture]] who inhabit an environment of red dust and [[nitric acid]], and for whom water is lethal. In the 1973 novel ''[[Protector (novel)|Protector]]'', a man named Jack Brennan allies himself with a ruthless, xenophobic humanoid species called the [[Pak Protector|Pak]]. To preclude the possibility future competition for Pak offspring, Brennan engineers a Martian [[genocide]] by sending an ice-covered asteroid to collide with Mars.

In [[Dennis Feltham Jones]]' 1977 novel ''[[Colossus and the Crab]]'', Martian life predated life on Earth, but faced a process of devolution as conditions on the planet worsened.

''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958–59) is a British television serial in which a crashed spacecraft is discovered in London. The wreck evidences that the human population of Earth resulted from the experiments of a Martian civilisation, now long dead. A film remake was released in 1967.

''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' (2001) human invaders war with Martians in an attempt to conquer Mars.

In the ''[[Invader Zim]]'' episode "Battle of the Planets" (2001), Zim discovers that a Martian race died off after converting Mars into a giant spacecraft.

In ''[[Doom 3]]'' (2004), the entire Martian race sacrificed itself many millennia ago in order to prevent a [[demonic]] invasion of our universe. By the year 2145, humanity has [[Colonization of Mars|colonized Mars]] and begun excavating the ruins of their civilization, recovering several important artifacts. One of these artifacts—known as the Soul Cube—is [[Doomguy|the player's]] most valuable tool in combating a second demonic invasion, as it is the only weapon capable of killing the [[Cyberdemon]].

===Martians as superbeings===
[[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[David Starr, Space Ranger]]'', the first novel in the Lucky Starr series, features a race of Martians who have retreated into vast artificial underground caverns half a million years ago. These Martians are incorporeal, telepathic beings, peaceful yet curious about humanity. They have access to advanced technologies completely incomprehensible to human beings, like personal energy shield generators the size of a fabric mask.

In Robert Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961), a man raised by native Martians emigrates to Earth, where he must reacclimate. In the novel he functions as a [[Christ figure]]. Soon he demonstrates psychic powers, superhuman intelligence, and an ability to manipulate higher dimensions. He founds a church on Earth based on Martian philosophy, and starts a cultural shift. At the novel's climax, he is murdered by a mob from a rival religious group.

In 1963, American television network [[CBS]] premiered a [[sitcom]] called ''[[My Favorite Martian]]''. The series proved popular in the US, especially during the first season, and CBS broadcast more than one hundred episodes before canceling it when the third season ended in 1966. In this comedy, a Martian anthropologist (who passes for human in most respects) crashes on Earth, where he is harbored by an American man who keeps the Martian's identity secret. Also secret are the Martian's extraordinary abilities, not the least of which are invisibility and [[telepathy]]. CBS's rival networks, [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], did not fail to notice the success of ''My Favorite Martian'', or the comic potential of a character with secret powers. In 1964, ABC introduced ''[[Bewitched]]'' (a sitcom about a married, suburban witch), and NBC countered the following year with ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', a sitcom about an [[astronaut]] who discovers and marries a [[Genie in popular culture|genie]].

In ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' (1967–68), the [[Mysteron]]s are a race of invisible superbeings from Mars who are at war with humans from Earth. The conflict begins when [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]], a human officer investigating radio signals from Mars, mistakes a [[surveillance camera]] for a weapon. In violation of his orders, he attacks, but the Mysterons immediately repair the damage he caused. The conflict escalates, and the Mysterons attempt to assassinate the president of Earth.

[[DC Comics]] introduced the first Martian [[superhero]] to the [[DC Universe]] in 1955. [[Martian Manhunter]] (J'onn J'onzz), a green humanoid who is believed to be the last of the peaceful Green Martians, joins the [[Justice League]]. Meanwhile, the warlike, shapeshifting [[White Martians]] regard the Green Martians as enemies. The White Martians adopt a humanoid form which, they say, expresses their distinctive philosophy. DC introduced a White Martian superhero, [[Miss Martian]], in 2006. A third race, the [[List of DC Comics races#Y|Yellow Martians]], may or may not have survived as long as the Green and White Martians.

'''MoneyBee''' was a [[distributed computing]] project in the fields of [[economics]], [[finance]] and [[stock market]]s, that generated stock forecasts by application of [[artificial intelligence]] with the aid of [[artificial neural networks]]. MoneyBee acted as a screensaver. The project was run by i42 Informationsmanagement GmbH, a consulting private company from [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]].  The project was suspended with a standing invitation for any interested in joining the MoneyBee2 project, but MoneyBee2 seems to have been abandoned in early 2010.

==History==
The idea was first conceived in an economics thesis on stock forecasts with the aid of artificial neural networks at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. The MoneyBee system was then developed by i42 GmbH, Mannheim, who added some innovative features to the original idea.

Since starting in September 2000, many users downloaded the German version. By 2001, about 12,000 users were generating 0.1 [[Teraflops]] of computing capacity – comparable to an average [[university]] [[mainframe computer]] at the time.

'''Pelinor''' was a [[Guanches|Guanche]] [[mencey]] king of [[Menceyato de Adeje]] at the time of the conquest of [[Tenerife]] in the fifteenth century.

Alongside the menceyes of [[Menceyato de Abona|Abona]] and [[Menceyato de Güímar|Güímar]], Pelinor negotiated peace around 1490 with [[Pedro de Vera]], Governor of [[Gran Canaria]], ratifying a treaty with [[Alonso Fernández de Lugo]] at the beginning of the conquest in 1494. Once the war ended, Pelinor was the only mencey not brought to the Peninsula to be presented to the [[Catholic Monarchs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44128/rec/1 La Conquista de Tenerife (1494-1496)]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mencey who actively supported the conquerors in the peace negotiations, he was amply rewarded by the new authorities. He received the entire  ''Valle de Masca'' (Masca Valley), 30 acres of land with water on the "''Río de Chasna''" (''Valle de San Lorenzo'') and another 100 acres in the ''Valle de Santiago'' - both pieces of land in the former domains of Adeje. Also, his family was granted a coat of arms.

However, this condition of peace Guanche not fought injustices suffered by the conquerors.

Pelinor died around 1505.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7155">'''Post-stroke depression''' (PSD) is considered the most frequent and important neuropsychiatric consequence of [[stroke]]. Approximately one-third of stroke survivors experience [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]]. Moreover, this condition can have an adverse effect on [[cognitive function]], functional recovery and survival.

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] (DSM) IV  categorizes post-stroke depression as “mood disorder due to a general medical condition” (i.e. stroke) with the specifiers of depressive features, major depressive-like episodes, [[mania|manic]] features, or mixed features. Utilizing patient data from acute hospital admission, community surveys, or out patient clinics previous studies have identified two types of [[depressive disorder]]s associated with cerebral [[ischemia]]: [[major depression]], which occurs in up to 25% of patients; and [[minor depression]], which has been defined for research purposes by DSM-IV criteria as a [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]] or loss of interest and at least two but fewer than four symptoms of major depression. Minor depression occurs in up to 30% of patients following stroke.

Prevalence clearly varies over time with an apparent peak 3–6 months after stroke and subsequent decline in prevalence at one-year reaches about to 50% of initial rates. Robinson and colleagues characterized the natural course of major depression after stroke with spontaneous remission typically 1 to 2 years after stroke  However, it was also noted that in few cases depression becomes chronic and may persist more than 3 years following stroke . On the other hand, minor depression appeared to be more variable, with both short term and long term depression occurring in these patients .

Post-stroke depression is highly prevalent among both men and women post-stroke, however, it appears that post-stoke depression is more common in women when prevalence is compared between the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Poynter, B., Shuman, M., Diaz-Granados, N., Kapral, M., Grace, S. L., P.H.D., &amp; Stewart, Donna F, M.D., F.R.C.P.C. (2009). Sex differences in the prevalence of post-stroke depression: A systematic review. Psychosomatics, 50(6), 563-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were twice as likely to experience post-stroke depression than men. It is hypothesized, based on CT scanning, that of the two sexes experiencing post-stroke depression, women who had post-stroke depression had a higher rate of left hemisphere lesions than men.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;Paradiso, S. &amp; Robinson, R. (1998). Gender Differences in Poststroke Depression. The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 10, 41-47&lt;/ref&gt; However, risk of post-stroke depression can not be determined effectively based on the location of the lesion in the brain and more research in this area is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, A.J. et al. (2000). Depression after stroke and lesion location: a systematic review. The Lancet, 356(9224),  122-126&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been postulated that the risk of developing post-stroke depression in male patients is partly linked to having a high level of limitations and disability in functioning, especially in performing [[activities of daily living]] (ADL's), as a result of their stroke; the greater the limitation, the greater the severity.&lt;ref name="para" /&gt; Risk of developing depression post-stroke in women is partly linked to a history of psychological disorders as well as limitations involving cognition as a result of their stroke.&lt;ref name="para" /&gt;

The scientific community is divided into two “camps” supporting opposing views: some propose a primary biological mechanism with stroke affecting neural circuits involved in mood regulation which in turn causes post-stroke depression, while other researchers claim that post stroke depression is caused by social and psychological stressors that emerge as a result of stroke.

While an integrated [[Biopsychosocial model|bio-psycho-social model]] including both biological and [[psychosocial]] aspects of post stroke depression seems warranted, a number of studies clearly suggest that biological mechanisms play a major role in the development of post stroke depression.

#stroke patients show a higher rate of depression compared to [[orthopedic]] patients with disabilities of comparable severity.
#Several studies proposed an association with specific [[lesion]]s (left anterior and [[basal ganglia]] lesions and lesions close to [[frontal pole]]) and occurrence of post stroke depression.
#Some studies reported an association between post-stroke mania and right orbital frontal, basotemporal, basal ganglia lesions.
#It has been shown that patients with [[anosognosia]] who are unaware of their disability still develop post stroke depression.

Despite this evidence, the association of post-stroke depression to specific brain lesions is still vague and needs replication from various independent groups. Furthermore, the cause of post stroke depression at a functional level is not clear.

The only biological model was proposed by Robinson and co-workers: They hypothesized that the depletion of [[monoamine]]rgic [[amine]]s occurring after stroke play a role in post stroke-depression. They point out that [[norepinephrine]]rgic and [[serotonin|serotonergic]] nuclei send projections to the [[frontal cortex]] and arc posteriorly, running through the deep layers of the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]], where they arborize and send terminal projections into the superficial cortical layers. These norepinephrinergic and serotoninergic pathways are disrupted in [[basal ganglia]] and [[frontal lobe]] [[lesion]]s – sites that are shown to be associated with post stroke depression.

However, this model is far from being universally accepted and there are serious objections both to their model and findings showing the association between post-stroke depression and lesion sites.

Depression-like behaviors are demonstrated in a mouse model of cortical intracerebral hemorrhage.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, W. et al. (2014). Mouse models of intracerebral hemorrhage in ventricle, cortex, and hippocampus by injections of autologous blood or collagenase. PLoS One, 9(5), e97423&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11931">'''Posthumous sperm retrieval''' ('''PSR''') is a procedure in which [[Semen extraction|spermatozoa are extracted]] from a man after he has been pronounced legally [[brain death|brain dead]]. There has been significant debate over the ethicality and legality of the procedure, and on the [[legal rights]] of the child and surviving parent if the [[gamete]]s are used for [[pregnancy|impregnation]].&lt;ref name="Orr"&gt;Orr, RD; Siegler, M (2002) Is posthumous semen retrieval ethically permissible? ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics|J Med Ethics]] 2002;'''28''':299–302''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases of post-mortem conception have occurred ever since human [[artificial insemination]] techniques were first developed, with sperm donated to a [[sperm bank]] being used following the death of the donor. While religious arguments have been brought against the process even under these circumstances, far more censure has arisen from a number of quarters with regards to [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] retrieval from fresh [[cadaver]]s or patients either on [[life support]] or in a [[persistent vegetative state]], particularly when the procedure is carried out without explicit consent from the donor.

==Procedure==
[[Image:Icsi.JPG|right|thumb|[[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]], the most common method of fertilisation using posthumously extracted sperm.]]
The first successful retrieval of sperm from a cadaver was reported in 1980, in a case involving a 30-year-old man who became brain dead following a motor vehicle accident and whose family requested sperm preservation.&lt;ref name="Rothman"&gt;Rothman, CM (1980) "A method for obtaining viable sperm in the postmortem state." ''[[Fertility and Sterility|Fertil. Steril.]] 1980;'''34'''(5):512.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first successful conception using sperm retrieved post-mortem was reported in 1998, leading to a successful birth the following year.&lt;ref name="Strong"&gt;Strong, C; Gingrich, JR; Kutteh, WH (2000), "Ethics of sperm retrieval after death or persistent vegetative state," ''[[Human Reproduction]] 2000;'''15'''(4):739–745''&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, a number of requests for the procedure have been made, with around one third approved and performed.&lt;ref name="Orr"/&gt; Gametes have been extracted through a variety of means, including removal of the [[epididymis]], [[irrigation]] or [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspiration]] of the [[vas deferens]], and rectal probe [[electroejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Strong"/&gt; Since the procedure is rarely performed, studies on the efficacy of the various methods have been fairly limited in scope. 

While [[medical literature]] recommends that extraction take place no later than 24&amp;nbsp;hours after death, [[motility|motile]] sperm has been successfully obtained as late as 36&amp;nbsp;hours after death, generally regardless of the [[cause of death]] or method of extraction. Up to this limit, the procedure has a high success rate, with sperm retrieved in nearly 100% of cases, and motile sperm in 80–90%.&lt;ref name="Shefi"&gt;Shefi S et al. (2006) "Posthumous sperm retrieval: Analysis of time interval to harvest sperm", ''Human Reproduction 2006;'''21'''(11):2890–2893''&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently little precedent for successful insemination using sperm harvested after 36 hours. New technologies are being researched that could make this a routine reality, in turn creating new ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anorkey.com/when-is-posthumous-sperm-retrieval-ethically-permissible-and-what-are-the-ethical-implications-of-conceiving-a-child-this-way/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505010854/http://anorkey.com/when-is-posthumous-sperm-retrieval-ethically-permissible-and-what-are-the-ethical-implications-of-conceiving-a-child-this-way/ |archivedate=2013-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the sperm is viable, fertilisation is generally achieved through [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]], a form of [[in vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilisation]]. The success rate of ''in vitro'' fertilisation remains unchanged regardless of whether the sperm was retrieved from a living or dead donor.&lt;ref name="Shefi"/&gt;

==Legality==

The legality of posthumous sperm extraction varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, legislation falls into one of three camps: a full ban, a requirement of written consent from the donor, or implied consent obtained from the family.

===Areas with full bans===
Following the 1984 [[Parpalaix case]] in [[France]], in which the widow of deceased [[cancer]] patient Alain Parpalaix obtained permission from the courts to be inseminated with her husband's spermatozoa after his death, the [[Centre d’Etude et de Conservation du Sperme Humain]] (Center for the Study and Preservation of Human Sperm) petitioned the courts successfully for a full ban on posthumous insemination,&lt;ref name="Bahadur"&gt;Bahadur, G (2002) "Death and conception", ''Human Reproduction Oct 2002;'''17'''(10):2769–2775&lt;/ref&gt; in line with the country's ban on ''in vitro'' fertilisation for post-[[menopause|menopausal]] women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/05/30/france.mom/index.html "62-year-old woman gives birth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810194540/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/05/30/france.mom/index.html |date=2007-08-10 }}, [[CNN]], May 30, 2001. Retrieved June 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar legislation exists in [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Canada]] and the [[Australia]]n states of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]]&lt;ref name="Bahadur"/&gt; and [[Taiwan]].

===Areas requiring written consent===
Guidelines outlining the legal use of posthumously extracted [[gamete]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] were laid out in the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. The Act dictates that explicit written consent by the donor must be provided to the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]] in order for extraction and fertilisation to take place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900037_en_1.htm Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (c. 37)], specifically [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900037_en_5.htm#sdiv3 Schedule&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;Paragraph&amp;nbsp;5]&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the 1997 case of ''[[Regina v. Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]]'', the terms of the Act were extended to [[coma]]tose patients, and so theoretically [[assault]] charges could be (but in this case were not) brought against doctors for overseeing or performing the procedure.&lt;ref name="Bahadur"/&gt;

There are few other jurisdictions that fall into this category. [[New York State Senate|New York senator]] [[Roy M. Goodman]] proposed a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] in 1997 requiring written consent by the donor in 1998, but it was never passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15721263.600-life-after-death--new-york-state-moves-to-keep-dead-mens-sperm-in-the-family.html "Life after death – New York state moves to keep dead men's sperm in the family"]; Cohen, Philip; ''[[New Scientist]]'' (21 March 1998. Retrieved 28 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Areas requiring implied consent===
In 2003, [[Israel]]i [[Attorney General]] [[Elyakim Rubinstein]] published several guidelines outlining the legal situation of  posthumous sperm retrieval for the purpose of later insemination by a surviving female partner. The guidelines specified firstly that only requests by a partner (married or otherwise) of the deceased would be honoured – requests by other members of the donor's family would be flatly denied. While extraction of the sperm was guaranteed following a request by the partner, permission to use the sperm was to be determined case by case, a court of law deciding on the basis of the effect on the presumed wishes of the donor, and the effect of the procedure on the donor's dignity. If it could be demonstrated that the deceased took definite steps towards parenthood (implied consent), use of extracted sperm by the female partner would generally be permitted.&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;Landau, R (2004) "Posthumous sperm retrieval for the purpose of later insemination or IVF in Israel: an ethical and psychosocial critique", ''Human Reproduction  2004 19(9):1952–1956''&lt;/ref&gt;

===No legislation===
Many other countries, including [[Belgium]] and the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Bahadur"/&gt; have no specific legislation regarding the rights of men on gamete donation following their death, leaving the decision in the hands of individual [[clinic]]s and [[hospital]]s. As such, many medical institutions in such countries institute in-house policies regarding circumstances in which the procedure would be performed.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;See [http://www.cornellurology.com/uro/cornell/guidelines.shtml guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816154338/http://www.cornellurology.com/uro/cornell/guidelines.shtml |date=2007-08-16 }} provided by [[Cornell University]] to various [[New York (state)|New York]] hospitals for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
There are several ethical issues surrounding the extraction and use of gametes from cadavers or patients in a [[persistent vegetative state]]. The most debated are those concerning religion, consent, and the rights of the surviving partner and child if the procedure results in a birth.

A number of major religions view posthumous sperm retrieval in a negative light, including [[Roman Catholicism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19870222_respect-for-human-life_en.html Instruction on respect for human life in its origin and on the dignity of procreation], [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], February 22, 1987. Retrieved June 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref name="Jude"&gt;Grazi, R V; Wolowelsky J B. (1995) "The Use of Cryopreserved Sperm and Pre-embryos In Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics",  ''Assisted Reproductive Technology-Andrology, 8:53–61''&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholicism proscribes the procedure on much the same grounds as ''in vitro'' fertilisation, namely the rights of the unborn. Judaic strictures are based on the [[Halakha|halakhic]] prohibition on deriving personal benefit from a corpse, and in the case of those in a persistent vegetative state, their categorisation as ''gosses'' (dying person) prohibits anyone from touching or moving them for anything that does not relate to their immediate care.&lt;ref name="Jude"/&gt;

Consent of the donor is a further ethical barrier. Even in jurisdictions where implicit consent is not required, there are occasions in which clinicians have refused to perform the procedure on these grounds.&lt;ref name="Cornell"/&gt; If no proof of consent by the donor can be produced, implied consent, often in the form of prior actions, must be evident for clinicians to proceed with the extraction. Sperm retrieval is rarely carried out if there is evidence that the deceased clearly objected to the procedure prior to his death.

Finally, if the procedure is performed and results in a birth, there are several issues involving the legal rights of the child and its mother. Because posthumous insemination can take place months or even years after the father's death, it can in some cases be difficult to prove the paternity of the child. As such, [[inheritance]] and even the legal rights of the child to marry (due to the possibility of [[consanguinity]] between partners) can be affected. For this reason, several countries, including [[Israel]] and the [[United Kingdom]], impose a maximum term for the use of extracted sperm, after which the father will not be legally recognised on the child's [[birth certificate]].&lt;ref name="Bahadur"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Landau"/&gt;

[[File:Helena Roerich (V. Serov).jpg|thumb|left|240 px|&lt;center&gt;Helena Roerich. 1909. &lt;br /&gt;[[Valentin Serov]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Helena Roerich (1879–1955) was a Russian theosophist, writer, and [[public figure]]. In the 20th century, she created, in cooperation with the Teachers of the East ([[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]), a philosophic teaching of ''Living Ethics'' ([[Agni Yoga]]).

Helena was born in the family of [[:ru:Шапошников, Иван Иванович (архитектор)|Ivan Shaposhnikov]], a well-known [[Saint-Petersburg]] architect. Helena's mother, belonged to an ancient [[:ru:Голенищев-Кутузов|Golenischev-Kutuzov]] family, which originated from [[Novgorod]] at the end of the 13th century. Significant members of this family included  [[knyaz]] [[Mikhail Kutuzov]], [[field marshal]] of the [[Russian Empire]]; [[Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov]], poet of the end of 19th century; [[Ilya Golenishchev-Kutuzov]], philologist, poet; and [[Modest Mussorgsky]], well-known composer. It was a nobiliary family distinguished not only for its [[nobility]] but for its cultural traditions too. Helena was in frequent communication with the artists and scientists of the era, such as [[Vladimir Bekhterev]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Sergei Diaghilev]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Vladimir Stasov]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and  [[Mikhail Vrubel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Roerich (born Shaposhnikova) Helena Ivanovna // New philosophical encyclopedia |year=2000 |location=Moscow |publisher=[[:ru:Мысль (московское издательство)|Misl]] |url= |language=Russian |volume=1-4 |pages= |isbn= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}

In 1901 Helena married Nicholas Roerich. Since that time they were inseparable on life and spiritual-creative paths. She became his companion-in-arms in all his public and cultural undertakings. The Agni Yoga Society was founded by Nicholas and Helena in 1920 in the United States. It is a non-profit educational institution incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.&lt;ref name="AY"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_info.html |title=Agni Yoga Society |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=6 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6p2NfrZqP |archivedate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with her husband she participated in the heroical [[transhimalaya]]n expedition (1924–1928). After the Roerich family settled in [[Kullu Valley]] in Himalayas there was established the [[George de Roerich#Himalayan Research Institute|Himalayan Institute of the Scientific Studies]] and its honorary president — the foundress was Helena Roerich.&lt;ref name="DevikaRani"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.kar.nic.in/helena_roerich.htm |title=Helena Ivanovna Roerich |publisher=Roerich &amp; DevikaRani Roerich Estate Board, Karnataka Govt, India |date= |accessdate=10 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6l9jd6CpZ |archivedate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The years of life in India were the time of the most intensive work of Helena. Here she completed a major part of books of Agni Yoga series. There were published 14 volumes of that series. On title pages of the volumes there is no name of the author since Helena Roerich considered that the sacred wisdom stated there can not be the author's property. She considered herself an author of three books only. They were published under different pen-names: "The Foundations of Buddhism" (1927), "The Cryptograms of the East" (1929), "The Banner of the [[Sergius of Radonezh|Reverent Sergius]]" (1934). Besides, she maintained very active correspondence with many people from Europe, Asia and America. Two volumes of her letters (''Letters of Helena Roerich''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-I.php |title=Letters of Helena Roerich.

Helena also did the translations. She translated into Russian the extracts from the book ''[[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett]]'' (''The Chalice of the East'') and also two volumes of ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' by [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref name="DevikaRani"/&gt;

Nicholas Roerich (1874–1947) was a Russian painter, writer, [[archaeologist]], [[theosophist]], philosopher, [[public figure]]. He is perceived by some people as a [[Teacher#Spiritual teacher|spiritual teacher]] and [[guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skumin |first1=V.

He studied at the [[Karl May School]], at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], and at [[St. Petersburg University]] from 1893–1898, simultaneously at the Law University as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.icr.su/node/145 |title=ПЛАНЕТА "РЕРИХ |work=Электронная библиотека Международного Центра Рерихов |publisher=icr.su |accessdate=17 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmdLczGF|archivedate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,"From 1890s, I saw accurate symbolisms of their people's morals shown in the main directions of philosophy, cultural memorials, monuments, literature and religions from ancient India, China, Tibet and [[Mongolian culture]]." For 42 years Roerich lived in Russia, in India for 20 years, US for 3 years, Finland for 2 years, France for 1 year, England for 1 year, China for 2 years, Tibet for half a year and Mongolia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pURmGVLlhk |title=The Story of the Roerich Mongolia House |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 7–8 months. Roerich twice toured through Central and Eastern Asia, in 1924 and 1934, and following his travels in Mongolia's [[Gobi]] and [[Altai Mountains]] and the [[Himalayan Mountains]], wrote the books "Heart of Asia" and "Altai-Himalaya". An important roles for humankind to coexist peacefully, together with well-known international figures ([[Einstein]], [[Tagore]]), initiated the Roerich Pact during World War II for the purpose of protecting world cultural values. Roerich's paintings, so attractive with their combinations of colours, amazing symbols, and secrets, depict hidden ideas and deep meanings. Roerich, knowing the Buddha legend, well toured through the Indian and Tibetan mountains looking for legendary [[Shambhala]]. The Roerichs are also famous for introducing Shambhala in [[Buddhism|Buddhist teachings]] in [[western countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Batbayar S. |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/4786 |title=Russian Scientist Roerich and Mongolia  |publisher=Canada Tibet Committee News |date=27 November 2008  |accessdate=17 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j1781OIv |archivedate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When I think of Nicholas Roerich I am astounded at the scope and abundance of his activities and creative genius. A great artist, a great scholar and writer, archaeologist and explorer, he touched and lighted up so many aspects of human endeavour. The very quantity is stupendous – thousands of paintings and each one of them a great work of art. When you look at these paintings, so many of them of the Himalayas, you seem to catch the spirit of those great mountains which have towered over the Indian plain and been our sentinels for ages past. They remind us of so much in our history, our thought, our cultural and spiritual heritage so much not merely of the India of the past but of something that is permanent and eternal about India, that we cannot help feeling a great sense of indebtedness to Nicholas Roerich who has enshrined that spirit in these magnificent canvases.}}

===Roerich's sons===
{{Main|George de Roerich |Svetoslav Roerich}} 
Nicholas and Helena had two children. In August 1902 their eldest son, George, was born in [[Okulovka (town), Novgorod Oblast|Okulovka]], [[Novgorod Oblast]]. After finishing his studies at [[Karl May School]], he entered the Indian and Iranian department of Oriental Languages at [[London University]] in 1918. Under Indologist Professor [[Edward Denison Ross]] he studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Natalia R.

His return and acquisition of Soviet citizenship was courageous as the USSR's opinion of his family was rather distorted. Because of his effort, bans were lifted on everything associated with the Rerikhism and the legacy of research left by the family was preserved. The first of Nicholas Roerich's exhibitions was organized in [[Moscow]] in 1958, then spread to [[Leningrad]], [[Riga]], [[Kiev]], [[Tbilisi]], and other cities. He was able to dispel myths about the family's philosophy of [[Agni Yoga]] and start a cultural movement using this philosophy to spread [[Living Ethics]] in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icr.su/family/gnr/02.php |title=George Roerich |publisher=International Centre of the Roerichs |accessdate=14 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6l9vt9Cqs |archivedate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; George died on 21 May 1960, and his ashes were placed in Moscow, at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

Their younger son, Svetoslav, was born on 23 October 1904, in St.Petersburg. In 1914-1916 he studied at the [[Karl May School]]. Since 1920 he lived in the United States. Svetoslav entered the [[Columbia University]], the department of architecture which he graduated with a bachelor's degree. Since 1923 he was a director of the International Centre of Art "Corona Mundi" in New York which was founded by Nicholas Roerich. In 1928 Svetoslav moved from USA to India ([[Darjiling]]) to his family. Studying the [[Culture of India|culture]], [[Indian art|art]] and [[Indian philosophy|philosophy of India]] he created many wonderful paintings. Together with landscapes he painted many portraits. The portraits of Nicholas Roerich, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Devika Rani]] - Svetoslav's wife, must be specially marked. One of the most beautiful ones is a portrait of his mother Helena Roerich, the woman of exceptional spiritual and physical beauty. Svetoslav headed the department of [[folk art]] and [[pharmacopoeia]] at the [[George de Roerich#Himalayan Research Institute|Institute of Himalayan Studies "Urusvati"]]. In 1989 up to the initiative of Svetoslav in the USSR was established the Soviet Foundation of the Roerichs at the base of which there were studies and spreading of the ideas of Agni Yoga. In 1991 he granted the Foundation  with the archives of his parents and his eldest brother which were kept in India before. On 30 January 1993, Svetoslav passed away in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.kar.nic.in/svetoslav_roerich.htm |title=Svetoslav Roerich |publisher=Roerich &amp; DevikaRani Roerich Estate Board, Karnataka Govt, India |accessdate=10 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6l9wN13r5 |archivedate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20041024/spectrum/main4.htm |title=Svetoslav Roerich.

===Agni Yoga as the spiritual foundation of Rerikhism===
{{Main|Agni Yoga}}
Agni Yoga is a religious doctrine transmitted by the Helena and Nicholas Roerichs from 1920. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], the [[guru]] of [[Helena Roerich]] and [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]]. In the sixteen volumes of the Teaching of Living Ethics that have been translated into English from the original Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.found-helenaroerich.ru/eng/bibliography/|title=Bibliography|publisher=found-helenaroerich.ru |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j18MY7yT |archivedate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the letters of Helena Roerich, the Agni Yoga teaching is also referred to as the Teaching of [[Living Ethics]], the Teaching of Life, the Teaching of Light, or simply as the Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last2=Aunovsky |first2=O. K. |last1=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first1=V. A. |year=1995 |script-title=ru: Светоносцы (о семье Рерихов)|trans-title=The Bringers of the Light (The story of the Roerich family). |location=[[Novocheboksarsk]] |publisher=TEROS |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/svet.html|isbn=5-88167-004-3 |language=Russian |accessdate=10 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1503952231274856&amp;date=%400&amp;fromform=1 |archivedate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being based on the ancient knowledge of the East and the achievements of modern science in the West, [[Agni Yoga]] concerns peculiarities of cosmic evolution of humanity and creates a new system of its perception. The Teaching pays particular attention to the Cosmic Laws that determine the motion of planets and growth of natural structures, birth of stars, and also human behavior and the development of [[Universe]]. The authors of the Teaching state that these Laws influence the historic and social processes in human life and unless the [[Human nature|humanity]] realizes this the life can't be improved. According to Agni Yoga, Universe is the immense spiritual-energy system in which a man plays the most important role. The [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|moral perfection]], strict observance of ethical laws and comprehension of key factor of Culture in the development of human society are basic principles of spiritual and historical development of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first1=V.

A man, according to the Teaching, influences the Cosmic processes greatly. Particular attention is paid to the consciousness of a man and the culture of thinking, as thought is energy, capable of filling space and effecting its surroundings. A man is directly responsible for the quality of his thoughts, words, and deeds, because not only his spiritual and physical health depend on them, but also the condition of the entire planet. Calling people to live in accordance with Cosmic Laws, the Agni Yoga opens unlimited possibilities for the [[Spiritual evolution|spiritual transformation]] of life, the expansion of consciousness, and the acquirement of high [[Moral disengagement|moral standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.found-helenaroerich.ru/eng/biography/ |title=Helena I.

===The Agni Yoga Society===
[[File:Roerich-Museum-1929.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Master Building]], 1929 view]]
The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incorporated in 1946 under the laws of the [[State of New York]], and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific. Unlike previous [[yoga]]s, Agni Yoga is a path not of physical disciplines, [[meditation]], or [[asceticism]]—but of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. It affirms the existence of the Hierarchy of Light and the center of the Heart as the link with the Hierarchy and with the far-off worlds. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, Agni Yoga is a Teaching that helps the discerning student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the [[common good]]. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a "living ethic." Speaking about the individual's role in human [[spiritual evolution]],  Helena Roerich wrote, "The greatest benefit that we can contribute consists in the broadening of consciousness, and the improvement and enrichment of our thinking, which, together with the purification of the heart, strengthens our emanations. And thus, raising our vibrations, we restore the health of all that surrounds us."&lt;ref name="AY"/&gt;

[[File:WTM3 The Fixers 0015.jpg |thumb |190px |left |[[Nicholas Roerich Museum]]]]
The Master Institute of United Arts came into being in 1920 as the Master School of United Arts. It struggled to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] to a mansion he bought on the site where the Master Building would later be constructed.

The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace movement grew rapidly during the early nineteen-thirties, with centers in a number of countries. There were three international conferences, in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]], in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and in Washington, D.C. The Pact itself declared the necessity for protection of the cultural product and activity of the world—both during war and peace—and prescribed the method by which all sites of cultural value would be declared neutral and protected, just as the [[Red Cross]] does with hospitals. Indeed, the Roerich Pact was often called The [[Red Cross]] of Culture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-pact.php |title=Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace |publisher=roerich.org |accessdate=17 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j6Mz6Foa  |archivedate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Russian Cultural Association===
The American Russian Cultural Association ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Америка́но–ру́сская культу́рная ассоциа́ция'') was organized in the USA in 1942 to encourage cultural ties between the [[Soviet Union–United States relations|Soviet Union and the United States]], with Nicholas Roerich as honorary president.

The group does not appear to have lasted much past Nicholas Roerich's death in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roerich-encyclopedia.facets.ru/personal/ARKA.html |title=American-Russian Cultural Association |publisher=roerich-encyclopedia |accessdate=17 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j6NXP6UV |archivedate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=arcareport |title=Annual Report |publisher=onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu |accessdate=17 December 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j6OGAS70 |archivedate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It carries in itself a new cosmic world view for which new interest grows more each year. The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the [[Agni Yoga]], which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and [[Cosmos]], contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |title=The Nicholas Roerich Museum |accessdate=17 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pms1o0eG |publisher=en.icr.su |archivedate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in Atlanta, Sharecare was founded in 2010 by [[Jeff Arnold (Internet entrepreneur)|Jeff Arnold]] (founder of [[WebMD]]) and [[Mehmet Oz|Dr. Mehmet Oz]], in partnership with [[Harpo Studios]], [[Sony Pictures Television]] and [[Discovery Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07adco.html |title=Web Site to Offer Health Advice, Some of It From Marketers |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-04-02 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&amp;tkr=HSWI:US&amp;sid=ac9dCGVDwxLU|title=Dr. Mehmet Oz and Internet Entrepreneur, Jeff Arnold, Announce Sharecare Inc., a Web 3.0 Platform, Organizing and Answering the Questions of Health|date=November 2, 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharecare began as an interactive question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) platform  about health &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobihealthnews.com/9257/sharecare-aims-to-be-humble-host-for-health-apps/ |title=Sharecare aims to be humble host for health apps |publisher=MobiHealthNews |date=2010-10-21 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then expanded its products and services  through internal development and strategic acquisitions of companies including  [[DailyStrength]], dotFit, The Little Blue Book, WisePatient, [[RealAge]], PKC Corporation, BACTES Imaging Solutions, QualityHealth, Feingold Technologies, BioLucid and [[Healthways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sharecare.com/static/sharecare-announces-14-million-dollar-growth-equity-financing |title=Sharecare Announces $14 Million Growth Equity Financing Led by Galen Partners, the Acquisition of The Little Blue Book Physician Reference and Jeff Arnold to be CEO |publisher=Sharecare |date=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sharecare.com/static/sharecare-announces-the-acquisition-of-realage |title=Sharecare Announces the Acquisition of RealAge |publisher=Sharecare |date=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sharecare.com/static/sharecare-announces-the-acquisition-of-pkc-corporation |title=Sharecare Announces the Acquisition of PKC Corporation |publisher=Sharecare |date=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sharecare.com/static/sharecare-announces-acquisition-of-bactes |title=Sharecare Announces Acquisition of BACTES |publisher=Sharecare |date=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-healthways-m-a-sharecare-idUSKCN1072L9 |title=Wellness platform Sharecare to buy health business from Healthways |publisher=Reuters |date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharecare.com is built on a social content platform curating the collective knowledge of vetted medical experts. Much of its content is contributed by organizations like [[AARP]], the [[American Cancer Society]], the [[American Heart Association]], the [[American Red Cross]], the [[National Academy of Sports Medicine]], and medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07adco.html |title= Web Site to Offer Health Advice, Some of It From Marketers |publisher=’’The New York Times’’ |date=2010-10-06 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions are also answered by medical centers such as the [[Cleveland Clinic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/zinamoukheiber/2010/11/16/names-you-need-to-know-in-2011-sharecare/ |title= Names You Need To Know In 2011: Sharecare |publisher=Forbes|date=2010-11-16|first=Zina|last=Moukheiber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  platform allows them to answer questions and engage in conversations about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthin30.com/2010/10/dr-mehmet-oz-and-jeff-arnold-launch-sharecare-com-where-experts-share-their-knowledge-with-consumers/ |title= Dr. Mehmet Oz and Jeff Arnold launch Sharecare.com, where experts share their knowledge with consumers |publisher=Health in 30 |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AskMD, launched in December 2013, is a web-based application, (and a free app for iPhone and iPod touch), that helps people collect information about symptoms, learn more about   causes, and find appropriate physicians. AskMD aims to help consumers get organized around their health and have a more productive doctor's visit by guiding users through a personalized questionnaire that takes into account symptoms and other factors, like medications and known conditions, and matches answers against the latest clinical research. AskMD’s clinical knowledge management system was developed through Sharecare’s acquisition of PKC Corporation, to bring evidence-based medicine to patients and providers, and enabling clinically-informed communications. It  was  named Best Medical App at the 4th Annual Appy Awards, and was named an official 2014 Webby Award honoree in Mobile &amp; Apps: Health &amp; Fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/05/23/sharecares-askmd-wins-appy-award-for-best-medical-app/ |title=Sharecare’s AskMD Wins Appy Award for Best Medical App |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://medcitynews.com/2014/04/mobile-health-apps-ehr-diabetes-picked-webby-award-honorees/ |title=Mobile health apps from EHR to diabetes picked as Webby award honorees |publisher=MedCityNews |date=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knowledge Partners==
Concerns have been raised regarding the bias of answers provided on Sharecare.com by “knowledge partners," or paid sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/10/sharecare-webmd-social-cmo-network-sharecare.html |title= WebMD Founder Matches Marketers With Consumers Who Have Health Concerns |publisher=Forbes |date=2009-11-19 |first=Laurie |last=Burkitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge partners include (among others): [[Colgate-Palmolive]]; [[Pfizer]]; [[Unilever]] ([[Dove Soap|Dove]] skin-care products); [[health insurer]] [[UnitedHealthcare]]; and [[Walgreens|Walgreens drug stores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07adco.html |title= Web Site to Offer Health Advice, Some of It From Marketers |publisher=The New York Times |date=2010-10-06 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the American Dental Association (ADA) withdrew as a knowledge partner in response to what it considered an irresponsible attack on the "Dr. Oz Show" on the use of dental amalgam. ADA President Dr. Robert A Faiella summed up the group's reaction by stating: "As a science-based organization, we should always welcome inquiry, but we should not be seen as supporting the promotion of misleading information unsupported by the best science."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ada.org/news/8697.aspx |title= ADA and Sharecare part ways |publisher=ADA News |date=2013-06-10 |first=Kelly |last=Soderland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarded among the finest stage and film actresses of her times,&lt;ref name=hindu/&gt; Patil appeared in over 80&lt;ref name="Sharma2004"/&gt; [[Hindi]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]] films in a career that spanned just over a decade.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gulzar |author2=Nihalani, Govind |author3=Chatterji, Saibal |title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema|year=2003|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=81-7991-066-0|page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her career, she received two [[National Film Awards]] and a [[Filmfare Award]]. She was the recipient of the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth-highest civilian honour in 1985.

Patil graduated from the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] in [[Pune]] and made her film debut with [[Shyam Benegal]]'s&lt;ref name="Subbārāvu2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Si.

Apart from acting, Patil was an active feminist and a member of the Women's Centre in Mumbai. She was deeply committed to the advancement of women's issues, and gave her endorsement to films which sought to explore the role of women in traditional Indian society, their sexuality, and the changes facing the middle-class woman in an urban milieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.indiainfo.com/tales/smitapatil.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=14 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814112650/http://movies.indiainfo.com/tales/smitapatil.html |archivedate=14 August 2007  }} "Reminiscing About Smita Patil"&lt;/ref&gt;

Patil was married to actor [[Raj Babbar]]. She died on 13 December 1986 at the age of 31 due to childbirth complications. Over ten of her films were released after her death. Her son [[Prateik Babbar]] is a film actor who made his debut in 2008.

==Early life==
Smita Patil was born in [[Pune]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Culture/Cinema/Smita.html Frontpage – MANAS]. Sscnet.ucla.edu. Retrieved on 8 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; to a Maharashtrian politician, [[Shivajirao Girdhar Patil]] and social worker mother Vidyatai Patil, from [[Shirpur]] town (Village-Bhatpure) of Khandesh province of Maharashtra State. She studied at Renuka Swaroop Memorial high school in Pune.{{citation needed| reason=no citation for her caste and other personal details|date=March 2018}}

Her first tryst with the camera was in the early 1970s as a television newsreader on the newly transmitting Mumbai [[Doordarshan]], the Indian government run broadcaster.&lt;ref name="GulazāraNihalani2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gulazāra|author2=Govind Nihalani|author3=Saibal Chatterjee|title=Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema: An Enchanting Close-Up of India's Hindi Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8y8vN9A14nkC&amp;pg=PT625|accessdate=29 December 2012|year=2003|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7991-066-5|pages=625–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Smita Patil belongs to a generation of actresses, including [[Shabana Azmi]] and, like her, who are strongly associated with the radically political cinema of the 1970s. Her work includes films with parallel cinema directors like [[Shyam Benegal]],&lt;ref name="Heide2006"/&gt; [[Govind Nihalani]], [[Satyajit Ray]] (''Sadgati'', 1981),&lt;ref name="Robinson1989"/&gt; [[G. Aravindan]] (''Chidambaram'', 1985) and [[Mrinal Sen]] as well as forays into the more commercial [[Hindi film industry]] cinema of [[Mumbai]]. Patil was working as a TV news reader and was also an accomplished photographer when [[Shyam Benegal]] discovered her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/Culture/Cinema/Smita.html "Indian Cinema – Smita Patil"], SSCnet UCLA&lt;/ref&gt;

She was an [[alumna]] of the [[Film and Television Institute of India]], [[Pune]]. In 1977, she won the [[National Film Award for Best Actress]] for her performance in the [[Hindi]] film ''[[Bhumika (film)|Bhumika]]''.&lt;ref name="Naqvi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hena Naqvi|title=Journalism And Mass Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0aFH2KFhFOkC&amp;pg=PA202|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Upkar Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7482-108-9|pages=202–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her films, Patil's character often represents an intelligent femininity that stands in relief against the conventional background of male-dominated cinema (films like ''Bhumika'', ''[[Umbartha]]'' and ''[[Bazaar (1982 film)|Bazaar]]''). Smita Patil was a women's rights activist and became famous for her roles in films that portrayed women as capable and empowered.

{{quote|"I remained committed to small cinema for about five years ... I refused all commercial offers. Around 1977–78, the small cinema movement started picking up and they needed names. I was unceremoniously dropped from a couple of projects. This was a very subtle thing but it affected me a lot. I told myself that here I am and I have not bothered to make money. I have turned down big, commercial offers because of my commitment to small cinema and what have I got in return? If they want names I'll make a name for myself. So I started and took whatever came my way."}}

In time she was accepted by commercial filmmakers and from [[Raj Khosla]] and [[Ramesh Sippy]] to [[B.R. Chopra]], they all agreed that she was "excellent." Her fans, too, grew with her new-found stardom. Patil's glamorous roles in her more commercial films&amp;nbsp;— such as ''[[Shakti (1982 film)|Shakti]]'' and ''[[Namak Halaal]]''&amp;nbsp;—  revealed the permeable boundaries between "serious" cinema and "Hindi cinema" masala in the Hindi film industry. In 1984, she served as a jury member of the [[Montreal World Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards of the Montreal World Film Festival – 1984|url=http://www.ffm-montreal.org/en/awards/33-awards-of-the-montreal-world-film-festival-1984.html|publisher=Montreal World Film Festival|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[C. V. Sridhar]] was the first one to pair her opposite [[Rajesh Khanna]] in ''[[Dil-E-Nadan]]'' in 1982. After success of this film, Smita and Khanna were paired in successful films like ''[[Aakhir Kyon?]]'', ''[[Anokha Rishta]]'', ''[[Angaaray (1986 film)|Angaarey]]'', ''[[Nazrana (1987 film)|Nazrana]]'', ''[[Amrit]]''. The songs "Dushman Na Kare Dost Ne Woh" and "Ek Andhera Lakh Sitare" from the J.P. Omprakash directorial venture ''Aakhir Kyun'' became popular. With the release of ''[[Aakhir Kyon?]]'' her popularity and her pairing with Khanna were at its peak.  The film ''[[Nazrana (1987 film)|Nazrana]]'', also co-starring [[Sridevi]] released posthumously after her death and became box office success with the film being among the top 10 highest-grossing films of the year 1987. Each of her films with Khanna were different and spoke about various social issues. In the film ''[[Awam (film)|Awam]]'', Smita was paired opposite Raj Babbar in supporting role whereas Khanna was in the lead role.  In the year 1987, ''[[Amrit (film)|Amrit]]'' directed by [[Mohan Kumar]] became fifth highest-grossing film of the year. Her performance along-with that of Khanna were critically acclaimed in case of the films ''[[Anokha Rishta]]'', ''[[Amrit (film)|Amrit]]'', ''[[Aakhir Kyon?]]''.

Her association with artistic cinema remained strong, however. Her arguably greatest (and unfortunately final) role came when Smita re-teamed with [[Ketan Mehta]] to play the feisty and fiery Sonbai in ''[[Mirch Masala]]'' (1987). Smita won raves for playing a spirited spice-factory worker who stands up against a lecherous petty official.
On the centenary of Indian cinema in April 2013, ''[[Forbes (India)|Forbes]]'' included her performance in the film on its list, "25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/100-years-of-indian-cinema/25-greatest-acting-performances-of-indian-cinema/35125/0|title=25 Greatest Acting Performances of Indian Cinema|magazine=[[Forbes (India)|Forbes]]|first1=Shishir|last1=Prasad|first2=N. S.|last2=Ramnath|first3=Sohini|last3=Mitter|date=27 April 2013 |accessdate = 27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the making of ''Chakra'', Smita Patil used to visit the slums in Bombay. It culminated in another National Award.

==Personal life==
When she became romantically involved with actor [[Raj Babbar]],&lt;ref name=Rediff&gt;{{cite web|title='She was a great human being'|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2006/dec/13smita.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=27 December 2011|date=13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patil drew severe criticism from her fans and the media, clouding her personal life and throwing her into the eye of a media storm. Raj Babbar left his wife [[Nadira Babbar]] to marry Patil.&lt;ref name=ibnlive&gt;{{cite web|title='25 years on, a phenomenon named Smita Patil '|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/25-years-on-phenomenon-named-smita-patil/211601-8-66.html|publisher=[[ibnlive.in.com]]|accessdate=27 December 2011|date=13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Smita died from childbirth complications on 13 December 1986,&lt;ref name="Robinson1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Robinson|title=Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnkcLvYRNfMC&amp;pg=PA258|accessdate=29 December 2012|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06946-6|pages=258–}}&lt;/ref&gt; age 31, barely two weeks after having given birth to her son, [[Prateik Babbar]].&lt;ref name="Agnihotri1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ram Awatar Agnihotri|title=Film stars in Indian politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Q5lAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Commonwealth Publishers|isbn=978-81-7169-506-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly two decades later, one of India's greatest film directors, [[Mrinal Sen]] alleged that Smita Patil had died due to gross medical negligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/feb/02mrinal.htm "Memories from Mrinal da"], Rediff.com, 2 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Rediff.com]] listed her as the second-greatest actress of all time, behind [[Nargis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Readers Choice: The Greatest Actresses of all time|publisher=Rediff.com|author=Sen, Raja|accessdate=22 September 2011|date=29 June 2011|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-greatest-actresses-of-all-time/20110629.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Suresh Kohli from ''[[Deccan Herald]]'', "Smita Patil was, perhaps, the most accomplished actress of Hindi cinema. Her oeuvre is outstanding, investing almost every portrayal with a powerhouse realistic performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Deccan Herald]]|date=22 September 2011|author=Kohli, Suresh|accessdate=22 September 2011|title=Immortal performances|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/150885/immortal-performances.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin Neil Whitrick''' (17 August 1964 – 21 March 2007) was a British citizen and an [[electrical engineer]].&lt;ref name="TOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article1560877.ece |title=Get on with it, said net audience as man hanged himself on webcam |accessdate=27 May 2007 |last=Bale |first=Joanna |date=24 March 2007 |work=The Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406181957/http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article1560877.ece |archivedate=6 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whitrick's death was highly publicised for his live, online [[webcast]] suicide.

== Biography ==

=== Marriage and children ===
At the time of his death, he was married to his wife Paula. At the time of his death Kevin lived apart from his family after the breakdown of his marriage two years previously.&lt;ref name="Evening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23390052-details/British+man+commits+suicide+on+live+webcam/article.do |title=Chatroom users 'egged on father to kill himself live on webcam' |accessdate=15 May 2009 |date=24 March 2007 |work=London Evening Standard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307222607/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23390052-details/British%2Bman%2Bcommits%2Bsuicide%2Bon%2Blive%2Bwebcam/article.do |archivedate=7 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suicide ===
On the day of his death, Kevin Whitrick was in a [[chatroom]] on [[PalTalk]] and was joined by about 60 other users in a special "insult" chatroom where people "[[Flaming (Internet)|have a go at each other]]".&lt;ref name="Evening" /&gt; He stood on a chair, punched a hole in his ceiling and placed a rope around a joist, and then tied the other end around his neck, then stepped off the chair. Some people thought this was a prank, until his face started turning blue. Some people in the chat room egged him on while others tried desperately to find his address. A member in the room contacted the police, who arrived at the scene two minutes later. Kevin Whitrick was pronounced dead at 11:15&amp;nbsp;pm. GMT.&lt;ref name="TOnline" /&gt; {{dead link|date=March 2013}}

=== Aftermath ===
The death has been reported in the press and is notable due to fear it might inspire other suicides,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/03/25/3828482-sun.html Live hanging shown on web – Alberta suicide-prevention groups brace for copycat deaths] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070328220732/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2007/03/25/3828482-sun.html |date=28 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the possibility of the webcam footage being made available on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=256671 Keep online suicide footage offline: police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329174229/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=256671 |date=29 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussions over the culpability of web users who encouraged the man.

The police detectives traced about 100 chatroom users to question them about their role in the cyber suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,21445333-2703,00.html |title=Police consider charging chatroom users for inciting cyber suicide |accessdate=27 May 2007 |last=Ungoed-Thomas |first=Jon |date=26 March 2007 |work=The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] has stated that none of the chatroom users will face criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Toto''' (1931–1968) (a.k.a. '''M'Toto''' meaning "Little Child" in Swahili) &lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Time Magazine, December 30, 1940 p.9&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[gorilla]] that was adopted and raised very much like a human child.

A. Maria Hoyt adopted the baby female gorilla orphaned by a hunt in [[French Equatorial Africa]] in 1931.  Mrs. Hoyt's husband killed the baby gorilla's father for a museum piece, and his guides killed its mother for fun.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Mrs. Hoyt moved to [[Cuba]] to provide a more tropical home for Toto.  At the age of four or five, Toto adopted a kitten named Principe, carrying the kitten with her everywhere.  When Toto became too difficult to manage for a private keeper, she was leased to the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]] as a potential mate for another gorilla, [[Gargantua (gorilla)|Gargantua]], a.k.a. Buddy.  Toto died in 1968. Toto is buried at "Sandy Lane" Kennels Pet Cemetery in Sarasota, Florida.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Ulysses syndrome''' ('''Immigrant Syndrome of Chronic and Multiple Stress''') is an atypical set of [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]], [[Anxiety|anxious]], [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform]] [[symptom]]s that results from being exposed to extreme levels of stress unique to the process of modern migration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Rather than a [[mental disorder]], this syndrome is a natural reaction to toxic levels of stress seen in migrants who are otherwise in normal mental health.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The syndrome is named after the ancient Greek hero, [[Odysseus]] (Ulysses in Latin), who suffered involuntary migration and travelled for 10 years through the Mediterranean to come back home from the decade-long [[Trojan War]]. The hardships of his journey are compared to the ones of contemporary migrants, who must struggle with intensely stressful, novel situations in isolation and with little help. Scarcity of their resources makes it impossible to cope with and successfully adapt to the unfamiliar environment of the receiving country, which in turn leads to experiencing a range of detrimental symptoms.

[http://www.wpa-tps.org/about-wpa-tps/members/joseba-achotegui-loizate/ Dr. Joseba Achotegui] coined the term "Ulysses Syndrome" in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/433383015|title=La depresión en los inmigrantes una perspectiva transcultural|last=Joseba.|first=Achotegui Loizate,|date=2002|publisher=Mayo|isbn=848998073X|location=Barcelona|oclc=433383015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
Symptoms of Ulysses syndrome include [[migraine]]s, [[insomnia]], recurrent worrying, tension, nervousness, [[irritability]], disorientation, fear, [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], sadness, gastric pain, [[bone pain]], low [[self-esteem]], increased tobacco and alcohol consumption, and decreased productivity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ulysses Syndrome: The immigrant Syndrome with Chronic and Multiple Stress|last=Achotegui|first=Joseba|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-84-613-31116|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A lack of social support or access to appropriate medical care may aggravate these symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In some occasions, patients with Ulysses syndrome are mistakenly diagnosed with another medical condition which can further impede recovery.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Causes ==

Migration in the 21st century has occurred in the context of unprecedented volatility, conflict, and suffering. There are currently more forcibly displaced individuals in the world than at any other time in history, including 22.5 million refugees, 40.3 million internally displaced peoples, and 2.8 million asylum-seekers in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/statistics/unhcrstats/5943e8a34/global-trends-forced-displacement-2016.html|title=Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2016|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=UNHCR|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced migration has profound impacts on individuals and families as their lives change suddenly and dramatically.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/strengthening-the-rights-of-internally-displaced-persons/|title=Strengthening the Rights of Internally Displaced Persons|last=Kälin|first=Walter|date=|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences of modern migrants include the separation of families, dissolution of communities by conflict and disaster, exposure to exploitation, and violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Migrants remain in prolonged periods of displacement with a median time of 4 years in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/dev4peace/how-many-years-do-refugees-stay-exile|title=How many years do refugees stay in exile?|last=Devictor|first=Xavier|date=2016-09-15|website=dev4peace|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migrants often face multiple forms of uniquely intense stressors, such as the death of loved ones, lack of jobs and social support, difficulties in the migratory process, and loss of status and identity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alba L. Diaz-Cuellar, Henny A. Ringe, David A. Schoeller-Diaz|first=|year=|title=The Ulysses Syndrome: Migrants with Chronic and Multiple Stress Symptoms  And the Role of Indigenous Linguistically and Culturally Competent Community Health Workers|url=http://www.panelserver.net/laredatenea/documentos/alba.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many migrants lack access to healthcare in the receiving country, they are often unable to receive appropriate care and continually re-experience the mental trauma of these losses. The cumulative effect may create stress levels so intense that they exceed individuals' [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]] capacities and lead to a failure of the [[acculturation]] process. This aggravates other symptoms, including depression, anxiety, headaches, and pain.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Extreme stressors that put individuals at risk for Ulysses syndrome, called "Ulysses stressors", can broadly be characterized into four categories:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* '''Forced loneliness:'''
** Separation from family and homeland
** Social and cultural [[Social isolation|isolation]] due to lack of language proficiency or familiar cultural and religious institutions
** [[Racism|Racial discrimination]] and prejudice in the receiving country
* '''Failure of migratory goals:'''
** Sense of failure of original reasons for emigration
** Pressure to earn enough money to support family back in the home country
** Lack of opportunities to acquire appropriate legal documentation, obtain work permits, and secure non-exploitative quality jobs
** Poor access to housing and health services,
* '''Dangers of the journey''':
** Crowded rafts and boats without life jackets
** Fear of arrest and deportation
** Physical and sexual abuse
* '''Struggle to survive''':
** Difficulties procuring basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=S.|last2=Sull|first2=L.|last3=Davis|first3=C.|last4=Worley|first4=N.|date=2011-04-01|title=Correlates of Depression among Older Kurdish Refugees|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/56.2.159|journal=Social Work|language=en|volume=56|issue=2|pages=159–168|doi=10.1093/sw/56.2.159|issn=0037-8046}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MSW|first=Banghwa Lee Casado|last2=PhD|first2=Patrick Leung|date=2002-04-23|title=Migratory Grief and Depression Among Elderly Chinese American Immigrants|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J083v36n01_02|journal=Journal of Gerontological Social Work|volume=36|issue=1-2|pages=5–26|doi=10.1300/J083v36n01_02|issn=0163-4372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salaberría|first=Karmele|last2=Polo-López|first2=Rocío|last3=Cruz-Sáez|first3=Soledad|last4=Echeburúa|first4=Enrique|last5=Berry|first5=Katherine|date=2015-01-01|title=Chronic Stress in Immigrants and Relatives of People with Mental Illness: A Comparative Study|url=http://www.redalyc.org/resumen.oa?id=243045363002|journal=Revista Mexicana de Psicología|volume=32|issue=1|issn=0185-6073}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Middle-aged and elderly adults are typically more strongly affected than younger people are because they experience a larger loss of status and social mobility, have fewer encounters with people outside of the community through school or work, and are less likely to be exposed to the receiving country's mainstream culture. Moreover, older immigrants typically have greater difficulty learning the receiving country's language, which may substantially impair their ability to understand and interact with the new culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Ulysses syndrome is not a mental disorder, but rather a normal stress response by a healthy individual to an extreme situation that overwhelms the normal psychological mechanisms for coping.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By definition, this syndrome cannot be diagnosed if another mental disorder is present.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is currently no DSM-5 criteria for this syndrome.

Although often falsely recognized as [[Acute stress reaction|acute stress disorder]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[adjustment disorder]], or other [[mental disorder]]s, Ulysses syndrome differs from these pathologies in important ways:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* [[Acute stress reaction|Acute stress disorder]]: Ulysses syndrome is brought about by chronic exposure to toxic stress, whereas the symptoms of acute stress disorder by definition are limited to one month.
* [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]: Although depressed mood is common, Ulysses syndrome does not include many other cardinal symptoms of depression such as [[apathy]] or thoughts of death. Immigrants, unlike people suffering from depression, have the motivation to go forward and struggle in order to reunite with their families and have a better life, despite their current difficulties, and do not lose their interests. Rather, they try to maintain their social and professional activities.
* [[Adjustment disorder]]: One of the central diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder is distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the stressor or stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-08-28|title=Adjustment Disorders: Practice Essentials, Background, Pathophysiology|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2192631-overview?pa=10hG00AOZCJfyBb6lPXxkDLZbhDLQsXO1vhBO1q8i/sS74KmHaRGSxq185t78c8Ulm+snaCVAQ+wAmmKNkPUcfUx1lsOtEz9hQfTzeEJH24=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Ulysses syndrome is an appropriate response that manifests as anxiety, insomnia, sadness, etc., precisely due to the extreme nature of the stressors. Moreover, deterioration of social and occupational functioning, which is often present in adjustment disorder, does not occur in Ulysses syndrome.
* [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|Post-traumatic stress disorder]]: Both PTSD and Ulysses syndrome stem from a response to fear. However, disturbing thoughts or feelings about traumatic events as well as distress and avoidance of trauma-related cues do not occur in Ulysses syndrome, but does in PTSD, whereas stressors such as social isolation, lack of opportunities, discrimination, and prejudice are common for Ulysses syndrome and not for PTSD.
Although clinically distinct from mental health disorders, Ulysses syndrome exists on a spectrum between normal and disease.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can be understood as the extreme limit of normal mental functioning that can still be considered non-pathological. However, an individual with Ulysses syndrome is at greater risk of disease and indeed, at a certain point the stressors may become too intense such that a true clinical mental disorder such as depression or PTSD can develop.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Because Ulysses syndrome is a stress response rather than a mental disorder, the natural response for an individual is to return to his or her normal state of health once the stressors are eliminated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dr. Achotegui, who first described Ulysses Syndrome, makes the analogy to a stalk of bamboo that bends in the wind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Just like bamboo will bend but not break, those who are exposed to Ulysses stressors are brought to the brink of mental instability and are made more vulnerable to mental disorders, but do not have a disorder yet. When the wind subsides, the bamboo will spring back to its normal state, just as those who face these stressors will return to their normal selves if and when the stressors resolve.

Preventive measures that may help reduce Ulysses syndrome generally revolve around building mental resilience, such as finding closure after losing loved ones, embracing changes in identity as an opportunity for growth, talking with others who have undergone similar experiences, re-evaluating expectations to be more realistic, and learning to live in the present rather than dwell too deeply in nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visaustralia.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=167:psychological-impact-of-migration-the-ulysses-syndrome-and-how-to-defeat-it&amp;lang=en|title=Psychological impact of migration: The Ulysses Syndrome and how to defeat it|last=VisAustralia|access-date=2017-12-14|language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed therapy leverages the ability of [[community health worker]]s CHWs) to connect with hard to reach populations such as displaced migrants.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; CHWs better understand the local culture and traditions and may, with the appropriate training, be able to engage affected individuals more effectively. For instance, CHWs can often better advocate for migrant rights and connect migrant populations to the resources necessary to facilitate integration and build community, all of which helps reduce the extreme stressors that lead to Ulysses syndrome.

== Alternative use of "Ulysses Syndrome" ==
The term "Ulysses Syndrome" has alternatively been used to refer to the psychological and physical sequelae of misdiagnosis due to a false positive result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Essex|first=Charles|date=2005-05-28|title=Ulysses syndrome|pmc=558104|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=330|issue=7502|pages=1268|issn=0959-8138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rang|first=M.|date=1972-01-22|title=The Ulysses syndrome.|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=106|issue=2|pages=122–123|issn=0008-4409|pmc=1940359|pmid=5058884}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a patient who complains of low risk chest pain may be referred for further cardiac work-up by an overcautious physician. These tests in turn may give a positive result due to high sensitivity, which subjects the patient to further testing that ultimately proves to be unnecessary. Victims of this condition experience the stress of being diagnosed with a condition they do not have as well as the physical trauma of invasive testing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There is currently no consensus on the definitive use of the term “Ulysses syndrome”. Nevertheless, Ulysses syndrome as it is used to describe the effects of chronic extreme stress  in migrant populations is more in line with the definition of a [[syndrome]] as used in the medical field, i.e. a set of signs and symptoms that constitute a disease. Moreover, because migrants who experience chronic stress and fear are frequently incorrectly diagnosed with depression or anxiety, it encapsulates the alternative definition of this condition.

'''William Wyatt Bibb''' (October 2, 1781{{spaced ndash}}July 10, 1820) was a [[United States Senator]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the [[list of Governors of Alabama|first]] [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]].  [[Bibb County, Alabama]], and [[Bibb County, Georgia]], are named for him.

He was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]] political party. Bibb served as governor of the [[Alabama Territory]] from August 1817 to December 1819, and as the first elected governor of the state of Alabama from December 1819 to his death on July 10, 1820.

==Early life==
William Wyatt Bibb was born on October 2, 1781, in [[Amelia County, Virginia|Amelia County]], [[Virginia]] to Captain William Bibb, an officer in the [[Continental Army]] during  the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775-1783) and a member of the state legislature, the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the newly independent   [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]], and his wife Sally Wyatt Bibb.&lt;ref name="Auburn"&gt;{{cite web|title=William Wyatt Bibb (1819-20)|publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama - Auburn University|author=Daniel S. Dupre (University of North Carolina - Charlotte)|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1416|date=January 7, 2008|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1784, Bibb senior moved with his family south to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with a large number of Virginians who accompanied [[George Mathews (Georgia)|General George Mathews]], hero of the [[Battle of Brandywine]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. Most of the general's followers were veterans like himself, who with their families took advantage of the new nation's offer of land bounties for former soldiers. They established tobacco farms on the rich lands around the confluence of the [[Broad River (Georgia)|Broad]] and [[Savannah River|Savannah Rivers]] in newly developing northeastern Georgia. The Bibbs are recorded as one of the earliest pioneer families in [[Elbert County, Georgia|Elbert County]].&lt;ref name="Auburn" /&gt; After having attended [[the College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] in [[Philadelphia]], he was awarded an [[Doctor of Medicine]] (M.D.) degree in 1801. He returned to Georgia and began practicing medicine in [[Petersburg, Georgia|Petersburg]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.archives.alabama.gov/govs_list/g_bibbwm.html|title=William Wyatt Bibb
|publisher=Alabama Department ofArchives &amp; History|accessdate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803, he married Mary Freeman.

==Politics in Georgia==
Bibb's first office was as a member of the [[Georgia House of Representatives]]. Elected in 1802, at the age of 21, he took office in 1803 and served one term until 1805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Official and Statistical Register 1975-1976|publisher=State of Georgia|page=1484|url=http://statregister.galileo.usg.edu/statregister/view?docId=statregister/stat1975/stat1975-1486.xml|date=|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected as a [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican]] to the [[Ninth United States Congress]] to fill a vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Thomas Spalding]], and was reelected four times, serving until November 6, 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Official and Statistical Register 1975-1976|publisher=State of Georgia|page=550|url=http://statregister.galileo.usg.edu/statregister/view?docId=statregister/stat1975/stat1975-0553.xm|date=|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then elected by the [[Georgia General Assembly|state legislature]],  to the [[United States Senate]] to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of the nationally known and presidential candidate [[William H.

Fifth President [[James Monroe]], (1758–1831, served 1817–1825), appointed Bibb as the first governor of the newly formed [[Alabama Territory]] (out of the larger previous [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1817. Alabama became the 22nd state on December 14, 1819. Bibb was elected governor, defeating [[Marmaduke Williams]]. Bibb received 8,342 votes, while Williams received 7,140 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dupre|first1=Daniel S.|last2=Webb|first2=Samuel L.|last3=Armbrester|first3=Margaret E.|title=Alabama Governors : A Political History of the State|date=2014|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=9780817318437|page=16|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e000xna&amp;AN=810885&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;ebv=EB&amp;ppid=pp_14|accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital was chosen to be the newly created town of [[Cahawba, Alabama|Cahawba]] in 1820 on the Alabama frontier, it then moved to [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] in 1826, and finally to the central city of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in 1846, where a [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol]] building was later begun (later the site of the historic inauguration in 1861 of [[Jefferson Davis]] of [[Mississippi]] as the first provisional and only President of the [[Confederate States of America]] after the first seven of thirteen southern states seceded, with Montgomery as the temporary Southern National Capital. Later several famous [[Civil Rights Movement]] marches and protests were held here in the 1950s and 60's).

During Bibb's tenure, the Alabama state [[militia]], (now [[Georgia National Guard]]) and the beginnings of the state judicial system with the organization and appointments to the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]] were accomplished.

[[Henry Hitchcock]] was elected the first [[Attorney General of Alabama]] and initially held the position of [[Secretary of State of Alabama]] as well. However, shortly afterward [[Thomas A. Rodgers]] was elected as the second [[Secretary of State of Alabama]]. The first session of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] was held from October 25, 1819, to December 17, 1819. [[William R. King]] and [[John W. Walker]] were chosen as the first [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]].

Bibb remains one of only two individuals who served as governor of a state and a U.S. senator from a different state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2017/09/14/mitt-romney-prepares-for-unusual-us-senate-bid/|title=Mitt Romney Prepares for Unusual US Senate Bid {{!}} Smart Politics|website=editions.lib.umn.edu|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is [[Sam Houston]], who (among his other political offices) served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and a [[List of United States Senators from Texas|U.S. senator from Texas]].  [[Mitt Romney]], who served as the seventieth [[governor of Massachusetts]] won the November, 2018 election to serve as [[List of United States Senators from Utah|U.S. senator from Utah]] and will become the third such individual if, as scheduled, he takes office in January 2019.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death==
In 1820, Bibb was thrown from his horse during a violent thunderstorm.&lt;ref name="NorthenGraves1910"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

His brother, [[Thomas Bibb]], was president of the state senate at the time and completed the rest of his term. Bibb is buried in [[Coosada, Alabama]].  As first governor his likeness appears on the [[Alabama centennial half dollar]], which was minted in 1921.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4917">The "'''Woman in Black'''" is a supernatural figure that was occasionally seen in western Virginia and Tennessee through the 1900-1930s, and at other times. Periodically described as an Appalachian folk tale, other times as a moral figure, and sometimes a voodoo spirit of malevolence, the Woman in Black was reported in different cities and regions throughout the south and west. At the same time, one appearance was reported by reputable people in Alma, Nebraska.

==Kingsport, Tennessee==
There is an account of a Woman in Black that was seen in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]] in November 1927. She appeared to Lena Mitchell, an African-American woman, was visited several times by this mysterious woman, who left her hypnotized or "in fits" afterwards. "Her woman in black was also African-American, and only appeared to torment her." Earlier visits had happened, and voodoo objects had been found under Lena Mitchells' bed, and when removed, the mysterious figure departed. "Relatives noted that, when it happened before, they found a strange hoodoo object beneath Mitchell’s bed. Once they got rid of it, her symptoms subsided and she returned to normal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vacreeper.com/kingsports-woman-black/ "Kingsport’s Woman in Black ".] Virginia Creeper: Appalachian History and Folklore Magazine. No date given, no page given.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the police searched the town, no one matching the description was ever found, and the Woman in Black remains a mystery.

==Roanoke, Virginia==
A woman in black was encountered by several people in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] in 1902. "She was beautiful, stately and terrifying." Here the woman in black would appear suddenly and unexpectedly to men who had stayed to long at the club and insist they go home as quickly as possible. Sometimes the woman in black would knock the man down to the ground or "slap him to the earth with a swish of her phantom garments".&lt;ref&gt;Clinch Valley News. May 1902. No page given&lt;/ref&gt;
The woman was always described as beautiful, about 5'10" in height, with large eyes and heavy lashes. She wore a black dress that almost touched the ground, and a raglan coat that covered a slender frame. On her head she wore a turban, but worn so it would obscure the lower part of her face. Although unknown to them, she would appear next to married men and address them by name. &lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Neil. "The Woman in Black." Discover: History &amp; Heritage. 2016. Page 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some other towns in the region were also visited by the woman in black, including [[Bristol, Virginia]], [[Tazewell, Virginia]], [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] and [[Richmond, Virginia]]. One account claims she appeared suddenly to four men of the [[Disciples of Christ]] church in [[Tazewell, Virginia]], and scared them so badly they all ran home. "They took to the middle of the street and burnt the wind" trying to get away. The moral upshot of her appearance in Roanoke in 1902 had the salutary effect of keeping married men home with their wives and families rather than going out each night.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Neil. "The Woman in Black." Discover: History &amp; Heritage. 2016. Page 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alma, Nebraska==
Three men in [[Alma, Nebraska]] claimed to have been spooked by the lady in black on March 16, 1902. H. S. Wetherald, editor of the Alma Journal; Frank Griggsby, the area's leading carriage dealer; and [[Ashton C. Shallenberger]], then the congressman of Nebraska's Fifth District, and later governor of Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Neil. "The Woman in Black." Discover: History &amp; Heritage. 2016.
