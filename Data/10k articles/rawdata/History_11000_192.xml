The Pakistani public reacted with protests all over the country and the government took measures adversely affecting the [[US exit strategy from Afghanistan]], including the evacuation of [[Shamsi Airfield]] and closure of the [[NATO supply lines to Afghanistan|NATO supply line]].

On 3 July 2012, US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] officially apologized for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. Subsequently, Pakistan restored the NATO supply routes.&lt;ref name="CNN20120704"&gt;{{cite news|author=CNN Wire Staff|title=Pakistan reopens NATO supply routes to Afghanistan|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/03/world/asia/us-pakistan-border-routes/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|work=CNN Wirestaff|publisher=CNN|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and timeline==
{{main|War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in North-West Pakistan}}

===The attack===
On 26 November 2011, US-led NATO forces opened fire on two Pakistani border check-posts near the [[Durand Line|Pakistan-Afghanistan border]]. The attack occurred at approximately 02:00 [[Pakistan Standard Time|local time]] (01:30 in Afghanistan and 21:00 [[GMT]]).&lt;ref name="timeofattack"/&gt; According to the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO), [[Major General]] [[Ashfaq Nadeem]], the attack was a coordinated NATO strike and used two [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow]] helicopters, an [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130H Spectre gunship]] and two [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15E Eagle]] fighter jets. A [[Beechcraft C-12 Huron|MC-12W Liberty]] turbo-propeller aircraft was used in an [[ISTAR|intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance]] role.&lt;ref name="AC-130 and Apache used"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkReport&gt;{{cite web|title=US Central Command Investigation into Salala Checkpoint Engagement|url=https://www.scribd.com/full/80616338?access_key=key-26rt0xtpw7icq41c5zat|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The check-posts were located {{convert|200|m}} to {{convert|2.5|km}} inside Pakistan from the border with Afghanistan in the Salala area of the Baizai subdivision of the [[Mohmand Agency]] in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA), Pakistan, and separated by a distance of one kilometre on the Salala mountain top.&lt;ref name="200 meters"/&gt;

The attacks caused the deaths of up to twenty-four Pakistani soldiers,&lt;ref name="Guardian-01" /&gt; including two officers, Major Mujahid Mirani and [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Usman Ali. Thirteen other soldiers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Both sides reported they were attacked first. The poorly defined border, as well as a history of [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban fighters]] moving around the Afghan border regions, were cited as possible contributing factors to the incident.&lt;ref name="Guardian-01"/&gt;

[[File:AC-130H Spectre (2152981898).jpg|thumb|An AC-130 gunship (pictured) was used in addition to two Apache helicopters and two F-15E Eagle fighter jets to carry out the attack.&lt;ref name="AC-130 and Apache used" /&gt;]]

====US-Afghan claims====
According to Afghan and US officials, the incident started after US-Afghan coalition forces, which were conducting an operation against the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan's eastern [[Kunar Province]], were fired upon from border positions within Pakistan.&lt;ref name="BBCNews-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/nato-came-under-fire-pakistan-attack-sources-134017538.html NATO came under fire from Pakistan before attack: sources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223144508/http://news.yahoo.com/nato-came-under-fire-pakistan-attack-sources-134017538.html |date=23 December 2011 }}, Reuters, 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newser"/&gt; "There was firing coming from the position against Afghan army soldiers who requested support", said one Afghan official in Kabul.&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt; 

The Afghan official further stated they were being fired upon directly from a Pakistani military outpost itself.&lt;ref name=TWR&gt;{{cite web|last=Shrivastava|first=Sanskar;|title=US, NATO Attack on Pakistan Affected South Asia's Geopolitics Over a Week|url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2011/11/us-nato-attack-on-pakistan-affected.html|work=The World Reporter|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Western official backed up that view by stating, "They were fired on from a Pakistani army base." And, "It was a defensive action."&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt; According to Afghan and US accounts helicopters were then called in for support against the incoming fire.&lt;ref name=WSJReport&gt;{{cite news|last=Nissenbaum|first=Dion; Tom Wright; Adam Entous|title=Airstrike Ravages U.S.-Pakistan Ties|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204630904577061270317324992|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=28 November 2011|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/afghan-soldiers-called-deadly-nato-airstrike-143342422.html Afghan soldiers called in deadly NATO airstrike], AP, RAHIM FAIEZ and RIAZ KHAN, 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tough-line&gt;{{cite web|last=Flaherty |first=Anne |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/27/2-key-senators-call-tough-line-pakistan/ |title=2 key senators call for tough line with Pakistan |work=Washington Times |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pakistani defence official reportedly admitted that soldiers in the Pakistani border post sitting there for the express purpose of stopping infiltration fired a few flares, a couple of mortar rounds and one or two bursts of machine-gun fire in that direction.&lt;ref name="Karen DeYoung"&gt;{{cite news|title=Afghans say commando unit was attacked before airstrike was called on Pakistan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/afghans-say-unit-was-attacked-before-airstrike/2011/11/28/gIQAX6ZY5N_story.html?hpid=z1|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|author=Karen DeYoung|author2=Joshua Partlow|date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another US official in Kabul pointed to [[Pakistan–United States skirmishes#Kurram incident|an incident in September 2010]], when a NATO helicopter fired on a Pakistan outpost, killing two soldiers. "It was a situation where insurgent forces butted right up against a Pakistani border post and used that as a firing position. When we fired back, we hit Pakistani security forces. Military officials in Kabul claimed insurgents in Pakistan have also used empty Pakistan border bases to stage attacks, which they say may have been the working assumption of the coalition forces who called in the airstrike when they drew fire.&lt;ref name=WSJReport/&gt;

One US official said NATO forces had informed the Pakistani army's 11th Corps command near the western border that operations against Taliban insurgents would take place on that day. Pakistani General Abbas admitted in a press conference that coalition forces had "informed our military earlier, much earlier, that they will be conducting an operation there."&lt;ref name="Karen DeYoung"/&gt;

According to the US military, information about the proposed strike was passed on at one of the centres on the border where both sides station officers and exchange information in an effort to avoid firing on each other, after which Pakistani officers cleared the strike, saying that there were no Pakistani forces in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Julian E. and Adam Entous, "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203833104577072771910500442?mod=googlenews_wsj Pakistan Was Consulted Before Fatal Hit, U.S. Says]", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Roggio|Roggio, Bill]], "[http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2011/12/pakistan_cleared_isaf_airstrik.php Pakistan cleared ISAF airstrikes that killed its own troops], ''[[Long War Journal]]'', 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident sparked outrage and controversy in Pakistan, which termed the attack an "unprovoked and indiscriminate firing,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan blasts "unprovoked" NATO attacks|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-57331477-503543/pakistan-blasts-unprovoked-nato-attacks/|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; an "irresponsible act," and a "stark violation" of its sovereignty.&lt;ref name="kyodo"/&gt; Leaders of the Pakistani military establishment viewed NATO's attacks on the army checkposts as intentional, pre-planned and premeditated.&lt;ref name="preplanned"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/28-Dec-2011/pakistan-rejects-us-army-findings-on-nato-attacks|title=Pakistan rejects US army findings on Nato attacks|work=The Nation|date=28 December 2011|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slamming NATO's version of events as "lame excuses", Pakistan rejected claims of any firing having emanated from its side as a prelude to the encounter, saying that the soldiers who were manning the post were asleep and resting when NATO launched the assault at night.&lt;ref name="BBCNews-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=5 Minutes 10 Minutes &lt;!-- // .tier-2 --&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/pakistan-hits-lame-excuses-for-nato-attack/story-e6frg6so-1226208563639 |title=Pakistan hits 'lame excuses' for NATO attack |work=The Australian  |accessdate=29 November 2011 |date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director general of the [[Inter Services Public Relations|ISPR]], [[Major General]] [[Athar Abbas]] challenged NATO to "present proof if they claim that firing was started from Pakistani side.

The helicopters first attacked the border post, named "Volcano", atop the mountain peak.

Pakistani authorities tried to contact their NATO counterparts in an effort to inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force. The helicopters returned a second time engaging Boulder border post again. A short while later communication with the NATO commanders was established and the attack was called off.

In a media conference with the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) Major General Ashfaq, Chief of General Staff [[Lieutenant General]] [[Waheed Arshad]], claimed that this was not an "unintended" incident. On accounts of series of events he commented that NATO was informed at the time of attack but their helicopters remained on course of aggression. Pakistani military also said that the NATO forces returned a second time to attack the post again.&lt;ref name=TWR/&gt; When he was asked whether Pakistan was satisfied with the investigating team headed under US Air force [[Brigadier General]] Stephon, he responded sharply by commenting that all incidents in past in relation to violation of Pakistan's sovereignty did not come to an agreeable conclusion. Pakistan was invited to jointly investigate the incident, but Pakistan refused to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Rosenberg and Eric Schmitt, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/world/asia/pakistan-refuses-to-help-as-us-sorts-out-fatal-airstrikes.html Pakistan Refuses to Help as U.S. Sorts Out a Fatal Attack] ''[[New York Times]]'' 2 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pakistani military called the strike "unprovoked and indiscriminate." Government of Pakistan launched a strong protest with U.S and also immediately discontinued the supply to NATO troops located in Afghanistan. Notably, the strike on Saturday came one day after Gen. John Allen, the commander of the US-led coalition in Afghanistan, visited Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. In that meeting, both the commanders discussed border co-ordination and other measures "aimed at enhancing border control on both sides."

==Repercussions of the incident==

US policy makers tried to find alternative routes through Russia, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] (termed as the "Northern Distribution Network") but these are longer and less effective than routes through Pakistan. Huge costs are associated with the Central Asian supply lines, and NATO's supply line through Russia is already under a looming danger of closure due to friction over missile defence plans.&lt;ref name="Sustainability of Nato supply line"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdul Zahoor Khan Marwat|title=Sustainability of Nato supply line|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=81604&amp;Cat=2|newspaper=The News|date=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a landlocked country, Afghanistan is highly dependent on Pakistan for its imports. According to figures released by [[The Pentagon]] in January 2012, the United States was paying six times more to send supplies to troops in Afghanistan via alternative supply routes following the closure of Pakistani routes. The figures placed the new US costs at $104 million per month, roughly $87 million costlier per month than when the cargo was transported via Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10049831|title=APNewsBreak: Costs soar for new war supply routes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=24 February 2012|author=Robert Burns|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high costs were associated with the routes being lengthier.&lt;ref name="other routes"/&gt;

====Continued strife====
In late March 2012, a US military official stated that the United States would have to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines. However, he conceded the expensiveness of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing.&lt;ref name="other routes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/357443/us-to-rely-on-india-in-case-pakistan-doesnt-resume-nato-routes/|title='US to rely on India in case Pakistan doesn't resume NATO routes'|work=Express Tribune|last=Imtiaz|first=Huma|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing United States-Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations, the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012.&lt;ref name="CSM 20120416"&gt;{{cite news|last=Latif|first=Aamir|title=Pakistan moves to reopen NATO supply lines, but US ties remain frayed|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2012/0416/Pakistan-moves-to-reopen-NATO-supply-lines-but-US-ties-remain-frayed|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to an [[Pakistani general election, 2013|upcoming general election]] in Pakistan, with widespread anti-American sentiments in the country, the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talks with US on ties next week|url=http://dawn.com/2012/04/22/talks-with-us-on-ties-next-week/|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=Dawn|date=22 April 2012|author=Anwar Iqbal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations,&lt;ref name="CSM 20120416" /&gt; such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident, the bringing of those involved in the strike to justice, and a stop to US drone airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan postpones reopening of NATO supply line |url=http://www.irna.ir/News/Politic/Pakistan-postpones-reopening-of-NATO-supply-line/80085125 |work=Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) |publisher=Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) |accessdate=22 April 2012 |date=18 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident.&lt;ref name="NYT20120424"&gt;{{cite news|title=United States Talks Fail as Pakistanis Seek Apology|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/28/world/asia/talks-between-us-and-pakistan-fail-over-airstrike-apology.html?hp|accessdate=28 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 April 2012|author=Declan Walsh, Eric Schmitt and Steven Lee Myers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White House]] refused to apologise after [[April 2012 Afghanistan attacks|Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities]] in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012, which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the [[Haqqani network]], an Afghan group working from a base in [[North Waziristan]] along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan's tribal belt.&lt;ref name="NYT20120424" /&gt; Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology.&lt;ref name="NYT20120424" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. drone strikes resume in Pakistan; action may complicate vital negotiations|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/us-drone-strikes-resume-in-pakistan-action-may-complicate-vital-negotiations/2012/04/29/gIQAIprqpT_story.html?tid=pm_world_pop|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=29 April 2012|author=Richard Leiby and Karen DeYoung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in May, Pakistan demanded the United States to pay stiff fees as a condition to open up NATO supply routes into Afghanistan. The United States, however, could not pay the required $5,000 per truck due to budgetary restraints according to US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. bristles at stiff Pakistani fees for supply routes|url=http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/19/u-s-bristles-at-stiff-pakistani-fees-for-supply-routes/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=19 May 2012|author=Mike Mount and Elise Labott|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S., Pakistan fail to reach deal on supply routes ahead of NATO summit|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/19/world/obama-g8-nato/index.html?hpt=wo_c2|work=Mike Mount and Elise Labott|publisher=CNN|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NATO Summit Opens With No Deal on Pakistan Supply Lines|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/world/asia/pakistan-supply-lines-an-issue-during-nato-summit.html?ref=northatlantictreatyorganization|accessdate=21 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=20 May 2012|author=Matthew Rosenberg, Eric Schmitt and Helene Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Considering the financial challenges that we're facing, that's not likely," Panetta said of the Pakistani demand of $5,000 for each truck carrying supplies across its territory for NATO troops waging the Afghanistan war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Panetta to confront Pakistan at NATO summit on transport costs|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-panetta-interview-20120519,0,2864210.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=19 May 2012|author=David S.

Unnamed US officials said that US officials said they had hoped a meeting between Pakistani President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] and US President Barack Obama as well as sharing the spotlight with President Obama and other global leaders during the [[2012 Chicago Summit|2012 NATO Chicago Summit]] might provide an incentive for a deal on resuming supply shipments. "The invitation was an inducement to get them back into the international fold," said a senior US official, speaking anonymously because of the sensitive issues. "But the Pakistanis couldn't get their own act together" in time for the summit. "The main issue, it seems, is money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NATO summit: Obama's Pakistan gamble falls flat|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-nato-afghanistan-20120522,0,3468909,full.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=21 May 2012|author=David S. Cloud and Kathleen Hennessey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Pakistan had nearly completed a deal to reopen crucial NATO supply routes into Afghanistan in June 2012, when Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said the US was "reaching the limits of our patience" over Islamabad's failure to root out Afghan insurgents in its tribal areas.  In the wake of Panetta's comments, deputy assistant secretary of Defense Peter Lavoy was not allowed to meet with the Pakistani Army Chief, General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]], and the Pentagon announced that it was bringing home a negotiating team that had worked in the Pakistani capital for nearly two months to end the bitter impasse over the supply routes.  A senior US official disputed the notion that Panetta's criticism of Pakistan had set back the talks.  "The sticking point for a long time has been the apology issue," the official said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense Secretary Panetta's Pakistan comments complicate talks|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-talks-20120613,0,7893198.story|accessdate=8 July 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=12 June 2012|author=David S.

====Supply lines reopening====

Pakistan decided to reopen the supply lines after the US Secretary of State apologised on 3 July 2012 for the Salala incident via a telephone call to Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar.&lt;ref name="CNN20120704"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan to reopen supply lines to Nato Afghan forces|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18691691|publisher=BBC News Asia|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guerin|first=Orla|title=Pakistan reopens vital lines into Afghanistan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18700001|publisher=BBC News Asia|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan to reopen NATO supply route|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRcI0iriH8U|work=Al Jazeera English|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Hina Rabbani Khar|Foreign Minister Khar]] and I acknowledged the mistakes that resulted in the loss of Pakistani military lives,"&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120704" /&gt; Clinton said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Hillary Clinton]]|title=Statement by Secretary Clinton on her Call With Pakistani Foreign Minister Khar (Press Release Number (PRN) 2012/1084)|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/07/194502.htm|publisher=United States Department of State|date=3 July 2012|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military.

Allen]] said in a statement that the agreement is "a demonstration of Pakistan's desire to help secure a brighter future for both Afghanistan and the region at large."&lt;ref name="WP20120703" /&gt; and NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen welcomed the announcement to reopen the supply lines, stating saying it highlighted the important role Pakistan has in supporting a stable future for Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Reuters20120703" /&gt;

Pakistani reactions to the US apology were different. "We appreciate Secretary Clinton's statement, and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here. I am confident that both countries can agree on many critical issues, especially on bringing peace to the region," Pakistan's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120704" /&gt; In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military. "Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines. What were the demands?"&lt;ref name="NYT20120704" /&gt; said former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. And Enver Baig, an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz complained about Americans: "They did not apologize. They said ‘sorry.’"&lt;ref name="NYT20120704" /&gt; Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys. "The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country, and we will not sit silently over this," retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan (a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes) and a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. "We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies."&lt;ref name="WP20120703" /&gt; Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes.&lt;ref name="Reuters20120703" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan Taliban threaten attacks after NATO supply routes deal|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/03/us-pakistan-usa-taliban-idUSBRE8620XH20120703|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 July 2012|author=Jibran Ahmad|date=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transporters who resume supplies will be "considered a friend of the U.S." and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani Taliban issue threats over reopening of NATO supply routes|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/04/world/asia/pakistan-taliban-threats/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=[[Nasir Habib]]|date=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jazeera]]'s Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past. "The losses, despite the fact that they have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring"&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120704" /&gt; the correspondent said. According to his analysis it would cause a problem if "the Pakistani Taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in the tribal areas" connecting Pakistan to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.&lt;ref name="AlJaz20120704" /&gt;

American officials said according to the New York Times that Hillary Clinton's increasingly cordial relationship with the young Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar paid dividends in resolving the dispute between both countries over the Salala incident.&lt;ref name="NYT20120704" /&gt; A final agreement on the wording of Clinton's statement of her conversation with Khar came after a week of marathon talks that included two trips to [[Islamabad]] by General [[John R.

The above-mentioned agreement between Pakistan and the United States was never an issue of money alone.

On 26 November, the same day the incident occurred, Pakistan ordered the US to shut down and vacate the [[Shamsi Airfield]] in the southwestern Balochistan province within a deadline of 15 days.

Among the immediate repercussions of the incident is that the United States' attempts to end the war in Afghanistan peacefully may now be in jeopardy. Some Pakistani officials warned that the attack could have "huge implications" for the Afghan endgame. Pakistan, which is designated as a [[major non-NATO ally]] by the United States and is seen as a key facilitator in bringing the United States to the negotiations table with the [[Taliban|Afghan Taliban]] and the [[Haqqani Network]], had already halted those efforts according to an unnamed Pakistani official close to the military establishment.&lt;ref name="Afghan endgame"/&gt;

While addressing a [[Senate of Pakistan|Senate]] committee, the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Hina Rabbani Khar]] warned that a repeat incident could end Pakistan's support to the United States in its war against militancy. "Enough is enough. The government will not tolerate any incident of spilling even a single drop of any civilian or soldier's blood. [[Pakistan's role in the War on Terror]] must not be overlooked."

Retired Brigadier Mahmood Shah, former chief of security in the tribal areas, said that so far the US has blamed Pakistan for all that is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan's point of view has not been shown in the international media, so the matter should be taken up by the [[United Nations Security Council]]. He advised Pakistani authorities to shoot down NATO aircraft should a similar event take place in the future, and to keep the supply lines closed, on the argument that the US cannot afford a war with Pakistan.&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2066488/U-S-helicopter-attack-killed-28-Pakistan-troops-act-self-defence.html |title=Pakistan gives US 2-week ultimatum to abandon 'secret' airbase and closes border &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Momand |first=Shams |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/26/us-pakistan-nato-idUSTRE7AP03S20111126 |title=Pakistan stops NATO supplies after deadly raid |publisher=Reuters |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oneclick.indiatimes.com/article/0fP57Qp4yI16Z?q=Afghanistan |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120718232109/http://oneclick.indiatimes.com/article/0fP57Qp4yI16Z?q=Afghanistan |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=Pakistan demands U.S. vacate air base within 15 days |publisher=Oneclick.indiatimes.com |accessdate=29 November 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/middle-east/6041277/Cross-border-NATO-raid-kills-up-to-14-Pakistani-troops |title=Cross-border raid kills 28 Pakistanis |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |url=http://www.lhrtimes.com/2011/11/26/nato-helicopters-attack-on-pakistani-border-post-kills-25-soldiers/ |title=NATO helicopters attack on Pakistan border post kills 26 soldiers&amp;nbsp;– The Lahore Times |publisher=Lhrtimes.com |date=26 November 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Inter Services Public Relations]] (ISPR), a media wing of the Pakistani military, released a statement calling the attack unprovoked and said that chief of army staff, General [[Ashfaq Parvez Kayani]] had called the incident unacceptable and "directed that all necessary steps be under taken for an effective response to this irresponsible act".&lt;ref name="defense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=8375544&amp;c=AIR&amp;s=TOP |title=Pakistan Condemns 'Unprovoked' Border Attack |publisher=Defensenews.com |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One senior Pakistani military official said "the latest attack by NATO forces on our post will have serious repercussions as they, without any reasons, attacked on our post and killed soldiers asleep."&lt;ref name="dailymail"/&gt;

The televised funeral ceremony of the soldiers who died was held in [[Peshawar]] and was attended by several high-level military and political figures, including the Chief of Army Staff. Afterwards, their bodies were dispatched to their native towns for burial. The soldiers hailed from various regions, including three from [[Azad Kashmir]] alone, while the Major was from [[Larkana]] and the Captain from [[Sahiwal]]. Family members of Major Mujahid Mirani and Captain Usman Ali said the soldiers "sacrificed their lives" for the country and that they were proud of those sacrifices.  The Army Chief later also paid a visit to the injured soldiers, who had been transported to the [[Combined Military Hospital]] (CMH) in Peshawar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AH Nizami / Manzoor Ali |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/298770/pakistan-buries-troops-amid-fury-over-nato-strike-2/ |title=Pakistan buries troops amid fury over NATO strike |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 2011, referring to Pak-US military, intelligence, political and diplomatic co-operation, the Pakistani Prime Minister announced that there would be no more business with the US and the relations between the two countries would never be the same again.  Later the Director General of ISPR, Abbas, announced that NATO's apology was not accepted and the attack would have serious consequences. He said that NATO's regret over the attack was not enough and such incidents had happened in the past, killing 72 soldiers and injuring more than 250 troops in three years.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} While addressing a gathering of journalists at a military headquarters, Pakistan Army Major-General Ashfaq Nadeem described the Salala incident as a "deliberate act of aggression"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/world/2011/11/30/nato-attack-was-blatant-aggression-pakistan-army|title=NATO attack was blatant aggression: Pakistan army|work=[[Times Live]]|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said it was "next to impossible" that NATO did not know they were attacking Pakistani forces.&lt;ref name="newser"&gt;[http://www.newser.com/article/d9raebf00/pakistan-to-boycott-key-meeting-in-germany-in-protest-over-nato-raid-that-killed-its-troops.html Pakistan to boycott key meeting in Germany in protest over NATO raid that killed its troops] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129141612/http://www.newser.com/article/d9raebf00/pakistan-to-boycott-key-meeting-in-germany-in-protest-over-nato-raid-that-killed-its-troops.html |date=29 November 2011 }}, Newser&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2012, foreign affairs minister Hina Rabbani Khar said Pakistan's ties with the United States were "still on hold" over the NATO air-attack and that until the re-evaluation was not complete, Washington could not ask Islamabad to pursue militant groups or assist in the Afghan peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/324091/relations-with-us-based-on-mutual-respect-interest-fo/|title=Pakistan-US ties still on hold over NATO attack: Khar|work=Express Tribune|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, [[Bilawal Bhutto Zardari]], son of President Zardari and chairman of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], toughened his stance when he called on President Obama to "show some courage" and "apologise to Pakistan" over the raid. Ridiculing US demands for Islamabad to "do more" in the Afghanistan war, Bilawal remarked "it is time for the US to do more". He called US drone operations a "constant irritant" to Pakistani public opinion and questioned whether the United States "actually considered Pakistan a military ally", citing other controversial events such as the Abbottabad operation and the [[Raymond Davis incident]]. He also remarked that while he understood Obama was facing a re-election, "the future of the NATO mission in Afghanistan should be more important than poll numbers".&lt;ref name="Bilawal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/23-May-2012/obama-should-apologise-for-salala-attack-bilawal|title=Obama should apologise for Salala attack: Bilawal|work=The Nation|date=23 May 2012|accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2011, NATO issued an apology for what it called a "tragic unintended incident".&lt;ref name="BBCNews-01"/&gt; In addition, NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen is reported to have written to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani commenting that "the deaths of Pakistani personnel are as unacceptable and deplorable as the deaths of Afghan and international personnel".&lt;ref name="BBCNews-01"/&gt; "We have a joint interest in the fight against cross-border terrorism and in ensuring that Afghanistan does not once again become a safe haven for terrorists," Rasmussen was quoted as saying.&lt;ref name="newamerican"&gt;[http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-mainmenu-26/asia-mainmenu-33/9944-pakistan-retaliates-against-nato-after-soldier-killings Pakistan Retaliates Against NATO After Soldier Killings], New American&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, US senators such as [[John McCain]] and [[Lindsey Graham]] said the United States needed to "fully review" its ties with Pakistan and consider enforcing cuts or new restrictions to military and economic aid, in response to attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan which the United States accuses of having links to Pakistani intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/302931/key-us-senators-urge-review-of-pakistan-funding/|title=Key US senators urge review of Pakistan funding|work=Express Tribune|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dennis J.

The [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|US embassy in Islamabad]] released a video statement on YouTube featuring Ambassador [[Cameron Munter]] standing in front of the American and Pakistani flags, in which he expressed his regrets for the attack. Giving his condolences, Munter said the United States took the attack "very seriously" and pledged "a full, in-depth investigation."

During the same gathering, protesters also criticised the United States for pushing an inquiry into the conduct of the Sri Lankan armed forces in the recently ended civil war against [[Tamil Tigers|Tamil insurgents]].&lt;ref name="colombo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_11B/Dec09_1323448298CH.php|title=Sri Lankans display solidarity with Pakistan against NATO attack|work=Colombo Page|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2011-12/09/c_131298048.htm|title=Sri Lanka protest against NATO air attacks on Pakistan|work=Xinhua|date=9 December 2011|accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flagu|Turkey}}: The Turkish [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]] [[Ahmet Davutoğlu]] telephoned Pakistan and called the attack "unprovoked and totally unacceptable". Davutoğlu assured that as a member of NATO, Turkey will ask for an impartial inquiry into the attacks. He further added that the loss of the Pakistani soldiers was "as painful as losing Turkish soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=APP 2|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/11/27/turkish-fm-expresses-solidarity-with-pakistan.html |title=Turkish FM expresses solidarity with Pakistan |publisher=Dawn.com |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Flagu|United Arab Emirates}}: Sheikh [[Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], the Foreign Affairs Minister of the United Arab Emirates, arrived in Islamabad on an unannounced visit and requested President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] to reconsider and withdraw Pakistan's deadline set for the US to vacate the Shamsi Airbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=F_487 |url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90777/7659861.html |title=Pakistan rejects UAE request to withdraw call to US for air base vacation |work=People's Daily  |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Zardari is said to have rejected the request during the meeting, saying the decision was taken by the Defence Committee of the Cabinet and was in national interests.&lt;ref name="irna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irna.ir/ENNewsShow.aspx?NID=30687714&amp;SRCH=1 |title=Zardari rejects UAE request for change in US airbase vacation call |publisher=Irna.ir |accessdate=29 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shamsi Airbase is believed to be under the control of the UAE, which leased it in the 1990s for facilitating visits of wealthy Arabs who used to visit Pakistan for falconry and hunting trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anita Joshua |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article2668930.ece |title=Will not be "business as usual": Pakistan |work=The Hindu |location=India |accessdate=29 November 2011 |date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UAE is reportedly the party which allowed the US to use the air base for military purposes.&lt;ref name="irna"/&gt;

====Organisations====
* {{flagu|United Nations}}: The office of the Security Council's President, Ambassador [[Jose Filipe Moraes Cabral]] of Portugal, submitted Mr. [[Hussain Haroon|Haroon]]'s letter for their information as well as the DCC statement, to be issued as a document of the UNSC. UN is still awaited for further comments.&lt;ref name="UNSC request" /&gt;
* {{flagu|Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)}}: The Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) [[Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu]] condemned the NATO attacks and gave his condolences to the relatives of the dead soldiers. Ihsanoglu said the attacks were a "serious violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and are totally unacceptable" and expressed solidarity with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oic-oci.org/topic_detail.asp?t_id=6015 OIC Secretary General condemns NATO attacks in Pakistan]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagu|European Union}}: [[Catherine Ashton]] offered her condolences for the deaths and said: "We underline the EU's commitment to continue its engagement with Pakistan in pursuit of the shared goals of promoting peace, security and prosperity. Pakistan is a vital partner in the region and has an essential role to play in the resolution of the Afghan conflict."&lt;ref name="paktribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paktribune.com/news/Nato-Attack-Pakistan-decides-to-boycott-Bonn-Conference-245493.html|title=Nato Attack: Pakistan decides to boycott Bonn Conference|work=[[PakTribune]]|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Syed Ali Shah Geelani]], leader of the separatist [[Tehreek-e-Hurriyat]] party in [[Indian-administered Kashmir]] said during a telephone address that Pakistan was facing problems due to its alliance with the United States.&lt;ref name="tribune2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tanveer |first=Rana |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/298508/jud-ji-raise-calls-for-jihad-against-us/ |title=Third rally in a week: Prepare for jihad, Jamaatud Dawa says |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=123225 |title=JuD Calls for Jihad After NATO Strike |publisher=Daijiworld.com |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Tehrik-i-Taliban]] (TTP) said NATO's attack on Pakistani check posts proved that the US "can never be a friend of Pakistan" and said Pakistan ought to take revenge for the incident and cut off its ties with the USA. A TTP spokesperson maintained that no peace talks were being held with the government of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/298791/slave-country-america-is-no-friend-says-taliban/ |title=America is no friend, says Taliban |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third parties====
[[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]], a British socialist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Socialists and the Middle East revolutions: John Rees|url=http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/46-video/10738-socialists-and-the-middle-east-revolutions-john-rees|newspaper=Counterfire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Socialism in the 21st century|url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj100/rees.htm|newspaper=International Socialism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.workersliberty.org/node/7124 |title=When John Rees justified ditching working-class socialism |newspaper=Workers' liberty |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100620131317/http://www.workersliberty.org/node/7124 |archivedate=20 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-war political activist, called the NATO attack an "extremely dangerous incursion" and argued that the US and its allies were creating instability in the nuclear-armed country. Ahmed Qureshi, an Islamabad-based analyst, said during the same interview with state-run ''[[Russia Today]]'' that the prevailing public outrage may force the government and the army to take some decisive measures against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/helicopters-checkpoint-killed-military-273/ Pakistan seals border in response to NATO attack], [[Russia Today]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian analyst Brian Cloughley said the attack would have severe consequences: "This is quite outrageous and I have no doubt it signifies the end of the last lingering shreds of trust that the Pakistani army had for the U.S.". According to Coughley, the USAF had full knowledge of the locations of Pakistani border posts, and thus there was no excuse for this incident.&lt;ref name="defense"/&gt;

An article from the ''[[Asia Times]]'' by M K Bhadrakumar explains that US should learn from its experience with Iran. It has no answer to a resolute nation in its will to put up against an enemy and Pakistan is going to give a "[[Iran–United States relations|Persian response]]" this time if the intention was to intimidate its army. According to Bhadrakumar, Pakistan's calculated response following the attack stops short of directly terminating its participation in the war although in essence, this event may push Pakistan's army "within inches of doing that" in the long-term scenario.&lt;ref name="Asia Times"&gt;{{cite web|last=M K Bhadrakumar|title=US and Pakistan enter the danger zone|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/MK29Df02.html|publisher=Asia Times|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report published in the newspaper ''[[Pakistan Observer]]'' claimed that some military and defence observers at [[Islamabad]] believed NATO was playing a double game and was in league with the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban]]; according to the report, there was a theory being circulated which suggested that the attack carried out by NATO came just when some Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP) militants from Afghanistan who had entered the region had been completely encircled by Pakistani forces and were about to be eliminated "within the next few hours". These check posts were there to check them and prevent from crossing the border into Pakistan. Pakistani monitors and experts on Afghanistan believed that at least two Afghan military officials deployed on the border, [[Brigadier General]] Aminullah Amarkhel and [[Colonel]] Numan Hatifi (of the 201st Silab Corps), have [[anti-Pakistan sentiments]] and links to anti-Pakistani elements.&lt;ref name="NATO Attack was to rescue TTP"&gt;{{cite web|last=Akhtar Jamal |title=NATO attack was launched to rescue TTP militants |url=http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=127616 |publisher=Pakistan Observer |accessdate=30 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424035415/http://pakobserver.net/detailnews.asp?id=127616 |archivedate=24 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATO Attack was to rescue TTP-ref2"&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO attack was launched to rescue TTP militants|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=9fc_1322626437|publisher=Live Leak|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Air Marshal (Retd) Shahid Lateef: NATO attack on Army checkpoint launched to rescue TTP militants|newspaper=CNBC Pakistan (TV)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''[[People's Daily]]'', China's top state newspaper, accused the United States and NATO of flouting international law and fanning terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/299415/china-paper-says-us-fans-terror-by-pakistan-attack/ |title=China paper says US fans terror by Pakistan attack|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=29 November 2011|accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, many Chinese scholars, analysts and members of leading think tanks also expressed strong criticism of NATO's attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ftpapp.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=168795&amp;Itemid=39 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121203030510/http://ftpapp.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=168795&amp;Itemid=39 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 December 2012 |title=Chinese scholars, civil society strongly condemn NATO-ISAF attack |work=[[Associated Press of Pakistan]] |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A former spokesperson for the US state department said China, which is a [[People's Republic of China–Pakistan relations|close ally of Pakistan]], "sees this as a target of opportunity, both to tweak the US and to subtly suggest to Pakistan that if it really sours of its relationship with the US, it has an alternative".&lt;ref name="chinesereaction"/&gt;

Writing for the Pakistani newspaper ''[[Express Tribune]]'', Indian blogger Sanjay Kumar said the attack had elicited various reactions in [[India]], with some vocal sections who saw Islamabad in "the prism of prejudice and paranoia" expressing glee and delight at the discomfort and supposed humiliation of their [[Indo-Pakistani relations|arch-rival western neighbour]]. Kumar opinionated that "such sick thought has many takers in this healthy democracy which prides itself as the voice of the third world countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/9307/pakistan%E2%80%99s-trouble-can-never-be-india%E2%80%99s-gain/|title=Pakistan's trouble can never be India's gain|work=Express Tribune|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An opinion piece by Abdul Ruff Colachal published on the ''Indian Muslim Observer'' titled "NATO terrorism in Pakistan" said that Pakistan's leadership was "interested mainly in promoting US imperialist goals and western capitalist interests" rather than protecting the interests of its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianmuslimobserver.com/2011/12/nato-terrorism-in-pakistan-is-pakistani.html |title=NATO terrorism in Pakistan: Is Pakistani regime really serious about people |work=Indian Muslim Observer |first=Abdul Rauf |last=Colachal |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615082242/http://www.indianmuslimobserver.com/2011/12/nato-terrorism-in-pakistan-is-pakistani.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">The '''Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America''' (AILLA) is a digital repository housed in [[LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. AILLA is a digital language archive dedicated to the digitization and preservation of primary data, such as field notes, texts, audio and video recordings, in or about Latin American indigenous languages. AILLA's holdings are available on the Internet and are open to the public wherever privacy and [[intellectual property]] concerns are met. AILLA has access portals in both English and Spanish; all metadata are available in both languages, as well as in indigenous languages where possible.

==Vanishing Voices==
In this global media age, more and more indigenous languages are being superseded by global languages such as Spanish, English, and Portuguese. Frequently, recordings made by researchers such as linguists, anthropologists, and ethnomusicologists, and by community members and speakers, are the only record of these languages. These recordings might be stored in university offices or in private homes where they are not accessible to the relevant stakeholders{{clarify|date=November 2016}}. AILLA provides a permanent home for these recordings in order to make them available to the speakers and to the rest of the world via the Internet.

==Archive==
The collection currently contains roughly 7,500 hours of archived audio materials, representing more than 300 languages from at least 28 countries. This is supplemented by a significant number of images, videos, and text files. Altogether, the archive contains more than 110,000 individual files (correct as of June 2016).

The database of archived materials can be freely searched via both the English and Spanish portals available on the AILLA webpage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ailla.utexas.org/|title=AILLA|website=www.ailla.utexas.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [http://www.language-archives.org/tools/search/?archive=paradisec.org.au Open Languages Archives Community]. Direct access to archived recordings requires registration and sometimes needs permission as specified by the depositor. Downloads are free of charge.

A large part of the project is the digitization of valuable analog recordings of languages and cultures from the Latin America that will otherwise deteriorate or be lost forever. Researchers whose materials are represented in these collections include [[Terrence Kaufman]], [[Lyle Campbell]], and [[Nora England]].

Analog recordings are digitized at the highest possible fidelity to ensure high-quality digital files result. The current international archive standard for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio files is 24-bit resolution and a sample rate of 96&amp;nbsp;kHz. AILLA employs the same standard to ensure that digital copies of the highest practicable fidelity are produced.

==Affiliations==
AILLA is funded by the College of Liberal Arts and the University of Texas Libraries at [[The University of Texas at Austin]]. AILLA's main office and primary ingestion{{clarify|date=November 2016}} stations are located at the [[Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection]]. The archive is currently headed by [[Susan Smythe Kung]], Joel Sherzer, Anthony C. Woodbury, and Patience Epps.

==Early career==
He was born in [[Asker]] as the son of historian [[Oscar Albert Johnsen]] (1876–1954) and Anna Evie Tollefsen (1877–1944). He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1928, enrolled in [[philology]] at the [[University of Oslo]] and graduated in 1936 with the [[mag.art.]] degree. Between 1937 and 1939 he studied medieval history at [[École des Chartes]], [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and [[Collège de France]]. He was then a research fellow at the University of Oslo for five years.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Arne Odd Johnsen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Gunnar I.|last=Pettersen|volume=|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Arne_Odd_Johnsen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 he published his thesis ''Studier vedrørende kardinal Nicolaus Brekespears legasjon til Norden'',&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Arne Odd Johnsen|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|first=Gunnar Christie|last=Wasberg|authorlink=Gunnar Christie Wasbergpublisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Arne_Odd_Johnsen|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; about Cardinal Nicolas Breakspear, later known as [[Pope Adrian IV]]. The thesis earned him the [[dr.philos.]] degree in 1946.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

==Later career==
After taking his doctorate he held scholarships and fellowships at several institutions in Norway and abroad. He was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] from 1949 and the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters]] from 1953. In 1958 he received a permanent scholarship from the Norwegian state. Johnsen became known for his endeavor to publish source documents from medieval and early modern times. His largest single work was ''Finnmarksfangstens historie 1864–1905'', published in 1959 as volume one of ''Den moderne hvalfangst historie'', the [[History of whaling|history of modern whaling]]. He was the editor of ''Kristiansunds historie'', a work on the [[Kristiansund#History|history of Kristiansund]], published in five volumes between 1945 and 1962, and in 1971 he released ''Tønsberg gjennom tidene'' on the [[Tønsberg#History|history of Tønsberg]].

Johnsen also issued one collection of poetry, in 1930 under the pseudonym Tore Tallbo.&lt;ref name=asbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2006|title=Johnsen, Arne Odd|encyclopedia=Asker og Bærum leksikon|publisher=Forlaget for by- og bygdehistorie|location=Drammen|first=Per Otto|last=Borgen|pages=263–264|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-91649-10-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married interior decorator Birgitte Christine Paus (1915–1992) in 1952.

[[File:Trojan1.jpg|thumb|An early [[nuclear power plant]] that used atomic energy to generate electricity.]]

The '''Atomic Age''', also known as the '''Atomic Era''', is the period of history following the detonation of the first [[Nuclear bomb|nuclear ("atomic") bomb]], ''[[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity]]'', on July 16, 1945, during [[World War II]]. Although [[nuclear chain reaction]]s had been hypothesized in 1933 and the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction ([[Chicago Pile-1]]) had taken place in December 1942,&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holl |first=Jack |year=1997 |title=Argonne National Laboratory, 1946–96 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |isbn=0-252-02341-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trinity test and the ensuing [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] that ended World War II represented the first large-scale use of [[nuclear technology]] and ushered in profound changes in [[Political sociology|sociopolitical]] thinking and the course of technology development.

While [[Nuclear power|atomic power]] was promoted for a time as the epitome of progress and modernity,&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt; entering into the nuclear power era also entailed frightful implications of [[nuclear warfare]], the [[Cold War]], [[mutual assured destruction]], [[nuclear proliferation]], the risk of [[nuclear disaster]] (potentially as extreme as [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] global [[nuclear winter]]), as well as beneficial civilian applications in [[nuclear medicine]].  It is no easy matter to fully segregate peaceful uses of nuclear technology from military or terrorist uses (such as the fabrication of [[dirty bomb]]s from [[radioactive waste]]), which complicated the development of a global nuclear-power export industry right from the outset.

In 1973, concerning a flourishing nuclear power industry, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] predicted that, by the turn of the 21st century, one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the U.S. However, the "nuclear dream" fell far short of what was promised because nuclear technology produced a range of social problems, from the [[nuclear arms race]] to [[nuclear meltdown]]s, and the unresolved difficulties of bomb plant cleanup and civilian plant waste disposal and decommissioning.&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Many orders and [[List of canceled nuclear plants in the United States|partially completed plants were cancelled]].&lt;ref name="Mortal Hands p. 283"&gt;[[Stephanie Cooke]] (2009). ''[[In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age]]'', Black Inc., p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, nuclear power had suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread [[anti-nuclear movement|public opposition]], coming to a head with the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Follies", February 11, 1985 cover story in ''[[Forbes magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
In 1901, [[Frederick Soddy]] and [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that [[radioactivity]] was part of the process by which atoms changed from one kind to another, involving the release of energy. Soddy wrote in popular magazines that radioactivity was a potentially “inexhaustible” source of energy, and offered a vision of an atomic future where it would be possible to “transform a desert continent, thaw the frozen poles, and make the whole earth one smiling Garden of Eden.” The promise of an “atomic age,” with nuclear energy as the global, utopian technology for the satisfaction of human needs, has been a recurring theme ever since. But "Soddy also saw that atomic energy could possibly be used to create terrible new weapons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~aglaser/2006aglaser_nuclearcrowd.pdf |title=Life in a Nuclear Powered Crowd |author1=Zia Mian  |author2=Alexander Glaser  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=June 2006  |work=INESAP Information Bulletin No.26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The two words atomic and nuclear are synonymous in the context of atomic power and weapons. The atom consists of a nucleus and one or more electrons. All atomic reactions involve changing one atom into another by changing the nucleus. Historically atomic power is an older term, and nuclear power is newer.[http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/Deterrence/Atomsforpeace.shtml President Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] was hypothesized in 1933, shortly after [[James Chadwick|Chadwick's]] [[Discovery of the neutron|discovery]] of the [[neutron]]. Only a few years later, in December 1938 [[nuclear fission]] was discovered by [[Otto Hahn]] and his assistant [[Fritz Strassmann]], and proved with Hahn's radiochemical methods. The first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction ([[Chicago Pile-1]], or CP-1) took place in December 1942 under the leadership of [[Enrico Fermi]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

In 1945, the pocketbook ''The Atomic Age'' heralded the untapped atomic power in everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused. One science writer, David Dietz, wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week, you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill. [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], who chaired the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], wrote "there will be nuclear powered earth-to-moon shuttles, nuclear powered artificial hearts, plutonium heated swimming pools for SCUBA divers, and much more".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin K. Sovacool, ''The National Politics of Nuclear Power'', Routledge, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==

The phrase "Atomic Age" was coined by [[William L. Laurence]], a [[New York Times]] [[journalist]] who became the official journalist for the [[Manhattan Project]] which developed the first nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="laurence19450926"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fpLSlthuEMC&amp;pg=PA10 | title=Drama of the Atomic Bomb Found Climax in July 16 Test | work=The New York Times | date=1945-09-26 | author=Laurence, William L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ATOMIC TRUTHS PLAGUE PRIZE COVERUP |last=Gonzalez |first=Juan |work=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2005/08/09/2005-08-09_atomic_truths_plague_prize_c.html |date=9 August 2005 |quote=Laurence, the only journalist the U.S. government permitted to witness the bombing of Nagasaki, is also the reporter who first coined the term "Atomic Age." ...  Nagasaki, Laurence launched his Times series, where he extolled the bomb and sought to discredit other accounts about effects of the bomb. }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He witnessed both the [[Trinity test]] and the bombing of [[Nagasaki]] and went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and in part motivated development of the technology in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;On this incident, see David Holloway, ''Stalin and the Bomb: The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939–1956'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994): 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union would go on to test [[RDS-1|its first nuclear weapon]] in 1949.

In 1949, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, [[David Lilienthal]] stated that "atomic energy is not simply a search for new energy, but more significantly a beginning of human history in which faith in knowledge can vitalize man's whole life".&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1950s ==
{{further|Atomic Age (design)}}
 
[[File:NNSA-NSO-787.jpg|thumb|This view of downtown Las Vegas shows a [[mushroom cloud]] in the background. Scenes such as this were typical during the 1950s. From 1951 to 1962 the government conducted 100 atmospheric tests at the nearby [[Nevada Test Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/issue.aspx?y=0&amp;content=true&amp;id=982&amp;css=print&amp;page=6 |title=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Tests and Cancer Risks |last1=Simon |first1=Steven |last2=Bouville |first2=Andre |date=2006 |website=American Scientist |publisher=American Scientist.org |access-date=27 March 2016|quote="Exposures 50 years ago still have health implications today that will continue into the future."}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The phrase gained popularity as a feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] would render all conventional explosives obsolete and [[nuclear power]] plants would do the same for power sources such as [[coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]]. There was a general feeling that everything would use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from [[Food irradiation|irradiating food]] to preserve it, to the development of [[nuclear medicine]]. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would "provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space".&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in [[technological progress]] as the first smelting of [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], of [[Iron Age|Iron]], or the commencement of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

This included even [[automobile|car]]s, leading [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] to display the [[Ford Nucleon]] [[concept car]] to the public in 1958. There was also the promise of golf balls which could always be found and [[nuclear-powered aircraft]], which the US federal government even spent US $1.5 billion researching.&lt;ref name=bks2011/&gt; Nuclear policymaking became almost a collective technocratic fantasy, or at least was driven by fantasy:&lt;ref name=sh96&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The very idea of splitting the atom had an almost magical grip on the imaginations of inventors and policymakers. As soon as someone said – in an even mildly credible way – that these things ''could'' be done, then people quickly convinced themselves ... that they ''would'' be done.&lt;ref name=sh96/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the USA, military planners "believed that demonstrating the civilian applications of the atom would also affirm the American system of private enterprise, showcase the expertise of scientists, increase personal living standards, and defend the democratic lifestyle against communism".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media reports predicted that thanks to the giant nuclear power stations of the near future [[electricity]] would soon become much cheaper and that [[electricity meter]]s would be removed, because power would be "[[too cheap to meter]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/media/toocheap/toocheap.html |title=Too Cheap to Meter? |accessdate=2007-06-17 |date=2007-03-30 |publisher=[[Canadian Nuclear Society]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204122504/http://www.cns-snc.ca/media/toocheap/toocheap.html |archivedate=2007-02-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Shippingport Atomic Power Station|Shippingport]] reactor went online in 1957 it produced electricity at a cost roughly ten times that of coal-fired generation. Scientists at the AEC's own Brookhaven Laboratory "wrote a 1958 report describing accident scenarios in which 3,000 people would die immediately, with another 40,000 injured".&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

However Shippingport was an experimental reactor using highly enriched uranium (unlike most power reactors) and originally intended for a (cancelled) nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. [[Kenneth Nichols]] was a consultant for the [[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant|Connecticut Yankee]] and [[Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station|Yankee Rowe]] nuclear power stations wrote that while considered "experimental" and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, they "became competitive because of inflation... and the large increase in price of coal and oil." He wrote that for nuclear power stations the capital cost is the major cost factor over the life of the plant, hence "antinukes" try to increase costs and building time with changing regulations and lengthly hearings, so that "it takes almost twice as long to build a (US-designed boiling-water or pressurised water) atomic power plant  in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea." French pressurised-water nuclear plants produce 60% of their electric power, and have proven to be much cheaper than oil or coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nichols |first= Kenneth David |title= The Road to Trinity: A Personal Account of How America's Nuclear Policies Were Made |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year=  |publisher= William Morrow and Company |location= New York |isbn= 0-688-06910-X |oclc= 15223648 |page= 344 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Fear of possible atomic attack from the Soviet Union caused U.S. school children to participate in "duck and cover" civil defense drills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-kelly/remember-duck-and-cover-w_b_774134.html Remember Duck and Cover?

=== Atomic City ===
During the 1950s, Las Vegas, Nevada, earned the nickname "Atomic City" for becoming a hotspot where tourists would gather to watch above-ground nuclear weapons tests taking place at [[Nevada Test Site]]. Following the detonation of Able, one of the first atomic bombs dropped at the Nevada Test Site, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce began advertising the tests as an entertainment spectacle to tourists.

Most parties started at midnight and musicians would perform at the venues until 4.00AM when the party would briefly stop so guests could silently watch the detonation. Some casinos  capitalised on the tests further by creating atomic cocktails, a mixture of vodka, cognac, sherry and champagne. 

Meanwhile, groups of tourists would drive out into the desert with family or friends to watch the detonations. 

Despite the health risks associated with nuclear fallout, tourists and viewers were told to simply "shower". Later on, however, anyone who had worked at the testing site or lived in areas exposed to nuclear fallout fell ill and had higher chances of developing cancer or suffering pre-mature deaths.&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loria |first1=Kevin |title=Nuclear explosions from the past are still causing cancer and health problems today |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-explosion-fallout-cancer-health-effects-2017-8 |accessdate=24 October 2018 |publisher=Business Insider |date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1960s ==

By exploiting the peaceful uses of the "friendly atom" in medical applications, earth removal and, subsequently, in nuclear power plants, the nuclear industry and government sought to allay public fears about nuclear technology and promote the acceptance of [[nuclear weapons]]. At the peak of the Atomic Age, the United States government initiated [[Operation Plowshare]], involving "peaceful nuclear explosions". The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] chairman announced that the Plowshares project was intended to "highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/69/5/56.full |title=Nuclear denial: From Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=Charles Perrow |date=September–October 2013 |volume=69 |issue=5 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Plowshare|Project Plowshare]] “was named directly from the Bible itself, specifically Micah 4:3, which states that God will beat swords into ploughshares, and spears into pruning hooks, so that no country could lift up weapons against another”.&lt;ref name=bks171/&gt; Proposed uses included widening the [[Panama Canal]], constructing a new sea-level waterway through [[Nicaragua]] nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting underground caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. It was proposed to plant underground atomic bombs to [[shale oil extraction|extract shale oil]] in eastern [[Utah]] and western [[Colorado]]. Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground [[aquifer]]s in [[Arizona]]. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of [[California]]'s [[Sacramento Valley]] for a water transport project.&lt;ref name=bks171/&gt; However, there were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions.&lt;ref name=bks171/&gt; Consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, tritium-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, due in large part to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.&lt;ref name=bks171&gt;[[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] (2011). ''[[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy'', [[World Scientific]], pp. 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' TV series, a set of vehicles was presented that were imagined to be completely nuclear, as shown in cutaways presented in their comic-books.

The term "atomic age" was initially used in a positive, futuristic sense, but by the 1960s the threats posed by [[nuclear weapon]]s had begun to edge out nuclear power as the dominant motif of the atom.

== 1970 to 2000 ==
[[File:View of Chernobyl taken from Pripyat.JPG|thumb|A photograph taken in the abandoned city of [[Pripyat (city)|Pripyat]]. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant can be seen on the horizon.]]

French advocates of nuclear power developed an aesthetic vision of nuclear technology as art to bolster support for the technology. Leclerq compares the nuclear cooling tower to some of the grandest architectural monuments of western culture:&lt;ref name=jbsh/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The age in which we live has, for the public, been marked by the nuclear engineer and the gigantic edifices he has created. For builders and visitors alike, nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century. Their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious, religious fulfilment and industrial achievement, the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration, utopia come true and the continued search for harmony.&lt;ref name=jbsh&gt;John Byrne and Steven M. Hoffman (1996). ''Governing the Atom: The Politics of Risk'', Transaction Publishers, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1973, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] predicted that, by the turn of the 21st century, one thousand reactors would be producing electricity for homes and businesses across the USA. But after 1973, reactor orders declined sharply as electricity demand fell and construction costs rose. Many orders and partially completed plants were cancelled.&lt;ref name="Mortal Hands p. 283"/&gt;

Nuclear power has proved controversial since the 1970s. [[High-level radioactive waste management|Highly radioactive materials]] may overheat and escape from the reactor building. Nuclear waste ([[spent nuclear fuel]]) needs to be regularly removed from the reactors and disposed of safely for up to a million years, so that it does not pollute the environment. Recycling of [[nuclear waste]] has been discussed, but it creates [[plutonium]] which can be used in weapons, and in any case still leaves much unwanted waste to be stored and disposed of. Large, [[geologic repository|purpose-built facilities]] for long-term disposal of nuclear waste have been difficult to site, and have not yet reached fruition.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research report, [https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42853.pdf Nuclear Energy: Overview of Congressional Issues], CRS Report, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, nuclear power suffered a remarkable international destabilization, as it was faced with economic difficulties and widespread [[anti-nuclear movement|public opposition]], coming to a head with the [[Three Mile Island accident]] in 1979, and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, both of which adversely affected the nuclear power industry for decades thereafter. A cover story in the February 11, 1985, issue of ''[[Forbes magazine]]'' commented on the overall management of the nuclear power program in the United States:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The failure of the U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history, a disaster on a monumental scale … only the blind, or the biased, can now think that the money has been well spent. It is a defeat for the U.S. consumer and for the competitiveness of U.S. industry, for the utilities that undertook the program and for the private enterprise system that made it possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Follies", a February 11, 1985 cover story in ''[[Forbes magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, in a period just over 30 years, the early dramatic rise of nuclear power went into equally meteoric reverse. With no other energy technology has there been a conjunction of such rapid and revolutionary international emergence, followed so quickly by equally transformative demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629614000036 |title=Transforming power |volume=1 |pages=83 |author=[[Andy Stirling]] |date=2014 |work=Energy Research and Social Science |doi=10.1016/j.erss.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, the label of the "Atomic Age" connotes either a sense of [[nostalgia]] or [[Naivety|naïveté]], and is considered by many to have ended with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, though the term continues to be used by many historians to describe the era following the conclusion of the [[Second World War]]. Atomic energy and weapons continue to have a strong effect on world politics in the 21st century. The term is used by some [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] to describe not only the era following the conclusion of the Second World War but also [[contemporary history]] up to the present day.

Until 1937, there was a [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] [[synagogue]] in Beltinci. It was built in 1860 and served the local Jewish community. On April 26, 1944, all of the Jews of the town were deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp, from which none of them returned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inv.si/psja/spomin/ebeltinc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[parish church]] in the settlement is dedicated to [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Saint Ladislaus]] and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Murska Sobota]]. It dates from 1742 with late 19th-century alterations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number 2871&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CNN effect''' is a phenomenon in [[political science]] and [[media studies]] which states that [[CNN]]'s use of shocking images of humanitarian crises around the world compels U.S. policy makers to intervene in humanitarian situations they may not otherwise have an interest in.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilboa|first=Eytan|date=2005|title=The CNN Effect: The Search for a Communication Theory of International Relations|url=http://www.guillaumenicaise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-cnn-effect.pdf|journal=Political Communication|volume=|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] international television news channel known as [[CNN|Cable News Network]] or CNN, had a major impact on the conduct of [[State (polity)|states]]' [[foreign policy]] in the late [[Cold War]] period and that CNN and its subsequent industry competitors have had a similar impact in the [[post Cold War era]]. While the [[Freedom of the press|free press]] has, in its role as the "[[Fourth Estate]]," always had an influence on policy-making in [[representative democracy|representative democracies]], proponents of the CNN effect argue that the extent, depth, and speed of the new global media have created a new species of effects qualitatively different from those that preceded them.&lt;ref name="livingston"&gt;Livingston, Steven. ''[http://shorensteincenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/r18_livingston.pdf Clarifying the CNN Effect: An Examination of Media Effects According to Type of Military Intervention]'' ([[PDF]]). [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]'s [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] at [[Harvard University]]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Piers|title=The CNN Effect: The Myth of News Media, Foreign Policy and Intervention|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|ISBN=9780415259057}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term's coinage reflects the pioneering role played by the network CNN in the field, whose "saturation coverage" of [[news|event]]s like the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985-1991)|fall of Communism in eastern Europe]], the first [[Gulf War]], and the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] was viewed as being strongly influential in bringing images and issues to the immediate forefront of [[United States|American]] political consciousness and beyond. ''':''' Additionally, the CNN effect was the driving force behind the U.S. intervention of the Kurdish crisis and use of force by the army during the Bosnia war of 1992-1995.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Piers|date=20 August 2006|title=The CNN Effect Revisited|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/07393180500288519|journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication|volume=20 |issue=4|pages=344–349|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these origins, the term as used generally refers to a broad range of real time modern media, and is not exclusive to CNN or even [[24-hour news cycle]] broadcast [[United States cable news|cable news]].

==Research==
In his research paper ''Clarifying the CNN Effect: An examination of Media Effects According to Type of Military Intervention'', [[George Washington University]] professor Steven Livingston identifies three distinct aspects that fall under the broad term of the CNN effect. The media may function alternately or simultaneously as &lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) a ''policy agenda-setting agent'', (2) an ''impediment'' to the achievement of desired policy goals, (3) an ''accelerant'' to policy decision-making. (Italics in original).&lt;ref name="livingston" /&gt; and (4) one of the common grounds of CNN effect is policy uncertainty; as policy certainty reduces, media influence increases and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By focusing instantaneous and ongoing media coverage on a particular conflict, international incident, or [[diplomacy|diplomatic initiative]], the [[news cycle]] effectively demands political attention, as governing politicians attempt to demonstrate that they are "on top of" current issues. The effect has been, according to Margaret Belknap, that "[t]he advent of real time news coverage has led to immediate public awareness and scrutiny of [[military strategy|strategic decisions]] and [[military operation]]s as they unfold".&lt;ref name="belknap"&gt;Belknap, Margaret H. [http://www.iwar.org.uk/psyops/resources/cnn-effect/Belknap_M_H_01.pdf ''The CNN Effect: Strategic Enabler or Operational Risk?''] ([[PDF]]). [[U.S. Army War College]] Strategy Research Project. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Deeper penetration and wider broadcast of statements and actions by public figures may increase [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]], but it can also complicate sensitive diplomatic relationships between states or force an official reaction from [[government]]s that would otherwise prefer to minimize political risk by remaining noncommittal. The information revolution and spread of [[globalization|global]] [[mass media]] through the Internet and international 24-hour news thus accelerates the policy-making process, requiring a faster tempo of decision and action to forestall the appearance of a leadership vacuum.

Former Secretary of State [[James Baker]] said of the CNN effect "The one thing it does, is to drive policymakers to have a policy position. I would have to articulate it very quickly. You are in real-time mode. You don't have time to reflect." His former press secretary, Margaret Tutwiler, mirrors his sentiment: "Time for reaction is compressed. Analysis and intelligence gathering is out."&lt;ref name="livingston" /&gt;

==Natural Disasters and the "CNN Effect"==
While the "CNN effect" most commonly refers to the effect that [[news media]] have on politics and government during political conflict, its effect on decisions made during natural disasters is also noteworthy. As videos and images are broadcast worldwide immediately after or even during natural disasters, these images may convince the public to donate money or pressure governments for immediate action.

The "CNN effect" may have played a role in increasing aid following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Asian tsunami]] (2004), the [[2005 Kashmir Earthquake|Kashmir earthquake]] (2005), [[Hurricane Katrina]] (2005), and the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake in China]] (2008). Following the Asian tsunami, for instance, the media "blitz" that followed this natural disaster may have helped prompt an unprecedented outpouring of donations. "By February 2005, the international community had donated $500 per person affected by the tsunami, compared to just 50 cents for each person affected by [[Uganda]]’s 18-year war."&lt;ref name="shah"&gt;Shah, Anup.

'''Carlos Viegas Gago Coutinho''', [[Order of the Tower and Sword|GCTE]], [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|GCC]], generally known simply as '''Gago Coutinho''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈkaɾluʒ ˈvjeɣɐʒ ˈɣaɣu kowˈtĩɲu}}; 17 February 1869 – 18 February 1959) was a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] geographer, cartographer, naval officer, historian and aviator. An [[aviation]] pioneer, Gago Coutinho and [[Sacadura Cabral]] were the [[first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic|first to cross the South Atlantic Ocean by air]], from March to June 1922, from [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvc.instituto-camoes.pt/ciencia/p25.html Gago Coutinho Biography (Portuguese)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born in Belém, [[Lisbon]], in a modest family, the son of José Viegas Gago Coutinho and her cousin, Fortunata Maria Coutinho. He finished high school in 1885, and entered the Polytechnic School, where he studied for one year, as preparation for his enterance at the [[Naval School (Portugal)|Naval School]], in Alfeite, [[Almada]], in 1886. 

==Naval and geographical career==
He joined the Navy in 1886 as an aspirant. In 1890, he was promoted to marine guard, in 1891 to second lieutenant, and in 1895 to first lieutenant. In 1907 he was promoted to captain-lieutenant and in 1915 to captain-of-frigate. In 1920 he became captain of sea-and-war. In 1922 he was promoted to vice-admiral, and in 1958 to admiral. During his first Navy years, he did several travels, being the first in the corvette "Afonso de Albuquerque", from 7 December 1888 to 16 January 1891, where he traveled to [[Mozambique]] as a member of the Naval Division of Eastern Africa. He did several naval travels the following years, until 31 March 1898, when he did his first commission as a overseas geographer, in [[Portuguese Timor]]. Since March 1898, Gago Coutinho activisties were developed mostly at the Cartography Commission, created in 1883. From 27 July 1898 to 19 April 1899, he was involved in field work, working at the delimitation of the borders and at the survey of the geographical chart of the most remote Portuguese colony. After is return to Portugal, he was assigned to work at the delimitation of the borders of [[Niassa]] territory in [[Mozambique]], from 5 September 1900 to 28 February 1901. He then moved to [[Angola]], where he worked at the delimitation of [[Noqui]]'s borders, until the end of 1901. He returned to [[Mozambique]], working for the borders delimitation in [[Tete]] district, between 27 February 1904 and 18 December 1905.

Gago Coutinho was nominated head of the Geodesical Mission of Eastern Africa in May 1907, a post he held until the beginning of 1911. It was during his assignment that he met Portuguese aviator pioneer [[Artur de Sacadura Cabral]], who become his close friend and who would be his mentor for future aviation projects. Afterwards, he led the Portuguese mission that delimited [[Angola]] borders in Barotze, which was formed in 1912. The year after his return to [[Portugal]], he was nominated the head of the Geodesical Mission of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], in 1915, which he was until middle 1919. In 1917, Gago Coutinho and [[Artur de Sacadura Cabral]] did their first flights together. In 1919, incentivated by his friend, he started to dedicate himself to the improvement of the aerial navigation methods. They took several flights together to study the methods, the most important was the first flight from [[Lisbon]] to [[Funchal]], in [[Madeira]], in 1919. [[Artur de Sacadura Cabral]] had already delineated by them the project of making the first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic, meant to take place in 1922, the year of the second centennial of the independence of [[Brazil]]. 

==First aerial crossing of the South Atlantic==
{{Main|First aerial crossing of the South Atlantic}}
The [[Fairey IIIB]] seaplane named ''Lusitânia'' used by Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral for their transatlantic flight did not have enough fuel capacity to make the entire trip unaided so various stops were made along the way and the aviators were shadowed by a support ship, ''República''. On the journey down the Brazilian coast a heavy rain storm caused the aircraft's engine to fail and the aviators were forced to ditch in the ocean. Realizing that something was wrong, the ''República'' sent out a distress signal asking other ships in the area to look out for the seaplane. After some time in the water, the aviators were found by a British freighter. The ''Paris City'' of the [[Reardon Smith Line]], under Captain A.E. Tamlyn, en route from Cardiff to Rio, rescued Coutinho and Cabral; they completed their journey with a new aircraft. A commemorative painting of the rescue was made by the Portuguese painter and cartoonist [[José Stuart Carvalhais]].

==Inventions==
Gago Coutinho invented a type of [[sextant]] incorporating two spirit levels to provide an artificial horizon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mat.uc.pt/~helios/Mestre/Novemb00/H61if_2.htm History of the Sextant] includes a photograph of a Gago Coutinho spirit level attachment.&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation of the traditional marine sextant allowed navigation without visual reference to the real horizon. He also invented an optical [[flight instrument]], to be mounted on the plane's cockpit floor, which measures leeway in flight whenever ground remains visible.

==Historian work==
He dedicated himself to the nautical history of the [[Portuguese Discoveries]] after 1924. His vast body of work later would be published in ''A Náutica dos Descobrimentos'' (''The Nautical of the Discoveries'') (1951-1952), in two volumes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1267">The '''Chronicle of the 24 Generals of the Order of the Friars Minor''' ({{lang-la|Chronica XXIV Generalium Ordinis Fratrum Minorum}}) is a medieval chronicle written in [[Latin]] around 1370, possibly by the [[Franciscan monk]] [[Arnaud de Sarrant]], though [[Ralf Lützelschwab]] doubts this attribution. The work deals with the history of Franciscan Order from its foundation by Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] to [[Leonardo Rossi]] (1373–1378), the 24th [[List of Ministers General of the Order of Friars Minor|Minister General]] if counting Francis as the first. The chronicle contains detailed accounts of various miracles and martyrs. For example, the Chronicle describes the deaths of [[Berard_of_Carbio|Berard]] and his companions, the first Franciscan martyrs, killed in Morocco in 1221. Overall, the Chronicle was heavily used by later Franciscan historians.

It is the earliest extant source for the incarceration of [[Roger Bacon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">'''Classical reception studies''' is the study of how the [[Classics|Classical world]], especially [[Ancient Greek literature]] and [[Latin literature]], have been received since antiquity. Influenced by [[reception theory]], it departs from the [[Classical tradition]] in various ways.

==Definition==
[[Lorna Hardwick]] and [[Christopher Stray]] assert that Classical reception studies is devoted to examining "the ways in which Greek and Roman material has been transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, rewritten, re-imaged and represented".{{sfn|Hardwick|Stray|2008|p=1}} Martindale notes that Classical reception "encompasses all work concerned with postclassical material".{{sfn|Martindale|2006|p=1}}

Hardwick and Stray state that scholars of reception studies hold the relationship between the ancient and modern to be reciprocal, although they acknowledge that others believe that reception studies only shed light on the receiving society, and not on the ancient text or its context.{{sfn|Hardwick|Stray|2008|p=4}}

'''Common heritage of mankind''' (also termed the '''common heritage of humanity''', '''common heritage of humankind''' or '''common heritage principle''') is a principle of [[international law]] which holds that defined territorial areas and elements of humanity's common heritage (cultural and natural) should be held in trust for future generations and be protected from exploitation by individual [[nation states]] or [[corporations]].

==Origins==
In his essay ''Toward Perpetual Peace'', [[Immanuel Kant]] claimed that the expansion of hospitality with regard to "use of the right to the earth's surface which belongs to the human race in common" would "finally bring the human race ever closer to a cosmopolitan constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant. 'Toward Perpetual Peace' in Practical Philosophy-Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Gregor MJ (trans.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1999. p 329 (8:358).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''Common Heritage of Mankind'', however, was first mentioned in the preamble to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The Hague 14 May 1954 http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html accessed 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of 'Mankind' is also mentioned in outer space treaties.&lt;ref&gt;The 1972 Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, Mar. 29, 1972, 24 U.S.T. 2389, 961 U.N.T.S. 187 (entered into force Sept. 1, 1972) and the 1975 Convention on Registration of Objects Launched Into Outer Space, Jan. 14, 1975, 28 U.S.T. 695, 1023 U.N.T.S. 15 (entered into force Sept. 15, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Mankind' as a subject in international law also appears in the Preamble of the [[United Nations Charter]], the Preamble of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] (1949) and the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (1968).&lt;ref name=Gyula04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gyula Gál |title=Some Remarks to General Clauses of Treaty Space Law |journal=Miskolc Journal of International Law (Miskolci Nemzetközi Jogi Közlemények) |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law of the Sea Treaty ==
[[File:Oceans.png|150px|left|thumb|Map of the world's oceans]]
In 1970, [[United Nations General Assembly]] Resolution 2749, the ''Declaration of Principles Governing the Seabed and Ocean Floor'', was adopted by 108 nation states and stated that the deep seabed should be preserved for peaceful purposes and is the "Common Heritage of Mankind."&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Res. 2749 (XXV), ¶ 1, U.N. Doc. A/RES/25/2749 (Dec. 12, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the Common Heritage of Mankind concept was stated to relate to "the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction" under Article 136 of the [[United Nations]] [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (UNCLOS).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea art. 1, para. 1, Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.N.T.S. 397 [UNCLOS]&lt;/ref&gt;

Payoyo argues that the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in Part XI of the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] should favour developing states (who were the voice of [[conscience]] in establishing it), and not merely in some transient 'affirmative action' manner.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p 326.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims, however, that the 1994 ''Implementation Agreement'' facilitated control by industrialised countries of the [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA), allowing access by the private sector to the deep [[sea bed]] and inhibiting constructive dialogue on sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Payoyo PB. Cries of the Sea. World Inequality, Sustainable Development and the Common Heritage of Humanity. Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague. 1997 {{ISBN|90-411-0504-2}} p458.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core conceptual components==
Maltese Ambassador [[Arvid Pardo]], one of the founders of the ''common heritage of humanity'' concept under international law, has claimed that it challenges the "structural relationship between rich and poor countries" and amounts to a "revolution not merely in the law of the sea, but also in international relations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pardo A |title=Ocean, Space and Mankind |journal=Third World Quarterly |volume=6 |pages=559–69 |year=1984 |doi=10.1080/01436598408419785 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main architects of the principle under international space law has claimed that it is "the most important legal principle achieved by man throughout thousands of years during which law has existed as the regulating element of social exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Cocca A. Introduction to the Study of the Legal Framework for Economic Activity in Space. Cordoba, 1982. p159 cited in {{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 250 fn11 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; This praise relates to the fact that [[international law]] in the ''common heritage of humanity'' principle is seeking to protect, respect and fulfill the interests of human beings independently of any politically motivated [[sovereign state]]; the concept covering all humans wherever they are living, as well as future generations.&lt;ref name=Gyula04/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Prue|title=Common Heritage of Mankind: A Bibliography of Legal Writing|date=2013|publisher=Fondation de Malte|location=Malta|isbn=978-1-291-57725-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Common-Heritage-Mankind-Bibliography-Writing/dp/1291577254/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392109201&amp;sr=1-4|author2=Stroud, Lucy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frakes has identified five core components of the Common Heritage of Humanity concept.&lt;ref name=Frakes03&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frakes, Jennifer |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind Principle and the Deep Seabed, Outer Space, and Antarctica: Will Developed and Developing Nations Reach a Compromise? |journal=Wisconsin International Law Journal |volume=21 |pages=409 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, there can be no private or public appropriation; no one legally owns common heritage spaces. Second, representatives from all nations must manage resources contained in such a territorial or conceptual area on behalf of all since a commons area is considered to belong to everyone; this practically necessitating a special agency to coordinate shared management. Third, all nations must actively share with each other the benefits acquired from exploitation of the resources from the commons heritage region, this requiring restraint on the profit-making activities of private corporate entities; this linking the concept to that of [[global public good]]. Fourth, there can be no weaponry or military installations established in territorial commons areas. Fifth, the commons should be preserved for the benefit of future generations, and to avoid a "[[tragedy of the commons]]" scenario.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; Academic claims have been made that where the principle requires the establishment of an international resource management regime, prior to establishment of such a regime a [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on resource exploitation should be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Narayana RK |title=Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=21 |pages=275 |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sehgal N |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind and the Moon Treaty |journal=Indian Journal of International Law |volume=26 |issue= |pages=112 |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a position does not appear to have been supported by most states during the respective drafting negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Danilenko GM |title=The Concept of the "Common Heritage of Mankind" in International Law |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law |volume=XIII |pages=247–63 at p 259 |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Destroyed Statue, July 17, 2005 at 15-53.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Bamian Valley]] - UNESCO World Heritage listed site in [[Afghanistan]], showing destroyed [[Buddha]] statue.]]
A similar principle of international law holds that the world's [[cultural heritage|cultural]] and natural heritage (as nominated for listing by nation states) must be protected by states parties to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. World Heritage Convention. http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/ (accessed 27 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study in the use of these provisions was provided by the [[Franklin Dam]] [[non-violent protest]] campaign against the construction of a dam of [[Australia]]'s last wild river; they being held by the [[Australian High Court]] to provide a valid basis for legislation protecting the [[Franklin River]]. Justice Lionel Murphy wrote in that case (''[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]'') about the Common Heritage of Humanity principle: "The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war&amp;nbsp;... [t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Commonwealth v Tasmania]] (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNESCO Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights==
{{main article|Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights}}
The UNESCO ''Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights'' declares in Article 1 that: "The [[human genome]] underlies the fundamental unity of all members of the human family, as well as the recognition of their inherent dignity and diversity. In a symbolic sense, it is the heritage of humanity." Article 4 states: "The human genome in its natural state shall not give rise to financial gains."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO.

== UNESCO Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Towards Future Generations ==
Proclaimed on November 12, 1997, the [[UNESCO]] ''Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Towards Future Generations'' is an international agreement (potentially part of international customary law) which includes provisions related to the ''common heritage of mankind''.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. Declaration on the Responsibilities of the Present Generations Towards Future Generations. 12 Nov. 1997. http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13178&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html accessed 4 Nov. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|'The present generations have the responsibility to bequeath to future generations an Earth which will not one day be irreversibly damaged by human activity.

==Potential applications==

It was argued at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] and has been advocated by academics that global communication between individuals over the [[internet]] should be regarded as part of the Common Heritage of Mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Henrik Spang-hanssen |title=Public International Computer Network Law Issues |publisher=Djoef Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=87-574-1486-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] or [[natural law]] perspective, it has been argued that for [[world peace]] to be achieved, [[laws]] and [[government]] [[policies]] should create the social preconditions whereby [[conscience]], properly understood, can be delinked from (often destructive) [[fundamentalist]] religious ideologies, and associated with a [[universal consciousness]], access to which is the Common Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffiths, Bede |title=A New Vision of Reality: Western Science, Eastern Mysticism and Christian Faith |publisher=Harpercollins/STL |year=1992 |page=276 |isbn=0-00-627636-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such thinking with associated implications about how a [[sustainable]] world in the future should be [[regulated]] is common to members of the [[Global Ecovillage Network]].&lt;ref&gt;William Thompson. Passages About the Earth: An Exploration of the New Planetary Culture. Rider and Co. London. 1974. Ch 7. 'To Findhorn and Lindisfarne' pp 150–183.&lt;/ref&gt; Equatorial countries have proposed that the [[geostationary orbit]] over the [[high seas]] should be declared the ''common heritage of mankind''.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries''. Bagota 3 Dec 1976. ITU Doc. WARC-BS (17 Jan 1977) 81-E. Reproduced: Journal of Space Law 1978; 6:193.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that a [[World government]] would manage common heritage areas according to principles of ''planetary democracy''.&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, Alexander. Why a World State is Inevitable. European Journal of International Relations. 2003; 9 (4): 491–542&lt;/ref&gt; The international law concept of common heritage of humanity has also been linked with [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabrera, Luis. Political Theory of Global Justice: A Cosmopolitan Case for the World State. London, Routledge. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Common heritage of humanity as a concept of international law is supported by many of the principles in the [[Earth Charter]] civil society Initiative&lt;ref&gt;Earth Charter http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/pages/Read-the-Charter.html accessed 5 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies about the principle==
[[File:NGC 6302 Hubble 2009.full.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[NGC 6302]] [[nebula]]. Militarization of [[Outer Space]] would be contrary to ''common heritage of humanity'' principles.]]Kemal Baslar has stated that the Common Heritage of Mankind principle "is a philosophical idea that questions the regimes of globally important resources regardless of their situation, and requires major changes in the world to apply its provisions. In other words, the application and enforcement of the common heritage of mankind require a critical reexamination of many well-established principles and doctrines of classical [[international law]], such as acquisition of territory, consent-based sources of international law, [[sovereignty]], [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[resource allocation]] and international personality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kemal Baslar |title=The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law |series=Developments in International Law |volume=30 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location=Dordrecht |year=1997 |isbn=90-411-0505-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''common heritage of humanity'' principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to the [[tragedy of the commons]] dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;Garrett Hardin, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 "The Tragedy of the Commons"], ''Science'', Vol. 162, No. 3859 (December 13, 1968), pp. 1243–1248. Also available [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf here] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott James Shackelford. 2008. "The Tragedy of the Common Heritage of Mankind"
Available at: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1407332 accessed 30 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of [[conscience]] in achieving justice and equality in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Axelrod, Robert M. |title=The evolution of cooperation |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-02121-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting [[economic rationalism]] on such social and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Appell, G. N. (1993). [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081217063416/http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00002203/01/HARDIN.pdf Hardin's Myth of the Commons: The Tragedy of Conceptual Confusions]. Working Paper 8. Phillips, ME: Social Transformation and Adaptation Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many that point out that as what we are seeking is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on [[Malthusian]] ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment.

The extent to which the Common Heritage of Mankind principle does or should control the activities of private [[multinational corporations]] as well as [[nation states]], particularly with regard to [[mining]] activities, remains controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nicholson G |title=The Common Heritage of Mankind and Mining: An Analysis of the Law as to the High Seas, Outer Space, the Antarctic, and World Heritage |journal=New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law |volume=6 |pages=177 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underdeveloped nations]] often see the principle as a means of protecting critical resources from exploitation by capitalist nations and their corporations.&lt;ref name=Frakes03/&gt; As world oil, coal and mineral reserves are depleted there will be increasing pressure to commercially exploit Common Heritage of Mankind areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyner CC |title=Legal Implications of the Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind |journal=International and Comparative Law Quarterly |volume=35 |pages=190 |year=1986 |doi=10.1093/iclqaj/35.1.190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears at the present time that exploration of outer space is unlikely to initially proceed under the jurisdiction of a supranational organization, but rather through the coordination of national space programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vereshchetin VS, Kamenetskaya EP |title=On the Way to a World Space Organization |journal=Annals of Air and Space Law  |volume=12 |pages=337 |year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that photosynthesis in its natural or artificial forms should be considered the common heritage of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA. (2011) Will international trade law promote or inhibit global artificial photosynthesis. Asian Journal of WTO and International Health Law and Policy (AJWH) 6: 313–347 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1935748 accessed 25 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Confusion is possible with David Hume or Home, Scottish minister at [[Duras, Lot-et-Garonne|Duras]] in France, a contemporary: they had quite different views on the union with England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hume|author2=Paul J.

==Life==
He was the second son of Sir David Hume or Home, seventh baron of [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]], a [[Roman Catholic]] traditionalist of the [[Merse (Scotland)|Merse]] (now Berwickshire), who had married an active [[Calvinist]] wife in Mary Johnston of Elphinstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hume|author2=Paul J. McGinnis|author3=Arthur H. Williamson|title=The British Union: a critical edition and translation of David Hume of Godscroft's De Unione Insulae Britannicae|year=2002|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-0340-5|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=14139|title=Hume, David, of Godscroft|first1=Paul J.|last1=McGinnis|first2=Arthur H.|last2=Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Dunbar]] grammar school, under [[Andrew Simson]]. He then entered the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1578, and after a course of study there travelled on the continent. From France he went on to [[Geneva]], intending to travel to Italy.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hume, David (1560?-1630?)|volume=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Simson, Andrew (d.1590?) |volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume was recalled to Scotland by the serious illness of his elder brother [[George Home (Comptroller of Scotland)|George]], returning about 1581.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Both brothers supported the [[Ruthven raid]] of 1582.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; In 1583 he was residing as private secretary with his relative [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus]], who was ordered, after [[James VI]] withdrew his confidence from the Ruthven lords, to remain in the north of Scotland.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

During the exile of the Ruthven party at Newcastle, Hume was in London, ostensibly studying, but actively interesting himself in Angus and his cause. The lords, with Hume, returned to Scotland in 1585, and between that date and 1588, when Angus died.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In later life Hume devoted himself to literature on his property of Gowkscroft, a farming hamlet 2 miles to the north of [[Abbey St. Bathans]], in the [[Lammermuir Hills]], Berwickshire, which he renamed Godscroft, and styled himself Theagrius when he figured as a Latin poet.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; 

==Works==

===Political and religious writings===
Hume supported his patron Angus's policy in a series of letters (preserved in the ''History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus'') on the doctrine of obedience to princes. A discussion of a sermon on the same theme by the [[John Craig (1512?-1600)|Rev. John Craig]] is the subject of ''Conference betwixt the Erle of Angus and Mr. David Hume,'' which is printed in [[David Calderwood]]'s ''History of the Kirk of Scotland''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Hume contests in this dialogue, based on actual conversation, the political theories of [[Jean Bodin]] and [[Adam Blackwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hume|author2=Paul J. McGinnis|author3=Arthur H. Williamson|title=The British Union: a critical edition and translation of David Hume of Godscroft's De Unione Insulae Britannicae|year=2002|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-0340-5|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1605 a [[union tract]] by [[Robert Pont (Scottish politician)|Robert Pont]] suggested Hume's treatise ''[[De Unione Insulæ Britanniæ]]'', a study in how to effect the closer political union of Scotland and England. The first part ''Tractatus I.'' was published in London (1605).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In terms of the [[Jacobean debate on the Union]], Hume went further than anyone else in looking to a unified "British society" to result from the [[Union of the Crowns]] of 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allan I. MacInnes|author2=Arthur H. Williamson|title=Shaping the Stuart World, 1603 – 1714: The Atlantic Connection ; &amp;#91;contains a Selection of Papers Presented at Two Symposia on the Shaping the Stuart World, 1603 – 1714, the First at the Huntington Library, Calif., in Jan. 2001 and the Second at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, in June 2002&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgdYwvIayvMC&amp;pg=PA46|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-14711-X|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the relative values of [[episcopacy]] and [[Presbytery (church polity)|presbytery]], Hume was a persistent polemicist in discussing the theme: first with [[James Law]], [[bishop of Orkney]], from 1608 to 1611; and secondly, in 1613, with [[William Couper (bishop)|William Cowper]], [[bishop of Galloway]]. He was also responsible about the same time for ''De Episcopatu, 1 May 1609, Patricio Simsono,'' to [[Patrick Simson]]. Hume's other major Latin prose writings are his unpublished attack on [[William Camden]] for his depreciatory view of Scotland, written in 1617—''Cambdenia; id est, Examen nonnullorum a Gulielmo Cambreno in "Britannia,"''—and a work dedicated to Charles I (Paris, 1626), entitled ''Apologia Basilica; seu Machiavelli Ingenium Examinatum, in libro quem inscripsit Princeps''.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

===Neo-Latin poetry===
Hume wrote Latin poems when very young, and received the commendation of [[George Buchanan]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; Buchanan was an intellectual leader for the Scottish [[Presbyterian]]s, among whom Hume was prominent, and as a close a follower as Buchanan had. In the end he showed dislike for the "angry" Buchanan, who had a quite different view of the Douglas family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hume|author2=Paul J. McGinnis|author3=Arthur H. Williamson|title=The British Union: a critical edition and translation of David Hume of Godscroft's De Unione Insulae Britannicae|year=2002|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-0340-5|page=19 note 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's ''Daphn-Amaryllis'' was a celebration of Anglo-Scottish union, printed in Edinburgh and London editions, in 1603–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steve Murdoch|author2=Andrew MacKillop|title=Fighting for Identity: Scottish Military Experience C. 1550–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc4stZF9hY8C&amp;pg=PR14|year=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=90-04-12823-9|page=xiv note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of four [[eclogue]]s, and drew on the ''Liber Pluscardensis'' and [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]]'s ''Historia'', in a setting of "[[leonine prophecy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Hume|author2=Paul J.

The ''Lusus Poetici'' (1605) were ultimately incorporated in [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]]'s ''Deliciæ Poetarum Scotorum'' (1637). When [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]] died, Hume wrote a memorial tribute entitled ''Henrici Principis Justa'', and in 1617 he welcomed the king back to Scotland in his ''Regi suo Gratulatio.'' His collected Latin poems were twice issued in Paris, in 1632 and 1639, the second time with additions under the care of his son James, and with the title: ''Davidis Humii Wedderburnensis Poemata Omnia. Accessere ad finem Unio Britannica et Prœlium ad Lipsiam soluta oratione.''&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

===Family history===
Hume was a partisan [[panegyric]]ist of the Douglas family. He is also said to have "plundered Scottish history for exemplars" within the Douglases, and with the aim of encouraging military services to the king.&lt;ref name="Brown2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith M. Brown|title=Noble Power in Scotland from the Reformation to the Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1g_K7LR1hqkC&amp;pg=PA122|year=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1298-7|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Williamson has argued that "Scots wrote histories of great families as general histories of Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Kidd|title=Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689–1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhTOqt4-wD8C&amp;pg=PA165|date=18 December 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52019-5|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grandson of Alison Douglas, herself a granddaughter of [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus]], Hume has as his main patron [[William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas|William Douglas, 11th Earl of Angus]], later the 1st Marquess of Douglas.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He is not thought an accurate historian, as far as Douglas involvement is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trevor Royle|title=The Mainstream Companion to Scottish Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8C1I7yD8wUC&amp;pg=PT279|date=6 January 2012|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=978-1-78057-419-6|page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's ''History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus'' was printed at Edinburgh in 1644 by Evan Tyler, the king's printer. He is thought to have finished the history between 1625 and 1630 (around the year of his death).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; The political message of the work includes the idea that direct action against "evil advisers" of a king is permissible to defend [[customary rights]]; and even against the king.&lt;ref name="LoewensteinMueller2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Loewenstein|author2=Janel Mueller|title=The Cambridge History of Early Modern English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J90cWIBoAPcC&amp;pg=PA480|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63156-3|page=480}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title-pages of early copies vary, with some having the title ''A Generall History of Scotland, together with a particular History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus''. Confusion arose when the editor, Anna Hume, encountered opposition of Angus, who resented the use which Hume had made of some of the material in the family archives.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; 

The work begins with [[Sholto Douglas]], conqueror of Donald Bane, and concludes with [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus]], who is eulogised in a Latin ode and numerous elegiacs. Another manuscript history of the family brings the record close to the death of [[William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus]], in 1611, and is ascribed to that earl. The tenth earl's son, William Douglas, is said to have threatened its publication in order that Hume's work might be superseded, but owing to the good offices of [[Drummond of Hawthornden]] the threat came to nothing.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Hume's ''History of the House of Wedderburn, written by a Son of the Family, in the year 1611,''  was a Latin eulogy, ''Davidis Humii de Familia Humia Wedderburnensi Liber''. It begins with David, the first laird of Wedderburn, about the end of the fourteenth century. It closes with an account of Hume's own early career in connection with that of his elder brother, to whom, along with the Earl of Home, it is dedicated. It remained in manuscript till 1839, when it was printed by the Abbotsford Club.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Davidis Humii de Familia Humia Wedderburnensi Liber'' (1839); [https://archive.org/details/davidishumiidefa00abbo archive.org.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Hume married in 1594 Barbara Johnston, widow of his friend James Haldane. They had five children.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; His daughter [[Anna Hume]] was known as an editor, and his son {{Interlanguage link multi|James Hume of Godscroft|fr|3=James Hume}} ({{fl.}} 1630) as a mathematician.

'''Gerald Massey''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|s|i}}; 29 May 1828 – 29 October 1907) was an English [[poet]] and writer on [[Spiritualism]] and [[Ancient Egypt]].

==Early life==
Massey was born near [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]] in England to poor parents.  When little more than a child,&lt;!--when exactly?--&gt; he was made to work hard in a silk factory, which he afterward deserted for the equally laborious occupation of [[straw plaiting]]. These early years were rendered gloomy by much distress and deprivation, against which the young man strove with increasing spirit and virility, educating himself in his spare time, and gradually cultivating his innate taste for literary work. He was attracted by the movement known as [[Christian socialism]], into which he threw himself with whole-hearted vigour, and so became associated with [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] and [[Charles Kingsley]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Massey, Gerald |volume=17 |page=867 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

From about 1870 onwards, Massey became increasingly interested in Egyptology and the similarities that exist between [[ancient Egyptian mythology]] and the [[Gospel]] stories. He studied the extensive Egyptian records housed in the [[Assyria]]n and [[Egyptology]] section of the [[British Museum]] in London where he worked closely with the curator, Dr. [[Samuel Birch]], and other leading Egyptologists of his day, even learning [[hieroglyphics]] at the time the [[Temple of Edfu|Temple of Horus at Edfu]] was first being excavated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Harpur]], 2004, [[The Pagan Christ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gerald Massey Collection-Upper Norwood Joint Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Writing career==

Massey's first public appearance as a writer was in connection with a journal called the ''[[Spirit of Freedom, and Working Man's Vindicator|Spirit of Freedom]]'', of which he became editor, and he was only twenty-two when he published his first volume of poems, ''Voices of Freedom and Lyrics of Love'' (1850). These he followed in rapid succession with ''The Ballad of Babe Christabel'' (1854), ''War Waits'' (1855), ''Havelock's March'' (1860), and ''A Tale of Eternity'' (1869).&lt;ref name= EB1911/&gt;

In 1889, Massey published a two-volume collection of his poems called ''My Lyrical Life''. He also published works dealing with [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], the study of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[sonnet]]s (1872 and 1890), and theological speculation. It is generally understood that he was the original of [[George Eliot]]'s [[Felix Holt, the Radical|Felix Holt]].&lt;ref name= EB1911/&gt;

Massey's poetry has a certain rough and vigorous element of sincerity and strength which easily accounts for its popularity at the time of its production. He treated the theme of [[Richard Grenville|Sir Richard Grenville]] before [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] thought of using it, with much force and vitality. Indeed, Tennyson's own praise of Massey's work is still its best eulogy, for the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Laureate]] found in him a poet of fine lyrical impulse, and of a rich half-Oriental imagination.&lt;ref name= EB1911/&gt; The inspiration of his poetry is a combination of his vast knowledge based on travels, research and experiences; he was a patriotic humanist to the core. His poem "The Merry, Merry May" was set to music in 1894 by the composer [[Cyril Rootham]] and then in a popular song by composer [[Christabel Baxendale]].

Massey was a believer in [[spiritual evolution]]; he opined that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution was incomplete without [[spiritualism]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory contains only one half the explanation of man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Massey, Concerning evolution, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In regard to [[Ancient Egypt]], Massey first published ''The Book of the Beginnings'', followed by ''The Natural Genesis''.  His most prolific work is ''Ancient Egypt: The Light of the World'', published shortly before his death.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Like [[Godfrey Higgins]] a half-century earlier, Massey believed that Western religions had Egyptian roots. Massey wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;The human mind has long suffered an eclipse and been darkened and dwarfed in the shadow of ideas the real meaning of which has been lost to moderns. Myths and allegories whose significance was once unfolded in the Mysteries have been adopted in ignorance and reissued as real truths directly and divinely vouchsafed to humanity for the first and only time! The early religions had their myths interpreted. We have ours misinterpreted. And a great deal of what has been imposed on us as God’s own true and sole revelation to us is a mass of inverted myths.&lt;ref&gt;Harpur, 2004, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Gerald|authorlink=Gerald Massey|title=The Natural Genesis: Or, Second Part of A Book of the Beginnings, Containing an Attempt to Recover and Reconstitute the Lost Origines of the Myths and Mysteries, Types and Symbols, Religion and Language, with Egypt for the Mouthpiece and Africa as the Birthplace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaI0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA13|volume=1|year=1883|publisher=Williams and Norgate|page=13|chapter=The Kamite Typology|quote=The human mind has long suffered an eclipse and been darkened and dwarfed in the shadow of ideas, the real meaning of which has been lost to the moderns.

One of the more important aspects of Massey's writings were his assertions that there were parallels between [[Jesus]] and the Egyptian god [[Horus]], primarily contained in the book ''The Natural Genesis'' first published in 1883. Massey, for example, argued in the book his belief that: both Horus and Jesus were born of virgins on 25 December, raised men from the dead (Massey speculates that the biblical [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], raised from the dead by Jesus, has a parallel in ''El-Asar-Us'', a title of [[Osiris]]), died by [[crucifixion]] and were resurrected three days later.&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Gerald. ''The Natural Genesis''. Cosimo Classics, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These assertions have influenced various later writers such as [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]], [[Tom Harpur]], [[Yosef Ben-Jochannan]], and [[Dorothy M. Murdock]].&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths?

==Criticism==
Christian theologian W. Ward Gasque, a Ph.D. from [[Harvard]] and Manchester University, sent emails to twenty Egyptologists that he considered leaders of the field – including [[Kenneth Kitchen]] of the University of Liverpool and Ron Leprohon of the University of Toronto – in Canada, the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany and Austria to verify academic support for some of these assertions. His primary targets were [[Tom Harpur]], [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]] and the [[Christ myth theory]], and only indirectly Massey. Ten out of twenty responded, but most were not named. According to Gasque, Massey's work, which draws comparisons between the Judeo-Christian religion and the Egyptian religion, is not considered significant in the field of modern Egyptology and is not mentioned in the ''[[Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt]]'' or similar reference works of modern Egyptology.&lt;ref name=test&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/6641.html The Leading Religion Writer in Canada ... Does He Know What He's Talking About?]&lt;/ref&gt; Gasque reports that those who responded were unanimous in dismissing the proposed etymologies for Jesus and Christ, and one unspecified Egyptologist referred to Alvin Boyd Kuhn's comparison as "fringe nonsense."&lt;ref name=test/&gt; However, Harpur's response to Gasque quotes leading contemporary Egyptologist [[Erik Hornung]] that there are parallels between Christianity and ancient Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary-afterword.asp |title=Harpur's archived response to Gasque |accessdate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513171957/http://www.tomharpur.com/documentary-afterword.asp |archivedate=13 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as do the writings of biblical expert [[Thomas L. Thompson]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Messiah Myth: The Near Eastern Roots of Jesus and David'' Thomas L. Thompson, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologian [[Stanley E. Porter]] has pointed out that Massey's analogies include a number of errors. For example, Massey stated that 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus was selected based on the birth of Horus, but the New Testament does not include any reference to the date or season of the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Porter18&gt;''Unmasking the Pagan Christ'' by Stanley E. Porter and Stephen J. Bedard 2006 {{ISBN|1894667719}} pages 18–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Egypt – The Light of the World'' by Gerald Massey (11 December 2008) {{ISBN|1595476067}} page 661&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lost Light: An Interpretation of Ancient Scriptures'' by Alvin Boyd Kuhn (11 June 2007) {{ISBN|1599868148}} page 674&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known source recognizing 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written around the beginning of the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the [[Annunciation|conception of Jesus]] took place at the [[Spring equinox]]. Hippolytus placed the equinox on 25 March and then added 9 months to get 25 December, thus establishing the date for festivals.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman [[Chronography of 354]] then included an early reference to the celebration of a Nativity feast in December, as of the fourth century. Porter states that Massey's serious historical errors often render his works nonsensical. For example, Massey states that the biblical references to [[Herod the Great]] were based on the myth of "Herrut" the evil [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] [[Snake|serpent]], while the existence of Herod the Great can be well established without reliance on Christian sources.&lt;ref name=Porter18/&gt;

'''Giuseppe Ferrari''' (7 March 1812 – 2 July 1876) was an Italian philosopher, historian and politician.

He was born at [[Milan]], studied Law at [[Pavia]] and graduated in 1831. A follower of Romagnosi and [[Giovan Battista Vico]], his first works were an article in the ''[[Biblioteca Italiana]]'' ("Italian Library") entitled "Mente di Gian Domenico Romagnosi" (1835), and a complete edition of the works of Vico, prefaced by an appreciation (1865).

Finding Italy uncongenial to his ideas, he went to France and, in 1839, produced in Paris his ''Vico ci l'Italie'', followed by ''La Nouvelle Religion de Campanella'' and ''La Théorie de l'erreur''. On account of these works he was made Docteur-ès‑lettres of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and professor of philosophy at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] (1840). His views, however, provoked antagonism, and in 1842 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at [[Strasbourg]]. After fresh trouble with the clergy, he returned to Paris and published a defence of his theories in a work entitled ''Idées sur la politique de Platon et d'Aristote''. After a short connection with the college at [[Bourges]], he devoted himself from 1849 to 1858 exclusively to writing. The works of this period are ''Les Philosophes Salariés, Machiavel juge des revolutions de notre temps'' (1849), ''La Federazione repubblicana'' (1851), ''La Filosofia della rivoluzione'' (1851), ''L'&amp;nbsp;Italia dopo il colpo di Stato'' (1852), ''Histoire des révolutions, ou Guelfes et Gibelins'' (1858).

[[File:Giuseppe Ferrari philosopher grave Milan 2015.jpg|thumb|alt=A marble gravestone on the wall of a crypt|Ferrari's grave at the [[Monumental Cemetery of Milan]], Italy]]
In 1859 he returned to Italy, where he opposed [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]], and upheld federalism against the policy of a single Italian monarchy. In spite of this opposition, he held chairs of philosophy at [[Turin]], Milan and Rome in succession, and during several administrations represented the college of [[Gavirate]] in the chamber. He was a member of the council of education and was made senator on 15 May 1876; but he died just six weeks later.

Amongst other works may be mentioned ''Histoire de la Raison d'État'', ''Corso di storia degli scrittori politici italiani'', and ''La China e l'Europa''. In the last mentioned work, Ferrari anticipated the emergence of [[superpower]]s, arguing that their emergence would destroy European dominance in favor of Russia, America, and, eventually, China. A skeptic in philosophy and a revolutionist in politics, rejoicing in controversy of all kinds, he was admired as a man, as an orator, and as a writer.

'''Hans Olof Hildebrand Hildebrand''' (5 April 1842 in [[Stockholm]] – 2 February 1913) was a Swedish archeologist. Born in Stockholm, he was the son of [[Bror Emil Hildebrand]] and Anna Mathilda Ekecrantz. He was the brother of Emil Hildebrand, and in 1867 married Elin Maria Charlotta Martin. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Hans-Olof-Hildebrand/6000000012614286609 Hans Olof Hildebrand]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hans&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Hildebrand|first=Bengt|title =Hans O H Hildebrand|encyclopedia =[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]]|year=1971–1973|publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]]|location =Stockholm |language=Swedish|volume=19|page=43|url =https://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=13584|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hildebrand, along with his father and his colleague [[Oscar Montelius]], is considered one of the fathers of Swedish archaeology. He worked both in [[archaeology]] and [[numismatics]], mainly of the High and Late [[Middle Ages]]. He is internationally known as one of the pioneers of the archaeological technique of [[typology (archaeology)|typology]].&lt;ref name="hans" /&gt;

Between 1895 and his death, Hildebrand was Director-General of the [[Swedish Academy]]. From 1879-1907 he was also Secretary to the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]] and Custodian of the National Heritage, ''[[riksantikvarie]]''. Whilst at the Academy of Letters he contributed to the foundation of the journal ''[[Fornvännen]]''. He was a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] from 1891.&lt;ref name="hans" /&gt; He gave the [[Rhind Lectures]] in 1896, on "Industrial arts of Scandinavia in pagan times".&lt;ref name="listing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socantscot.org/content/documents/public_rhind_lecturers_list.doc|title=List of 133 Lecturers|work=The Rhind Lectures|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]]|accessdate=27 November 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722055840/http://www.socantscot.org/content/documents/public_rhind_lecturers_list.doc| archivedate=July 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/industrialartsof00hild | title=The industrial arts of Scandinavia in the pagan time | publisher=Pub. for the Committee of Council on Education by [[Chapman &amp; Hall]] | author=Hildebrand, Hans | year=1883 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juan de Tecto''' (born in [[Ghent]], 1468; died in [[Honduras]], 1526) was a [[Belgium|Flemish]] [[missionary]] to the New World.

==Biography==
He graduated as [[D.D.]] in [[Paris]], and was for several years professor of theology in the [[Sorbonne University]], and afterward chaplain of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], and guardian of a convent of [[Franciscans]] at Ghent. In 1522 Charles V, who was much attached to him, gave him permission to go to the [[New World]].  Tecto settled at [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], where he founded missions for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and learned their language.

He accompanied [[Hernán Cortés]] in his expedition to [[Hibueras]] in 1525, and as, owing to the rebellion of [[Cristobal de Olid]], no provisions were obtainable, Tecto, exhausted, fell behind the army, and was found later by a patrol leaning against a tree, where he had died of hunger. According to [[Bernal Diaz del Castillo]], another source, he was sent by Cortés to report to the emperor about the conquest of Hibueras, and died at sea, off the coast of [[Spain]].

Tecto is the author of two works: ''Primeros rudimentos de la doctrina Cristiana en lengua Mexicana'' (Rudiments of Christian Doctrine in the Mexican Language), a manuscript which was utilized by Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] for his ''Catecismo Mexicano'' (Mexican [[catechism]]); and ''Apología del bautismo administrate á los gentiles Mexicanos con sola el agua y la forma Sacramental'', which is cited by [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] in his ''Monarquía Indiana''.

[[Baron]] '''Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ˈ|v|oʊ|l|ə}}; {{IPA-it|ˈɛːvola|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Evola cogn. |publisher=[[Rai Libri]] |encyclopedia=Dizionario d'Ortografia e di Pronunzia (DOP)  |url=http://www.dizionario.rai.it/poplemma.aspx?lid=61429&amp;r=90351 |accessdate=2018-10-23 &lt;!--Feb 13 2017--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 May 1898 – 11 June 1974), better known as '''Julius Evola''', was an Italian [[philosopher]], painter, and [[Western esotericism|esotericist]]. He has been described as a "fascist intellectual,"&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, vol 1''. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; a "radical traditionalist,"&lt;ref name="packer2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Packer |first=Jeremy |title=Secret agents popular icons beyond James Bond |location=New York |publisher=Lang |year=2009 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; "antiegalitarian, antiliberal, antidemocratic, and antipopular,"&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2004. p 89"&gt;Atkins, Stephen E. Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and as having been "the leading philosopher of Europe's neofascist movement."&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2004. p 89"/&gt;

Evola is popular in fringe circles, largely because of his extreme metaphysical, magical, and supernatural beliefs (including belief in ghosts, telepathy, and alchemy),&lt;ref&gt;Horrox, James. "Julius Evola". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 20 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and his extreme [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]] and [[misogyny]]. He himself termed his philosophy "magical idealism." Many of Evola's theories and writings were centered on his idiosyncratic [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], and esoteric religious studies,&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;  and this aspect of his work has influenced [[occult]]ists and esotericists. Evola also justified rape (among other forms of male domination of women) because he saw it "as a natural expression of male desire". This misogynistic outlook stemmed from his extreme right views on [[gender role]]s, which demanded absolute submission from women.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz /&gt;

According to the scholar Franco Ferraresi, "Evola's thought can be considered one of the most radical and consistent anti-egalitarian, [[Liberalism#Criticism and support|anti-liberal]], [[criticism of democracy|anti-democratic]], and anti-popular systems in the twentieth century. It is a singular (though not necessarily original) blend of several schools and traditions, including [[German idealism]], Eastern doctrines, traditionalism, and the all-embracing ''[[world view|Weltanschauung]]'' of the interwar [[conservative revolutionary movement]] with which Evola had a deep personal involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Franco Ferraresi|title=Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0DG3uk9o8oC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2211-4|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Aaron Gillette described Evola as "one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=Aaron|authorlink=Aaron Gillette|title=Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Gjq0ZPvIZgC|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-52706-9|chapter=7: Julia Evola and spiritual Nordicism, 1941-1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admired SS head [[Heinrich Himmler]], whom he once met.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola spent [[World War II]] working for the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; During his trial in 1951, Evola denied being a fascist and instead referred to himself as a "superfascist". Concerning this statement, historian Elisabetta Cassina Wolff wrote that "It is unclear whether this meant that Evola was placing himself above or beyond Fascism".&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

==Life==
Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola was born in Rome to a minor aristocratic family of Sicilian origins. He was a [[baron]]. Little is known about his early upbringing except that he considered it irrelevant. Evola studied engineering in Rome, but did not complete his studies because he "did not want to be associated in any way with [[bourgeois]] academic recognition and titles such as doctor and engineer."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"&gt;Paul Furlong, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVGkhzpXxLkC The Social and Political Thought of Julius Evola]''. London: Routledge, 2011. {{ISBN|9780203816912}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Evola, Cinabro"&gt;Julius Evola, Il Camino del Cinabro, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teenage years, Evola immersed himself in painting—which he considered one of his natural talents—and literature, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. He was introduced to philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Otto Weininger]]. Other early philosophical influences included [[Carlo Michelstaedter]] and [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola served in [[World War I]] as an [[artillery]] officer on the [[Asiago]] plateau. He was attracted to the [[avant-garde]] and after the war, Evola briefly associated with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]'s [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement. He became a prominent representative of [[Dada]]ism in Italy through his painting, poetry, and collaboration on the briefly published journal, ''Revue Bleue''. In 1922, after concluding that avant-garde art was becoming [[commercialized]] and stiffened by academic conventions, he reduced his focus on artistic expression such as painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;G.Evola, ''Il Camino del Cinabro'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=July 2017}}

Evola died on 11 June 1974 in Rome.&lt;ref name="treccani"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Luca Lo Bianco |language=it |title=EVOLA, Giulio Cesare Andrea |encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |trans-title=Biographical Dictionary of Italians |volume=43 |year=1993 |publisher=Treccani |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giulio-cesare-andrea-evola_(Dizionario-Biografico) |accessdate=2018-10-23 |quote=Morì a Roma l'11 giugno 1974 e le ceneri, per sua volontà, furono sepolte sul Monte Rosa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{how|date=June 2018}}

==Works==

===Christianity===
In 1928, Evola wrote an attack on Christianity titled ''Pagan Imperialism'', which proposed transforming fascism into a system consistent with ancient Roman values and the ancient mystery traditions. Evola proposed that fascism should be a vehicle for reinstating the caste system and aristocracy of antiquity. Although Evola invoked the term "fascism" in this text, his diatribe against the Catholic Church was criticized by both the fascist regime and the Vatican itself. [[A. James Gregor]] argued that the text was an attack on fascism as it stood at the time of writing, but noted that [[Benito Mussolini]] made use of it in order to threaten the Vatican with the possibility of an "anti-clerical fascism".&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gregor2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=A. James|authorlink1=A. James Gregor|title=The search for neofascism : the use and abuse of social science|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521676397}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–91}} On account of Evola's sentiment, the Vatican-backed right wing Catholic journal ''Revue Internationale des Sociétés Secrètes'' published an article in April 1928 entitled "Un Sataniste Italien: Julius Evola."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

''The Mystery of the Grail'' discarded Christian interpretations of the [[Holy Grail]]. Evola wrote that the Grail "symbolizes the principle of an immortalizing and transcendent force connected to the primordial state ... The mystery of the Grail is a mystery of a warrior initiation." He held that the Ghibellines, who fought the Guelph for control of Northern and Central Italy in the thirteenth century, had within them the residual influences of pre-Christian Celtic and Nordic traditions that represented his conception of the Grail myth. He also held that the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph victory against the Ghibellines]] represented a regression of the castes, since the merchant caste took over from the warrior caste.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt; In the epilogue to this text, Evola argued that the fictitious ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', regardless of whether it was authentic or not, was a cogent representation of modernity.&lt;ref name=Barber&gt;Richard W. Barber. ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief''. Harvard University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Richard Barber]] said, "Evola mixes rhetoric, prejudice, scholarship, and politics into a strange version of the present and future, but in the process he brings together for the first time interest in the esoteric and in conspiracy theory which characterize much of the later Grail literature."&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;

===Buddhism===
In ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', Evola argued that the [[Pāli Canon]] could be held to represent true [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; His interpretation of Buddhism is that it was intended to be anti-democratic. He believed that Buddhism revealed the essence of an "Aryan" tradition that had become corrupted and lost in the West. He believed it could be interpreted to reveal the superiority of a warrior caste.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; [[Harry Oldmeadow]] described Evola's work on Buddhism as exhibiting Nietzschean influence,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oldmeadow. ''Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions''. World Wisdom, Inc, 2004. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; but Evola criticized Nietzsche's anti-ascetic prejudice.&lt;ref name=forum&gt;T. Skorupski. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYSAAAAAQBAJ The Buddhist Forum, Volume 4]''. Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The book "received the official approbation of the Pāli [text] society", and was published by a reputable Orientalist publisher.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; Evola's interpretation of Buddhism, as put forth in his article "Spiritual Virility in Buddhism", is in conflict with the post-WWII scholarship of the Orientalist [[Giuseppe Tucci]], which argues that the viewpoint that Buddhism advocates universal benevolence is legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez. ''Curators of the Buddha: The Study of Buddhism Under Colonialism''. University of Chicago Press, 1995. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Versluis]] stated that Evola's writing on Buddhism was a vehicle for his own theories, but was a far from accurate rendition of the subject, and he held that much the same could be said of Evola's writing on Hermeticism.&lt;ref name=Versluis&gt;Arthur Versluis. ''Magic and Mysticism: An Introduction to Western Esoteric Traditions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2007. p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanavira Thera|Ñāṇavīra Thera]] was inspired to become a [[bhikkhu]] from reading Evola's text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'' in 1945 while hospitalized in [[Sorrento]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;

===Modernity===
Evola's ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'' is a text that promotes the mythology of an ancient [[Golden Age]]. In this work, Evola described the features of his idealized traditional society. Evola argued that modernity represented a serious decline from an ideal society. He argued that in the postulated Golden age, religious and temporal power were united. He wrote that society had not been founded on priestly rule, but by warriors expressing spiritual power. In mythology, he saw evidence of the West's superiority over the East. Moreover, he claimed that the traditional elite had the ability to access power and knowledge through a hierarchical version of magic which differed from the lower "superstitious and fraudulent" forms of magic.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola insists on "nonmodern forms, institutions, and knowledge" as being necessary to produce a "real renewal ... in those who are still capable of receiving it."&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; The text was "immediately recognized by [[Mircea Eliade]] and other intellectuals who allegedly advanced ideas associated with Tradition."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; Eliade, one of Evola's closest friends, was a fascist sympathizer associated with the Romanian fascist [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola was aware of the importance of myth from his readings of [[Georges Sorel]], one of the key intellectual influences on fascism.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; [[Hermann Hesse]] described ''Revolt Against the Modern World'' as "really dangerous."&lt;ref name=Sedgwick&gt;Mark Sedgwick. ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

E. C. Wolff noted that in ''Ride the Tiger'' "Evola argued that the fight against modernity was lost. The only thing a 'real man' could just do was to ride the tiger of modernity patiently". Evola wrote that the events of the period would have to run their course but he "did not exclude the possibility of action in the future." He argued that one should be ready to intervene when the tiger "is tired of running."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke notes that, "Evola sets up the ideal of the 'active nihilist' who is prepared to act with violence against modern decadence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to European Studies professor Paul Furlong, this text presents Evola's view that the potential "elite" should immunize itself from modernity and use "right wing anarchism" to rebel against it.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===Other writings===
In the posthumously published collection of writings, ''Metaphysics of War'', Evola, in line with the conservative revolutionary [[Ernst Jünger]], explored the viewpoint that war could be a spiritually fulfilling experience. He proposed the necessity of a transcendental orientation in a warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson. ''Ernst Junger – A Portrait''. Manticore Books, 2016. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] has written that Evola's 1945 essay "American 'Civilization'" described the United States as "the final stage of European decline into the 'interior formlessness' of vacuous individualism, conformity and vulgarity under the universal [[aegis]] of money-making." According to Goodrick-Clarke, Evola argued that U.S. "mechanistic and rational philosophy of progress combined with a mundane horizon of prosperity to transform the world into an enormous suburban shopping mall."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Occultism and esotericism==
Around 1920, Evola's interests led him into [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]], and "supra-rational" studies. He began reading various esoteric texts and gradually delved deeper into the occult, [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Oriental studies]], particularly [[Vajrayana|Tibetan Tantric]] [[yoga]]. A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences. After his return from the war, Evola experimented with [[hallucinogen]]s and magic.

When he was about 23 years old, Evola considered suicide. He claimed that he avoided suicide thanks to a revelation he had while reading an early Buddhist text that dealt with shedding all forms of identity other than absolute transcendence.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola would later publish the text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', which he regarded as a repayment of his debt to [[Buddhism]] for saving him from suicide.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;

Evola wrote prodigiously on Eastern mysticism, Tantra, [[hermeticism]], the myth of the Holy Grail and Western esotericism.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; German Egyptologist and esoteric scholar Florian Ebeling has noted that Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' is viewed as an "extremely important work on Hermeticism" in the eyes of esotericists.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Ebeling. ''The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from Ancient to Modern Times''. Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Evola gave particular focus to Cesare della Riviera's text ''Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi'', which he later republished in modern Italian. He held that Riviera's text was consonant with the goals of "high magic" – the reshaping of the earthly human into a transcendental 'god man'. According to Evola, the alleged "timeless" Traditional science was able to come to lucid expression through this text, in spite of the "coverings" added to it to prevent accusations from the church.&lt;ref name=Hermeticism/&gt; Though Evola rejected [[Carl Jung]]'s interpretation of alchemy, Jung described Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' as a "magisterial account of Hermetic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Hermeticism&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rNOYDQAAQBAJ Lux in Tenebris: The Visual and the Symbolic in Western Esotericism]''. BRILL, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', the philosopher Glenn Alexander Magee favored Evola's interpretation over that of Jung's.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition''. Cornell University Press, 2008. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a journal devoted to Hermetic thought published a section of Evola's book and described it as "Luciferian."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola later confessed that he was not a Buddhist, and that his text on Buddhism was meant to balance his earlier work on the Hindu ''tantras''.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; Evola's interest in [[tantra]] was spurred on by correspondence with [[John Woodroffe]].&lt;ref name="Gary Lachman 2012. p. 215"/&gt; Evola was attracted to the active aspect of tantra, and its claim to provide a practical means to spiritual experience, over the more "passive" approaches in other forms of Eastern spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Taylor. ''Sir John Woodroffe, Tantra and Bengal: 'An Indian Soul in a European Body?' ''. Routledge, 2012. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia'', Richard K. Payne, Dean of the Institute of Buddhist Studies, argued that Evola manipulated Tantra in the service of right wing violence, and that the emphasis on "power" in ''The Yoga of Power'' gave insight into his mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Payne. ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia''. Simon and Schuster, 2006. p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola advocated that "differentiated individuals" following the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path#Left-Hand Path|Left-Hand Path]] use dark violent sexual powers against the modern world. For Evola, these "virile heroes" are both generous and cruel, possess the ability to rule, and commit "Dionysian" acts that might be seen as conventionally immoral. For Evola, the Left Hand path embraces violence as a means of transgression.&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;{{rp|217}}

According to [[A. James Gregor]] Evola's definition of spirituality can be found in ''Meditations on the Peaks'': "what has been successfully actualized and translated into a sense of superiority which is experienced inside by the soul, and a noble demeanor, which is expressed in the body."&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|101–102}} Goodrick-Clarke wrote that Evola's "rigorous [[New Age]] spirituality speaks directly to those who reject absolutely the leveling world of democracy, capitalism, multi-racialism and technology at the outset of the twenty-first century. Their acute sense of cultural chaos can find powerful relief in his ideal of total renewal."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] wrote that to "read Evola is to take a trip through a weird and fascinating jungle of ancient mythologies, pseudo-ethnology, and transcendental mysticism that is enough to make any southern California consciousness-tripper feel quite at home."&lt;ref name=sheehanterror&gt;Thomas Sheehan. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7178 Italy: Terror on the Right]. ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 27, Number 21 &amp; 22, January 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magical idealism===
[[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] wrote that "Evola's first philosophical works from the 'twenties were dedicated to reshaping neo-idealism from a philosophy of Absolute Spirit and Mind into a philosophy of the "absolute individual" and action."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; Accordingly, Evola developed the doctrine of "[[magical idealism]]", which held that "the Ego must understand that everything that seems to have a reality independent of it is nothing but an illusion, caused by its own deficiency."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; For Evola, this ever-increasing unity with the "absolute individual" was consistent with unconstrained liberty, and therefore unconditional power.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; In his 1925 work ''Essays on Magical Idealism'', Evola declared that "God does not exist. The Ego must create him by making itself divine."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;

According to Sheehan, Evola discovered the power of metaphysical mythology while developing his theories. This led to his advocacy of supra-rational intellectual intuition over discursive knowledge. In Evola's view, discursive knowledge separates man from Being.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; Sheehan stated that this position is a theme in certain interpretations of Western philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] that was exaggerated by Evola.&lt;ref name=Sheehan&gt;Thomas Sheehan. ''Myth and Violence: The Fascism of Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist''. Social Research, XLVIII, 1 (Spring, 1981). 45–73&lt;/ref&gt; Evola would later write:

{{quote|The truths that allow us to understand the world of Tradition are not those that can be "learned" or "discussed." They either are or are not. We can only ''remember'' them, and that happens when we are freed from the obstacles represented by various human constructions (chief among these are the results and methods of the authorized "researchers") and have awakened the capacity to ''see'' from the nonhuman viewpoint, which is the same as the Traditional viewpoint ... Traditional truths have always been held to be essentially ''non-human''.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;}}

Evola developed a doctrine of the "two natures": the natural world and the primordial "world of 'Being'". He believed that these "two natures" impose form and quality on lower matter and create a hierarchical "great chain of Being."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; He understood "spiritual virility" as signifying orientation towards this postulated transcendent principle.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; He held that the State should reflect this "ordering from above" and the consequent hierarchical differentiation of individuals according to their "organic preformation". By "organic preformation" he meant that which "gathers, preserves, and refines one's talents and qualifications for determinate functions."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;

===Ur Group===
Evola was introduced to esotericism by [[Arturo Reghini]], who was an early supporter of fascism. Reghini sought to promote a "cultured magic" opposed to Christianity and introduced Evola to the traditionalist [[René Guénon]]. In 1927, Reghini and Evola, along with other Italian esotericists, founded the ''Gruppo di Ur'' ("[[Ur]] Group").&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; The purpose of this group was to attempt to bring the members' individual identities into such a superhuman state of power and awareness that they would be able to exert a magical influence on the world. The group employed techniques from Buddhist, Tantric, and rare Hermetic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Nevill Drury. ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2004. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; They aimed to provide a "soul" to the burgeoning Fascist movement of the time through the revival of [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and to influence the fascist regime through esotericism.&lt;ref&gt;Isotta Poggi. "Alternative Spirituality in Italy." In: James R. Lewis, J. Gordon Melton. ''Perspectives on the New Age.'' SUNY Press, 1992. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

Articles on occultism from the Ur Group were later published in ''Introduction to Magic''.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;ref name="Gary Lachman 2012. p. 215"&gt;Gary Lachman. ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen''. Quest Books, 2012. p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Reghini's support of [[Freemasonry]] would however prove a bone of contention for Evola; accordingly, Evola broke with Reghini in 1928.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Reghini himself broke from Evola, accusing Evola of plagiarizing his thoughts in the book ''Pagan Imperialism''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola, on the other hand, blamed Reghini for the premature publication of ''Pagan Imperialism''.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola's later work owed a considerable debt to René Guénon's text ''Crisis of the Modern World'',&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; though he diverged from Guénon on the issue of the relationship between warriors and priests.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===Views on sex and gender roles===
Julius Evola believed that the alleged higher qualities expected of a man of a particular race were not those expected of a woman of the same race. He held that "just relations between the sexes" involved women acknowledging their "inequality" with men.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; In 1925, he wrote an article titled ''"La donna come cosa"'' ("Woman as Thing").&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Evola later quoted [[Joseph de Maistre]]'s statement that "Woman cannot be superior except as woman, but from the moment in which she desires to emulate man she is nothing but a monkey."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Evola believed that [[women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] was "the renunciation by woman of her right to be a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Franco Ferraresi. ''Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War''. Princeton University Press, 2012. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; A woman "could traditionally participate in the sacred hierarchical order only in a mediated fashion through her relationship with a man."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He held, as a feature of his idealized gender relations, the Hindu [[sati (practice)|sati]], which for him was a form of sacrifice indicating women's respect for patriarchal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ben-Ghiat, M. Fuller. ''Italian Colonialism''. Springer, 2016. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; For the "pure, feminine" woman, "man is not perceived by her as a mere husband or lover, but as her lord."&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; Women would find their true identity in total subjugation to men.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola regarded matriarchy and goddess religions as a symptom of decadence, and preferred a hyper-masculine, warrior ethos.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann. ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition [6 volumes]: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. ABC-CLIO, 2010. p. 1085&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola was influenced by [[Hans Blüher]]; he was a proponent of the ''[[Secret society#Characteristics|Männerbund]]'' concept as a model for his proposed ultra-fascist "Order".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke noted the fundamental influence of [[Otto Weininger]]'s misogynist book ''[[Sex and Character]]'' on Evola's dualism of male-female spirituality. According to Goodrich-Clarke, "Evola's celebration of virile spirituality was rooted in Weininger's work, which was widely translated by the end of the First World War."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Unlike Weininger, Evola believed that women needed to be conquered, not ignored.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola denounced [[homosexuality]] as "useless" for his purposes. He did not neglect [[sadomasochism]], so long as sadism and masochism "are magnifications of an element potentially present in the deepest essence of [[eros]]."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Then, it would be possible to "extend, in a transcendental and perhaps [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] way, the possibilities of sex."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola held that women "played" with men, threatened their masculinity, and lured them into a "constrictive" grasp with their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; He wrote that "It should not be expected of women that they return to what they really are ... when men themselves retain only the semblance of true virility",&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; and lamented that "men instead of being in control of sex are controlled by it and wander about like drunkards".&lt;ref name=occult/&gt; He believed that in Tantra and in [[sex magic]], in which he saw a strategy for aggression, he found the means to counter the "emasculated" West.&lt;ref name=occult&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lycourinos|editor1-first=Damon Zacharias|title=Occult traditions|date=2012|publisher=Numen Books|isbn=9780987158130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOG3fu3dss4C|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arad |first1=Roy |title=How an Israeli Bookstore in Berlin Ended Up Accused of Nazi Recruitment |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-an-israeli-bookshop-in-berlin-ended-up-accused-of-nazi-recruitment-1.6053918 |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=Haaretz |date=May 3, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Annalisa Merelli, Evola "went so far as to justify rape" because he saw it "as a natural expression of male desire".&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; Evola also said that the "ritual violation of virgins",&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; and "whipping women" were a means of "consciousness raising",&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; so long as these practices were done to the intensity required to produce the proper "liminal psychic climate".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He wrote that "as a rule, nothing stirs a man more than feeling the woman utterly exhausted beneath his own hostile rapture."&lt;ref name=Merelli&gt;Annalisa Merelli. "[https://qz.com/909323/bannons-interest-for-julius-evola-unveils-the-sexism-at-the-core-of-trump/ Steve Bannon’s interest in a thinker who inspired fascism exposes the misogyny of the alt-right]". [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]. February 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola translated Weininger's ''Sex and Character'' into Italian. Dissatisfied with simply translating Weininger's work, he wrote the text ''Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex'', where his views on sexuality were dealt with at length.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; [[Arthur Versluis]] described this text as Evola's "most interesting" work aside from ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; This book remains popular among many New Age adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conner |first1=Randy P. |last2=Sparks |first2=David Hatfield |last3=Sparks |first3=Mariya |date=1997 |title=Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol, and Spirit: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Lore |publisher=Cassell |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on race==
{{anchor|Race}}
Evola's dissent from standard biological concepts of race had roots in his aristocratic elitism, since Nazi ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' ideology inadequately separated aristocracy from "commoners."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; According to Furlong, Evola developed "the law of the regression of castes" in ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'' and other writings on racism from the 1930s and World War II period. In Evola's view "power and civilization have progressed from one to another of the four castes—sacred leaders, warrior nobility, bourgeoisie (economy, 'merchants') and slaves".&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Furlong explains: "for Evola, the core of racial superiority lay in the spiritual qualities of the higher castes, which expressed themselves in physical as well as in cultural features, but were not determined by them. The law of the regression of castes places racism at the core of Evola's philosophy, since he sees an increasing predominance of lower races as directly expressed through modern mass democracies."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

In 1941, Evola's book ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' (Italian: ''Sintesi di Dottrina della Razza'') was published by [[Hoepli]]. It provides an overview of his ideas concerning race and [[eugenics]], introducing the concept of "spiritual racism",&lt;ref name="Rota2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rota|title=Intellettuali, dittatura, razzismo di stato|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGwiln0yQC4C&amp;pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=FrancoAngeli|isbn=978-88-568-2094-2|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "esoteric-traditionalist racism".&lt;ref name=cassata&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassata|first=Francisco|title=Building the New Man: Eugenics, Racial Science and Genetics in Twentieth-century Italy|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZKPeD6CyAC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=%22Sintesi+di+Dottrina+della+Razza%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the end of War, Evola had frequently used the term "Aryan" to mean the nobility, who in his view were imbued with traditional spirituality.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Wolff notes that Evola seems to have stopped writing about race in 1945, but adds that the intellectual themes of Evola's writings were otherwise unchanged. Evola continued to write about elitism and his contempt for the weak. His "doctrine of the Aryan-Roman 'super-race was simply restated as a doctrine of the 'leaders of men' ... no longer with reference to the SS, but to the mediaeval Teutonic knights of the Knights Templar, already mentioned in Rivolta."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Evola spoke of "inferior non-European races".&lt;ref name=Coogan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Kevin|title=Dreamer of the day : Francis Parker Yockey and the postwar fascist international|date=1999|publisher=Autonomedia|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9781570270390|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wa7AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Merkl wrote that "Evola was never prepared to discount the value of blood altogether". Evola wrote: "a certain balanced consciousness and dignity of race can be considered healthy" in a time where "the exaltation of the negro and all the rest, anticolonialist psychosis and integrationist fanaticism [are] all parallel phenomena in the decline of Europe and the West."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. ''Political Violence and Terror: Motifs and Motivations''. University of California Press, 1986. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; While not totally against race-mixing, in 1957, Evola wrote an article attributing the perceived acceleration of American decadence to the influence of "negroes" and the opposition to segregation. Furlong noted that this article is "among the most extreme in phraseology of any he wrote, and exhibits a degree of intolerance that leaves no doubt as to his deep prejudice against black people."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===National mysticism===
For his spiritual interpretation of the different racial psychologies, Evola found the work of German race theorist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss invaluable. Like Evola, Clauss believed that physical race and spiritual race could diverge as a consequence of [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola's racism included racism of the body, soul, and spirit, giving primacy to the latter factor, writing that "races only declined when their spirit failed."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Like [[René Guénon]], Evola believed that mankind is living in the [[Kali Yuga]] of the [[Hindu]] tradition—the Dark Age of unleashed, materialistic appetites. He argued that both Italian fascism and [[Nazism]] represented hope that the "celestial" Aryan race would be reconstituted.&lt;ref name=intellectuals&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Mussolini's Intellectuals: Fascist Social and Political Thought''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He drew on mythological accounts of super-races and their decline, particularly the [[Hyperborea]]ns, and maintained that traces of Hyperborean influence could be felt in Indo-European man. He felt that Indo-European men had devolved from these higher mythological races.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Gregor noted that several contemporary criticisms of Evola's theory were published: "In one of Fascism's most important theoretical journals, Evola's critic pointed out that many Nordic-Aryans, not to speak of Mediterranean Aryans, fail to demonstrate any Hyperborean properties. Instead, they make obvious their materialism, their sensuality, their indifference to loyalty and sacrifice, together with their consuming greed. How do they differ from 'inferior' races, and why should anyone wish, in any way, to favor them?"&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|106}}

Concerning the relationship between "spiritual racism" and biological racism, Evola put forth the following viewpoint, which Furlong described as pseudo-scientific:

{{quote|The factor of "blood" or "race" has its importance, because it is not psychologically—in the brain or the opinions of the individual—but in the very deepest forces of life that traditions live and act as typical formative energies. Blood registers the effects of this action, and indeed offers through heredity, a matter that is already refined and pre-formed ...&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;}}

===Views on Jews===
Evola endorsed [[Otto Weininger]]'s views on the Jews. Though Evola viewed Jews as corrosive and anti-traditional, he described [[Adolf Hitler]]'s more fanatical anti-Semitism as a paranoid [[Idée fixe (psychology)|idée fixe]] that damaged the reputation of the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Evola's conception did not emphasize the Nazi racial conception of Jews as "representatives of a biological race"—in Evola's view the Jews were "the carriers of a world view ... a spirit [that] corresponded to the 'worst' and 'most decadent' features of modernity: democracy, egalitarianism and materialism."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Evola argued that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''—whether or not a forgery—accurately reflect the conditions of modernity.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He believed that the ''Protocols'' "contain the plan for an occult war, whose objective is the utter destruction, in the non-Jewish peoples, of all tradition, class, aristocracy, and hierarchy, and of all moral, religious, and spiritual values."&lt;ref name=religionfascism&gt;Horst Junginger. ''The Study of Religion Under the Impact of Fascism''. BRILL, 2008. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the foreword to the second Italian edition of the ''Protocols'', which was published by the Fascist [[Giovanni Preziosi]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=religionfascism/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dershowitz&gt;Oren Nimni and Nathan J. Robinson. ''[https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/11/alan-dershowitz-takes-anti-semitism-very-seriously-indeed Alan Dershowitz Takes Anti-Semitism Very Seriously Indeed]''. [[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]. November 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of his friend [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the leader of the Fascist Romanian [[Iron Guard]], Evola expressed anticipation of a "talmudic, Israelite tyranny."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, Evola believed that Jews had this "power" only because of European "decadence" in modernity.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He also believed that one could be "Aryan", but have a "Jewish" soul, just as one could be "Jewish", but have an "Aryan" soul.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman. ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen''. Quest Books, 2012. p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; In Evola's view Otto Weininger and [[Carlo Michelstaedter]] were Jews of "sufficiently heroic, ascetic, and sacral" character to fit the latter category.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Fascism==
Evola developed a complex line of argument, closely related to the spiritual orientation of Traditionalist writers such as [[René Guénon]] and the political concerns of the European [[Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] Right.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola's first published political work was an anti-fascist piece in 1925. In this work, Evola called Italy's fascist movement a "laughable revolution," based on empty sentiment and materialistic concerns. He applauded Mussolini's anti-bourgeois orientation and his goal of making Italian citizens into hardened warriors, but criticized Fascist populism, party politics, and elements of leftism that he saw in the fascist regime. Evola saw Mussolini's Fascist Party as possessing no cultural or spiritual foundation. He was passionate about infusing it with these elements in order to make it suitable for his ideal conception of ''Übermensch'' culture which, in Evola's view, characterized the imperial grandeur of pre-Christian Europe.&lt;ref name=occult/&gt; He expressed anti-nationalist sentiment, stating that to become "truly human," one would have to "overcome brotherly contamination" and "purge oneself" of the feeling that one is united with others "because of blood, affections, country or human destiny." He also opposed the [[futurism]] that Italian fascism was aligned with, along with the "plebeian" nature of the movement.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|86}} Accordingly, Evola launched the journal ''La Torre'' (The Tower), to voice his concerns and advocate for a more elitist fascism.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola's ideas were poorly received by the fascist mainstream as it stood at the time of his writing.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt;

===Mussolini===
[[File:Evola-40.jpg|thumb|Julius Evola (1940)]]
Scholars disagree about why [[Benito Mussolini]] embraced racist ideology in 1938—some scholars have written that Mussolini was more motivated by political considerations than ideology when he introduced anti-semitic legislation in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Renzo de Felice, ''Storia degli ebrei''; [[A. James Gregor]]; Meir Michaelis, ''Mussolini and the Jews''; ''contra'' Aaron Gillette, ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy'', Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have rejected the argument that the racial ideology of Italian fascism could be attributed solely to Nazi influence.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Luigi Preti (1968) for discussion of [[miscegenation]]; Gene Bernardini (1977) for discussion of German influence&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent interpretation is that Mussolini was frustrated by the slow pace of fascist transformation and, by 1938, had adopted increasingly radical measures including a racial ideology. Aaron Gillette has written that "Racism would become the key driving force behind the creation of the new fascist man, the ''uomo fascista''."&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini read Evola's ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' in August 1941, and met with Evola to offer him his praise. Evola later recounted that Mussolini had found in his work a uniquely Roman form of Fascist [[racism]] distinct from that found in [[Nazi Germany]]. With Mussolini's backing, Evola launched the minor journal ''Sangue e Spirito'' (Blood and Spirit). While not always in agreement with German racial theorists, Evola traveled to Germany in February 1942 and obtained support for German collaboration on ''Sangue e Spirito'' from "key figures in the German racial hierarchy."&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Fascists appreciated the [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] value of Evola's "proof" "that the true representatives of the state and the culture of ancient Rome were people of the Nordic race."&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola eventually became Italy's leading racial philosopher.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

Evola blended [[Sorelianism]] with Mussolini's [[eugenics]] agenda. Evola has written that "The theory of the Aryo-Roman race and its corresponding myth could integrate the Roman idea proposed, in general, by fascism, as well as give a foundation to Mussolini's plan to use his state as a means to elevate the average Italian and to enucleate in him a new man."&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 1951, Evola was arrested and charged with promoting the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers who certainly could be linked to fascism—at least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria—but who certainly could not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini. Evola then declared that he was not a Fascist but a "superfascist". He was acquitted.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Wolff, Elisabetta Cassini. "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0031322X.2016.1243662 Evola's interpretation of fascism and moral responsibility]", Patterns of Prejudice, Vol. 50, Issue 4–5, 2016. pp. 478–494&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Reich===
Finding Italian fascism too compromising, Evola began to seek recognition in [[Nazi Germany]]. Evola spent a considerable amount of time in Germany in 1937 and 1938, and gave a series of lectures to the German–Italian Society in 1938.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; Evola took issue with Nazi populism and biological materialism. SS authorities initially rejected Evola's ideas as supranational and aristocratic though he was better received by members of the conservative revolutionary movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Nazi [[Ahnenerbe]] reported that many considered his ideas to be pure "fantasy" which ignored "historical facts.".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola admired [[Heinrich Himmler]], whom he knew personally,&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; but he had reservations about [[Adolf Hitler]] because of Hitler's reliance on ''völkisch'' nationalism.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Himmler's [[Schutzstaffel]] ("SS") kept a dossier on Evola—dossier document AR-126 described his plans for a "Roman-Germanic Imperium" as "utopian" and described him as a "reactionary Roman," whose goal was an "insurrection of the old aristocracy against the modern world." The document recommended that the SS "stop his effectiveness in Germany" and provide him with no support, particularly because of his desire to create a "secret international order".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Hansen, "A Short Introduction to Julius Evola" in Evola, ''Revolt Against the Modern World'', p xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Umland&gt;A. James Gregor and Andreas Umland. ''Erwägen Wissen Ethik'', 15: 3 &amp; 4 (2004), pp. 424-429, 591-595; vol. 16: 4 (2005), pp. 566-572 ''[https://www.academia.edu/174269/Dugin_Not_a_Fascist_A_Debate_with_A._James_Gregor_6_texts_ Dugin Not a Fascist?]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this opposition, Evola was able to establish political connections with pan-Europeanist elements inside the [[Reich Main Security Office]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola subsequently ascended to the inner circles of Nazism as the influence of pan-European advocates overtook that of Völkisch proponents, due to military contingencies.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola wrote the article ''Reich and Imperium as Elements in the New European Order'' for the Nazi-backed journal ''European Review''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He spent World War II working for the [[Sicherheitsdienst]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; The Sicherheitsdienst bureau Amt VII, a [[Reich Main Security Office]] research library, helped Evola acquire arcane occult and Masonic texts.&lt;ref name=Rahn&gt;Nigel Graddon. ''Otto Rahn and the Quest for the Grail: The Amazing Life of the Real Indiana Jones''. SCB Distributors, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Italian Fascism went into decline when, in 1943, Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned. At this point, Evola fled to Germany with the help of the Sicherheitsdienst.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Although not a member of the [[National Fascist Party]], and despite his apparent problems with the Fascist regime, Evola was one of the first people to greet Mussolini when the latter was broken out of prison by [[Otto Skorzeny]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Evola helped welcome Mussolini to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Wolf's Lair]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Following this, Evola involved himself in Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was Evola's custom to walk around the city of [[Vienna]] during [[bombing raid]]s in order to better "ponder his destiny". During one such raid, 1945, a [[shell (projectile)|shell]] fragment damaged his [[spinal cord]] and he became [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down, remaining so for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Guido&gt;Guido Stucco, "Translator's Introduction," in Evola, ''The Yoga of Power'', pp. ix–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-War==
[[File:Julius Evola – Smernice (it. Orientamenti).jpg|thumb|Julius Evola – ''Směrnice'' (2015),  the Czech translation  of his book ''Orientamenti'' (1950).]]
After World War II, Evola continued his work in esotericism. He wrote a number of books and articles on sex magic and various other esoteric studies, including ''The Yoga of Power: Tantra, Shakti, and the Secret Way'' (1949), ''Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex'' (1958), and ''Meditations on the Peaks: Mountain Climbing as Metaphor for the Spiritual Quest'' (1974). He also wrote his two explicitly political books ''Men Among the Ruins: Post-War Reflections of a Radical Traditionalist'' (1953), ''Ride the Tiger: A Survival Manual for the Aristocrats of the Soul'' (1961), and his autobiography,&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; ''The Path of Cinnabar'' (1963). He also expanded upon critiques of American civilization and materialism, as well as increasing American influence in Europe, collected in the posthumous anthology ''Civiltà Americana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civiltà americana. Scritti sugli Stati Uniti (1930–1968)|last=Evola|first=Julius|publisher=Controcorrente|year=2010|isbn=|location=Napoli|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola's occult ontology exerted influence over post-war [[neo-fascism]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; In the post-war period, Evola's writing evoked interest among the neo-fascist right.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; After 1945, Evola was considered the most important Italian theoretician of the conservative revolutionary movement&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; and the "chief ideologue" of Italy's post-war radical right.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; According to Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm, Evola's most significant post-war political texts are ''Orientamenti'' and ''Men Among the Ruins''.&lt;ref&gt;Egil Asprem, Kennet Granholm. ''Contemporary Esotericism''. Routledge, 2014. p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orientamenti'' was a text against "national fascism"—instead, it advocated for a European Community modeled on the principles of the [[Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; The Italian Neo-fascist group [[Ordine Nuovo]] adopted ''Orientamenti'' as a guide for action in postwar Italy.&lt;ref name=Laurelle&gt;Marlene Laruelle. ''Eurasianism and the European Far Right: Reshaping the Europe–Russia Relationship''. Lexington Books, 2015. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Liberation Front]], who were affiliated with [[Francis Parker Yockey]], called Evola "Italy's gretest living authoritarian philosopher" in the April 1951 issue of their publication ''Frontfighter''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

During the post-war period, Evola attempted to dissociate himself from totalitarianism, preferring the concept of the "organic" state, which he put forth in his text ''Men Among the Ruins''.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola sought to develop a strategy for the implementation of a "conservative revolution" in post World War II Europe.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; He rejected nationalism, advocating instead for a European ''Imperium'', which could take various forms according to local conditions, but should be "organic, hierarchical, anti-democratic, and anti-individual."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola endorsed [[Francis Parker Yockey]]'s neo-fascist manifesto ''Imperium'', but disagreed with it because he believed that Yockey had a "superficial" understanding of what was immediately possible.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola believed that his conception of neo-fascist Europe could best be implemented by an elite of "superior" men who operated outside normal politics.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Giuliano Salierni was an activist in the neo-Fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] during the early 1950s. He later recalled Evola's calls to violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Roberto Fiore]] and his colleagues in the early 1980s helped the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]]{{'}}s "Political Soldiers" forge a militant elitist philosophy based on Evola's "most militant tract", ''The Aryan Doctrine of Battle and Victory''. ''The Aryan Doctrine'' called for a "Great Holy War" that would be fought for spiritual renewal and fought in parallel to the physical "Little Holy War" against perceived enemies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Wolff attributes extreme-right terrorist actions in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s to the influence of Julius Evola.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Thomas Sheehan has argued that Evola's work is essential reading for those seeking to understand [[Neo-fascism|Eurofascism]], in the same way that knowledge of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] is necessary for those seeking to understand Communist actions.&lt;ref name=sheehanterror/&gt;

==Political influence==
The Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]], the Nazi Grail seeker [[Otto Rahn]], and the Romanian fascist sympathizer and religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] admired Julius Evola.&lt;ref name=HorowitzMussolini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rahn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; After World War II, Evola's writings continued to influence many European far-right political, racist and neo-fascist movements. He is widely translated in French, Spanish, partly in German, and mostly in Hungarian (the largest number of his translated works [see &lt;http://www.tradicio.org/bibliographia.pdf&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;130–154]). Amongst those he has influenced are the American Blackshirts Party, the "esoteric Hitlerist" [[Miguel Serrano]],&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; [[Savitri Devi]], [[GRECE]], the [[Italian Social Movement|Movimento sociale italiano]] (MSI), [[Gaston Armand Amaudruz]]'s [[New European Order|Nouvel Ordre Européen]], [[Pino Rauti]]'s [[Ordine Nuovo]], [[Troy Southgate]], [[Alain de Benoist]], [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], [[Giorgio Freda]], the [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), [[Eduard Limonov]], [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]], [[CasaPound|CasaPound Italia]], [[Tricolor Flame]] and the [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Giorgio Almirante]] referred to him as "our [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]&amp;mdash;only better."&lt;ref name=sheehanterror/&gt; According to one leader of the neofascist "black terrorist" [[Ordine Nuovo]], "Our work since 1953 has been to transpose Evola's teachings into direct political action."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ferraresi, Franco. "The Radical Right in Postwar Italy." ''Politics &amp; Society''. 1988 16:71-119. (p.84)&lt;/ref&gt; The now defunct French fascist group [[Third Way (France)|Troisième Voie]] was also inspired by Evola.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Race relations. "The far Right in Europe: a guide." ''Race &amp; Class'', 1991, Vol. 32, No. 3:125-146 (p.132).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Bowden]], English political activist and chairman of the [[Far-right politics in the United Kingdom|far right]], spoke highly of Evola and his ideas and gave lectures on his philosophy.

Evola has also influenced the [[alt-right]] movement,&lt;ref name=HorowitzMussolini/&gt; which also cites [[Oswald Spengler]], [[H. L. Mencken|H.L Mencken]], [[Samuel T. Francis|Sam Francis]], and [[Pat Buchanan]] as influences.&lt;ref name=Dershowitz/&gt; Additionally, Evola has influenced [[Vladimir Putin]] advisor&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;Meyer, Henry and Ant, Onur.

[[Donald Trump]]'s former chief adviser [[Steve Bannon]] noted Evola's influence on the [[Eurasianism]] movement;&lt;ref name=Bannon&gt;Feder, J. Lester.

'''Kelmis''' ({{lang-fr|La Calamine}}) is a [[municipality]] located in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]], named for the historical deposits of [[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]] ([[zinc]] ore) nearby. {{As of|2011}}, the population was 10,881; the area is {{convert|18.1|km2}} and the [[population density]] is {{convert|{{#expr:10881/18.1 round 1}}|PD/sqkm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ng3.economie.fgov.be/ni/municipalkeyfigures/FR/slide/slide_63040.pdf#page=2 |title=Votre commune en chiffres: La&amp;nbsp;Calamine |date=2012 |page=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316211351/http://ng3.economie.fgov.be/ni/municipalkeyfigures/FR/slide/slide_63040.pdf#page=2 |archive-date=16 March 2016 |dead-url=no |language=fr |publisher=[[SPF Economie]] |format=PDF |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality consists of the following [[deelgemeente|sub-municipalities]]: Kelmis proper, [[Hergenrath]], and [[Neu-Moresnet]].

The territory around the [[Vieille Montagne]] [[zinc]] mine in Kelmis was a neutral condominium of the Netherlands and [[Prussia]] (later Belgium and Germany) from 1816 to 1919 as [[Neutral Moresnet]], with the Mayor of Kelmis being nominated by two commissionners from the neighbouring countries. Although there were attempts by locals at making it evolve into a fully independent microstate, all of them were thwarted and it remained under double-sovereignty and neutrality until its eventual annexation by Belgium after {{nowrap|World War I}}.

In the nineteenth century a [[Low Dietsch]] dialect was spoken in Kelmis. Today Kelmis is bilingual: [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]] and one of the nine municipalities of the [[German‑speaking Community of Belgium]].

'''Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv''' ({{lang-ua|Кий, Щек, Хорив}}) are three [[legend]]ary brothers often mentioned along with their sister '''Lybid''' ({{lang-ua|Либідь}}), who, according to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"An Armenian historian of the seventh century, Zenob Glak, knew of a similar legend concerning the founding of the city of Kuar ([[Kiev]]) in the land of Poluni (Polianians) by three brothers Kuar, Mentery, and Kherean." [in:] Medieval Rus' epics, chronicles, and tales. 1974; "Similarly to Nestor's story about Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, the Armenian legend of Kuar and his brothers says (in the 6th or in the 7th century). [in:] Київ, анциент анд модерн киты. 1983&lt;/ref&gt; were the founders of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] city of [[Kiev]], now the capital of [[Ukraine]]. The legend is widely recognized as a source of Kievan mythology and urban naming.{{citation needed|reason=No research verifying this speculation|date=May 2015}}

==Historical background for the legend==
Archaeological excavations have shown that there was indeed an ancient settlement starting with the 6th century. Some speculate that Kyi was a real person, a ''[[knyaz]]'' (prince) from the tribe of the [[Polans (eastern)|Polans]]. According to legend, Kyi, the eldest brother, was a Polianian Prince, and the city was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ukrainians-world.org.ua/eng/peoples/ff653263602957f1/&lt;/ref&gt;. As well, the legend says that the appearance of a large city on the hilly banks of the [[Dnieper]] was predicted by [[Andrew the Apostle]].

This legend of the three brothers and their sister is one of the most popular theories among the attempts to explain the local names. ''Shchek'' and ''Khoryv'', according to this theory, represent the actual Shchekavytsia and Khorevytsia mountains in the center of Kiev, while ''Lybid'' is [[Lybid River|the actual river]], a right tributary of the [[Dnieper]] and an important landscape factor in the city. Lybid means "swan" in Slavic. Goddess [[Zorya]] (Danica) was identified with white swan, white bird.{{citation needed|reason=Needs to have cited research to add a reason to believe it|date=May 2015}}

==Modern tributes==
[[File:UkraineP89-200Karbovantsiv-1992 f-donated.jpg|thumb|The sculpture of Kiev founders depicted on Ukraine's [[Karbovanets#Third_karbovanets|interim bank note]] in 1990s.]]

In addition to the respective hills and the river, there are ''Shchekavytska'' and ''Khoryva'' Streets in Kiev's ancient neighborhood of [[Podil]].

In 1982, Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid were depicted (standing on an ancient riverboat) in a sculpture at the river-side of Navodnytsky Park. The monument, created by [[Vasyl Borodai]], soon became iconic for the city and has been used as [[Kiev]]'s unofficial emblem. In the 2000s another statue was installed at the central square, [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6189">'''Love Cosmetics''' (1969 ''-'' 1980) was introduced by Menley &amp; James Laboratories on March 1, 1969.&lt;ref name=enter&gt;''Menley &amp; James Turns To Love 1969 Style'', [[New York Times]], January 26, 1969, Page F16.&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1970 the company was marketing and promoting Fresh Lemon bath products and Soft Eyes items to beautify the eyes. Advertising was coordinated by Wells, Rich, Greene advertising agency (1967 ''-'' 1990), a company founded by [[Mary Wells Lawrence]]. Love's advertising budget surpassed $7 million. There was an emphasis on a long-term building operation, with advertisements on television and
in women's magazines.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; A 4-page spread appeared in the February 1969 [[Harper's Bazaar]]. The headline theme was ''This is the way Love is in 1969.'' The opening continued with ''Love today is different than it's ever been. It's freer, more natural, more honest-more out in the open. So are the girls who fall in love these days.'' Singer [[Andy Williams]] hosted a mid-March 1969 ''Andy Williams Love Special''.&lt;ref name=enter/&gt; Love Cosmetics is credited with introducing ''the lemon craze''.&lt;ref name=lemon/&gt;

==Ownership==

M&amp;J was composed of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] lawyers, doctors, and marketing men. It was a subsidiary of [[SmithKline &amp; French]] Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;''Sales 'Love' Cosmetics'', New York Times, November 8, 1970, Page 420.&lt;/ref&gt; SmithKline &amp; French made [[Thorazine]], [[Compazine]], [[Dexedrine]], Eskatrol, and most notably, [[Contac]].&lt;ref name=enter/&gt; M&amp;J was sometimes criticized for concentrating its marketing in drug stores. However it felt that such a basic strategy would enable it to best take advantage of its
capabilities.&lt;ref name=first&gt;''Advertising: Menley Signs Up Della Femina, New York Times, August 21, 1970, Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product line==

The ideal customer on which marketing focused was a young woman, 20 to 25. She might be a young businesswoman, co-ed, or young married. She was likely a trend setter and a heavy cosmetics user.&lt;ref name=enter/&gt; Love Cosmetics' first line of items
included Love's Fresh Lemon Cleanser, Lovelids eyeshadow, and Eau De Love. The latter came in a 6 oz. bottle. In all there were eleven products, and with the inclusion of shades, they numbered forty-three. Loveshines was ''the fun stick to contour and color your eyes, face, all your other kissable little curves and hollows.'' Lipsticks were called Lovesticks. The remainder of the line was Love's Basic Moisture, Love's A Little Color, Love's Transparent Powder, Love's A Little Cover, Love's Liner, Love's Mascara, and Lovelids. The latter was eyeshadow with a container in the shape of a plastic eyeball.&lt;ref name=enter/&gt; The company believed that eyeshadows for the day should be in neutral shades, specifically [[taupe]], [[russet (color)|russet]], heather, or olive green. Nighttime was more suited for deeper, yet not brighter colors, especially purple, plum, or teal.&lt;ref&gt;''Facing Up To Fall'', New York Times, August 24, 1975, Page 
210.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1976 Love Cosmetics started marketing Purple Sage, Tumbleweed, and Prairie Dawn eyeshadow shades.&lt;ref&gt;''...and another word about color'', New York Times, February 29, 1976, Page 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1974 Love Cosmetics began to make a line of Baby Soft products meant for adults. The items were scented with an ''innocent fragrance'' most often associated with babies. There was a Baby soft talc, a body lotion, and a foam bath. A marketing slogan read ''sexy in a very special way.'' Baby Soft products were priced from $2 to $2.75.&lt;ref name=lemon&gt;''It's Apple-Scented And For the Hair'', New York Times, March 18, 1974, Page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; 1975 was a busy year in the cosmetics industry with the introduction of many fragrances by competing firms. Love Cosmetics' new scent was called Daisy L.&lt;ref&gt;''Advertising: Heady Success
for Fragrances'', New York Times, January 2, 1976, Page 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==

Peter Godfrey, president of Menley &amp; James, announced in May 1976 that he was seeking a smaller advertising firm to replace Wells, Rich, Green. The parting was friendly but necessary because of the growth of Wells Lawrence's firm. It had become too large for it to give Love Cosmetics' account the attention it required.&lt;ref&gt;''Menley and Wells Parting'', New York Times, May 21, 1976, Page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Wells, Rich, Green began to represent [[Max Factor]] of [[Los Angeles, California]] in April 1977.&lt;ref&gt;''Max Factor Chooses Wells, Rich, Greene'', New York Times, April 25, 1977, Page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David R. Altman|Altman, Stoller, Weiss]] represented Love Cosmetics for two years before M&amp;J switched to the Jan Zwiren Agency of [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Zwiren was formerly vice president of the consumer products division of Helene Curtis Industries. Prior to this she worked with M&amp;J in promoting Love Cosmetics. In BC Canada, Peter Rose was "the Man from Love!" producing by far the largest sales per account in North America. The SFM Media Service Corporation continued to coordinate media planning and buying for the Love Cosmetics line.&lt;ref&gt;''SFM Will Continue Cosmetics Media Planning'', New York Times, February 2, 1979, Page D11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Buyout==

In May 1980 Menley &amp; James entered into an agreement with [[Chattem]] of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], to purchase its Love Cosmetics business. Terms were not revealed.&lt;ref&gt;''Company Briefs'', New York Times, May 20, 1980, Page D4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Holleaux''' (15 April 1861 – 21 September 1932) was a 19th–20th-century French historian, archaeologist and [[epigrapher]], a specialist of [[Ancient Greece]].

[[Image:Delos Panorama1.jpg|thumb|Site of [[Delos]] whose archaeological exploration was strongly driven by Maurice Holleaux during his leadership of the French School at Athens]]

== Biography ==
=== Années de formation ===
Admitted in the [[École normale supérieure]] in 1879, Holleaux was [[Agrégation|agrégé in history]] in 1881 and became a member of the [[French School at Athens]] in 1882. He then conducted epigraphic explorations in [[Samos]] and [[Rhodes]]. He devoted thereafter an important scientific activity in the latter city. In 1884 he undertook missions in Asia Minor during which he discovered with Pierre Paris the inscription of [[Diogenes of Oenoanda]]. Back in Greece, he discovered in Beotia the Ptoion sanctuary. Between 1884 and 1891 he directed the excavation of this shrine to [[Apollo]] Ptoios in [[Boeotia]].&lt;ref&gt;On this monument, whose excavations were started again in the 1990s, see C. Müller, « Le Ptoion et Akraiphia (Béotie) », ''BCH'', 120-2, 1996, (p.&amp;nbsp;853–864) [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bch_0007-4217_1996_num_120_2_7043 Read online]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1888 he discovered an inscription bearing the text of the speech [[Nero]] spoke in Corinth in 67 to restitute their freedom to the Greeks.

=== Career ===
He was appointed in the University of Lyon in 1888. He then became a friend of [[Philippe Fabia]]. His research abandoned the archaeological area to focus more exclusively on epigraphy.

Leaving Lyon after sixteen years of teaching, he directed the French School at Athens from 1904 to 1912. Succeeding [[Théophile Homolle]], he led archaeological activities of the school and then oversaw the archaeological exploration of [[Delos]].

On his return to France, he was a lecturer at the Faculty of Paris. In 1918 he published a memoir which then became his complementary thesis:''Étude sur la traduction en grec du titre consulaire''. In 1923, he defended his main thesis, completed at the end of 1920: [http://www.mediterranee-antique.fr/Auteurs/Fichiers/GHI/Holleaux/Grece/Grece_0.htm ''Rome, la Grèce et les monarchies hellénistiques au IIIe s. BC, 273-205''] during a session remained memorable where he himself was critical of his own work. The work yet deeply renewed the perspective on the attitude of Rome to the Greeks. Holleaux was then appointed professor of Hellenistic antiquity to a Chair at the [[Sorbonne]].

In 1928 he became a member of the [[Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres]]. In 1927, he succeeded Paul Foucart to the chair of Greek epigraphy of the [[College de France]].

Maurice Holleaux was the master of historian [[Louis Robert (historian)|Louis Robert]] who gathered and published posthumously his articles. One of his sons was the magistrate and lawyer Georges Holleaux (1893-1973).&lt;ref&gt;Marc Ancel, « Georges Holleaux », ''Revue internationale de droit comparé'', 26-3, 1974, (p.&amp;nbsp;645–647)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late hours of 3 February and the early hours of 4 February 1973, six men, all of whom were Catholics, were shot and killed in the [[New Lodge, Belfast|New Lodge]] area of north [[Belfast]], four (one [[Provisional IRA|IRA]] member and three civilians) of them were shot dead at the junction at Edlingham Street by [[British Army]] [[sniper]]s, the other two men were shot dead by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA). [[Irish Nationalism|Irish Nationalists]] and [[Irish Republicanism|Republicans]] believe that collusion took place between the British security forces and [[Ulster Loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] in the shootings. The six men who were killed became known as "The New Lodge Six".{{fact|date=October 2017}}

==Background==
[[The Troubles]] broke out in August 1969 with [[1969 Northern Ireland riots|severe rioting in Belfast]] and the British army was called in to restore order. Shortly after, the newly formed guerrilla movement the [[Provisional IRA]] waged a campaign against the British of shooting and bombing. In response, Loyalist paramilitary groups such as the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster Defence Association|(UDA)]] waged a campaign of killings against the Nationalist community in [[Northern Ireland]] and also bombed targets in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. 
The conflict was a bloody and bitter one with all sides carrying out massacres of civilians. The incidents included [[McGurk's Bar bombing]], which killed 15 people, was carried out by the UVF, [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], in which the British army shot dead 14 Catholic civilians and [[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]], which killed 11 civilians was carried out by the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch69.htm#Aug|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1969|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=4&amp;month=12&amp;year=1971|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bfriday/bf.htm|title=CAIN: Key Events - 'Bloody Friday'|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Lodge, on the edge of the city centre, with a history of active [[Irish republicanism]] and surrounded by Loyalist areas, saw much violence during The Troubles. Most of the remaining Protestant population left under intimidation in the early 1970s, to be replaced by Catholics intimidated from Loyalist areas of Belfast. As a stronghold of the Third Battalion of the [[Provisional IRA]]'s [[Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade|Belfast Brigade]], rioting and gun battles between the IRA and the [[British Army]] and loyalist paramilitaries were almost daily occurrences during the early 1970s and other periods of high political tension such as the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]], and occurred sporadically during the rest of that period.  The area was vulnerable to attacks by Loyalist paramilitaries throughout The Troubles, particularly to [[drive-by shooting]]s. The corner of the New Lodge Road and the Antrim Road was statistically the most dangerous spot to stand at in Northern Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Shootings==
In the first four days of February 1973, fourteen people died and many more were injured in numerous gun attacks across the city. On Friday 2 February, the hooded body of 28-year-old Catholic, Patrick Bradley from [[Andersonstown]], was found in a car in Maurice Street. An 18-year-old petrol pump attendant was shot dead in his café on York Road. Earlier in the day, ten people from the [[Beechmount]] area were injured when gunmen opened fire from a passing car. Undercover British army involvement was suspected in the Beechmount shooting. In Ardoyne, in a similar attack, residents escaped injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch73.htm#Feb|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1973|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension was high in Belfast on Saturday 3 February. The UDA had paraded from many parts of the city to the Laddas Drive RUC station to demand the release of two of its members who had recently been interned. This was the first time Loyalists were threatened with internment and there was many protests and rioting by Loyalists in Belfast because of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewlodge.com/history/newlodgesix.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130043424/http://www.thenewlodge.com/history/newlodgesix.html |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The first shooting in the New Lodge area occurred at around 11.00pm when members of the UDA shot dead James Sloan (19) and James McCann (18) both IRA Volunteers who were shot while they stood outside Lynch's Bar, in a drive-by shooting. The car drove down the [[Antrim Road]] and fire was directed at a Chinese restaurant injuring others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=3&amp;month=02&amp;year=1973|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial attack, residents gathered on the streets after hearing the shooting, they soon came under a hail of gunfire from several positions. [[British Army]] soldiers was fired a number of rounds at a crowd of people from Duncairn Gardens down Edlingham Street and from the top of Templar and Alamein Flats. For the first time in Northern Ireland the army were using their new 'Nitesights'. Four more people, Tony Campbell (19), Ambrose Hardy (26), Brendan Maguire (33) and John Loughran (35) were shot dead by British snipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=4&amp;month=02&amp;year=1973|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The British Army released a statement after the shootings in which they claimed that between 23.45 and 03.00 there was a severe gun battle in the New Lodge area.{{fact|date=October 2017}} In about 30 separate incidents, nearly 200 shots were fired at the security forces and fire was returned on most occasions. They said that seven of the people shot were gunmen and six of them died, eyewitness claims dispute these statements claiming none of those shot was armed at the time they were killed.

The sister of Ambrose Hardy claims he was waving a white petticoat when he was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/Irelandclick/arts2002/dec2_new_lodge_survivors.php|title=Newshound: Daily Northern Ireland news catalog - Irelandclick.com article|website=Nuzhound.com|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Six years later Ambrose Hardy's brother John Hardy (43) was killed by UVF gunmen while he was having dinner with his six children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=28&amp;month=08&amp;year=1979|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Newcomen Society''' is an [[International]] [[learned society]] that promotes and celebrates the history of [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. It was founded in [[London]] in 1920 and takes its name from [[Thomas Newcomen]], one of the inventors associated with the early development of the [[steam engine]] and who is widely considered the "father of the Industrial Revolution".

The motto of the Society is the [[Latin]] ''actorum memores simul affectamus agenda'', meaning "mindful of things that have taken place, at the same time we strive after things yet to be done". The choice of a [[griffin]] [[regardant]] for the logo was to symbolise vigilance and looking backward while going forward.

The Newcomen Society is based at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London. There are regional branches in England: Midlands ([[Birmingham]]), North West ([[Manchester]]), North East ([[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]), Western ([[Bristol]]) and Southern ([[Portsmouth]]), and one in Scotland ([[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]).

The Society is concerned with all branches of engineering: [[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[structural engineering|structural]], [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical]], [[marine engineering|marine]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]] and [[manufacturing]] as well as [[biography]] and [[invention]].

It publishes the '''International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology''' (formerly the Transactions of the Newcomen Society) and '''Newcomen Links''', a quarterly newsletter. An online archive of previous Transactions is also available to members of the Society.

An American branch was established in 1923, but the [[Newcomen Society of the United States]] was entirely separate from its UK counterpart in 2007, when the chairman and trustees announced its closure.

'''Samuel Pollard''' (20 April 1864 in [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]] &amp;ndash; 16 September 1915 in [[Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County|Weining]], [[China]]), known in Chinese as '''Bo Geli''' ({{zh|c=柏格理|p=Bó Gélǐ}}) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[missionary]] to China with the [[China Inland Mission]] who converted many of the [[Miao people|A-Hmao]] (closely related to the [[Hmong people|Hmong]]) in [[Guizhou]] to [[Christianity]], and who created a [[Pollard script|Miao script]] that is still in use today.

== Biography ==
Born the son of a [[Bible Christian Church]] preacher, Sam Pollard initially aimed for a career in the civil service. However, a conference in [[London]] in 1885 encouraged him to instead become a missionary.&lt;ref name=Mundus /&gt; He was appointed a missionary in 1886, left the [[United Kingdom]] for China in 1887, and was posted to [[Yunnan]] province in 1888. He remained in China, as a missionary, until his death from [[typhoid]].

In 1891 he was posted to a newly opened Bible Christian mission station in [[Zhaotong]] (referred to in contemporary sources in Wade–Giles as Chaotung),&lt;ref name=Morrison1895a /&gt; where he married Emmie Hainge. He began a Christian movement with the Big Flowery Miao in 1905 that spread to Zhaotong. Pollard also invented a script for the [[Miao languages]] called the [[Pollard Script]] (also sometimes called the "Ahmao script"). He credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabary, "While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]], a [[Methodist]] missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done".&lt;ref name=Pollard1919a /&gt; He also gave credit to a non-Miao Chinese pastor, “Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system”.&lt;ref name=Pollard1919a /&gt;

Pollard never claimed any divine inspiration or vision in creating the script. Rather, he left a record of hard work, advice from others, and ideas from other scripts. At the beginning, he wrote, he “made an experiment in getting out a written language for the Miao”, even writing out some symbols in his diary.&lt;ref name=Enwall1994a /&gt; He credited the basic idea of the script to the [[Cree syllabary]] (discussed above), “While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done”.&lt;ref name=Pollard1919a /&gt; He also gave credit to a Chinese pastor, “Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system”.&lt;ref name=Pollard1919a /&gt; In another document he wrote “Mr. Stephen Lee and I are attempting to reduce the Miao language to a simply system of writing. The attempt may succeed or it may end… stillborn”.&lt;ref name=Enwall1994b /&gt; He asked himself in his diary “How shall I manage to distinguish [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]]?” then later wrote how he had found the solution, adopting an idea from Pitman’s shorthand.&lt;ref name=Enwall1994d /&gt; In listing the phrases he used to describe the process of creating the script, there is clear indication of work, not revelation:  “we looked about”, “working out the problem”, “resolved to attempt”, “assisted”, “at last we arrived at a system”, “adapting the system”, “we found”, “solved our problem”.&lt;ref name=Pollard1919b /&gt; In all of this, we see no hint of specific revelation or any vision, only intellectual labor.
[[File:Pollard and Miao teachers.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Pollard and Miao teachers]]
He used it to translate the [[New Testament]]. The script was unique in the fact that it used the initial consonant of a syllable, with the vowel placed above or below it, in order to indicate which tone the vowel was.&lt;ref name=Dingle1911a /&gt;

Pollard received pressure from some British sources that if the [[Roman script]] was not suitable, he should consider using the [[Burmese alphabet]].&lt;ref name=Enwall1994c /&gt; He did not accept this suggestions, but Pollard did leave the door open for switching over to Roman letters, writing in 1906, "It is quite possible later on to turn our system into Romanised, where there is a successful Romanised system in use which will solve the tone difficulty".&lt;ref name=Enwall1994c /&gt; A large part of Pollard’s motivation for creating his script was to have a way to adequately mark the sounds of the language, especially the tones. It has remained in use for 90 years, despite efforts to supersede it.&lt;ref&gt;Yu Suee Yan, "The Story of the Big Flowery Miao Bible," ''The Bible Translator ''62.4  (2011), [http://www.ubs-translations.org/fileadmin/publications/tbt/practical/BT-62-4-2011-Yu.pdf pp. 209-212].&lt;/ref&gt;

During his mission he travelled extensively, founding churches, training other missionaries, performing the role of language examiner, and arguing the causes of Miao Christians.

== Death ==
After Pollard's death in 1915, he was buried in the mountains near the Shimenkan mission station, contemporary [[Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County]]. The mission prospered for another 35 years until 1950, when the CCP ordered all English missionaries to cease proselytizing and leave the country. His grave and the county were closed to foreigners until 1995, when Xinhua announced that work had been taken to restore Pollard's tomb which they now declared to be a national monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Becker|first=Jasper|title=The Chinese|year=2000|publisher=John Murray|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|100,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} main building at the [[Hopkins-Nanjing Center]] in Nanjing, China is known as the Samuel Pollard Building. It houses the Center's library, classrooms and conference space, and administration offices.

The building was dedicated in 2007 as part of the Center's twentieth anniversary celebrations, which included keynotes by former [[Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and former Chinese Foreign Minister [[Qian Qichen]].[http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/2007/11jun07/11nanj.html]

[[Image:Sandratiko Gipuzkoako sarrera.jpg|thumb|Northern access to the San Adrian tunnel]]

The '''San Adrian tunnel''' or '''Lizarrate'''&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Luis Peña Basurto: [http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/88749 "Lizarrate,"] Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; represents the most outstanding milestone in the historic inland Basque route of the [[Way of St. James]]. It consists of a natural cave carved by water erosion in the rock (called ''Lizarrate'', arguably stemming from "leize arrate", 'the stone gate of the cave') with an opening on either side north and south; it also holds an hermitage inside. The tunnel provides a natural passage dividing the provinces of [[Gipuzkoa]] and [[Alava|Álava/Araba]] (the actual borderline locating at the ''Alto de la Horca''). 

The Spanish-[[Basque language|Basque]] linguistic boundary of the twentieth century was established in this area, the next village south, [[Zalduondo]], having been predominantly Spanish speaking during that period. Nowadays many hikers cross the tunnel in order to gain access to the nearby peaks, forests and grazing fields, namely [[Aratz]], [[Aizkorri]] and Urbia.

==Name==

As so many times in [[Basque language|Basque]] place- and person-names, this name of worship (San Adrian) has gone through a mutation arguably brought about by scribes and people ignorant of Basque. The pass itself is attested as ''Leizarrate'' at the beginning of the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/103571?q=san+adrian&amp;partialfields=fondo:au%25F1amendi&amp;numreg=4&amp;start=0 | title = Sierra y Túnel de San Adrián | publisher = Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia | accessdate =21 October 2010}} Site in Spanish&lt;/ref&gt; while nowadays this naming (in the modern form ''Lizarrate'') is usually limited to the rock in Spanish, with Basque still retaining the name ''Lizarrate'' also with its original meaning – i.e. to refer to the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{eu}} GipuzkoaKultura: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZgqbQYHrnk ''Garai bateko Lizarrate''], video by the Culture and Basque Language Department of the Gipuzkoa Provincial Council, published in YouTube, 2010-09-30.

Yet the word, like many [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Latin]] words turns out messy to pronounce in Basque, and it underwent a reduction (along the phonetic rules exhaustively described by [[Koldo Mitxelena#Works|K. Mitxelena]]) that ultimately resulted in ''Sandrati'' or ''Sandratei'', as locals call it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zegama.net/historia_sanadrian.php | title = History: San Adrian | publisher = Council of Zegama etc | accessdate =17 February 2008}} Site in Basque&lt;/ref&gt; Other phonetic outputs as attested in place-names around the area include ''Sandrati'', ''Santa Tria'' and variations, especially in the lands of [[Alava|Álava/Araba]] extending south of the mountain range that San Adrian provides the pass for: ''Santa Tria'' (village Audikana), ''San Tetria'' (village Contrasta 1556, leftover place-name of a former hermitage otherwise called in [[Romance languages|Romance]] ''San Adrian'').

Curiously enough, [[Adrian and Natalia of Nicomedia|Saint Adrian]] does not hold a representative position among Basque religious icons, as opposed to the ubiquitous San Martin, San Miguel or San Juan/Donibane, but Saint Adrian was actually much revered in the [[way of St James|ways of St James]]. To sum up, the name San Adrian results from a phonetic interpretation by Romance-speaking people of the Basque name for "Sancta Trinitate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Portilla, Micaela J.| year = 1991 | title = Una ruta europea.

==History==

The occurrence and relevance of the tunnel is attested since the 16th century, more so since the 13th, when historic circumstances rendered it a preferred route for [[pilgrimage]] and trade. The status increasingly gained at that time by the San Adrian pass and the way coming south from [[Gascony]] down into [[Gipuzkoa]] was to have an important impact on the social, economic and constructing development of the population nuclei located on it and around. Yet the heyday of this branch of the [[Way of St. James (route descriptions)|Way of St. James]] was to go on the wane thereafter by an ebb in popularity, the main trade and pilgrimage stream shifting to the more convenient [[the French Way|French Way]] (via [[Roncesvalles|Orreaga]]).

===Prehistory===

The mountain pass was used for ages by shepherds, as evidenced by prehistoric traces of seasonal cattle migration, [[dolmen]]s and [[burial mound]]s (usually small) in the area. Cattle, especially sheep, keep on grazing up to these days on the steep pastures all around the area of the cave. Place-names associated to alien cultures, such as neighbouring town ''[[Zegama]]'' or ''Arakama'' (commonplace family name in this region), claimed by some scholars to stem from Indo-European,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Bähr, Gerhard | year = 1948 | title = Baskisch und Iberisch | series = Eusko Jakintza | location= Bayonne | pages = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that European peoples may have used this pass.

===Antiquity and Early Middle Ages===

In step with the popular name, the "Roman way" (also called by locals ''estratea'' {{IPA-eu|es̺ˈtɾatea|}}), some point to the construction of the original roadway by the Romans, with continuous upkeep and renovation in the Middle Ages. At any rate, this stretch is not located on the important axis [[Ab Asturica Burdigalam|Bordeaux-Astorga]] cutting its way east to west through the Alava plains (merging point with the Tunnel Route in [[Salvatierra/Agurain]]). A Roman inscription has been found in [[Zegama]] (only two sites discovered so far in Gipuzkoa, the other one locating in the ancient [[Oiasso]]). A reference of the hermitage and pass of San Adrian in the blurred early ages is provided in ''Noticias Históricas'' (by [[Juan Antonio Llorente|J.A. Llorente]]), where the spot is identified (reasonably so, see [[San Adrian (tunnel)#Name|Name]]) as the "Sanctam Trianam" landmark cited as establishing the southern boundaries of the bishopric of [[Bayonne]]. Early Medieval [[Navarre]]se and [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] coins and copper buckles have been gathered in the tunnel, confirming that it was frequented in advance of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Portilla, Micaela J.| year = 1991 | title = Una ruta europea. Por Álava, a Compostela. Del paso de San Adrián, al Ebro  | publisher = Diputación Foral de Álava | location= Vitoria | isbn = 84-7821-066-0 | pages = 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coastal route was dangerous on account of [[Viking]] attacks and raids, while the southern roads, namely [[the French Way]] crossing [[Pamplona|Pamplona/Iruñea]], [[Logroño]] and on to [[Burgos]] was subject to Muslim forays and attacks, which rendered the [[Alava]]n lands (and therefore the San Adrian tunnel route) safer and more secure, as "they have always stayed in possession of its inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Portilla, Micaela J.| year = 1991 | title = Una ruta europea. Por Álava, a Compostela. Del paso de San Adrián, al Ebro | publisher = Diputación Foral de Álava | location= Vitoria | isbn = 84-7821-066-0 | pages = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Middle Ages===

After snatching the territories of Alava and Gipuzkoa from [[Navarre]], Alfonso X encouraged the use of this stretch that connected by land [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] to [[Gascony]] through the strip extending from San Sebastian to [[Irun]]. With a view to strengthening both trade and military grip in the region, the king founded in 1256 the towns of [[Salvatierra/Agurain|Salvatierra]] (Agurain), [[Segura (Guipúzcoa)|Segura]] and Villafranca ([[Ordizia]]) in various spots of the way,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Portilla, Micaela J.| year = 1991 | title = Una ruta europea.

Del paso de San Adrián, al Ebro | publisher = Diputación Foral de Álava | location= Vitoria | isbn = 84-7821-066-0 | pages = 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; so becoming popular with pilgrims, that could find there shelter and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csj.org.uk/route-tunnel-route.htm | title = Overview: The Tunnel Route – Irún to Santo Domingo de la Calzada | publisher = The Confraternity of Saint James | accessdate = 17 February 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316004405/http://www.csj.org.uk/route-tunnel-route.htm | archivedate = 16 March 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Times===

Despite [[pilgrimage]] shift to the flatter, safer and more convenient [[the French Way|French Way]], the San Adrian tunnel road kept its profile and was much in use as a European route in the 15th, 16th and 17th century; it is worth remembering that the former was in [[Navarre]]se territory (definite [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] conquest of Navarre in 1521), so Castilian kings continued to foster the tunnel route. At this period, evidence and descriptions about the route given by pilgrims and other users coming from Europe grow more frequent.

The San Adrian mount and pass are "rugged and difficult for horses", comments the cartographer [[Jan Janssonius]] in his ''Novus Atlas''. "The passengers usually carve their names on the thick stones or the rocks, so there are recorded many names with the date of the year they crossed the roughness of these mountains", he adds. In approx. 1567, Jorge Braun conjures up the inside of the tunnel: the nice inn and the good suppers offered to the pilgrims, especially to those who brought money along, and the fodder supplied to horses, no matter if the travellers were devoid of money. In 1572, J.B. Venturino travelled in the retinue of the patriarch of Alexandria, who crossed the tunnel northwards. The cavern "is dark and frightening", observes, but there he also mentions the hermitage and the house of the governor, responsible for watching the pass, as havens of preaching and safety guarantee for travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Portilla, Micaela J.| year = 1991 | title = Una ruta europea. Por Álava, a Compostela. Del paso de San Adrián, al Ebro | publisher = Diputación Foral de Álava | location= Vitoria | isbn = 84-7821-066-0 | pages = 36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, king [[Enrique IV of Castile]] (ruling 1454–1474) and later sister and queen [[Isabel I of Castile]] crossed the tunnel. Legend has it, on his route from Germany to Spain emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] first dismounted from the horse at this cave.

Since the Middle Ages the tunnel has been a point where tolls are paid on account of its border position. Yet usually at night, when the gate was shut, smugglers skip the tunnel by mounting up the rock North of the tunnel through a very narrow path called ''Ochoa Arrate''. At the time, highwaymen frequenting the area are dreaded by pilgrims and travellers alike, who were not acquainted with the wild surroundings where local bandits could easily stalk and find a hideout. The care provided inside the tunnel is welcome. Many remember in their travel memoirs the cosy atmosphere found at the inn, the pilgrims singing and the "fat woman" serving them. Above the North entrance of the tunnel, the fortress watches and protects the pass, a building that may hold 100 soldiers, as reported by a traveller in the 17th century. Much appreciated water sprung out of the stone wall in the tunnel, as told by a Franciscan in 1633.

Meanwhile, other routes grow gradually more important at the expense of the stretch corresponding to the San Adrian tunnel. "The San Adrian pass is good only for people on horse or on foot, since the carriage way exiting Vitoria goes through Salinas, Mondragon, Oñate and Villareal [from Gipuzkoa]", explains the arguably French Basque traveller J.C. Santoyo in 1612. However, this stretch continues to be widely used up to the late 18th century, when the new King's Highway from Madrid to France is built in 1765 and traffic shifts, so spurring the definite decay of the San Adrian tunnel way.

==Surroundings==
[[Image:Otzaurtetik gora.jpg|thumb|Uphill into the forest towards San Adrian (from Otzaurte)]]
The cave rises at 1,005 m high and it stands in the lowest point between the towering massifs of ''Aizkorri'' and ''Aratz'' mounts (1,528 m and 1,442 m respectively). Vast beech forests covered with bucolic brown in autumn abound in the area north and south of the cave, with limestone rocks cropping up more frequently as we gain altitude and approach the cave from the north. 
[[Image:Beundara hurbiltzen.jpg|thumb|Approaching col Beunda]]
The most usual access points for hikers are:
[[Image:Otzaurtetik maparen argazki.jpg|thumb|Info map on a landmark in route to San Adrian]]
* In the [[Gipuzkoa]]n side: the hamlet of Otzaurte (652 m). A concrete track starting off from the main paved road ([[Zegama]]-[[Altsasu]], GI-2637) heads south. This line splits the waters that slide to the Mediterranean through the [[Ebro]] watershed and those flowing north to the Atlantic through the [[Oria River]]. The track winds up the beech forest. Hikers may follow the red and white GR signs leading to paths that alternately detach from and merge into the main concrete track. After a while, the Beunda/e pass looks out into a wild valley (20'), the track heading west down the slope. In the landmark ''Aldaola'' (50'), a track heads up west, while vehicles should follow the left track sloping down. Going west, in a few metres a steep wet slope lies left out of the main track (red and white GR signs) until it joins a wide track near the refuge (1h5). From there, an overt view of the San Adrian tunnel could be seen, while the easily noticeable gentle path ascends west to the cave, merging with the St James roadway of cobblestone layout coming from Zegama (1h20). On choosing the left track down (vehicles), in a couple of minutes the stream is reached and crossed to the other side, where vehicles could park at a sharp bend (see map); hikers may ascend north through a narrow path making its way out of the forest towards the refuge.
* In the [[Alava]]n side: the carpark (dead end) of ''Zumarraundi'' ([[Zalduondo]]). A patchwork of paths sloping up north among beech trees penetrates in the dense forest. Traces of the medieval roadway may be easily noticed winding up (20') to the highest point of the mountain pass, the ''Alto de la Horca'', named after the gibbet formerly set up there (35'). Sloping down a hollow, the medieval track leads north past the spring of ''Ezkaratza'' on the right (45'), until the tunnel is attained (55').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuadrillasalvatierra.org/pdfs/ruta3.pdf |title=ZALDUONDO-SAN ADRIAN-ARATZ-ZALDUONDO |publisher=Cuadrilla de Salvatierra |accessdate=15 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030427144311/http://www.cuadrillasalvatierra.org/pdfs/ruta3.pdf |archivedate=27 April 2003 }} Site in Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrims coming south from [[Zegama]] take the pilgrimage way, which follows a paved road first (Zegama-Altsasu, GI-2637) and splits away through a concrete track that ascends on the right (signs all the way, see [[#External links|Graphic description of the Segura-Salvatierra/Agurain stretch]]). On nearing the San Adrian tunnel, the hut shaped ''Sancti Spiritus'' hermitage stands right on the left of the way. It is often claimed that it may have belonged to the [[Templar Knights]], while this association remains contentious.

{{History of science and technology in China}}

The [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 220 CE) of [[History of China|ancient China]], divided between the eras of Western Han (206 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 9 CE, when the capital was at [[Chang'an]]), [[Xin dynasty]] of [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9–23), and Eastern Han (25–220 CE, [[History of the Han dynasty|when the capital was]] at [[Luoyang]], and after 196 CE at [[Xuchang]]), witnessed some of the most significant advancements in premodern [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese science and technology]].

There were great innovations in [[metallurgy]]. In addition to [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou-dynasty China's]] (c. 1050&amp;nbsp;– 256 BCE) previous inventions of the [[blast furnace]] and [[cupola furnace]] to make  [[pig iron]] and [[cast iron]], respectively, the Han period saw the development of [[steel]] and [[wrought iron]] by use of the [[finery forge]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]]. With the drilling of deep [[borehole]]s into the earth, the Chinese used not only [[derrick]]s to lift [[brine]] up to the surface to be boiled into [[salt]], but also set up bamboo-crafted [[pipeline transport]] systems which brought [[natural gas]] as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the [[waterwheel]]-powered [[bellows]]; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For [[Tillage|tilling the soil]] and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron [[plowshare]]s and sturdy multiple-tube iron [[seed drill]] were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying [[irrigation]] ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical [[chain pump]] powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating [[trip hammer]]s in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical [[armillary sphere]] representing the [[celestial sphere]] around the Earth.

The quality of life was improved with many Han inventions. The Han Chinese had hempen-bound bamboo scrolls to write on, yet by the 2nd century CE had invented the [[papermaking]] process which created a writing medium that was both cheap and easy to produce. The invention of the [[wheelbarrow]] aided in the hauling of heavy loads. The maritime [[Junk (ship)|''junk'' ship]] and stern-mounted steering [[rudder]] enabled the Chinese to venture out of calmer waters of interior lakes and rivers and into the open sea. The invention of the [[grid reference]] for maps and [[raised-relief map]] allowed the Chinese to better navigate their terrain. [[Traditional Chinese medicine|In medicine]], they used new [[Chinese herbology|herbal remedies]] to cure illnesses, [[calisthenics]] to keep physically fit, and regulated [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]]s to avoid diseases. Authorities in the capital were warned ahead of time of the direction of sudden [[earthquakes]] with the invention of the [[seismometer]] that was tripped by a vibration-sensitive [[pendulum]] device. To mark the passing of the seasons and special occasions, the Han Chinese [[Chinese calendar|used two variations]] of the [[lunisolar calendar]], which were established due to efforts in [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Chinese mathematics|mathematics]]. Han-era Chinese advancements in mathematics include the discovery of [[square root]]s, [[cube root]]s, the [[Pythagorean theorem]], [[Gaussian elimination]], the [[Horner scheme]], improved calculations of ''[[pi]]'', and [[negative number]]s. Hundreds of new roads and canals were built to facilitate transport, commerce, tax collection, communication, and movement of military troops. The Han-era Chinese also employed several types of bridges to cross waterways and deep gorges, such as [[beam bridge]]s, [[arch bridge]]s, [[simple suspension bridge]]s, and [[pontoon bridge]]s. Han ruins of [[Chinese city wall|defensive city walls]] made of [[brick]] or [[rammed earth]] still stand today.

==Modern perspectives on science and technology during Han==
[[File:Western Han Dynasty wine-heating stove.JPG|thumb|A [[Wine in China|wine]]-heating [[stove]] made of [[bronze]], dated to the Western Han]]
Jin Guantao, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], Fan Hongye, a research fellow with the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]' Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science, and Liu Qingfeng, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, assert that the latter part of the Han dynasty was a unique period in the history of premodern Chinese science and technology.&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 178 179"&gt;Jin, Fan, &amp; Liu (1996), 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; They compare it to the incredible pace of [[Technology of the Song dynasty|scientific and technological growth]] during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279). However, they also argue that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of [[Mohism]], Chinese science continued to lack a definitive structure:&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 178 179"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties, the net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak (second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty) ...Han studies of the Confucian classics, which for a long time had hindered the socialization of science, were declining. If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable to the development of a scientific structure. However, this did not happen because the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed. During the late Eastern Han, disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese history. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science.&lt;ref name="jin fan liu 1996 178 179"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joseph Needham]] (1900–1995), a late Professor from the [[University of Cambridge]] and author of the groundbreaking ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' series, stated that the "Han time (especially the Later Han) was one of the relatively important periods as regards the history of science in China."&lt;ref name="needham 1972 111"&gt;Needham (1972), 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted the advancements during Han of [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Chinese calendar|calendrical]] sciences, the "beginnings of systematic [[botany]] and [[zoology]]", as well as the [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist thought]] embodied in Han works such as the ''[[Lunheng]]'' by the philosopher [[Wang Chong]] (27–100 CE).&lt;ref name="needham 1972 111"/&gt;

While [[Chinese cartography|maps drawn in ink]] on flat silk cloths [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|have been found in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai]] (interred in 168 BCE at [[Mawangdui]], [[Hunan]] province), the earliest known [[paper]] map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at [[Fangmatan]] (near [[Tianshui]], [[Gansu]] province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 12"&gt;Buisseret (1998), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as [[wrapping paper]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 1 1 2 40 41 122 123, 228"&gt;Needham (1986e), 1–2, 40–41, 122–123, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[papermaking]] process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 where [[Morus (plant)|mulberry tree]] bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled together to make a pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a [[Reed (plant)|reed]] mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper.&lt;ref&gt;Tom (1989), 99; Day &amp; McNeil (1996), 122; Needham (1986e), 1–2, 40–41, 122–123, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese [[watchtower]] at Tsakhortei, [[Alxa League]], [[Inner Mongolia]], dated precisely to 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic [[Xiongnu]] attack.&lt;ref name="cotterell 2004 11"&gt;Cotterell (2004), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 1 1 2"&gt;Needham (1986e), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han [[ceramic art|ceramics]] industry was upheld by private businesses as well as local government agencies.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 146 147"&gt;Wang (1982), 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics were used in domestic wares and utensils as well as construction materials for roof [[tile]]s and [[brick]]s.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 147 149"&gt;Wang (1982), 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Han dynasty grey [[pottery]]—its color derived from the [[clay]] that was used—was superior to earlier Chinese grey pottery due to the Han people's use of larger [[kiln]] chambers, longer firing tunnels, and improved chimney designs.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 142 143"&gt;Wang (1982), 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Kilns of the Han dynasty making grey pottery were able to reach firing temperatures above {{convert|1000|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 142 143"/&gt; However, hard southern Chinese pottery made from a dense adhesive clay native only in the south (i.e. [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Hunan]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]], [[Zhejiang]], and southern [[Jiangsu]]) was fired at even higher temperatures than grey pottery during the Han.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 142 143"/&gt; [[Ceramic glaze|Glazed pottery]] of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (c. 1600&amp;nbsp;– c. 1050 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (c. 1050&amp;nbsp;– 256 BC) dynasties were fired at high temperatures, but by the mid Western Han (206 BCE&amp;nbsp;–  9 AD), a brown-glazed ceramic was made which was fired at the low temperature of {{convert|800|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, followed by a green-glazed ceramic which became popular in the Eastern Han (25–220 CE).&lt;ref name="wang 1982 143 145"&gt;Wang (1982), 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Zhongshu]] states that the light-green [[stoneware]] known as [[celadon]] was thought to exist only since the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220–265 CE) onwards, but argues that ceramic shards found at Eastern Han (25–220 CE) sites of Zhejiang province can be classified as [[celadon]].&lt;ref name="wang 1982 145"&gt;Wang (1982), 145.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Richard Dewar argues that true celadon was not created in China until the early [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) when Chinese kilns were able to reach a minimum furnace temperature of {{convert|1260|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, with a preferred range of {{convert|1285|to|1305|C|F}} for celadon.&lt;ref name="dewar 2002 42"&gt;Dewar (2002), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Furnaces and smelting techniques===
A [[blast furnace]] converts raw [[iron ore]] into [[pig iron]], which can be remelted in a [[cupola furnace]] to produce [[cast iron]]. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BCE during the late [[Spring and Autumn period]], yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141–87 BCE) [[Economy of the Han dynasty|established a government monopoly over the iron industry]] in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely [[Foundry|foundries]] which recast iron that had been smelted elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2001), 7, 36–37, 64–68; Pigott (1999), 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron.&lt;ref name="wagner 2001 75 76"&gt;Wagner (2001), 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt; Cupola furnaces utilized a [[cold blast]] traveling through [[tuyere]] pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of [[charcoal]] and pig iron was introduced.&lt;ref name="wagner 2001 75 76"/&gt; The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a [[hot blast]] once it reached the bottom of the furnace.&lt;ref name="wagner 2001 75 76"/&gt;

[[File:Han Dynasty iron plow.jpg|thumb|upright|A Han-dynasty iron [[plowshare]]]]

Although Chinese civilization lacked the [[bloomery]], the Han Chinese were able to make [[wrought iron]] when they injected too much [[oxygen]] into the cupola furnace, causing [[decarburization]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigott (1999), 177 &amp; 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han-era Chinese were also able to convert cast iron and pig iron into wrought iron and [[steel]] by using the [[finery forge]] and [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], the earliest specimens of such dating to the 2nd century BCE and found at Tieshengguo near [[Mount Song]] of [[Henan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 125; Pigott (1999), 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The semisubterranean walls of these furnaces were lined with [[refractory]] bricks and had bottoms made of refractory clay.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides charcoal made of wood, [[Wang Zhongshu]] states that another furnace fuel used during the Han were "coal cakes", a mixture of [[coal]] powder, clay, and [[quartz]].&lt;ref name="wang 1982 126"&gt;Wang (1982), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of steel, iron, and bronze===
Donald B. Wagner writes that most domestic iron tools and implements produced during the Han were made of cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|the military]] preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1993), 336.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Han dynasty, the typical {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[bronze]] sword found in the [[Warring States period]] was gradually replaced with [[Chinese swords|an iron sword]] measuring roughly {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[dagger-axe]] (''ge'') made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron [[Ji (halberd)|''ji'' halberds]].&lt;ref name="wang 1982 123"&gt;Wang (1982), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[arrowhead]]s, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, until the end of the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 123"/&gt; Farmers, [[carpenter]]s, bamboo craftsmen, [[stonemason]]s, and [[rammed earth]] builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the [[plowshare]], [[pickaxe]], [[spade]], [[shovel]], [[hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[sickle]], [[axe]], [[adze]], [[hammer]], [[chisel]], [[knife]], [[saw]], [[scratch awl]], and [[Nail (fastener)|nails]].&lt;ref name="wang 1982 122"&gt;Wang (1982), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, [[stove]]s, [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pots]], [[belt buckle]]s, [[tweezers]], fire [[tongs]], [[scissors]], kitchen knives, [[fish hook]]s, and [[Sewing needle|needles]].&lt;ref name="wang 1982 123"/&gt; [[TLV mirror|Mirrors]] and [[oil lamp]]s were often made of either bronze or iron.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 103–105 &amp; 124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Coin money]] minted [[Economy of the Han dynasty|during the Han was made]] of either [[copper]] or copper and [[tin]] smelted together to make the bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (1986), 611–612; Nishijima (1986), 586–587.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==
{{Further|Economy of the Han dynasty|Agriculture in China|Sericulture}}

===Tools and methods===
Modern archaeologists have unearthed Han iron farming tools throughout China, from [[Inner Mongolia]] in the north to [[Yunnan]] in the south.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 53"&gt;Wang (1982), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The spade, shovel, pick, and [[plow]] were used for [[tillage]], the hoe for [[weed]]ing, the [[Rake (tool)|rake]] for loosening the soil, and the [[sickle]] for harvesting crops.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 53"/&gt; Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 54"&gt;Wang (1982), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron [[seed drill]] (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of [[Sowing|casting them out by hand]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberger (2006), 12; Cotterell (2004), 24; Wang (1982), 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; While artwork of the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] (220–265 CE) and [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] (265–420) periods show use of the [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]] for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25–220 CE).&lt;ref name="wang 1982 55"&gt;Wang (1982), 55.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irrigation]] works for agriculture included the use of [[water well]]s, artificial ponds and embankments, [[dam]]s, [[canal]]s, and [[sluice]] gates.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 55–56; Ebrey (1986), 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternating fields===
{{Further|Government of the Han dynasty}}
During [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu's]] (r. 141–87 BCE) reign, the Grain Intendant Zhao Guo (趙過) invented the alternating fields system (''daitianfa'' 代田法).&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 561"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 561.&lt;/ref&gt; For every [[Chinese units of measurement|''mou'']] of land—i.e. a thin but elongated strip of land measuring {{convert|1.38|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|331|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, or an area of roughly {{convert|457|m2|acre|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="wang 1982 55 56"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swann (1974), 361.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— three low-lying [[Ridge and furrow|furrows]] (''quan'' 甽) that were each {{convert|0.23|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide were sowed in straight lines with crop seed.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 561"/&gt; While weeding in the summer, the loose soil of the [[Ridge and furrow|ridges]] (''long'' 壟) on either side of the furrows would gradually fall into the furrows, covering the sprouting crops and protecting them from wind and drought.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 561"/&gt; Since the position of the furrows and ridges were reversed by the next year, this process was called the alternating fields system.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 561"/&gt;

[[File:Pottery cow, Han Dynasty.JPG|thumb|left|A Han-dynasty pottery model of a standing cow]]
This system allowed crops to grow in straight lines from sowing to harvest, conserved moisture in the soil, and provided a stable annual yield for harvested crops.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 562"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 562.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Guo first experimented with this system right outside the capital [[Chang'an]], and once it proved successful, he sent out instructions for it to every [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] administrator, who were then responsible for disseminating these to the heads of every [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]], [[District (China)|district]], and [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in their commanderies.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 562"/&gt; Sadao Nishijima speculates that the Imperial Counselor [[Sang Hongyang]] (d. 80 BCE) perhaps had a role in promoting this new system.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich families who owned oxen and large heavy moldboard iron plows greatly benefited from this new system.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 563 564"/&gt; However, poorer farmers who did not own oxen resorted to using teams of men to move a single plow, which was exhausting work.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 563 564"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 563–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The author Cui Shi (催寔) (d. 170 CE) wrote in his ''Simin yueling'' (四民月令) that by the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE) an improved plow was invented which needed only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it, had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil, and could sow roughly {{convert|45,730|m2|acre|abbr=on}} of land in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 563–564; Ebrey (1986), 616–617.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pit fields===
[[File:Western Han bull.JPG|thumb|A Western-Han pottery model of a sitting bull]]
During the reign of [[Emperor Cheng of Han]] (r. 33–7 BCE), Fan Shengzhi wrote a manual (i.e. the ''Fan Shengzhi shu'' 氾勝之書) which described the pit field system (''aotian'' 凹田).&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 564 565"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 564–565.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hinsch 2002 67 68"&gt;Hinsch (2002), 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, every ''mou'' of farmland was divided into 3,840 grids which each had a small pit that was dug {{convert|13.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|13.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and had good quality [[manure]] mixed into the soil.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 564 565"/&gt; Twenty seeds were sowed into each pit, which allegedly produced 0.6 L (20 [[fluid ounce|oz]]) of harvested grain per pit, or roughly 2,000 L (67,630 oz) per ''mou''.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 564 565"/&gt; This system did not require oxen-driven plows or the most fertile land, since it could be employed even on sloping terrains where supplying water was difficult for other methods of farming.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 565; Hinsch (2002) 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this farming method was favored by the poor, it did require intensive labor, thus only large families could maintain such a system.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 565–566; Hinsch (2002), 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rice paddies===
[[File:Eastern Han pottery paddy field.JPG|thumb|right|An Eastern-Han pottery model of a rice paddy field with farmers]]

Han farmers in the [[Yangzi River]] region of southern China often maintained [[paddy field]]s for growing [[rice]]. Every year, they would burn the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 568 569"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 568–569.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, the field lays [[Crop rotation|fallow]] for much of the year and thus did not remain very fertile.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 568 569"/&gt; However, Han rice farmers to the north around the [[Huai River]] practiced the more advanced system of [[Transplanting|transplantation]].&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 570 572"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 570–572.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 570 572"/&gt;

==Mechanical and hydraulic engineering==
{{Further|Mechanical engineering}}

===Literary sources and archaeological evidence===
[[File:Winnowing machine and tilt hammer.JPG|thumb|A Han-dynasty pottery model of two men operating a winnowing machine with a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank handle]] and a [[Trip hammer|tilt hammer]] used to pound grain.]]
Evidence of Han-era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars. Professional artisan-engineers (''jiang'' 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 2, 9; see also Barbieri-Low (2007), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Han scholars, who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. As written by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the [[Belt (mechanical)|belt drive]] was first used for a [[quilling]] device which wound silk fibers onto the [[bobbin]]s of weaver shuttles.&lt;ref name="temple 1986 54 55"&gt;Temple (1986), 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the belt drive was a crucial first step in the development of [[Technology of the Song dynasty|later technologies during the Song dynasty]], such as the [[chain drive]] and [[spinning wheel]].&lt;ref name="temple 1986 54 55"/&gt;

The inventions of the artisan-engineer Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the ''Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri-Low (2007), 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The official and poet [[Sima Xiangru]] (179–117 BCE) once hinted in his writings that the Chinese used a [[censer]] in the form of a [[gimbal]], a pivot support made of concentric rings which allow the central gimbal to [[rotate|rotate on an axis]] while remaining vertically positioned.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 233 234"&gt;Needham (1986c), 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first explicit mention of the gimbal used as an incense burner occurred around 180 CE when the artisan Ding Huan created his 'Perfume Burner for use among Cushions' which allowed burning incense placed within the central gimbal to remain constantly level even when moved.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 233–234; Barbieri-Low (2007), 198, writes that "For reasons I cannot determine, Joseph Needham estimated that Ding Huan was active around 180 CE, during the Latter Han period," although on the previous page 197, Barbieri-Low writes of Ding Huan's biography in the ''Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital'', "The avoidance of some tabooed written characters in his story suggest to me that Ding Huan's tale may have been written during the Latter Han period."&lt;/ref&gt; Ding had other inventions as well. For the purpose of indoor [[air conditioning]], he set up a large manually operated [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] which had rotating wheels that were {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 99, 134, 151, 233.&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented a lamp which he called the 'nine-storied hill-censer', since it was shaped as a hillside.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 1 123 temple 1986 87"&gt;Temple (1986), 87; Needham (1986b), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; When the cylindrical lamp was lit, the [[convection]] of rising hot air currents caused vanes placed on the top to spin, which in turn rotated painted paper figures of birds and other animals around the lamp.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 1 123 temple 1986 87"/&gt;

[[File:Mold for bronze gear Han dynasty.jpg|thumb|left|A Han-dynasty era [[Molding (process)|mold]] for making bronze [[gear]] wheels]]
When [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] (r. 202&amp;nbsp;– 195 BCE) came upon the treasury of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210) at [[Xianyang]] following the downfall of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206), he found an entire miniature musical orchestra of [[puppet]]s {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall who played [[Free reed aerophone|mouth organs]] if one pulled on ropes and blew into tubes to control them.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 158"&gt;Needham (1986c), 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Heng wrote in the 2nd century CE that people could be entertained by theatrical plays of artificial fish and dragons.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 158"/&gt; Later, the inventor [[Ma Jun]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 220–265) invented a theater of moving mechanical puppets powered by the rotation of a hidden waterwheel.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 158"/&gt;

From literary sources it is known that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed beforehand. This employed sliding levers and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the [[Crank (mechanism)|crank handle]]. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and [[gristmill]]s possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate [[Fan (mechanical)|the fans]] of winnowing machines.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 116 119, 153 154 &amp; PLATE CLVI temple 1986 46 wang 1982 57"&gt;Needham (1986c), 116–119, 153–154 &amp; PLATE CLVI; Temple (1986), 46; Wang (1982), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was used to separate [[chaff]] from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the [[windlass]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 116 119, 153 154 &amp; PLATE CLVI temple 1986 46 wang 1982 57"/&gt; To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the [[odometer]] cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 283–285.&lt;/ref&gt; The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in ''[[Li (length)|li]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 281–285.&lt;/ref&gt; From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal [[caliper]] to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 86–87; Loewe (1968), 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses of the waterwheel and water clock===

By the Han dynasty, the Chinese developed various uses for the [[waterwheel]]. An improvement of the simple [[lever]]-and-[[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] tilt hammer device operated by one's foot, the hydraulic-powered [[trip hammer]] used for pounding, [[Wiktionary:decorticate|decorticating]], and polishing grain was first mentioned in the [[Chinese dictionary|Han dictionary]] ''[[Jijiupian]]'' of 40 BCE.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 183 184 390 392"&gt;Needham (1986c), 183–184, 390–392.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also mentioned in the ''[[Fangyan|Regional Speech]]'' (''Fangyan'') dictionary written by [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 18 CE) in 15 BCE, the philosophical ''Xinlun'' 新論 written by [[Huan Tan]] (43 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 28 CE) in 20 CE, the poetry of [[Ma Rong]] (79–166 CE), and the writings of [[Kong Rong]] (153–208 CE).&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 183 184 390 392"/&gt;

In his ''[[Lunheng|Balanced Discourse]]'' (''Lunheng''), the philosopher [[Wang Chong]] (27–100 CE) was the first in China to describe the square-pallet [[chain pump]] used to lift water (and other substances).&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 89 110 344"&gt;Needham (1986c), 89, 110, &amp; 344.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 2 342 346"&gt;Needham (1986c), 342–346.&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in [[public works]] programs, such as when [[Zhang Rang]] (d. 189) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital [[Luoyang]] and [[Chinese Palaces|its palaces]] with clean water.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 33 &amp; 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acting as administrator of [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] in 31 CE, [[Du Shi]] (d. 38) invented a water-powered [[Reciprocating motion|reciprocator]] which worked the bellows of the blast furnace and cupola furnace in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the bellows.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 184; Needham (1986c), 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the astronomical [[armillary sphere]] (representing the [[celestial sphere]]) had existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power by using the constant [[pressure head]] of an inflow [[water clock]] to rotate a waterwheel that acted on a set of [[gear]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 30 &amp; 479 footnote e; de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 70; Bowman (2000), 595; Temple (1986), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Heng was also the first to address the problem of the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the [[timekeeper|timekeeping]]) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 30 &amp; 479 footnote e; de Crespigny (2007), 1050.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismometer===
The Han court was responsible for the major efforts of disaster relief when natural disasters such as [[earthquake]]s devastated the lives of commoners.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1986 621"&gt;Ebrey (1986), 621.&lt;/ref&gt; To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a [[seismometer]] in 132 CE, which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific [[Cardinal direction|cardinal or ordinal direction]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck {{convert|400|to|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern [[Gansu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Minford &amp; Lau (2002), 307; Balchin (2003), 26–27; Needham (1986a), 627; Needham (1986c), 484; Krebs (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 626"&gt;Needham (1986a), 626.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EastHanSeismograph.JPG|thumb|left|A modern replica of [[Zhang Heng]]'s [[seismometer]] of 132]]
As described in the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', the frame of the seismometer was a domed bronze vessel in the shape of [[Wine in China|a wine jar]], although it was {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter and decorated with scenes of mountains and animals.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986a), 626–627; Barbieri-Low (2007), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The trigger mechanism was an [[inverted pendulum]] (which the ''Book of the Later Han'' calls the "central column") that, if disturbed by the ground tremors of earthquakes located near or far away, would swing and strike one of eight mobile arms (representing the eight directions), each with a crank and catch mechanism.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 627 631"/&gt; The crank and a right angle lever would raise one of eight metal dragon heads located on the exterior, dislodging a metal ball from its mouth that dropped into the mouth of one of eight metal toads below arranged like the points on a [[compass rose]], thus indicating the direction of the earthquake.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 627 631"&gt;Needham (1986a), 627–631.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Book of the Later Han'' states that when the ball fell into any one of eight toad mouths, it produced a loud noise which gained the attention of those observing the device.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 626 627"&gt;Needham (1986a), 626–627.&lt;/ref&gt; While Wang Zhenduo (王振铎) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary [[Akitsune Imamura]] (1870–1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 631"&gt;Needham (1986a), 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Book of the Later Han'' states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 627 631"/&gt;

===Mathematical treatises===
[[File:九章算術.gif|thumb|right|A page of the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'']]
One of the earliest surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the ''[[Book on Numbers and Computation]]'' (''Suan shu shu''), part of the [[Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts]] dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in [[Jiangling County]], [[Hubei]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu et al. (2003), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was [[Zhoubi Suanjing|''The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven'']] (''Zhoubi Suanjing''), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the ''zhoubi'' school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until [[Cai Yong]]'s (132–192 CE) commentary of 180.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen (2007), 138–149; Dauben (2007), 213–214.&lt;/ref&gt; A preface was added to the text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century.&lt;ref name="dauben 2007 214"&gt;Dauben (2007), 214.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (''Jiuzhang Suanshu''); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by [[Liu Hui]] (fl. 3rd century) in 263.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 24 25"&gt;Needham (1986a), 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting in this context that many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lander. "State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region." T'oung Pao 100.4–5 (2014): 350–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovations in the treatises===
The ''Suan shu shu'' presents basic mathematics problems and solutions. It was most likely a handbook for day-to-day business transactions or affairs of government administration.&lt;ref name="dauben 2007 213"&gt;Dauben (2007), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains problems and solutions for field measurements of [[area]], proportional [[exchange rate]]s for agricultural [[millet]] and [[rice]], distribution by [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], short width division, and excess and deficiency.&lt;ref name="dauben 2007 212"&gt;Dauben (2007), 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the problems found in the ''Suan shu shu'' appear in the later text ''Jiuzhang suanshu''; in five cases, the titles are exact matches.&lt;ref name="dauben 2007 212"/&gt; However, unlike the ''Jiuzhang suanshu'', the ''Suan shu shu'' does not deal with problems involving right-angle triangles, [[square root]]s, [[cube root]]s, and [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix methods]], which demonstrates the significant advancements made in Chinese mathematics between the writings of these two texts.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben (2007) 212; Liu, Feng, Jiang, &amp; Zheng (2003), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese pythagoras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mathematical proof]] for the [[Pythagorean theorem]] (in Chinese: 勾股定理) as seen in the treatise ''[[Zhoubi Suanjing]]'' compiled during the Han dynasty]]
The ''Zhoubi suanjing'', written in dialogue form and with regularly presented problems, is concerned with the application of mathematics to [[astronomy]]. In one problem which sought to determine the height of the [[Sun]] from the [[Earth]] and the [[diameter]] of the Sun, Chen Zi (陳子) instructs Rong Fang (榮方) to wait until the shadow cast by the 8 ''chi'' tall [[gnomon]] is 6 ''[[Chinese units of measurement|chi]]'' (one ''chi'' during the Han was 33&amp;nbsp;cm), so that a 3-4-5 right-angle triangle can be constructed where the base is [[Li (unit)|60,000 ''li'']] (one ''li'' during the Han was the equivalent of 415 m or 1362&amp;nbsp;ft), the [[hypotenuse]] leading towards the sun is 100,000 ''li'', and the height of the sun is 80,000 ''li''.&lt;ref name="dauben 2007 219"&gt;Dauben (2007), 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Jiuzhang suanshu'', the ''Zhoubi suanjing'' also gives [[mathematical proof]] for the "Gougu Theorem" (勾股定理; i.e. where ''c'' is the length of the hypotenuse and ''a'' and ''b'' are the lengths of the other two sides, respectively, a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), which is known as the [[Pythagorean theorem]] in the West after the Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]] (fl. 6th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986a), 22; Dauben (2007), 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Jiuzhang suanshu'' was perhaps the most groundbreaking of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature [[negative number]]s, along with the [[Bakhshali manuscript]] (200?&amp;nbsp;– 600? CE) of [[India]] and the book of [[Greek mathematics|the Greek]] mathematician [[Diophantus]] (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 141; Liu, Feng, Jiang, &amp; Zheng (2003), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative numbers appeared as [[Counting rods|black counting rods]], while positive numbers appeared as [[Counting rods|red counting rods]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[decimal]] system existed in China since the [[Shang dynasty]] (c. 1600&amp;nbsp;– c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a [[Fraction (mathematics)|decimal fraction]] (i.e. the denominator [[Exponentiation|is a power]] of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] (46 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 23 CE).&lt;ref name="temple 1986 139 142 143"&gt;Temple (1986), 139 &amp; 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the ''Jiuzhang suanshu'', as a means to solve [[equation]]s and represent measurements.&lt;ref name="temple 1986 139 142 143"/&gt; [[Gaussian elimination]], an [[algorithm]] used to solve [[System of linear equations|linear equations]], was known as the Array Rule in the ''Jiuzhang suanshu''.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986a), 24–25, 121; Shen, Crossley, &amp; Lun (1999), 388; Straffin (1998), 166.&lt;/ref&gt; While the book used continued fractions to find the [[root of a function|roots of equations]], Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the decimals to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the [[Horner scheme]] named after [[William George Horner]] (1786–1837).&lt;ref name="temple 1986 142"&gt;Temple (1986), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approximations of pi===
[[File:Yanghui triangle.gif|thumb|right|[[Yang Hui]]'s ([[Pascal's triangle|Pascal's]]) triangle, as depicted by [[Zhu Shijie]] in 1303, using [[counting rods]]]]

For centuries, the Chinese had simply approximated the value of [[pi]] as 3, until Liu Xin approximated it at 3.154 sometime between 1–5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 99 100"&gt;Needham (1986a), 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of [[Wang Mang]] (9–23 CE) also showed [[Approximations of π|approximations for pi]] at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167.&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"&gt;Berggren, Borwein &amp; Borwein (2004), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to have made an approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the area of a square versus the area of its inscribed circle had an approximate [[ratio]] of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="berggren borwein 2004 27"/&gt; With ''D'' as [[diameter]] and ''V'' as volume, D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;:V = 16:9 or V=&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Berggren &amp; Borwein (2004), 27; Arndt, Haenel, &amp; Lischka (2001), 176.&lt;/ref&gt; To fix this, Zhang added &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to the formula, thus V = &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Since he found the ratio of the volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the area of a square to the inscribed circle is {{radic|8}}:{{radic|5}}.&lt;ref&gt;Berggren &amp; Borwein (2004), 27; Arndt, Haenel, &amp; Lischka (2001), 177.&lt;/ref&gt; With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the [[square root]] of 10, or 3.162.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Berggren &amp; Borwein (2004), 27; Arndt, Haenel, &amp; Lischka (2001), 177.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Han, [[Liu Hui's pi algorithm|Liu Hui approximated pi]] as 3.14159, while the mathematician [[Zu Chongzhi]] (429–500) [[Milü|approximated pi]] at 3.141592 (or &lt;sup&gt;355&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;113&lt;/sub&gt;), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986a), 100–101; Berggren, Borwein &amp; Borwein (2004), 20 &amp; 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical tuning and theory===
Mathematics were also used in [[musical tuning]] and [[music theory]]. The 2nd-century-BCE ''[[Huainanzi]]'', compiled by [[Eight Immortals of Huainan|eight scholars]] under the patronage of King [[Liu An]] (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of [[Chromatic scale|twelve tones]] on a [[musical scale]].&lt;ref name="mcclain ming 1979 207 208"&gt;McClain &amp; Ming (1979), 207–208.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jing Fang]] (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones.&lt;ref name="mcclain ming 1979 207 208"/&gt; While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 [[just fifth]]s is approximate to 31 [[octave]]s.&lt;ref name="mcclain ming 1979 212 needham 1986 volume 4 part 1 218 219"&gt;McClain &amp; Ming (1979), 212; Needham (1986b), 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; By calculating the difference at &lt;sup&gt;177147&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;176776&lt;/sub&gt;, Jing reached the same value of [[53 equal temperament]] duly discovered by the German mathematician [[Nicholas Mercator]] (1620–1687) (i.e. 3&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;/2&lt;sup&gt;84&lt;/sup&gt;, known as [[Mercator's comma]]).&lt;ref name="mcclain ming 1979 212 needham 1986 volume 4 part 1 218 219"/&gt; Later, the prince [[Zhu Zaiyu]] (1536–1611) in [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] and [[Simon Stevin]] (1548–1620) of the [[Flemish Region]] in [[Europe]] would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 209; Needham (1986b), 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical observations===
{{Further|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}
[[File:Lspn comet halley.jpg|thumb|right|The Han-era Chinese observed and tracked the movements of [[Halley's comet]] in 12 BCE, seen here in its 1986 reappearance.]]
The ancient Chinese made careful observations of heavenly bodies and phenomena since observations of the cosmos were used for [[astrology]] and prognostication.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1994), 61–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The astronomer [[Gan De]] (fl. 4th century BCE) from the [[Qi (state)|State of Qi]] was the first in history to acknowledge [[sunspot]]s as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing [[natural satellite]]s as thought in the West after [[Einhard]]'s observation in 807), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE, during the reign of [[Emperor Cheng of Han]] (r. 33–7 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at [[Mawangdui|Mawangdui Han tombs site]], [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province), the ''Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images'' (''Tianwen qixiang zazhan'' 天文氣象雜占) manuscript illustrates in writings and ink drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, [[mirage]]s, [[rainbow]]s, [[star]]s, [[constellation]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1994), 61; Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246–177 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1994), 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han-era Chinese noted the passage of the same comet seen in [[Persia]] for the birth of [[Mithridates II of Parthia]] in 135 BCE, [[Caesar's Comet|the same comet]] [[Ancient Rome|the Romans]] observed close to the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]] in 44 BCE, [[Halley's comet]] in 12 BCE, the same comet noted by Roman historian [[Cassius Dio]] (c. 155&amp;nbsp;– c. 229 CE) for 13 CE, and (what is now known to have been) a [[supernova]] in AD 185.&lt;ref name="loewe 1994 69"&gt;Loewe (1994), 69.&lt;/ref&gt; For various comets discussed in the Han-era history books ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' and ''[[Book of Han]]'', details are given for their position in the sky and direction they were moving, the length of time they were visible, their color, and their size.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1994), 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han-era Chinese also made [[star catalogue]]s, such as historian [[Sima Qian]]'s (145–86 BCE) ''A Monograph on Celestial Officials'' (''Tianguanshu'' 天官書) and Zhang Heng's 2nd-century-CE star catalogue which featured roughly 2,500 stars and 124 constellations.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Balchin (2003), 27; Sun &amp; Kristemaker (1997), 5 &amp; 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; To create a three-dimensional representation of such observations,&lt;ref&gt;Sun &amp; Kistemaker (1997), 25 &amp; 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) provided his [[armillary sphere]] with an [[Equatorial coordinate system|equatorial ring]] in 52 BCE. By 84 CE, the elliptical ring was added to the armillary sphere, while Zhang Heng's model of 125 added the [[celestial horizon]] ring and [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986a), 343; Barbieri-Low (2007), 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Han calendars===
{{Further|Government of the Han dynasty}}
[[File:Guardians of Day and Night, Han Dynasty.jpg|thumb|right|Han-dynasty paintings on [[tile]]; being conscious of time, the Chinese believed in [[Chinese mythology|guardian spirits]] for the divisions of day and night, such as these two guardians here representing 11 pm to 1 am (left) and 5 am to 7 am (right).]]
The Han Chinese used astronomical studies mainly to construct and revise their [[calendar]]. In contrast to the [[Julian calendar]] (46 BCE) and [[Gregorian calendar]] (1582) of [[Western world|the West]] (but like the [[Hellenic calendars]] of [[Classical Greece]]), the [[Chinese calendar]] is a [[lunisolar calendar]], meaning that it uses the precise movements of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] as time-markers throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen (2006), 7; Lloyd (1996), 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the spring and autumn periods of the 5th century BCE, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (古四分历), which measured the [[tropical year]] at 365&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; days (like the Julian calendar of Rome).&lt;ref name="deng 2005 67"&gt;Deng (2005), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (太初历) in 104 BCE, which measured the tropical year at 365&lt;sup&gt;385&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;1539&lt;/sub&gt; days and the [[lunar month]] at 29&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt; days.&lt;ref name="deng 2005 67"/&gt; Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, [[Emperor Zhang of Han]] (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 498.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, astronomer [[Guo Shoujing]] (1233–1316) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Deng (2005), 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the use of the calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the [[Sexagenary cycle]]—constructed by [[celestial stem]]s (''gan'' 干) and [[Earthly Branches]] (''zhi'' 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the [[Chinese astrology|Chinese zodiac]].&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomical theory===
Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century commentary in the ''Zhoubi suanjing'' describes two astronomical theories: in one, the heavens are shaped as a hemi-spherical dome extending over the earth, while the other compares the earth to the central [[egg yolk|yolk of an egg]], where the heavens are shaped as a [[celestial sphere]] around the earth.&lt;ref name="dauben 2007 214"/&gt; The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in his ''Model Sayings'' (''Fayan'' 法言) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in his ''Spiritual Constitution of the Universe'' (''Lingxian'' 靈憲) of 120 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Dauben (2007), 214; Balchin (2003), 27; Huang (1988), 64; Sun &amp; Kistemaker (1997), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Han-era Chinese believed in a [[geocentric model]] for the immediate [[solar system]] and greater universe, as opposed to a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]].

[[File:Geometry of a Lunar Eclipse.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of a [[lunar eclipse]], where the Earth obstructs the path of sunlight to the Moon]]
The Han-era Chinese discussed the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, or were they rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or [[crossbow]] bullets.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 227"&gt;Needham (1986a), 227.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 227"/&gt; For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 227"/&gt; In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 414"&gt;Needham (1986a), 414.&lt;/ref&gt; He also repeated Jing's comment that the side of the moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 414"/&gt; However, Zhang noted that [[sunlight]] did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a [[lunar eclipse]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 414"/&gt; He also noted that a [[solar eclipse]] occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 414"/&gt;

In his ''[[Lunheng|Balanced Discourse]]'' (''Lunheng''), [[Wang Chong]] (27–100 CE) wrote that some Han thinkers believed that rain fell from the Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 468"&gt;Needham (1986a), 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 468"/&gt; He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the [[evaporation]] of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact one and the same; in essence, he accurately described the [[water cycle]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 468"/&gt;

[[Timber]] was the chief building material in Han architecture.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"&gt;Ebrey (1999), 76.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of [[Mount Wutai]]) date no earlier than the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (2004), 228–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, as well as the often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Thorp (1986), 360–378.&lt;/ref&gt; What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of [[brick]] and [[rammed earth]] walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered [[Chinese glazed roof tile|ceramic roof tiles]] that once adorned timber halls.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 1 &amp; 30, 39–40, 148–149; Chang (2007), 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of the Han-era rammed earth [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] still exist in [[Gansu]] province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty [[beacon]] towers and two fortified [[castle]]s with [[crenellation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Han walls of frontier towns and forts in [[Inner Mongolia]] were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.&lt;ref&gt;Chang (2007), 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thatched or tiled roofs were supported by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; Stone and [[plaster]] were also used for domestic architecture.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they were supported by ''[[dougong]]'' brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (1999), 76; Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courtyard homes===
Valuable clues about Han architecture can be found in Han artwork of ceramic models, paintings, and carved or stamped bricks discovered in tombs and other sites.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; The layout of Han tombs were also built like underground houses, comparable to the scenes of [[courtyard house]]s found on tomb bricks and in three-dimensional models.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; Han homes had a courtyard area (and some had multiple courtyards) with halls that were slightly elevated above it and connected by stairways.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; Multi-story buildings included the main colonnaded residence halls built around the courtyards as well as [[watchtower]]s.&lt;ref name="ebrey 1999 76"/&gt; The halls were built with intersecting crossbeams and rafters that were usually carved with decorations; stairways and walls were usually plastered over to produce a smooth surface and then painted.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1968), 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chang'an and Luoyang, the Han capitals===
The ruins of the walls of Han's first capital [[Chang'an]] still stand today at {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height with a base width of {{convert|12|to|16|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 1 2"&gt;Wang (1982), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern archaeological surveys have proven that the eastern wall was {{convert|6,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, the southern wall was {{convert|7,600|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, the western wall was {{convert|4,900|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and the northern wall was 7,200 (23,622&amp;nbsp;ft) long.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 1 2"/&gt; Overall the total length of walls equalled {{convert|25,700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and formed a roughly square layout (although the southern and northern walls had sections which [[zigzag]]ged due to topographical concerns: rough terrain existed along the southern wall and the course of the [[Wei River]] obstructed the straight path of the northern wall).&lt;ref name="wang 1982 1 2"/&gt; The city's [[moat]] was {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep; the remains of what were wooden bridges have been discovered along the moat.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 2"&gt;Wang (1982), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chang'an had twelve [[gatehouse]]s leading into the city, three for each side of the wall, and acted as terminus points for the main avenues.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 2 3"&gt;Wang (1982), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Every gatehouse had three gateway entrances that were each {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide; Han-era writers claimed that each gateway could accommodate the traffic of four horse-drawn carriages at once.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 2 3"/&gt; [[Sewage collection and disposal|The drainage system]] included many drainholes that were dug under these gates and lined with bricks that form arches, where ceramic [[water pipe]]s have been found that once connected to the ditches built alongside the major streets.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 4"&gt;Wang (1982), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Only some wall sections and platform foundations of the city's once lavish imperial palaces remain.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 4 6"&gt;Wang (1982), 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the stone foundations of the armory were also discovered, but its wooden architecture had long since disappeared.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 4 6"/&gt;

Some sections of the wall ruins of Han's second capital [[Luoyang]] still stand at {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width at the base.&lt;ref&gt;Bielenstein (1986), 262; Wang (1982), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern wall was {{convert|3,900|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, the western wall was {{convert|3,400|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and the northern wall was {{convert|2,700|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, yet the southern wall was washed away when the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] changed its course centuries ago; by using the terminus points of the eastern and western walls, historians estimate that the southern wall was {{convert|2,460|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 30"/&gt; The overall walled enclosure formed a rectangular shape, yet with some disruptive curves due to topographical obstructions.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 30"&gt;Wang (1982), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Chang'an, Luoyang had twelve gatehouses, three for each side of the wall, while each gatehouse had three gateway entrances which led to major avenues within the city.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 30 31"&gt;Wang (1982), 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The rammed earth foundational platforms of religious altars and terraces still stand today outside of the walled perimeter of Luoyang, [[Society and culture of the Han dynasty|dedicated to the worship of deities]] and where state sacrifices were conducted.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 39"&gt;Wang (1982), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; They were approached by long ramps and once had timber halls built on top with verandas on the lower levels.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 39"/&gt;

===Underground tombs===
By the 1980s, over ten thousand brick-and-stone underground Han tombs had been discovered throughout China.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 175"&gt;Wang (1982), 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier Chinese tombs dating to the Warring States were often vertically dug pits lined with wooden walls.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 176"&gt;Wang (1982), 176.&lt;/ref&gt; In digging the tomb sites, Han workers would first build vertical pits and then dig laterally, hence the name "horizontal pits" for Han tombs; this method was also used for tomb sites dug into the sides of mountains.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 175"/&gt; The walls of most Western Han tombs were built of large hollow bricks while the smaller, non-hollow brick type that dominated Eastern Han tomb architecture (with some made out of stone) appeared in the late Western Han.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 175 177 178"&gt;Wang (1982), 175, 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller brick type was better-suited for Han tomb [[arch]]ways at entrances, [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] chambers, and [[dome]]d roofs.&lt;ref&gt;Wang (1982), 175, 177–178; Needham (1986d), 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits.&lt;ref name="watson 2000 108"&gt;Watson (2000), 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown.&lt;ref name="watson 2000 108"/&gt;

The layout of tombs dug into the sides of mountains typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of aboveground halls.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 176"/&gt; The tomb of King [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] (d. 113 BCE) in [[Hebei]] province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber).&lt;ref name="wang 1982 176"/&gt; Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs [[Qianling Mausoleum|as well as tombs in later dynasties]].&lt;ref&gt;Fong (1991), 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (''[[que (tower)|que]]'') from the Han dynasty have survived and can be found in the aboveground areas around Han tomb and shrine sites.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 279; Wang (1982), 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; They often formed part of outer walls, usually flanking an entry but sometimes at the corners of walled enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 279; Liu (2002), 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and [[Baluster|balustrades]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 279–280; Liu (2002), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boreholes and mining shafts===
On Han tomb brick reliefs of [[Sichuan]] province, scenes of [[borehole]] drilling for [[mining]] projects are shown.&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 191 194"/&gt; They show towering [[derrick]]s lifting liquid [[brine]] through [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipes]] to the surface so that the brine could be [[Distillation|distilled]] in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce [[salt]].&lt;ref name="loewe 1968 191 194"&gt;Loewe (1968), 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt; The furnaces were heated by [[natural gas]] brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from {{convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the surface could cause an explosion if it was not properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground [[carburetor]] chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with [[Exhaust system|exhaust pipes]].&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1968), 191–194; Temple (1986), 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated by a draft animal, usually oxen or [[water buffalo]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Tom (1989), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan (1994), 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shaft mining|Mining shafts]] dating to the Han dynasty have been found which reach depths of hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the earth, complete with spacious underground rooms structured by timber frames along with ladders and iron tools left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1968), 191–194; Wang (1982), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceramic model buildings===
{{Further|Society and culture of the Han dynasty#Arts and crafts}}
There are Han-era literary references to tall towers found in the capital cities; they often served as watchtowers, astronomical [[Observatory|observatories]], and religious establishments meant to attract the favor of [[Xian (Taoism)|immortals]].&lt;ref&gt;Loewe (1968), 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; The court eunuchs [[Zhao Zhong]] and [[Zhang Rang]] discouraged the aloof [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. AD 168–189) from ascending to the top floors of tall towers (claiming it would cause bad luck), in order to conceal from him the enormous palatial mansions the eunuchs built for themselves in Luoyang.&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 513–514.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known for certain whether or not miniature ceramic models of residential towers and watchtowers found in Han-dynasty tombs are completely faithful representations of such timber towers, yet they reveal vital clues about lost timber architecture.&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 pleasure 275 278"/&gt;

There are only a handful of existing ceramic models of multi-story towers from pre-Han and Western Han eras; the bulk of the hundreds of towers found so far were made during the Eastern Han period.&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 pleasure 275 278"&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 275–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Model towers could be fired as one piece in the kiln or assembled from several different ceramic pieces to create the whole.&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 pleasure 275 277"&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt; No one tower is a duplicate of the other, yet they share common features.&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 pleasure 275 277"/&gt; They often had a walled courtyard at the bottom, a balcony with balustrades and windows for every floor, roof tiles capping and concealing the ceiling [[rafter]]s, human figures peering out the windows or standing on the balconies, [[door knocker]]s, and [[Dogs in ancient China|pets such as dogs]] in the bottom courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 275–277, 280; Steinhardt (2005), "Tower Model," 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most direct pieces of evidence to suggest that miniature ceramic tower models are faithful representations of real-life Han timber towers are tile patterns.&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 tower 283 284"&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Tower Model" 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic patterns found on the circular tiles that cap the eave-ends on the miniature models are exact matches of patterns found on real-life Han roof tiles excavated at sites such as the royal palaces in Chang'an and Luoyang, and even the tiles of the original [[White Horse Temple]].&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 tower 283 284"/&gt; The ceramic model towers featured below come from tombs of the Han dynasty:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Besides towers, other ceramic models from the Han reveal a variety of building types. This includes multi-story [[Warehouse|storehouses]] such as [[Granary|granaries]], courtyard houses with multi-story halls, [[kiosk]]s, walled gate towers, mills, manufactories and [[workshop]]s, animal pens, [[outhouse]]s, and water wells.&lt;ref name="steinhardt 2005 pleasure 278"&gt;Steinhardt (2005), "Pleasure Tower Model," 278.&lt;/ref&gt; Even models of single-story [[farmhouse]]s show a great amount of detail, including tiled roofs, courtyards, steps leading to walkways, farmyards with troughs and basins, parapets, and privies.&lt;ref&gt;Juliano (2005), "Model Farm," 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Models of granaries and storehouses had tiled rooftops, ''dougong'' brackets, windows, and stilt supports raising them above ground level.&lt;ref&gt;Hiromi (2005), "Storehouse Model," 291.&lt;/ref&gt; Han models of water wells sometimes feature tiny tiled roofs supported by beams that house the rope [[pulley]] used for lifting the bucket.&lt;ref&gt;Liu (2005), "Green-glazed Wellhead," 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceramic models featured below come from tombs of the Han dynasty:

===Roads, bridges, and canals===
{{Further|Government of the Han dynasty}}
In order to facilitate commerce and communication as well as speed the process of tax collection and movement of military troops, the Han government sponsored the building of new roads, bridges, and [[:Category:Canals in China|canal waterways]].&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 238; Ebrey (1986), 614; Needham (1986d), 281.&lt;/ref&gt; These include repairs and renovation work on the [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System]] of [[Sichuan]] and [[Zhengguo Canal]] of [[Shaanxi]], both of which were built by the previous [[State of Qin]].&lt;ref name="wang 1982 55 56"&gt;Wang (1982), 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting the proposal of Ni Kuan ([[:zh:兒寬]]), in 111 BCE Emperor Wu commissioned Er to lead the project of creating extensions to the Zhengguo Canal that could irrigate nearby terrain elevated above the main canal.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 286"&gt;Needham (1986d), 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large amount of [[silt]] had built up over time at the bottom of the Zhengguo Canal (causing flooding), in 95 BCE another project was initiated to tap irrigation waters from further up the Jing River, requiring the dredging of a new {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} long canal following a [[Contour canal|contour line]] above the Zhengguo.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 286"/&gt; The Han state also maintained a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lander. “State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.” T’oung Pao 100.4–5 (2014): 325–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roadways, wooden bridges, postal stations, and relay stations were occasionally repaired, while many new facilities such as these were established.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey (1986), 613–614; Needham (1986d), 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt; As written by Han authors, roads built during the Han were tamped down with metal rammers, yet there is uncertainty over the materials used; [[Joseph Needham]] speculates that they were rubble and gravel.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The widths of roads ranged from narrow footpaths where only a single horse or oxen could pass at once to large highways that could accommodate the simultaneous passage of nine horse-drawn chariots abreast.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Fortified Han roadways were built as far west as [[Shanshan]] ([[Loulan Kingdom|Loulan]]) near the [[Lop Desert]], while [[Protectorate of the Western Regions|Han forces]] utilized routes that traversed north of the [[Taklamakan Desert]] towards [[Kashgar]].&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 18"&gt;Needham (1986d), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A vast network of roads, fortified passes, and wooden bridges built over rushing torrents in steep gorges of the [[Qin Mountains]] was consolidated during the Han, known as the [[gallery road]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Emperor Wu, roads were built to connect newly conquered territories in what is now [[Yunnan]] in the far southwest as well as the [[Korean Peninsula]] in the far northeast.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common bridge-types built during the Han was the wooden-trestle [[beam bridge]], described by literary sources and seen in reliefs carved on tomb bricks.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 149 150"&gt;Needham (1986d), 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for [[arch bridge]]s is elusive: one outside of [[Chengdu]]'s south gate is claimed to date to the Han period, while that built by Ma Xian (馬賢) (fl. 135 CE) was certainly a beam bridge.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 171 172"&gt;Needham (1986d), 171–172.&lt;/ref&gt; In artwork, a relief sculpture from a Han tomb in Sichuan province shows an arch bridge with a gradual curve, suggesting that it is segmental, although the use of such bridges are not entirely confirmed.&lt;ref name="liu 2002 56"&gt;Liu (2002), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are rare references to [[simple suspension bridge]]s in Han sources, these are only mentioned in connection with travels to foreign countries in the [[Himalaya]], [[Hindukush]] and [[Afghanistan]], demonstrating the antiquity of the invention there.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 4 part 3 187 188"&gt;Needham (1986d), 187–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Floating [[pontoon bridge]]s made of boats secured by iron chains were built during the Han (some even spanning the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangzi River]]) and were most often employed for military purposes since they could be easily assembled and then disassembled.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 161; Bielenstein (1986), 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
{{Further|Traditional Chinese medicine|Society and culture of the Han dynasty}}
[[File:Mawangdui2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]], found in the [[Mawangdui]], [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province, provide information not only on astronomy and mythology, but also on [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Han-era medicine]].]]

Much of the beliefs held by Han-era physicians are known to modern historians through such texts as the ''[[Huangdi Neijing|Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon]]'' (''Huangdi neijing'') medical corpus, which was compiled from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE and was mentioned in the ''Book of Later Han''.&lt;ref name="csikszentmihalyi 2006 181 182"&gt;Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from this text and others that their metaphysical beliefs in the [[Wu Xing|five phases]] and [[yin and yang]] dictated their medical decisions and assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi (2006), 181–182; Sun &amp; Kistemaker (1997), 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Han-era Chinese believed that each [[Zang-fu|organ in the body]] was associated with one of the five phases (metal 金, wood 木, water 水, fire 火, earth 土) and had two circulatory qi channels (任督二脉).&lt;ref name="csikszentmihalyi 2006 181 182"/&gt; If these channels were disrupted, Han medical texts suggest that one should consume an edible material associated with one of these phases that would counteract the organ's prescribed phase and thus restore one's health.&lt;ref name="csikszentmihalyi 2006 181 182"/&gt; For example, the Chinese believed that when the heart—associated with the fire phase—caused one to become sluggish, then one should eat sour food because it was associated with the wood phase (which promoted fire).&lt;ref name="csikszentmihalyi 2006 181 182"/&gt; The Han Chinese also believed that by using [[pulse diagnosis]], a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted "[[Qi|vital energy]]" (''qi'') and what qualities the latter had, in order to figure out the exact disorder the patient was suffering.&lt;ref name="hsu 2001 75"&gt;Hsu (2001), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine, Han texts also give practical advice, such as the proper way to perform [[clinical lancing]] to remove an [[abscess]].&lt;ref&gt;Hsu (2001), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Huangdi neijing'' noted the symptoms and reactions of people with various diseases of the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidneys in a 24-hour period, which was a recognition of [[circadian rhythm]], although explained in terms of the five phases.&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 124–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Jinkui Yaolue|Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber]]'' (''Jinkui yaolue''), [[Zhang Zhongjing]] (c. 150&amp;nbsp;– c. 219 CE) was the first to suggest a regulated diet rich in certain [[vitamin]]s could prevent [[Nutrition disorder|different types of disease]], an idea which led [[Hu Sihui]] (fl. 1314–1330) to prescribe a diet rich in [[Thiamin|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] as a treatment for [[beriberi]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang's major work was the [[Shang Han Lun|''Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders'']] (''Shanghan zabing lun'').&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1055.&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary and alleged associate [[Hua Tuo]] (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the ''Huangdi neijing'' and became knowledgeable in [[Chinese herbology]].&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 332"&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Hua Tuo used [[anesthesia]] on patients during [[surgery]] and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month.&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 332"/&gt; In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead [[fetus]] within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 332"/&gt;

Historical sources say that Hua Tuo rarely practiced [[moxibustion]] and [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 332"/&gt; The first mentioning of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the ''Huangdi neijing''.&lt;ref&gt;Omura (2003), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture needles made of gold were found in the tomb of the Han King [[Liu Sheng, Prince of Zhongshan|Liu Sheng]] (d. 113 BCE).&lt;ref name="omura 2003 19 22"/&gt; Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE).&lt;ref name="omura 2003 19 22"&gt;Omura (2003), 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of [[calisthenics]].&lt;ref name="de crespigny 2007 332"/&gt; In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the [[Mawangdui]], illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions.&lt;ref name="loewe 1994 65"&gt;Loewe (1994), 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] and [[qigong]] are derived from Han-era calisthenics.&lt;ref name="lo 2001 23"&gt;Lo (2001), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartography==
{{Further|History of cartography}}

[[Map]]-[[cartography|making]] in China preceded the Han dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps from the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] (found in [[Gansu]], displaying the region about the [[Jialing River]]) show [[Li (unit)|the measured distance]] between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues that these are to be considered the first known [[Economic geography|economic maps]] (as they predate the maps of [[Ancient Rome|the Roman]] geographer [[Strabo]], c. 64 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 24 CE).&lt;ref name="hsu 1993 90 93"&gt;Hsu (1993), 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Maps from the Han period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts]] at [[Mawangdui]].&lt;ref name="hsu 1993 90 93"/&gt; In contrast to the Qin maps, the Han maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu (1993), 90–93; Hansen (2000), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the maps discovered at [[Mawangdui]] shows positions of [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Han military garrisons]] which were to attack [[Nanyue]] in 181 BCE.&lt;ref name="hansen 2000 125"&gt;Hansen (2000), 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|left|An early Western-Han silk map found in tomb 3 of [[Mawangdui|Mawangdui Han tombs site]], depicting the Kingdom of Changsha and Kingdom of Nanyue in southern China (note: the south direction is oriented at the top).]]
In [[Chinese literature]], the oldest reference to a map comes from the year 227 BCE, when the assassin [[Jing Ke]] was to present a map to Ying Zheng 嬴政, King of Qin (ruling later as [[Qin Shi Huang]], r. 221–210 BC) on behalf of [[Crown Prince Dan of Yan]]. Instead of presenting the map, he pulled out a dagger from his scroll, yet was unable to kill Ying Zheng.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 534 535"&gt;Needham (1986a), 534–535.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Rites of Zhou]]'' (''Zhouli''), compiled during the Han and commented by Liu Xin in the 1st century CE, mentioned the use of maps for governmental provinces and districts, principalities, frontier boundaries, and locations of ores and minerals for mining facilities.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 534 535"/&gt; The first Chinese [[gazetteer]] was written in 52 CE and included information on territorial divisions, the founding of cities, and local products and customs.&lt;ref&gt;Hargett (1996), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271 CE) was the first to describe in detail the use of a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] and [[Grid reference|geometrically plotted reference grid]].&lt;ref&gt;Hsu (1993), 93–94; Needham (1986a), 538–540.&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians Howard Nelson, Robert Temple, and [[Rafe de Crespigny]] argue that there is enough literary evidence that Zhang Heng's now lost work of 116 CE established the geometric reference grid in Chinese cartography (including a line from the ''Book of Later Han'': "[Zhang Heng] cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it").&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Nelson (1974), 359; Temple (1986), 30; see also Barbieri-Low (2007), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is speculation fueled by the report in Sima's ''Records of the Grand Historian'' that a gigantic [[raised-relief map]] representing the Qin Empire is located within the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, it is known that small raised-relief maps were created during the Han dynasty, such as one made out of rice by the military officer [[Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)|Ma Yuan]] (14 BCE&amp;nbsp;– 49 CE).&lt;ref name="temple 1986 179"&gt;Temple (1986), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, an ancient [[shipyard]] discovered in [[Guangzhou]] is now dated to the late 3rd century BCE, made during either the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE) or early Western Han dynasty.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 122"/&gt; It had three large platforms capable of building wooden ships that were {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and had a weight capacity of 60 metric tons.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 122"/&gt; Another Han shipyard in what is now [[Anhui]] province had a government-operated maritime workshop where battle ships were assembled.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 582"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 582.&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread use of iron tools during the Han dynasty was essential for crafting such vessels.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 122"/&gt;

The [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty]] led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu [[Han–Nanyue War|conquered]] the Kingdom of [[Nanyue]] in what is now modern [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern Vietnam]] and [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]]; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]], as foreign merchants brought [[lapis lazuli]], [[pearl]]s, [[jade]], and [[glass]]wares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route.&lt;ref name="nishijima 1986 579 580"&gt;Nishijima (1986), 579–580.&lt;/ref&gt; When a group of travelers from the [[Roman Empire]] (allegedly diplomats of [[Marcus Aurelius]] but most likely [[Roman commerce|Roman merchants]]) [[History of the Han dynasty|came to the Han court in 166 CE]], they allegedly came from this southern trade route.&lt;ref&gt;Nishijima (1986), 579–580; Liu (1988), 19; de Crespigny (2007), 600.&lt;/ref&gt; By at least the 1st century CE&amp;nbsp;— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs&amp;nbsp;— the Chinese would have been able to brave distant waters with the new [[steering]] invention of the stern-mounted [[rudder]]. This came to replace the less efficient [[steering oar]].&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 627–628; Chung (2005), 152; Tom (1989), 103–104; Adshead (2000), 156; Fairbank &amp; Goldman (1998), 93; Block (2003), 93 &amp; 123.&lt;/ref&gt; While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified [[lou chuan|tower ship]] meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the [[Junk (ship)|''junk'' design]] (''jun'' 船) created by the 1st century was China's first seaworthy sailing ship.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986d), 678; Turnbull (2002), 4 &amp; 14–16; Woodman (2002), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical junk has a square-ended [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]], a flat-bottomed [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] or [[Carvel (boat building)|carvel-shaped]] hull with no [[keel]] or [[sternpost]], and [[Bulkhead (partition)|solid transverse bulkheads]] in the place of [[Boat building|structural ribs]] found in Western seacrafts.&lt;ref&gt;Turnbull (2002), 14; Needham (1986d), 390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or [[block and tackle]] (which differed from the later European [[pintle]] and [[gudgeon]] design of the 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;Adshead (2000), 156; Mott (1991), 2–3, 92, 84, 95f.&lt;/ref&gt; As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had [[Junk Rig|for-and-aft rigs]] and [[lug sails]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986), 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eastern Han pottery chariot.JPG|thumb|right|A pottery model of a horse-drawn, roofed chariot from the Eastern Han period]]
Although horse and ox-drawn [[cart]]s and spoke-wheeled [[chariot]]s had existed in China long before the Han dynasty, it was not until the 1st century BCE that literary evidence pointed to the invention of the [[wheelbarrow]], while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 263–267; Greenberger (2006), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive amount of pressure on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the [[State of Chu]] (as seen on a Chu [[lacquerware]]).&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 310; Temple (1986), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb [[relief]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 308–312.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final stage of evolution, the modern [[horse collar]] was invented in China by the 5th century, during the [[Northern Wei]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Needham (1986c), 319–323.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaponry and war machines==
{{Further|Military history of China (pre-1911)|Naval history of China|Chinese armour}}
The pivot [[catapult]], known as the traction [[trebuchet]], had existed in China since the [[Warring States period]] (as evidenced by the ''[[Mozi]]'').&lt;ref name="turnbull 2001 18"&gt;Turnbull (2001), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; It was regularly used in sieges during the Han dynasty, by both besiegers and the besieged.&lt;ref name="turnbull 2001 18"/&gt; The most common projectile weapon used during the Han dynasty was the small handheld, trigger-activated [[History of crossbows|crossbow]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[repeating crossbow]]), first invented in China during the 6th or 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;You (1994), 80; Wagner (1993), 153 &amp; 157–158; Mao (1998), 109–110; Wright (2001), 42 &amp; 159; Lin (1993), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nomadic [[Xiongnu]] were able to twist their waists slightly while horse-riding and shoot arrows at targets behind them, the official [[Chao Cuo]] (d. 154 BCE) deemed the Chinese crossbow superior to the Xiongnu bow.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo (2002), 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = A Chinese [[crossbow]] mechanism with a buttplate from either the late Warring States Period or the early Han; made of bronze and inlaid with silver | footer_align = left | image1 = Warring States or Western Han crossbow.jpg | width1 = 150 | caption1  = | image2 = Warring States or Western Han crossbow2.jpg | width2 = 150| caption2  = }}

The Han Chinese also employed [[chemical warfare]]. In quelling a peasant revolt near [[Guiyang]] in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying [[bellows]] that were used to pump powdered lime ([[calcium oxide]]) at the rebels, who were dispersed.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 167"&gt;Needham (1986f), 167.&lt;/ref&gt; In this same instance, they also lit [[incendiary device|incendiary]] rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 5 part 7 167"/&gt;

To deter pursuits of marching infantry or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made [[caltrop]]s (barbed iron balls with sharp spikes sticking out in all directions) that could be scattered on the ground and pierce the feet or hooves of those who were unaware of them.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 123"/&gt;

'''Simeon "Sima" Milutinović "Sarajlija"''' ({{lang-sr-cyr| Симеон "Сима" Милутиновић "Сарајлија"}}, {{IPA-sh|sǎːʋa milutǐːnɔʋit͡ɕ sarǎjlija|pron}}; 3 October 1791 – 30 December 1847) was a [[Bosnian Serb]] [[poetry|poet]], [[hajduk]], [[translator]], [[historian]], [[philologist]], [[diplomat]] and [[adventurer]].&lt;ref name="HE"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=40962 |contribution=Milutinović Sarajlija, Sima |title=[[Croatian Encyclopedia]] |year=1999–2009 |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža]] |language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From his birth his life was a constant adventure. It began with his family's flight from the plague and the Turks. Its zenith came during the Serbian insurrections, and it ended in the unmatched glory of a poet and his grandiose political plans.

==Life and work==
Sima Milutinović was born in [[Sarajevo]], [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1791, hence his nickname Sarajlija (''The Sarajevan''). His father was from the village of [[Rožanstvo]] near [[Užice]], which he left running away from the [[plague (disease)|plague]] and eventually settled in Sarajevo long enough to marry a famed town beauty Anđelija Srdanović who is Sima's mother.

Sima wasn't even two years of age when another plague outbreak hit Sarajevo. The family fled the town, seeking refuge on several locations in Bosnia, before going to [[Slavonski Brod]], before ending up in Zemun where Sima commenced primary education but never completed it. He then attended school in [[Szeged]] (Hungary) and was later expelled from [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]].

During the [[First Serbian Uprising]] he was a [[scribe]] in [[Karađorđe]]'s [[Government of Serbia|Governing Council]] (Praviteljstvujušći Sovjet). Sarajlija laid [[Dositej Obradović]] to rest and joined a guerilla band, commanded by hajduk [[Zeka Buljubaša]]. It was in the heat of battles with [[Ottoman Turks]] that his first poems germinated. They were not revolutionary odes, however, but love songs. They were inspired by his first great love - Fatima, a Turkish girl. After the collapse of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] he was a [[hajduk]] and teacher in [[Vidin]]. He also spent a year or two in a Turkish dungeon.  After evading the Turks, he went to [[Chişinău]] (then part of Russia), where he remained, long enough to write ''The Serbian Maid''. It is said that he sent reports to confidants of [[Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia]] concerning Karađorđe's followers in exile. This did not keep him later from turning against the Obrenović faction. In 1825 he went to Germany where he enrolled in the [[University of Leipzig]], though he did not tarry there. Instead, a year later, he went back to Serbia to be a clerk in the employ of Prince Miloš but on arriving in Zemun, however, he turned about and went to [[Trieste]], [[Kotor]], and then [[Cetinje]].

He arrived in Cetinje on 25 September 1827, uninvited, led by the passions of adventure and poetry and, at the same time, deep patriotism. He was neither the first nor the last stranger to be attracted by the blazing heroism and hidden power of Montenegro. A gifted adventurer—Stephen the Small—had once wandered into this land from out of nowhere, and organized the first civil government. There was something of the adventurer in the Petrović bishops as well—in every one of them, in one way or another. Sarajlija simply blew into the Montenegro wilderness, fleeing before the Kotor police because of the
irregularity of his documents. He was to captivate Bishop [[Petar I Petrović Njegoš]] from the beginning. "As soon as I laid eyes on him, he came to my heart", the old man wrote to '''Jeremija Gagić''', the Russian vice-consul at [[Dubrovnik]], and added, "I do not know whether any other Serb would be willing to live in Montenegro." Sarajlija found Rade (the Bishop's nephew and the future [[Petar II Petrović Njegoš]]) there when he arrived.

The Bishop immediately took him in as a secretary. Sima pushed himself forward and grasped for power. He was not only sent, but he went himself among the tribes to dispense justice and settle disputes. He took upon himself the education of Bishop's nephew Rade. Then suddenly something came into his head and he disappeared into the mountains, shut himself up in a hut, and after several days returned with the tragedy ''[[Obilić]]''.

He already had been everywhere, had experienced everything, had seen many different forms of government—including those born of revolution and arising from the most primitive conditions. He was nurtured in rebellions and prisons, in political strife, intrigue, and espionage, and, being himself unstable, unpredictable, he was accustomed to quick upheavals. Bishop Petar was to have many trials and tribulations with him. Sima got the old man to sign unread letters which brought the latter into conflict with Prince Miloš of Serbia. Miloš who recognized and had a regard for the genuine thing, was to pronounce a final judgement on Sima: ''A young cloud-chaster whose nose scrapes the sky.''

As soon as he arrived, Sarajlija began to think up schemes, to have ideas, to lay plans. How would it be, he proposed an alliance to Prince Miloš to attack the Turks? He was in the very eye of the Montenegrin storm which lay pent up in the stillness of the monastery waiting to break out at the death of the old Bishop.

Direct and provocative, Sarajlija hardly felt like a stranger. Nor was he regarded as such. It was as though his irrepresible nature had found refuge for the first time, in a land in which—as he himself said -- ''every rifle is a cannon, every head anointed, every wish the general will, every home a castle, and every cliff a fortress.''

He was a handsome man with a mighty frame, and this is not without importance in Montenegro. That is what his painting (the excellent portrait done by Katarina Ivanoviċ) also portrays—masculine beauty, willfulness, energy. He already enjoyed the fame of a poet, and his life was stormy even for those times of rebellions and revolutions. In 1829 [[Bjelice]] tribe struggled against [[Ozirinići]] and [[Cuce, Montenegro|Cuce]], two neighboring tribes, and [[Petar I Petrović-Njegoš]] sent Sarajlija and Mojsije to negotiate peace among them.&lt;ref name="ObenAubin1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miloš Oben|author2=Michel Aubin|title=Njegoš i istorija u pesnikovom delu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpliAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 May 2013|year=1989|publisher=Književne novine|page=63|quote=Бјелице су племе у Катунској нахији. Водили су 1829. оружану бор- бу са два суседна племена, Озринићима и Цуцама. Да би успоставио мир, Петар I је решио да им пошаље Симу Милутиновића и Мојсија }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarajlija remained in Cetinje more than three years—until the spring of 1831. But he still did not have enough of Montenegro. He was to come another three times—to be sure, on secret, inexplicable, and perhaps even invetented missions.

In 1836 he escorted Prince Miloš to Istanbul, only to find himself immediately thereafter in Prague, Vienna, and Budapest. He remained a while in Budapest and married there, in 1838, '''Marija Popović-Punktatorka''' (1810&amp;ndash;1875), who was also a poet. (She carried on a lively correspondence with [[Vuk Karadžić]], '''Milovan Vidaković''', and [[Đorđe Marković Koder]] among many other men of letters, even before her marriage). In 1839 he was in Belgrade—deep in political intrigue. Again flight and wandering. In 1846 he led a group of Serbian students to St. Petersburg, where they were to study. He died suddenly in [[Belgrade]] at the end of 1847 at the height of his strength and vigor. He was mourned by all, as the greatest Serbian poet (of his day), even in distant Montenegro, where his erstwhile pupil, Njegoš, dedicated to his ashes an ode which was lavish and unstinting in love and appreciation. He was buried in the graveyard at [[St. Mark's Church, Belgrade|St. Mark's Church]].

[[Image:Rabbi Rapoport-Machek.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Rabbi Rapoport by &lt;br /&gt;[[Antonin Machek]]]]

'''Solomon Judah Löb Ha[[Kohen]] Rapoport''' (June 1, 1786 – October 15, 1867) ([[Hebrew]]: שלמה יהודה כהן רפאפורט), was a [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]n [[rabbi]] and [[Jew]]ish scholar. He was born in [[Lemberg]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller, the daughter of the well-known [[Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller|Aryeh Leib Heller]], and was instrumental in publishing the work ''Avnei Miluim'' of his father in law. He wrote both the index, sources and numerous comments.

After various experiences in business, Rapoport became rabbi of [[Tarnopol]] (1837) and of [[Prague]] (1840). He was one of the founders of the new [[Wissenschaft des Judentums]] movement. His chief work was the first part of an ([[unfinished work|unfinished]]) encyclopaedia ("Erekh Millin", 1852). Equally notable were his biographies of [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Nathan ben Jehiel|Nathan]] (author of the ''[[Arukh]]''), [[Hai Gaon]], [[Eleazar Kalir]] and others.

Thrown upon his own resources about 1817, Rapoport became the collector of the meat-tax on farmers. He had already given evidence of marked critical ability, though his writings previously published were of a light character—poems and translations. His critical talent, however, soon revealed itself. In 1824 he wrote an article for ''Bikkure ha-'Ittim'' on the independent Jewish tribes of [[Saudi Arabia|Arabia]] and [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]. Though this article gained him some recognition, a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times (published in the same journal in 1829), the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages. Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends, especially [[S. D. Luzzatto]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernfeld, ''Toledot Shir'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fashion in rabbinic circles, Rapoport was known by an acronym "Shir", formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name '''Sh'''elomo '''Y'''ehuda '''R'''apoport (Shir literally means "song" in Hebrew).

[[Leopold Greenwald]] quotes a letter from Mendel Mahr to [[Moses Sofer]], regarding Sofer's attitude towards Rapoport. Mahr criticized what he felt was an overly moderate stance by Sofer, and mentioned that it was well known in Lemberg that Rapoport had had an affair with a married woman which lasted around two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenwald |first=Leopold  |date= |title=אוצר נחמד - תקופות סערות בחיי הגאון חתם סופר|trans-title= ''Otzar Nechmad-Tekufos Saaros Bechayei HaChasam Sofer''|url=http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2587&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=87&amp;hilite= |language=Hebrew |page=87|location= |publisher= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Sephirot as vowel sounds==
Solomon Judah Löb Rapoport notes that according to the [[Masoretes]] there are ten vowel sounds. He suggests that the passage in the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'', which discusses the manipulation of letters in the creation of the world, can be better understood if the Sephirot refer to vowel sounds.  He posits that the word ''sephirah'' in this case is related to the Hebrew word ''sippur'' ("to retell"). His position is based on his belief that most [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] works written after ''Sefer Yetzirah'' (including the ''[[Zohar]]'') are forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:The Two Babylons (7th Edition).jpg|thumb|Cover of the 7th edition of ''The Two Babylons'' (1871), which claims that [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrines and ceremonies are a veiled continuation of [[Babylonia]]n paganism.]]
'''''The Two Babylons''''', subtitled '''''The Papal Worship Proved to Be the Worship of Nimrod and His Wife''''' is a religious [[pamphlet]] published in 1853 by the [[Presbyterian]] [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Alexander Hislop]] (1807–65).

Its central theme is its allegation that the [[Catholic Church]] is a veiled continuation of the [[pagan]] religion of ancient [[Babylon]], the product of a millennia-old secret [[New World Order (conspiracy)|conspiracy]] founded by the Biblical king [[Nimrod]] and the Assyrian queen [[Semiramis]], who Hislop claimed was Nimrod's wife.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabbe|first=Lester L.|authorlink=Lester L.

Modern scholars have unanimously rejected the book's arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion,&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mcllhenny"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mcllhenny|first1=Albert M.|title=This Is the Sun?: Zeitgeist and Religion (Volume I: Comparative Religion)|date=2011|isbn=978-1-105-33967-7|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=KymmAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Alexander+Hislop+debunked&amp;ots=-uFxjecdKP&amp;sig=UvBeem9hvfz2T-p-RKkD3ROfGpk#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Hislop&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but variations of them are accepted among some groups of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]].&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mcllhenny"/&gt;

==Publication history==
It was expanded in 1858, going through many editions. A 3rd edition was published in 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Babylons Third Edition|url=https://archive.org/stream/twobabylonsorpa00hislgoog#page/n6/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 7th in 1871,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Babylons Seventh Edition|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029406448#page/n1/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; a popular edition in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Two Babylons Popular Edition|url=https://archive.org/stream/thetwobabylonsor00hisluoft#page/n1/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed on many websites that ''The Two Babylons'' was only finally published as a book in 1919, even though the third edition had already reached 500 pages in length.

The book has been published by various Protestant publishing houses over the years, one being [[Chick Tract|Chick Publications]], which is still publishing the book as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/catalog/books/0185.asp ''The Two Babylons''], Chick Publications, retrieved 2018-08-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Hislop builds on the [[Panbabylonism|Panbabylonian]] school of [[Hyperdiffusionism in archaeology|Hyperdiffusionism]], which was common in the 19th century, to argue that Classical and Ancient Near Eastern civilization took its inspiration from [[Babylon]]. From this, he derives the argument that the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]] of [[Late Antiquity]] were actually offshoots of one ancient religion founded at the [[Tower of Babel]]. Panbabylonism has since been relegated to pseudohistory by some 20th-century scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Peter Lancaster. ''Megaliths, Myths and Men: An Introduction to Astro-Archaeology'' p. 268. Dover Publications, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Hislop's work centers on his association of the legendary [[Ninus]] and his semi-historical wife [[Semiramis]] with the Biblical [[Nimrod]] as her husband and her son, with their incestuous male offering being [[Tammuz]]. [[Hellenistic]] histories of the Ancient Near East tended to conflate their faint recollections of the deeds of ancient kings into legendary figures who exerted far more power than any ancient king ever did. In Assyria, they invented an [[eponymous]] founder of [[Nineveh]] named Ninus, who supposedly ruled 52 years over an empire comparable to the Persian Empire at its greatest extent. Ninus's wife Semiramis was in turn a corruption of the historical figure [[Shammuramat]], regent of the [[Neo-Assyrian]] Empire from 811 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Hislop takes Ninus as a historical figure, and associates him with the Biblical figure [[Nimrod]], though he was not the first to do so. The [[Clementine literature]] made the association in the 4th Century AD. An influential belief throughout the Middle Ages was that Ninus was the inventor of Idolatry,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Camille]], The Gothic Idol: Ideology and Image-Making in Medieval Art, Cambridge,1991: 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept that Hislop clearly drew upon. However, Hislop wrote before the historical records of the ancient near east had been thoroughly decoded and studied, that cast doubt in the decades after he wrote whether there was any such figure as Ninus, and the Greek authors whom he quoted lacked credibility on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Sarah Raup|title=Historical Fictions and Hellenistic Jewish Identity: Third Maccabbees in its Cultural Context|date=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0-520-23307-7|pages=112-113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mfiJ6foYhMAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=Was+Ninus+a+historical+figure?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Pdm5BXVl-r&amp;sig=6xaLfpuiBMd5f6KJHTwnR1PpiLo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLl-OfoZ7UAhVK7oMKHXj5DMIQ6AEIYDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=Was%20Ninus%20a%20historical%20figure%3F&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ishtar Eshnunna Louvre AO12456.jpg|thumb|Relief of the Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]], whose name Hislop  claimed to be the root behind the English word ''Easter'']]

''The Two Babylons'' heavily relies on [[Austen Henry Layard]]'s publications of his excavations at Nineveh, which had only been just discovered in 1851. This gave his work an appearance of being well-researched at the time of its publication. For example, Hislop linked the name of [[Easter]] with [[Astarte]], the [[Phoenicia]]n fertility goddess by citing Layard's recent discovery of Astarte's Assyrian name, ''[[Ishtar]]'', which Hislop took to be "identical" to Easter.
{{Quote|text=What means the term Easter itself? It is not a Christian name. It bears its [[Babylon|Chaldean]] origin on its very forehead. Easter is nothing else than Astarte, one of the titles of [[Beltis]], the queen of heaven, whose name, as pronounced by the people Nineveh, was evidently identical with that now in common use in this country. That name, as found by Layard on the Assyrian monuments, is Ishtar. |author=Hislop |source=The Two Babylons, Chapter 3, Section 2, Easter}}

The claim that ''Easter'' is derived from ''Ishtar'' has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=D'Costa|first1=Krystal|title=Beyond Ishtar: The Tradition of Eggs at Easter: Don't believe every meme you encounter.|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/beyond-ishtar-the-tradition-of-eggs-at-easter/|website=Scientific American|publisher=Nature America, Inc.|accessdate=8 July 2017}}{{RS|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern etymologists derive the word ''Easter'' from the Proto-Indo-European root ''*aus-'', meaning "dawn,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvert Watkins|Watkins, Calvert]] (2006 [2000]). ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots''. p. 2021.

''On the Etymology of Ishtar.'' Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 31, No. 4 (1911), pp. 355-358&lt;/ref&gt;

Hislop ultimately claimed to trace Catholic doctrines back to the [[worship]] of [[Nimrod]], asserting that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] represented [[Whore of Babylon]] of the [[Book of Revelation]] and that "the [[Pope]] himself is truly and properly the lineal representative of [[Belshazzar]]". He claimed that the [[Christogram]] IHS, the first three Greek letters in the name of Jesus, represented Latin characters standing for [[Isis]], [[Horus]] and [[Geb|Seb]].

==Analysis==

In the note by the editor of the 7th edition, which was published in 1871, it was claimed, "that no one, so far as we are aware, has ventured to challenge the accuracy of the historical proofs adduced in support of the startling announcement on the title page." Since then however there have been many who have challenged the accuracy of Hislop's claims. For example, [[Lester L. Grabbe]] has highlighted the fact that Hislop's entire argument, particularly his association of [[Ninus]] with [[Nimrod]], is based on a misunderstanding of historical Babylon and its religion.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; Grabbe also criticizes Hislop for portraying the mythological queen [[Semiramis]] as Nimrod's consort,&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; despite the fact that she is never even mentioned in a single text associated with him,&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; and for portraying her as the "mother of harlots",&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt; even though this is not how she is depicted in any of the texts where she is mentioned.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;

In 2011, a critical edition was published.&lt;ref&gt;which also contains the English book by Ralph Woodrow ''Von Babylon nach Rom? – The Two Babylons?'', 2011; {{ISBN|978-3-9811529-5-1}}, as well as the papers by Ralph Woodrow and Dr. Eddy Lanz&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hislop's work is extensively footnoted, some commentators (in particular [[Ralph Woodrow]]) have stated that the document contains numerous misconceptions, fabrications, logical fallacies, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and grave factual errors.&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow, Ralph [http://equip.org/article/the-two-babylons/ BOOK REVIEW - The Two Babylons: A Case Study in Poor Methodology] Christian Research Institute, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Some [[Christian Fundamentalism|fundamentalist Protestants]] still regard Hislop's book as proof that the Roman Catholic Church is, in fact, the continuation of ancient Babylonian religion.&lt;ref name="Grabbe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mcllhenny"/&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] periodical ''[[The Watchtower]]'' frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="veith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2013/02/lent-and-ash-wednesday-are-not-pagan-relics/|title=Lent and Ash Wednesday are NOT pagan relics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's thesis has also featured prominently in the [[conspiracy theories]] of [[racist]] groups such as [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun [https://books.google.com/books?id=bdGSbDaCQVsC&amp;dq Religion and the Racist Right], pp. 192-193, UNC Press 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and other fringe groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq A Culture of Conspiracy], p. 210, Univ. of California Press 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Author and [[conspiracy theorist]] [[David Icke]] incorporates Hislop's claims about Semiramis into his book ''The Biggest Secret'', claiming that Semiramis played a key role in the establishment of a global conspiracy run by [[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilian]] aliens, whom he asserts is secretly controlling humanity.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''The Biggest Secret, 52-54''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the theory of [[Leninist]] [[Communist revolution|revolution]]ary struggle, '''vanguardism''' is a strategy whereby the most class-conscious and politically advanced sections of the [[proletariat]] or working class, described as the '''revolutionary vanguard''', form organizations in order to draw larger sections of the working class towards revolutionary politics and serve as manifestations of proletarian political power against its [[class enemies]].

==Foundations==
[[Vladimir Lenin]] popularized political vanguardism as conceptualized by [[Karl Kautsky]], detailing his thoughts in one of his earlier works, ''[[What is to be done?]]''. Lenin argued that [[Marxism|Marxism's]] complexity and the hostility of the establishment (the [[Autocracy|autocratic]], semi-[[feudalism|feudal]] state of [[Imperial Russia]]) required a close-knit group of individuals pulled from the working class vanguard to safeguard the revolutionary ideology within the particular circumstances presented by the Tsarist régime at the time. While Lenin wished for a revolutionary organization akin to the contemporary [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] of Germany, which was open to the public and more democratic in organization, the Russian autocracy prevented this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lenin's Electoral Strategy from Marx and Engels Through the Revolution of 1905: The Ballot, the Streets—or Both|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mh4CAwAAQBAJ|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|date = 2014-03-13|isbn = 9781137389961|first = August H.|last = Nimtz|page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leninists]] argue that Lenin's ideal vanguard party would be one where membership is completely open: "The members of the Party are they who accept the principles of the Party programme and render the Party all possible support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://marx.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/iv.htm#v05fl61h-440-GUESS, Vladimir Lenin, ''What is to be Done?'' ch.IV], quoting Clause 1 of the Rules of the German Social-Democratic Party&lt;/ref&gt; This party could, in theory, be completely transparent: the "entire political arena is as open to the public view as is a theater stage to the audience".&lt;ref&gt;[http://marx.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/iv.htm#v05fl61h-440-GUESS, Vladimir Lenin, ''What is to be Done?'' ch.IV]&lt;/ref&gt; A party that supposedly implemented democracy to such an extent that "the general control (in the literal sense of the term) exercised over every act of a party man in the political field brings into existence an automatically operating mechanism which produces what in biology is called the "survival of the fittest"". This party would be completely open to the public eye as it conducted its business which would mainly consist of educating the proletariat to remove the [[false consciousness]] that had been instilled in them.&lt;ref name="marx.org"&gt;[http://marx.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/iv.htm#v05fl61h-440-GUESS, Vladimir Lenin, ''What is to be Done?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first phase, the vanguard party would exist for two reasons. Firstly, it would protect Marxism from outside corruption from other ideas as well as advance its concepts. Secondly, it would educate the [[proletariat]] in Marxism in order to cleanse them of their "false individual consciousness" and instill the revolutionary "[[class consciousness]]" in them.
{{quote|Our task is not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur, but to ''raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries.''&lt;ref name="marx.org"/&gt;}}

If the party is successful in this goal, on the eve of revolution, a critical mass of the working class population would be prepared to usher forth the transformation of society. Furthermore, a great number of them, namely their most dedicated members, would belong to the party [[cadres]] as [[professional revolutionaries]] and would be elected to leadership positions by the mass party membership. Thus the organization would quickly include the entire working class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/iv.htm#v05fl61h-440-GUESS, Vladimir Lenin, ''What is to be Done?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the proletariat gained class consciousness and thus was prepared to revolt against the ruling classes, the vanguard party would serve another purpose. The party would coordinate the proletariat through its revolution by acting as a military command hub of sorts. This is, according to Leninists, a vital function as mass revolutions can sometimes be easily crushed by the disciplined military of the ruling classes. The vanguards would serve as commanders of the revolt, chosen to their positions by "democratic natural selection".{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In Lenin's view, after the revolution the working class would implement the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] to rule the new worker's state through the first phase of communism, socialism. Here it can be said that the vanguard disappears, as all of society now consists of revolutionaries.

==Political party==
A vanguard party is a [[political party]] at the fore of a mass-action political movement and of a [[revolution]]. In the praxis of political science, the concept of the vanguard party, composed of professional revolutionaries, was first effected by the [[Bolshevik Party]] in the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. [[Lenin]] (Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov), the first leader of the Bolsheviks, coined the term ''vanguard party'', and argued that such a party was necessary in order to provide the practical and political leadership that would impel the [[proletariat]] to achieve a [[communist revolution]]. Hence, as a political-science concept and term, ''vanguard party'' most often is associated with [[Leninism]]; however, similar concepts (under different names) also are present in other revolutionary [[ideology|ideologies]].

[[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]] presented the concept of the vanguard party as solely qualified to politically lead the proletariat in revolution; in Chapter II: "Proletarians and Communists" of ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), they said:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the purpose of the vanguard party is to establish a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]; supported by the [[working class]]. The change of ruling class, from the [[bourgeoisie]] to the proletariat, makes possible the full development of [[socialism]]. In early 20th century Russia, Lenin argued that the vanguard party would lead the revolution to [[Deposition (politics)|depose]] the incumbent [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] government, and transfer government power to the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Townson, D. ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789–1945'' London:1994 pp. 462–464&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet ''[[What is to be Done?]]'' (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, mostly recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign, because it was the only way that the proletariat could successfully achieve a revolution; unlike the economist campaign of trade union struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and later by the [[anarcho-syndicalists]]. Like Karl Marx, Lenin distinguished between the two aspects of a revolution, the '''economic campaign''' (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions), which featured diffused plural leadership; and the '''political campaign''' (socialist changes to society), which featured the decisive revolutionary leadership of the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik]] vanguard party.

===Marxism–Leninism===
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar |expanded=concepts}}
{{Main|Marxism–Leninism}}
As he surveyed the European milieu in the late 1890s, Lenin found several theoretic problems with the [[Marxism]] of the late 19th century. Contrary to what [[Karl Marx]] had predicted, [[capitalism]] had become stronger in the last third of the 19th century. In Western Europe, the [[working class]] had become poorer, rather than becoming politically [[Progressivism|progressive]], thinking people; hence, the workers and their [[trade union]]s, although they had continued to militate for better [[wages]] and working conditions, had failed to develop a revolutionary [[class consciousness]], as predicted by Marx. To explain that undeveloped political awareness, Lenin said that the [[division of labour]] in a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] capitalist society prevented the emergence of a [[Proletariat|proletarian]] class consciousness, because of the ten-to-twelve-hour workdays that the workers laboured in factories, and so had no time to learn and apply the philosophic complexities of [[Marxist theory]]. Finally, in trying to effect a revolution in [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[Imperial Russia]] (1721–1917), Lenin faced the problem of an [[Autocracy|autocratic]] régime that had outlawed almost all political activity. Although the Tsarist autocracy could not enforce a ban on political ideas, until 1905—when [[Nicholas II|Tsar Nicholas II]] (1894–1917) agreed to the formation of a national [[duma]]—the [[Okhrana]], the Tsarist [[secret police]], suppressed every political group seeking social and political changes, including those with a democratic program.

To counter such political conditions, Lenin said that a professional revolutionary organization was necessary to organize and lead the most class-conscious workers into a politically coherent movement. About the Russian [[class struggle]], in the book ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' (1902), against the "economist" trend of the [[socialism|socialist]] parties (who proposed that the working class would develop a revolutionary consciousness from demanding solely economic improvements), Lenin said that the "history of all countries bears out the fact that, through their own powers alone, the working class can develop only a [[trade-union]] consciousness"; and that under reformist, trade-union leadership, the working class could only engage spontaneous local rebellions to improve their political position within the capitalist system, and that revolutionary consciousness developed unevenly. Nonetheless, optimistic about the working class's ability to develop a revolutionary [[class consciousness]], Lenin said that the missing element for escalating the class struggle to revolution was a political organization that could relate to the [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] of political vanguard of the working class, who then would attract many workers from the middling policies of the reformist leaders of the trade unions.

It is often believed that Lenin thought the bearers of class consciousness were the common [[intellectual]]s who made it their vocation to conspire against the capitalist system, educate the public in revolutionary theory, and prepare the workers for the [[proletarian revolution]] and the dictatorship of the proletariat that would follow. Yet, unlike his [[Menshevik]] rivals, Lenin distinguished himself by his hostility towards the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[intelligentsia]], and was routinely criticized for placing too much trust in the [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] ability of the working class to transform society through its own political struggles.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Like other political organizations that sought to change Imperial Russian society, Lenin's [[Bolshevik Party]] resorted to conspiracy, and operated in the political underground. Against Tsarist repression, Lenin argued for the necessity of confining membership to people who were professionally trained to combat the Okhrana [[secret police]];{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} however, at its core, the Bolshevik Party was an exceptionally flexible organization who pragmatically adapted policy to changing political situations. After the [[Revolution of 1905]], Lenin proposed that the Bolshevik Party "open its gates" to the militant working class, who were rapidly becoming political radicals, in order for the Party to become a mass-action political party with genuine roots in the working class movement.

The notion of a 'vanguard', as used by Lenin before 1917, did not necessarily imply single-party rule. Lenin considered the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party|Social-Democrats]] (Bolsheviks) the leading elements of a multi-class (and multi-party) democratic struggle against Tsarism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul LeBlanc. ''Lenin and the Revolutionary Party''. Humanities Press International, 1990. p.49.&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the [[October Revolution]], the Bolsheviks (now renamed the Communist Party) operated in the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]], trade unions, and other working-class [[mass organizations]] in a milieu with other revolutionary parties, such as Mensheviks, [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Social-Revolutionaries]] and [[anarcho-communists]], and local soviets often elected non-Bolshevik majorities.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Serge. ''Year One of the Russian Revolution''. p.243.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Lenin considered the Bolsheviks the vanguard insofar as they were the most consistent defenders of Soviet power (which he considered the dictatorship of the proletariat or 'Commune-state').&lt;ref&gt;Paul LeBlanc. ''Lenin and the Revolutionary Party''. Humanities Press International, 1990. p.260.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this situation changed drastically during the [[Russian Civil War]] and economic collapse, which decimated the working class and its independent institutions, and saw the development of [[left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|irreconcilable conflicts]] between the Bolsheviks and their rivals. At the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] in 1921, the Party made the de facto reality de jure by outlawing opposition parties and formalizing single-Party rule.&lt;ref&gt;Paul LeBlanc. ''Lenin and the Revolutionary Party''. Humanities Press International, 1990. p.306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the concept of a vanguard party was used by the Bolsheviks to justify their suppression of other parties. They took the line that since they were the vanguard of the proletariat, their right to rule could not be legitimately questioned. Hence, opposition parties could not be permitted to exist. From 1936 onward, Communist-inspired state constitutions enshrined this concept by giving the Communist parties a "leading role" in society—a provision that was interpreted to either ban other parties altogether or force them to accept the Communists' guaranteed right to rule as a condition of being allowed to exist.

In the 20th century, the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) continued regarding itself as the institutionalization of Marxist–Leninist political consciousness in the Soviet Union; therein lay the justification for its political control of Soviet society. Article 6 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution refers to the CPSU as the "leading and guiding force of Soviet society, and the nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and public organizations". The CPSU, precisely because it was the bearer of Marxist–Leninist ideology, determined the general development of society, directed domestic and foreign policy, and "imparts a planned, systematic, and theoretically substantiated character" to the struggle of the Soviet people for the victory of [[communism]].

Nonetheless, the political role of the vanguard party, as outlined by Lenin, is disputed among  the contemporary [[communist]] [[social movements|movement]]. Lenin's contemporary in the Bolshevik Party, [[Leon Trotsky]], further developed and established the vanguard party with the creation of the [[Fourth International]]. Trotsky, who believed in [[permanent revolution]], proposed that a vanguard party must be an international political party who organized the most militant activists of the working classes of the countries of the world. Although the Fourth International faded from the public upon the death of Trotsky, there continued some efforts to revive the concept of an international vanguard party.

===Other uses===
Although Lenin honed the idea in terms of a class leadership forged out of a proletarian vanguard specifically to describe Marxist-Leninist parties,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Joseph, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c2ny4jEwoVcC&amp;pg=PA45 ''Hegemony: A Realist Analysis,''] Routledge 2002 p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; the term is also used for many kinds of movement conceiving themselves as initially guided by a small elite. [[Theodor Herzl]], the theorist of [[Zionism]], thought legitimation from the majority would only hinder from the outset his movement, and therefore advised that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'we cannot all be of one mind; the ''gestor'' will therefore simply take the leadership into his hands and march in the van.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This principle antedated by some years the Leninist idea of Bolshevism as the vanguard of the revolution by characterizing the 'Zionist movement as a vanguard of the Jewish people.'&lt;ref&gt;David Biale, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DL5U8V9ze3QC&amp;pg=PA136  ''Power &amp; Powerlessness in Jewish History,''] (1986) Random House 2010 p.136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hashomer Hatzair|The Youth Guard]] at the forefront of Zionist mobilization in the [[Yishuv]] likewise conceived of itself as a revolutionary vanguard,&lt;ref&gt;Sasson Sofer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=svvM3MxwtloC&amp;pg=PA160  ''Zionism and the Foundations of Israeli Diplomacy,''] 1998 pp.160-178, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[kibbutz]] movement itself is said to have thought of itself as a 'selfless vanguard'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua Muravchik]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=SkI4LN-1S0AC&amp;pg=PT263 ''Heaven On Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism,''] Encounter Books, 2013 p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; It is occasionally used with of certain [[Islamist]] parties. Writers [[Abul Ala Maududi]] and [[Sayyid Qutb]] both urged the formation of an Islamic vanguard to restore Islamic society. Qutb talked of an [[Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq#Islamic vanguard|Islamist vanguard]] in his book [[Ma'alim fi al-Tariq]] (''Milestones'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/304/fundamentalist-islam-at-large-the-drive-for-power Fundamentalist Islam at Large: The Drive for Power by Martin Kramer], Middle East Quarterly, June 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and Maududi formed the radical [[Islamist]] party [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]]&lt;ref name=globalsec&gt;GlobalSecurity.org: [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/ji.htm Jamaat-e-Islami]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pakistan]] whose goal was to establish a pan-[[Ummah]] worldwide Islamist ideological state starting from Pakistan, administered for God solely by Muslims "whose whole life is devoted to the observance and enforcement" of Islamic law ([[Shari'ah]]), leading to the world becoming the [[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam|House of Islam]]. The party members formed an elite group (called ''arkan'') with "affiliates" (''mutaffiq'') and then "sympathizers" (''hamdard'') beneath them.&lt;ref name="globalsec"/&gt; Today, the JI has spread wings to other South Asian countries with large Muslim populations, such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh and India.

Another elite or vanguard Islamist party is [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], which seeks to take power for a pan-Islamic state not by a vanguard-led armed struggle, but by a [[coup d'état]]. The party seeks to obtains "support from army generals, leaders, and other influential figures or bodies to facilitate the change of the government."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070126003916/http://www.risala.org/books/1.Hizb-ut-Tahrir-new.pdf (untitled HT pamphlet]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roger Eatwell, some [[Fascism|fascist parties]] have also operated in ways similar to the concept of a vanguard party.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell.

'''Waikuri''' (Guaycura, Waicura) is an extinct language of southern [[Baja California]] spoken by the Waikuri or [[Guaycura people]]. The Jesuit priest [[Johann Jakob Baegert|Baegert]] documented words, sentences and texts in the language between 1751 and 1768.

Waikuri may be, along with the [[Yukian languages|Yukian]] and [[Chumashan languages|Chumashan]] languages and other languages of southern Baja such as [[Pericú language|Pericú]], among the oldest languages established in California, before the arrival of speakers of [[Penutian]], [[Uto-Aztecan]], and perhaps even [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] languages. All are spoken in areas with long-established populations of a distinct physical type.&lt;ref&gt;Golla, Victor. (2011). ''California Indian Languages''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-5202-6667-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{distinguish|Guaicuruan languages}}
Baegert's data is analyzed by Raoul Zamponi (2004). On existing evidence, Guaycura appears to be unrelated to the [[Yuman languages]] to its north. Some linguists have suggested that it belonged to the widely scattered [[Hokan languages|Hokan]] phylum of California and Mexico (Gursky 1966; Swadesh 1967); however, the evidence for this seems inconclusive (Laylander 1997; Zamponi 2004; Mixco 2006). [[William Clifford Massey|William C. Massey]] (1949) suggested a connection with [[Pericú language|Pericú]], but the latter is too meagerly attested to support a meaningful comparison. Other languages of southern Baja are essentially undocumented, though people have speculated from non-linguistic sources that Monqui (Monquí-Didiú), spoken in a small region around Loreto, may have been a 'Guaicurian' language, as perhaps was Huchití (Uchití), though that may have actually been a variety of Guaycura itself (Golla 2007).

The internal classification of Gauicurian (Waikurian) languages is uncertain. Massey (1949), cited in Campbell (1997:169), gives this tentative classification based on similarity judgments given by colonial-era sources, rather than actual linguistic data.

;Gauicurian (Waikurian)
*Guaicura branch
**Gauocura (Waikuri)
**Callejue
*Huchiti branch
**Cora
**Huchiti
**Aripe
**Periúe
*Pericú branch
**Pericú
**Isleño

However, Laylander (1997) and Zamponi (2004) conclude that Waikuri and [[Pericú language|Pericú]] are unrelated.

==Phonology==
Phonology of the Waikuri language:&lt;ref&gt;Zamponi, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consonants ===
Consonants were voiceless stops ''p t č k'' and maybe glottal stop; voiced ''b d'', nasal ''m n ny'', flap ''r'', trill ''rr'', and approximants ''w y''.

=== Vowels ===
Waikuri had four vowels, /i, e, a, u/. Whether or not vowel length was [[phoneme|phonemic]] is unknown.

==Grammar==
The little we know of Guaycura grammar was provided by [[Francisco Pimentel]], who analyzed a few verbs and phrases. Guaicura was a polysyllabic language that involved a lot of compounding. For example, 'sky' is ''tekerakadatemba'', from ''tekaraka'' (arched) and ''datemba'' (earth). 

Beagert and Pimentel agree that the plural is formed with a suffix ''-ma''. However, Pimentel also notes a prefix ''k-'' with the 'same' function. For example, ''kanai'' 'women', from ''anai'' 'woman'. According to Pimentel, the negation in ''-ra'' of an adjective resulted in its opposite, so from ''ataka'' 'good' is derived ''atakara'' 'bad'. 

Pronouns were as follows (Golla 2011):

'''William (Bill) Barr''' (born 1940) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] historian now resident of Calgary, Canada, with a specific interest in the history of exploration of the [[Arctic]], and to a lesser degree, the [[Antarctic]]. He holds degrees in [[Geography]] from the [[University of Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] and [[McGill University]], [[Québec]], Canada. From 1968 until 1999 he was a member of the faculty of the Department of Geography, [[University of Saskatchewan]], [[Saskatoon]], Canada and is now a professor emeritus there.

Since 1999 he is a Research Fellow in residence at the [[Arctic Institute of North America]], [[University of Calgary]].

For the past 30 years the history of the exploration of the Arctic has been the focus of his research. He has published 16 books, including translations from French, German, and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0011/bts.html 	Saving White Death]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, William Barr received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the [[recorded history]] of the Canadian North from the [[Canadian Historical Association]].

Most of the titles of his works show that William Barr is an admirer of [[Russia]]n Arctic explorers. His contribution has been crucial to make known to the wider public the exploits of Polar explorations by Russia and the Soviet Union.

'''William''' "'''Bill'''" '''Cronon''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born September 11, 1954 in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]) is a noted [[environmental history|environmental historian]]&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4DB1239F930A35757C0A96F958260&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=%22william+Cronon%22&amp;st=nyt |author=Janny Scott|title=An Environmentalist on a Different Path; A Fresh View of the Supposed 'Wilderness' and Even the Indians' Place in It|date=April 3, 1999|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Frederick Jackson Turner and Vilas Research Professor of History, Geography, and Environmental Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He was president of the [[American Historical Association]] (AHA) in 2012.

==Education and recognition==
Born in Connecticut, Cronon earned his D.Phil. from [[Jesus College, Oxford]] while a [[Rhodes Scholar]] from 1976 to 1978.&lt;ref name=Jesus&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Jesus College Record|year=1993/4|title=Old Members News and Notes|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a B.A. (1976) from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and an M.A. (1979), M.Phil. (1980), and PhD (1990) from [[Yale University]].

In July 1985 Cronon was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Cronon serves on the board of directors for [[The Trust for Public Land]], a national land conservation group. He has been a member of the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] since 1995, and as of 2014 he served as vice chair of the organization's governing council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council Leadership|url=http://wilderness.org/article/council-leadership|website=The Wilderness Society|publisher=The Wilderness Society|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
Cronon is best known for his first book ''[[Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists, and the Ecology of New England]]'' (1983), based on a seminar paper he wrote for his Yale adviser [[Edmund Morgan (historian)|Edmund Sears Morgan]]. He proposed that the way cultures conceptualize property and ownership is a major factor in economies and ecosystems. Secondly, unlike most historians, he documented that Native Americans actively intervened in and shaped the ecosystems in which they lived.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

His book ''Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West'' (1991) "is credited with having radically widened many environmental historians' gaze beyond such things as forests and public lands to include cities and what Cronon calls the 'elaborate and intimate linkages' between city and country."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Cronon says that Chicago and capitalism fundamentally transformed the open Midwestern countryside. In one chapter, he details how grain became a standardized commodity. At first farmers sold it in sacks with the farm's family name stamped on it; as a commodity, it was sold in bulk as a standardized good stored in silos according to grade. The book won the 1992 [[Bancroft Prize]] and was a finalist for the 1992 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]].
 
In his book ''Uncommon Ground: Toward Reinventing Nature'' (1995), and his essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: Or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature", published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 13, 1995), Cronon traced the idea of wilderness throughout American history. He claimed that the idea of untouched, pristine wilderness is a fantasy, because all of nature is interconnected. He concludes:

{{Quote|text=Learning to honor the wild — learning to remember and acknowledge the autonomy of the other — means striving for critical self-consciousness in all of our actions. It means the deep reflection and respect must accompany each act of use, and means too that we must always consider the possibility of non-use. It means looking at the part of nature we intend to turn toward our own ends and asking whether we can use it again and again and again — sustainably — without its being diminished in the process. It means never imagining that we can flee into a mythical wilderness to escape history and the obligation to take responsibility for our own actions that history inescapably entails. Most of all, it means practicing remembrance and gratitude, for thanksgiving is the simplest and most basic of ways for us to recollect the nature, the culture, and the history that have come together to make the world as we know it. If wildness can stop being (just) out there and start being (also) in here, if it can start being as humane as it is natural, then perhaps we can get on with the unending task of struggling to live rightly in the world — not just in the garden, not just in the wilderness, but in the home that encompasses them both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3985059| issn = 1084-5453| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 7| last = Cronon| first = William| title = The Trouble with Wilderness: Or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature| journal = Environmental History| accessdate = 2017-08-02| date = January 1996| url = https://academic.oup.com/envhis/article-lookup/doi/10.2307/3985059}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Cronon was also featured in [[Ken Burns]]'s 2009 documentary ''[[The National Parks: America's Best Idea]]''.

=='Scholar as Citizen' blog==
During the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] over the state budget, Cronon started a blog called "Scholar as Citizen." His first blog post, on March 15, 2011, was about the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), an organization that provides model legislation to Republican and Democratic state legislators. According to [[Anthony Grafton]] of ''The New Yorker'', "Cronon argued from indirect evidence that ALEC had played a major role behind the scenes in Governor Walker's attack on public employee unions in Wisconsin.  He also argued that this sort of political work, though legitimate, should be done in the open."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grafton|first=Anthony|title=Wisconsin: The Cronon Affair|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/03/wisconsin-the-cronon-affair.html|work=[[The New Yorker|The New Yorker, News Desk]]|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, [[Stephan Thompson]] of the [[Wisconsin Republican Party]] filed a [[freedom of information legislation|freedom of information]] request for email sent from or to Cronon's University of Wisconsin-Madison account that contained keywords related to the ongoing political events, including "Republican", "[[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]", "recall", "collective bargaining", "AFSCME", "WEAC", "rally", "union", and the names of 12 Republican senators who supported [[2011 Wisconsin Act 10|Walker's bill]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner|first=John|title=William Cronon and academic freedom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/01/wisconsin-republicans|work=The Guardian|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cronon also wrote an [[op-ed]] criticizing Walker for ''[[The New York Times]]'', published on March 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;Leonard, Andrew (March 25, 2011) [http://www.salon.com/news/wisconsin/index.html?story=/tech/htww/2011/03/25/wisconsins_most_dangerous_professor Wisconsin's most dangerous professor], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, Cronon wrote a second blog entry announcing the Wisconsin Republican Party's [[freedom of information legislation|freedom of information]] request for his emails, saying that the party's action had "the nakedly political purpose of trying to embarrass, harass, or silence a university professor".&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shafer|first=Jack|title=There's No Such Thing as a Bad FOIA Request|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2289482/|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=March 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Citing Wisconsin's long history of protecting the right to academic freedom, Cronon asked the Republican Party of Wisconsin to withdraw its request.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The party did not withdraw the request and on April 1 the university turned over a selection of Cronon's emails. Attorney John Dowling, acting as senior legal counsel for the University of Wisconsin-Madison, included a statement with the documents that explained the university's decision to continue to withhold some of Cronon's emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grafton|first=Anthony|title=The Cronon Affair: Wisconsin Answers|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/04/the-cronon-affair-wisconsin-answers.html|work=[[The New Yorker|The New Yorker, News Desk]]|date=April 3, 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor [[Carolyn Martin|Carolyn "Biddy" Martin]] expounded upon this decision in an email to the UW-Madison campus community on the same day: 
{{quote|We are excluding students because they are protected under [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act|FERPA]]. We are excluding exchanges that fall outside the realm of the faculty member's job responsibilities and that could be considered personal pursuant to [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] case law. We are also excluding what we consider to be the private email exchanges among scholars that fall within the orbit of academic freedom and all that is entailed by it.}} 

Martin discussed the idea of [[academic freedom]] and the university's firm commitment to protecting all academics' right to engage in the "open intellectual exchange" of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Carolyn 'Biddy'|title=Chancellor's message on academic freedom and open records|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/19190|work=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison, News]]|date=1 April 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these events, on April 4 the Faculty Senate of the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] passed a resolution to protect academic freedom. The body decided, according to University Committee Chair Judith Burstyn, that the university needed to take a public position to defend academic freedom in the wake of the FOIA records request directed at Cronon. Political scientist Howard Schweber, who was involved in writing the resolution with colleague Donald Downs, commented: "The university can't change the law, but the university can take a leading position on behalf of public employees everywhere and make a statement that we think this is wrong. What was begun as a classic notion of sunshine being the best disinfectant has turned into a law that's used as a weapon to target not government officials and offices but individual public employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forster|first=Stacy|title=Faculty Senate approves resolution protecting academic freedom|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/19210|work=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison, News]]|date=April 5, 2011|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wisconsin Republican Party]] had made no report on the contents of Cronon's emails as of August 5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisgop.org/news|title=WISGOP.ORG News|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party also filed other open records requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCallum|first=Katie|title=Shelly Moore Caught Campaigning on Taxpayer Dime, RPW Requests Investigation|url=http://www.wisgop.org/news/shelly-moore-caught-campaigning-taxpayer-dime-rpw-requests-investigation|work=WISGOP.ORG News|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin GOP Files Open Records Request on Campaigning UW Oshkosh Prof|url=http://www.wisgop.org/news/wisconsin-gop-files-open-records-request-campaigning-uw-oshkosh-prof|work=WISGOP.ORG NEWS|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association of University Professors]] (quoting Cronon) said that "this action by the Wisconsin Republican Party is an 'obvious assault on academic freedom'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obvious Assault on Academic Freedom|url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/newsroom/2011+Web+Highlights/Madison.htm|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

The '''woman's film''' is a [[film genre]] which includes women-centered narratives, female protagonists and is designed to appeal to a female audience. Woman's films usually portray "women's concerns" such as problems revolving around domestic life, the family, motherhood, self-sacrifice, and [[Romance (love)|romance]].{{sfn|Doane|1987|pp=152&amp;ndash;53}} These films were produced from the [[Silent film|silent era]] through the 1950s and early 1960s, but were most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, reaching their zenith during [[World War II]]. Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films characterized by some of the elements of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s. The work of directors [[George Cukor]], [[Douglas Sirk]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Josef von Sternberg]] has been associated with the woman's film genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor1-first = Angela | editor1-last = Howard | editor2-first = Frances M. | editor2-last = Kevenik | title = Handbook of American Women's History | url = | publisher =  Garland | location = New York | year = 1990 | chapter = | chapterurl = | isbn = 978-0-8240-8744-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] were some of the genre's most prolific [[movie star|stars]].{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}}

The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]]'s silent films. [[Film historian]]s and critics defined the genre and canon in retrospect. Before the woman's film became an established genre in the 1980s, many of the classic woman's films were referred to as [[Melodrama#Film|melodrama]]s.

Woman's films are films that were made ''for'' women by predominantly male screenwriters and directors whereas [[women's cinema]] encompasses films that have been made ''by'' women.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=153}}

==Definition==

When the woman's film was still at a nascent stage, it was not regarded as a fully independent genre.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=29}} [[Mary Ann Doane]], for example, argued that the woman's film is not a "pure genre" because it is crossed and informed by a number of other genres such as melodrama, [[film noir]], the gothic, and [[horror film]].&lt;ref&gt;Doane cited in Altman 1998, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, film scholar Scott Simmon argues that the woman's film has remained "elusive" to the point of having its very existence questioned. This elusiveness, he argues, is partially due to the fact that the woman's film is an oppositional genre which can only be defined in opposition to male-centered genres like the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and [[Mob film|gangster film]].{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=68}} It has also been noted that it is a critically rather than industrially constructed genre, having been defined in retrospect rather than at the time of the films' production.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=28}} The woman's film was seen as closely related to and even synonymous with melodrama.&lt;ref name="modleski"&gt;Modleski, Tania (1984). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1225094 "Time and Desire in the Woman's Film"]. ''[[Cinema Journal]]'' '''23''' (3): 19&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms commonly used to describe the woman's film were "drama", "romance", "love story", "comedy drama", and "soap opera".&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Stephen (1993). "Melo Talk: On the Meaning and Use of the Term 'Melodrama' in the American Trade Press". ''[[Velvet Light Trap|The Velvet Light Trap]]'' '''32''' (3): 66&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, the woman's film has been an established film genre.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=32}} Film scholar Justine Ashby, however, has observed a trend in [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] that she calls "generic eclipse" whereby films that adhere to all the fundamental tenets of the woman's film are subsumed under other genres. ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943) and ''[[Two Thousand Women]]'' (1944), for example, have been described and promoted as war films rather than woman's films.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=155}}

The woman's film differs from other film genres in that it is primarily addressed to women.{{sfn|Doane|1987|p=3}} Cinema historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] argues that the first of three purposes of the woman's film is "to place a woman at the center of the story universe".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} In most other and particularly men-oriented film genres the opposite is the case as women and their concerns have been assigned minor roles. [[Molly Haskell]] explains that "if a woman hogs this universe unrelentingly, it is perhaps her compensation for all the male-dominated universes from which she has been excluded: the gangster film, the western, the war film, the policier, the rodeo film, the [[adventure film]]".{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=155}} The second purpose of the woman's film, according to Basinger, is "to reaffirm in the end the concept that a woman's true job is that of being a woman". A romantic ideal of [[love]] is presented as the only "career" that will guarantee happiness and that women should aspire to.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} The third purpose of the genre, as suggested by Basinger, is "to provide a temporary visual liberation of some sort, however small – an escape into a purely romantic love, into sexual awareness, into luxury, or into the rejection of the female role".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} Basinger argues that the major – if not only – action of the woman's film and its biggest source of drama and tragedy is the necessity to make a choice.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=19}} The heroine will have to decide between two or more paths that are equally appealing but mutually exclusive as, for example, romantic love and a fulfilling job. One path will be right and consistent with the film's overall morality and the other path will be wrong but it will provide liberation. As the films' heroines were punished for following the wrong path and ultimately reconciled to their roles as women, wives, and mothers, Basinger argues that woman's films "cleverly contradict themselves" and "easily reaffirm the status quo for the woman's life while providing little releases, small victories or even big releases, big victories".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=10}}

==Identifying characteristics==
Unlike male-centered movies which are frequently shot outdoors, most woman's films are set in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]],{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=24}} which defines the lives and roles of the female protagonist.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=181}} Whereas the events in woman's films &amp;ndash; weddings, proms, births &amp;ndash; are [[socialization|socially]] defined by nature and society, the action in male films &amp;ndash; chasing criminals, participating in a fight &amp;ndash; is story-driven.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=9}}

The themes in woman's and male-oriented films are often diametrically opposed: fear of separation from loved ones, emphasis on emotions, and human attachment in women's films, as opposed to fear of intimacy, repressed emotionality, and individuality in male-oriented movies.{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=24}} The plot conventions of woman's films revolve around several basic themes: love triangles, unwed motherhood, illicit affairs, the rise to power, and mother-daughter relationships.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|pp=163, 166}} The narrative pattern depends on the activity engaged in by the heroine and commonly includes sacrifice, affliction, choice, and competition.{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=157}} The maternal melodrama, the career woman comedy, and the paranoid woman's film, a subgenre based on suspicion and distrust, are the most frequent subgenres.{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=125}} Female madness, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[hysteria]], and [[amnesia]] were frequent plot elements in Hollywood's woman's films of the 1940s. This trend took place when Hollywood tried to incorporate aspects of [[psychoanalysis]]. In the medical discourse in films like ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948), mental health is visually represented by beauty and mental illness by an unkept appearance; health was restored if the female protagonist improved her appearance.{{sfn|Doane|1986|pp=153, 155}} [[Friendship]] among women was fairly common,{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=45}} although the treatment was superficial and focused more on women's dedication to men and female-male relationships than on their friendships with each other.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|pp=36&amp;ndash;40}}

[[File:Annex - Stanwyck, Barbara (Stella Dallas) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|In [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937), Barbara Stanwyck plays a [[Working class|working-class]] mother who sacrifices her connection to her daughter in order to help her become part of an [[Upper class|upper-class]] world.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=46}}]]
The woman's films that were produced in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] have a strong thematic focus on [[Social class|class]] issues and questions of economic survival whereas the 1940s woman's film places its protagonists in a middle- or upper-middle-class world and is more concerned with the characters' emotional, sexual, and psychological experiences.{{sfn|McKee|2014|pp=24&amp;ndash;25}}

The female protagonist is portrayed as either good or bad.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=164}} Haskell distinguishes three types of women that are particularly common to woman's films: the extraordinary, ordinary and the "ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary". The extraordinary women are characters like [[Scarlett O'Hara]] and [[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]] who are played by equally extraordinary actresses like [[Vivien Leigh]] and Bette Davis. They are independent and emancipated "aristocrats of their sex" who transcend the limitations of their sexual identities. The ordinary women, in contrast, are bound by the rules of their respective societies because their range of options is too limited to break free of their limitations. The ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary is a character who "begins as a victim of discriminatory circumstances and rises, through pain, obsession, or defiance, to become mistress of her fate."{{sfn|Haskell|1987|pp=160&amp;ndash;61}} Depending on the type of heroine a film champions, a film can be either socially conservative or progressive.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|p=28}} Certain archetypal characters appear in many woman's films: unreliable husbands, the other man, a female competitor, the reliable friend, usually an older woman, and the sexless male, frequently depicted as an older man who offers the protagonist security and luxury but makes no sexual demands on her.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|pp=165&amp;ndash;66}}

A common motif in Hollywood's woman's films is that of the [[doppelgänger]] sisters (often played by the same actress), one good and one bad who vie for one man as [[Bette Davis]] in her double role in ''[[A Stolen Life (1946 film)|A Stolen Life]]'' (1946) and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in ''[[The Dark Mirror (film)|The Dark Mirror]]'' (1946).{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=78}} The good woman is portrayed as passive, sweet, emotional, and asexual whereas the bad woman is assertive, intelligent, and erotic. The conflict between them is resolved with the defeat of the bad woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Lucy (1983). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1225070 "Two-Faced Women: The 'Double' in Women's Melodrama of the 1940s"]. ''Cinema Journal'' '''23''' (1): 24&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; A central element of the 1980s British woman's film is the motif of escape. Woman's films allow their respective female protagonists to escape their everyday lives and their socially and sexually prescribed roles. The escape can take the form of a journey to another place such as the [[USSR]] in ''[[Letter to Brezhnev]]'' (1985) and [[Greece]] in ''[[Shirley Valentine (film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989) or education as in ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983) and sexual initiation as in ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 film)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1987).{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=155}}

==History==
The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]], whose one- and two-reelers ''[[A Flash of Light]]'' (1910) and ''[[Her Awakening]]'' (1911) feature the trademark narratives of repression and resistance that would later define a majority of women's films.{{sfn|Simmon|1993|pp=68&amp;ndash;69, 71}} Other predecessors of the genre include women-centered [[serial film]]s such as ''[[The Exploits of Elaine]]'' (1914) and ''[[Ruth of the Rockies]]'' (1920).{{sfn|Hollinger|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TA8iYChqyb0C&amp;pg=PA36 36]}}

The woman's film genre was particularly popular in 1930s and 1940s, reaching its zenith during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="russel"&gt;Russel, Catherine (1994). [http://www.filmstudies.ca/journal/pdf/cj-film-studies32_Russell_mourning.pdf "Mourning the Woman's Film: The Dislocated Spectator in ''The Company of Stranger''"]. ''Canadian Journal of Film Studies'' '''3''' (2): 25&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The film industry of that time had an economic interest in producing such films as women were believed to comprise a majority of movie-goers. In line with this perception, many woman's films were prestigious productions which attracted some of the best stars and directors.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=45}} Some film scholars suggest that the genre as a whole was well-regarded within the film industry,{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=193}} while others argue that the genre and term "woman's film" had derogatory connotations and was used by critics to dismiss certain films.{{sfn|Haskell|1987|pp=154&amp;ndash;55}} 

Production of women's films dropped off in the 1950s as melodrama became more male-centered and as [[soap opera]]s began to appear on television.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt; Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films marked by some of the features and concerns of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=184}}

The genre was revived in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor-first = Lucy | editor-last = Fischer | title = Imitation of Life: Douglas Sirk, Director | url = | publisher =  [[Rutgers University Press]] | location = [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] | year = 1991 | chapter = 'What's the matter with Sarah Jane?': Daughters and Mothers in Douglas Sirk's ''Imitation of Life'' | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHbph9wFJsC&amp;pg=PA302 | isbn = 978-0-8135-1644-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to create modern versions of the classic woman's film, updated to take account of new social norms, include [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' (1978) by [[Paul Mazursky]], [[Garry Marshall]]'s ''[[Beaches (film)|Beaches]]'' (1988), and ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes]]'' (1991) by [[Jon Avnet]]. Similarly, the 2002 films ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'' and ''[[Far from Heaven]]'' took their cues from the classic woman's film.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=49}} Elements of the woman's film have reemerged in the modern [[horror film]] genre. Films such as [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976) and [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) subvert traditional representations of femininity and refuse to follow the traditional marriage plot. The female protagonists in these movies are driven by something other than romantic love.{{sfn|Greven|2011|pp=91&amp;ndash;140}}

Within [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]], [[David Leland]] returned to the formula of the 1980s woman's film in ''[[The Land Girls (film)|The Land Girls]]'' (1998). The film tells the story of three young women during World War II and offers its heroines the opportunity to escape their old lives. ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002) emphasizes the key generic theme of female friendship and casts the heroine in a conflict between the restrictions of her traditional [[Sikh]] upbringing and her aspirations to become a [[Association football|football player]]. [[Lynne Ramsay]]'s ''[[Morvern Callar (film)|Morvern Callar]]'' is based on the woman's film tradition; a young woman escapes to Spain and pretends to be the author of her boyfriend's novel. While Morvern's journeys and transformations allow for liberation, she ends up where she started.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|pp=162, 163&amp;ndash;65, 166&amp;ndash;68}}

==Response==
Jeanine Basinger notes that woman's films were often criticized for reinforcing conventional values, above all, the notion that women could only find happiness in love, marriage and motherhood. However, she argues that they were "subtly subversive". They implied that a woman could not combine a career and a happy family life, but they also offered women a glimpse of a world outside the home, where they did not sacrifice their independence for marriage, housekeeping, and childrearing. The pictures depicted women with successful careers as journalists, pilots, car company presidents, and restaurateurs.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}} Similarly, Simmon notes that the genre offered a mixture of repression and liberation, in which repressive narratives are regularly challenged, partly via [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]] and acting but also by conflicts within the narratives themselves. He further states that such resistances were present in some of the earliest woman's films and became the rule with [[Douglas Sirk]]'s postwar American woman's films.{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=71}} Others have argued, however, that the narratives of these films offer only the repressive perspective and that viewers must read the texts "against the grain" to be able to find a liberating message.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|p=35}} Critics such as Haskell have criticized the term "woman's film" itself. She writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;What more damning comment on the relations between men and women in America than the very notion of something called the 'woman's film'? ... A film that focuses on male relationships is not pejoratively dubbed a 'man's film' ..., but a 'psychological drama.'"{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some woman's film have been met with critical acclaim. Woman's films that were selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" include ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1934), ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' (1941), ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942),&lt;ref&gt;LaPlace, Maria.
