The [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]] was embroiled in a conflict that lasted more than seven months and resulted in at least seventeen deaths&lt;ref name = denham&gt;{{cite book|title = Teaching Rebellion: Stories from the Grassroots Mobilization in Oaxaca|editor = Diana Denham and the C.A.S.A. Collective}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|195}} and the occupation of the capital city of [[Oaxaca City|Oaxaca]] by the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO). The conflict emerged in May 2006 with the police responding to a strike involving the local teachers' trade union by opening fire on non-violent protests.  It has since grown into a broad-based movement pitting the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO) against the state's governor, [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]]. Protesters demand the removal or resignation of Ortiz, whom they accuse of political corruption and acts of repression.  Multiple reports, including from international human rights monitors, have accused the [[Mexican government]] of using [[death squad]]s, [[summary execution]]s, and even violating [[Geneva Conventions]] standards that prohibit attacking and shooting at unarmed medics attending to the wounded.&lt;ref name = denham/&gt;{{rp|197}}
One human rights observer has claimed over twenty-seven killed by the police violence.  The dead include [[Brad Will]], [[Emilio Alonso Fabián]], [[José Alberto López Bernal]], [[Fidel Sánchez García]], and [[Esteban Zurita López]].&lt;ref name = denham/&gt;{{rp|280}}

== Organisation ==
After the police fired on non-violent protesters, the teacher's union fought back and were able to force the police out of the city and establish a city-wide [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[List of anarchist communities|community]] for several months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher's union and other worker's and community groups form the APPO which created large [[Participatory democracy|democratic assemblies]] for citizens.

According to one activist who helped to found the APPO:&lt;blockquote&gt;So the APPO was formed to address the abuses and create an alternative. It was to be a space for discussion, reflection, analysis, and action. We recognized that it shouldn’t be just one organization, but rather a blanket coordinating body for many different groups. That is, not one ideology would prevail; we would focus on finding the common ground among diverse social actors. Students, teachers, anarchists, [[Marxism|Marxists]], churchgoers — everyone was invited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The APPO was born without a formal structure, but soon developed impressive organizational capacity. Decisions in the APPO are made by consensus within the general assembly, which was privileged as a decision-making body. In the first few weeks of our existence we created the APPO State Council. The council was originally composed of 260 people — approximately ten representatives from each of Oaxaca’s seven regions and representatives from Oaxaca’s urban neighborhoods and municipalities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Provisional Coordination was created to facilitate the operation of the APPO through different commissions. A variety of commissions were established: judicial, finance, communications, human rights, gender equity, defense of natural resources, and many more. Proposals are generated in smaller assemblies of each sector of the APPO and then brought to the general assembly where they are debated further or ratified.&lt;ref name="denham" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;There was deep tension in the group between the more radical and [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] elements who rejected representative democracy and wanted to create a permanent self-organised society against the more [[Conservatism|conservative]] and moderate elements who wanted elections. Ultimately, the radicals were more successful and the elections were boycotted by most of the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The APPO was also able to organise festivals, defensive measures, radio stations and a neighbourhood watch. The festivals, the 'Guelaguetza' thousands of people attended for free to see indigenous culture, dresses and dancing whilst graffiti artists packed the streets and covered the walls of the towns in anti-government and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] messages. The APPO also used 'topiles' as a method of keeping the peace. These were [[Neighbourhood Watched|neighbourhood watches]] that also doubled as a [[militia]] which fought off government soldiers often with little more than rocks and fireworks. If a criminal was found to be disturbing someone, a bell would be used to alert the nearest topile, who would either give them a minor fine or perhaps hold them for the night. The topiles were successful in organising first aid centres and garbage collection.&lt;ref name="denham" /&gt;

==May and June 2006==
In May 2006, a teachers' strike began in the [[Zócalo]] in the Mexican city of Oaxaca.  2006 was the 25th consecutive year that Oaxaca's teachers had struck. Previously, the protests had generally lasted for one to two weeks and had resulted in small raises for teachers.  The 2006 strike began in protest of the low funding for teachers and rural schools in the state, but was prompted to additionally call for the resignation of the state governor [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]] after 3000 police were sent to break up the occupation in the early morning of June 14, 2006.  A street battle lasted for several hours that day, resulting in more than one hundred hospitalizations but no fatalities.  Ortiz declared that he would not resign. [[Image:Oaxaca protests.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Protests in Oaxaca City centre on June 22, 2006.]] 
In response to the events of June 14, representatives of Oaxaca's state regions and municipalities, unions, non-governmental organizations, social organizations, cooperatives, and parents convened to form the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO, from its Spanish name, ''Asamblea Popular de los Pueblos de Oaxaca''). On June 17 APPO reestablished encampments in the zocalo and declared itself to be the governing body of Oaxaca, plunging the city into a state of civil rebellion. Barricades were constructed across some streets in an effort to prevent further police raids.  APPO began to seek country-wide solidarity with their movement and urged other states within Mexico to similarly organize popular assemblies at every level of social organization: neighborhoods, street blocks, unions, and towns. Various municipality offices across the state closed in unity.  A popular mantra was, “No leader is going to solve our problems”.

[[Image:APPO Guelaguetza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Popular [[Guelaguetza]] organized by protesters.]]
Though APPO did not boycott the Mexican [[Mexican general election, 2006|national elections]] on July 2, Ulises Ruiz's [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) suffered electoral defeat in Oaxaca, a state they have ruled for seventy years.

APPO did agree to boycott the annual [[Guelaguetza]] festival in the final weeks of July. Protesters blocked access to the auditorium in which the festival is held using burned buses and miscellaneous trash, thus preventing the finalization of renovations to the facility. This action drew criticism due to the damage that some individuals did to the auditorium by starting fires and spray painting graffiti. Some of the graffiti said: "Tourists, go home! In Oaxaca we are not capitalists". As a result of the boycott, the government cancelled the celebration of the festival – in its stead the APPO held an alternative version of the cultural festival over the course of several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=5&amp;id_art=45402&amp;id_ejemplar=1186 |title=Crónica de la Guelaguetza Popular |newspaper=Noticias |language=Spanish |date=27 July 2006 |access-date=14 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021446/http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=5&amp;id_art=45402&amp;id_ejemplar=1186 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action marked the lowest point of government for Ulises Ruiz, who subsequently left the State. He resided in Mexico City for a few months.

After a few weeks of absence, the APPO assumed control of the city and started implementing their own law, while confrontations with State Police escalated.

==August 2006==
August 1 saw the beginning of APPO's break in of television and radio stations throughout the city. While all of these stations are no longer occupied by APPO members, the use of radio has been an important facet of the movement. APPO utilized the radio resources in order to communicate about possible threats from police and armed gangs, demand the removal of Ulises Ruiz and the release of political prisoners. During APPO's illegal occupation of the radio stations, pro-PRI and PRI-funded groups engaged in frequent late-night armed attacks on APPO-controlled radio stations and damaged their broadcasting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=15&amp;id_art=45723&amp;id_ejemplar= |title=Porros infiltrados sabotean transmisor de Radio Universidad |newspaper=Noticias |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2006 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020502/http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=15&amp;id_art=45723&amp;id_ejemplar= |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those attacks on the APPO-controlled radio stations represented an escalation of violence in a conflict that (despite constant rumors of threats) had remained relatively peaceful since the June 14 police raid. In what was called a "cleanup operation", armed groups of men attacked the APPO's barricades during the nights. The individuals involved were identified as members of pro-PRI organizations and as plain-clothes local police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/08/23/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=049n1soc|title = En ''operativo'' de limpieza, policías de Oaxaca siembran el terror entre civiles|newspaper = La Jornada|date = 23 August 2006|access-date = 15 November 2006|language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks, combined with other shootings and assassinations, resulted in the first deaths associated with the conflict, in which six APPO supporters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/11/02/048o1soc.php |title=Para los muertos de Oaxaca |newspaper=La Jornada |date=2 November 2006 |accessdate=15 November 2006 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113144701/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/11/02/048o1soc.php |archivedate=January 13, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/08/09/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=047n1soc|title = Ejecutan'' a catedrático de la Universidad de Oaxaca|newspaper = La Jornada|language = Spanish|date = 9 August 2006|accessdate = 15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==September 2006==
On September 14, striking teachers and APPO members took over the municipal building in [[Huautla de Jiménez]], located in the Sierra Mazateca in northern Oaxaca. They retained control of the building until mid-January 2007 (months after the government regained control of Oaxaca City), when Oaxacan state police briefly occupied the city, patrolling the streets with large guns and guarding the ''municipio'' all hours of the day and night. 

The leader of Mazatecan APPO, Agustín Sosa, was elected mayor (''presidente'') of [[Huautla de Jiménez]] in November 2007, to a term beginning in January, 2008. Sosa is a longtime activist who spent many months in jail in 2004, accused of murder in the death of a protester (at the hands of the police) at a protest organized by Sosa. He bears no relation to [[Flavio Sosa]], the still imprisoned leader of APPO.

==October 2006==
[[Image:Ejército en Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Mexican Armed Forces]] assemble near the airport in Oaxaca.]]
On October 27, 2006, [[Bradley Roland Will]], a U.S. [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]] journalist from New York who had entered the country under a tourist [[visa (document)|visa]], was killed along with Professor Emilio Alonso Fabián and Esteban López Zurita, in what the [[Associated Press]] has claimed was a "shootout" between protesters and a group of armed men. Photographs by Brad Will, however, demonstrate that the protesters were throwing rocks at the gunman.&lt;ref name=denham/&gt;{{rp|161}} Photographs of Will, after he was shot, show a man lying on the ground, surrounded by friends, and not the "armed gangs" that the Associated Press has reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2006/11/day_of_the_dead.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110717123641/http://www.worldproutassembly.org/archives/2006/11/day_of_the_dead.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |title=Day of the Dead in Oaxaca |publisher=World Prout Assembly |date=November 4, 2006 |accessdate=March 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An autopsy by the Mexican government has concluded that "two shots" were fired at Will, one from in front and one from behind (which, the government alleges, was fired by a protester).  The body was never examined for blood clotting in the second wound, which would have demonstrated that it was "implemented" in the morgue. Brad Will's body was cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=AltWeeklies |url=http://www.altweeklies.com/news/who_killed_brad_will_/Story?oid=191245 |access-date=July 10, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5iTL90l2T?url=http://www.altweeklies.com/news/who_killed_brad_will_/Story?oid=191245 |archive-date=July 23, 2009 |title=Who Killed Brad Will? |first=John |last=Ross |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family of Brad Will visited Mexico to demand justice from the court system, and upon hearing the accusation that their son was shot at close range by a protester, they called it "ridiculous, false, without substance, biased, and unconvincing."&lt;ref name=denham/&gt;{{rp|283}} They also accused the District Attorney of falsifying evidence and acting in bad faith.

However, protesters claim the shooting was by a group of armed men against unarmed protesters. Oswaldo Ramírez, a photographer for Mexico City daily ''[[Milenio]]'', was also shot in the foot. [[Lizbeth Cana]], attorney general of Oaxaca, claims the shooting of the protesters was provoked by the protesters themselves and that the armed men who engaged them were upset residents from the area. The U.S. ambassador to Mexico, [[Tony Garza]], however, claims the men may have been local police. ''[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]'' has identified some of the men as local officials. Protesters also allege that the men were police and not local residents. Indymedia claims from a first-hand witness that the man who shot Will was an "urban paramilitary" member of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref name="indymedia_bradwill_global"&gt;{{cite news | title= NYC Indymedia volunteer Brad Will killed in attack by Paramilitaries in Oaxaca| date= October 28, 2006 | publisher= [[Indymedia]] | url= http://www.indymedia.org/en/2006/10/849305.shtml|accessdate=October 28, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061031200122/http://www.indymedia.org/en/2006/10/849305.shtml| archivedate=October 31, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local news organisation, Centro de Medios Libres, claims that from Will's recovered videotapes,&lt;ref name="imc_nyc_bradwill_press"&gt;{{cite news|title=Official Press Release on Brad Will Murder From Ad-Hoc Media Group |date=October 28, 2006 |publisher=[[Indymedia]] New York City |url=http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2006/10/77806.html |accessdate=October 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104135800/http://nyc.indymedia.org/en/2006/10/77806.html |archivedate=November 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; they have found that [[Pedro Carmona (Oaxaca)|Pedro Carmona]], a paramilitary who was the mayor of [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Oaxaca|Felipe Carrillo Puerto]] in [[Municipalities of Oaxaca|Santa Lucía del Camino]], was the person who shot Bradley Roland Will.&lt;ref name="vientos_bradwill"&gt;{{cite news|title=27 de octubre: Ataque a la poblacion Oaxaquena: Minuto a minuto |date=October 28, 2006 |publisher=vientos.info |url=http://vientos.info/cml/?q=node/5821 |accessdate=October 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721064820/http://vientos.info/cml/?q=node%2F5821 |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another shooting took place later in the day outside the state prosecutor's office, leading to three injuries.

An Associated Press report by Rebeca Romero (December 11, 2006, 12:33&amp;nbsp;am (ET)) claims, "Most of the nine victims of the Oaxaca violence have been protesters who were shot by armed gangs..."  One protester, in response to the massive denunciations of the state-controlled media, has said, "I saw a young boy shot in the leg, friends around me arrested left and right, bullets flying everywhere.  The government needed someone to blame, and it came down heaviest on the people at the barricades, especially strategic barricades like Cinco Senores.  They called us vandals and thieves and delinquents."&lt;ref name=denham/&gt;{{rp|204}}

The death of Bradley Roland Will prompted [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Vicente Fox]] to send [[Federal Preventative Police|federal police]] to Oaxaca&lt;ref name="yahoo_bradwill"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061028/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/mexico_oaxaca_unrest |title=Mexican president sends police to Oaxaca |newspaper=Yahoo News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101071846/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061028/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/mexico_oaxaca_unrest |archivedate=November 1, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after months of attempting to stay neutral in what he considered a local issue.

On October 30th, 2006, the Revolutionary Indigenous Clandestine Committee ([[Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee|CCRI]]) issued a notice condemning the government tactics and the killings, including that of a minor; through the communiqué, the [[EZLN]] indicated a four-point response, which included the closing of some highways in the southeast state of Chiapas, and their vocal support to the people of Oaxaca.

Since the University is autonomous, the police are forbidden from entering the grounds, unless invited by the Rector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6112142.stm |work=BBC News | title=More violence in Oaxaca protest | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of protesters arrived in the following hours, surrounding the police and eventually forcing them to withdraw from the area surrounding the university. The APPO has also received permission by the university rector, through threats of violence, to broadcast their messages through the university radio, which they have used to criticise political parties, the PRI specifically. Opinions against the APPO are quickly taken off the air&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/145225.html |title=Radio Universidad, voz estratégica de APPO – El Universal – México |publisher=Eluniversal.com.mx |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After criticism by the private sector, political organizations and the press (specifically [[Grupo Formula]]'s news anchor [[Denise Maerker]]) for his remarks towards the APPO the rector declared that he had requested respect for the rights of students and faculty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48536&amp;id_ejemplar=1276 |title=Exige rector de la UABJO a Segob se respeten garantías individuales |deadurl=yes |work=Noticias de Oaxaca |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021656/http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48536&amp;id_ejemplar=1276 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a tentative operation by the Federal Police would not be a solution to the issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oloramitierra.com.mx/?mod=read&amp;sec=general&amp;id=9420&amp;titulo=Busca_el_rector_de_la_UABJO_reestablecer_actividades_en_Ciudad_Universitaria |title=Busca el rector de la UABJO reestablecer actividades en Ciudad Universitaria |publisher=Oloramitierra.com.mx |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930075218/http://www.oloramitierra.com.mx/?mod=read&amp;sec=general&amp;id=9420&amp;titulo=Busca_el_rector_de_la_UABJO_reestablecer_actividades_en_Ciudad_Universitaria |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three explosions in Mexico City destroyed a [[Scotiabank]] branch lobby, blew out windows at Mexico's Tribunal Federal Electoral (Federal Electoral Tribunal), and damaged the auditorium at [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] headquarters.  Other homemade bombs were placed in a second Scotiabank branch and in front of the chain restaurant Sanborns, but these were disabled before exploding.  A phone call was placed to authorities shortly before midnight which warned of the bombings.

None of the exploded bombs resulted in injuries or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20061107.RTICKERMAIN07/TPStory/Business |title=Scotiabank targeted in Mexican bombing campaign |work=The Globe and Mail |location=Canada |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coalition of five leftist guerrilla groups from [[Oaxaca]] claimed responsibility for the blasts. There are no known ties between these guerrilla groups and Oaxacan protesters, and APPO members denied any involvement in or knowledge of the bombings.

===November 10–13, 2006===
Despite the presence of federal police in the city, the APPO has continued to organize, holding a Constitutional Congress in order to discuss plans to rewrite Oaxaca's political constitution. Likewise, in an attempt to broaden its focus throughout the state and develop future projects, the movement formed the State Council of the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (CEAPPO). This new council will be formed of 260 representatives from the various regions of Oaxaca, including 40 members of the teachers' union. This represents a major development for the APPO's continuing attempts to develop alternative political proposals while still pushing for the removal of Ulises Ruiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48717&amp;id_ejemplar=1280 |title=Constituye la APPO su Consejo Estatal |newspaper=Noticias |date=14 November 2006 |access-date=November 14, 2006 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021741/http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=1&amp;id_art=48717&amp;id_ejemplar=1280 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 25–26, 2006===
On Saturday, November 25, 2006, a large clash between the federal police and demonstrators occurred in the evening following the seventh megamarch held by the APPO. The march began peacefully, but the situation turned violent when the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters attempted to encircle the city's zócalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.narconews.com/Issue43/article2397.html|title = Oaxaca: The End of Tolerance|newspaper = La Jornada|date = 28 November 2006|accessdate = 28 November 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061202222348/http://www.narconews.com/Issue43/article2397.html|archive-date = December 2, 2006|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear who instigated the violence, but the clash quickly spread through the city as protesters fought back with rocks and homemade PVC rockets. Police took the APPO encampment in the Santo Domingo plaza and arrested more than 160 people. Many APPO supporters were hospitalized, and the deaths of three protesters were reported but remain unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/22119.html |title=APPO protest deteriorates into violence |newspaper=El Universal |date=26 November 2006 |accessdate=26 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202143908/http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/22119.html |archivedate=December 2, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/peller12022006.html |title=The Dirty War of Oaxaca |website=CounterPunch |date=2 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210004039/http://www.counterpunch.org/peller12022006.html |archivedate=December 10, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, and continuing on Sunday, November 26, fires were set by the protesters to numerous vehicles, and fires also destroyed or damaged four buildings housing government offices (including a tax and court office), one university building, and an office building of a local trade association. Three hotels were also attacked, and some local businesses were looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/11/26/oaxaca.protest.ap/index.html |title=Buildings torched, dozens injured in Mexican tourist town |work=[[CNN]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220135747/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/11/26/oaxaca.protest.ap/index.html |archivedate=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, November 27, 2006, the Chief of the Federal Police, Ardelio Vargas, stated that they would no longer have any more tolerance for the APPO. "There will be no more tolerance (...) those who go against the law will have their punishment. The warrants and orders of arrest are not ordered by the police, but by local and federal judges", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnorte.com/nacional/articulo/694893/ |title=(spanish) requires subscription, "Se acabó la tolerancia en Oaxaca.- PFP" |publisher=El Norte |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts have been made to follow through on these threats as movement leaders have been arrested and organizational offices have been raided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/22157.html |newspaper=El Universal |title=PFP sweep nets arrest of Sosa’s brother }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After indications that the APPO would assemble at the State University Campus following the weekends confrontations, Vargas said that "there will be no violation of the autonomy of the University"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/390512.html |title=(spanish), "Se agotó la tolerancia: PFP" |publisher=El Universal |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following days the APPO removed the last of their barricades from the city and turned over control of the university radio station to the rector, citing lack of security. APPO leaders have gone into hiding, claiming a repressive crackdown by state authorities against those involved in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/miami/22187.html |newspaper=El Universal |title=Eerie calm falls over city since troubles began |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173236/http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/miami/22187.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The police have been accused of arresting teachers out of classrooms, beating detainees and false arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noticias-oax.com.mx/articulos.php?id_sec=2&amp;id_art=49282&amp;id_ejemplar=1295 |title=Aterroriza la PFP en escuelas |work=Noticias |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |date=December 1, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220135747/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/11/26/oaxaca.protest.ap/index.html |archivedate=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/miami/22172.html |newspaper=El Universal |title=Rights activist held in Oaxaca prison, alleges false arrest |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927173145/http://www.mexiconews.com.mx/miami/22172.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==December 2006==
On Monday, December 4, hours after he said at a news conference in Mexico City that he had gone to the capital to negotiate a peaceful solution, [[Flavio Sosa]] was arrested by police on charges related to the barricades, vandalism and irregular detentions carried out by some protesters. Sosa's brother, Horacio, and two other men were also arrested on unspecified charges. Flavio Sosa's heavy-set, bearded presence became an emblem of APPO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061205/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/mexico_oaxaca |title=Protest movement leader nabbed in Mexico |work=Associated Press |deadurl=yes |author=Rebeca Romero |date=December 5, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207091554/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061205/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/mexico_oaxaca |archivedate=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrest, the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]], through their speaker, Gerardo Fernandez Noroña, revealed that Sosa was a member of the party's National Council and said that this obliged them to assume Sosa's legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = El Norte|language = Spanish|url = http://www.elnorte.com/nacional/articulo/697416/|title = Asume PRD defensa de líder de la APPO|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following week, the federal police seized armament from Oaxaca's State Police and said that local forces were under investigation based on accusations of murder that the APPO made against them. The APPO reported that the federal government offered to not detain any other members of their movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = El Norte|language = Spanish|url = http://www.elnorte.com/nacional/articulo/698568/ |subscription = yes|title = Cuerpos policiacos de Oaxaca están bajo investigación federal por las denuncias que hiciera la APPO en su contra; Bucareli se comprometió a no proceder ni detener a ninguno de los líderes de la APPO|trans-title=Oaxaca police corps are under Federal investigation for the accusations that APPO made against them; Bucareli compromised to stop proceeding against or detaining any of the other leaders of the APPO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ulises Ruiz==
{{Main|Ulises Ruiz}}
At the heart of the continuing conflict are attitudes towards the state's governor, [[Ulises Ruiz]], a member of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] which governed Mexico for most of the 20th century, but which now is a minority in a nation where political power resides in 3 main parties. However, the main power struggle is between the rightist [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and the leftist [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|Democratic Revolutionary Party]], leaving the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] free to form coalitions with one of the two parties. Ruiz is a polemical figure whom opponents accuse of stealing his 2004 election, suppressing the freedom of the press, destruction of public spaces and historical monuments in the city, and repression of political opponents. Protestors argue that the constitution gives the central government the power under certain circumstances &lt;!-- Help me... who, when?

re: In fact, never. The protesters are very wrong. According to Senator Fernando Elizondo (PAN, NL) the Senate only has the power to declare absence of government and call for elections when it has been recorded that no government exists. They have not found this to be the case in Oaxaca. Further, the Federal Judicial Branch is not empowered to remove elected officials, for the same reason that Lopez Obrador could not be taken to trial despite President Fox trying very hard. Finally, the Executive branch has no authority over state issues. The only ones empowered to remove the governor are the State Legislature, which is also PRI majority.

Also, please take into account the PAN's position in the Senate, and in the Executive branch as documented in the talk page. The PAN has openly called for Ruiz's resignation and does not seem reluctant to ask for it day after day.

--&gt;&lt;!--the preceding is VERY long for an inline comment; best to move it to the talkpage, please, as it should be seen for discussion--&gt;to remove a sitting governor; the [[Senate of Mexico|Senate of the Republic]], voted on the issue and decided that those "special circumstances" are not to be found in Oaxaca.

As the conflict in Oaxaca has grown more intractable, outside pressure on Ruiz to resign has grown, but he has not shown signs of budging. The senate has blamed both the governor and the APPO for the violence that originated in the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/144405.html |title=Ulises Ruiz lesionó la legalidad: Senado |publisher=Eluniversal.com.mx |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the business group [[Coparmex]] in the state of Puebla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2006/11/02/puebla/pol103.php |title=Necedad, la de Ulises Ruiz al negarse a escuchar las voces que piden su salida: Coparmex |publisher=Lajornadadeoriente.com.mx |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the then Secretary of the Interior [[Carlos Abascal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debate.com.mx/eldebate/index.asp?IdTPDMilenium=27&amp;IdArt=2317472&amp;IdCat=1783 |title=Abascal pide la renuncia a Ulises Ruiz |publisher=Debate.com.mx |accessdate=March 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205235147/http://www.debate.com.mx/eldebate/index.asp?IdTPDMilenium=27&amp;IdArt=2317472&amp;IdCat=1783 |archivedate=February 5, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; have called for his resignation or blamed him for the conflict. The APPO has made his resignation or removal their one non-negotiable demand before they will agree to end the conflict.

'''Al-Hikma University colllge ''' ({{in arabic كليةالحكمةالجامعة}}) was a university in [[Baghdad]] founded in 1956 by members of the [[New England]] [[ecclesiastical province|Province]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] ..Re-opening in 2010 in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] . Located in Yarmouk .Al “hikma” name mean in English "wisdom"

==History==
Four [[American people|American]] Jesuits were sent to Iraq in 1932 at the request of [[Pope Pius XI]], upon the urging of the [[Patriarch]] of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], as the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] prepared for its independence from Great Britain.&lt;ref name=JT&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph, S.J.|last= MacDonnell|url=http://faculty.fairfield.edu/jmac/bag/bag.htm|title=Jesuits by the Tigris|year=1994|place=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher= Jesuit Mission Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There they founded [[Baghdad College]], which soon became known as an institution of academic excellence.&lt;ref name=JB&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fairfield.edu/documents/publications/fn_fall03.pdf |work=FairfieldNow |date=Fall 2003 |title=The Jesuits of  Baghdad: 1932-69 |pages=32–35 |first=Joseph, S.J. |last=MacDonnell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923034002/http://www.fairfield.edu/documents/publications/fn_fall03.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 the decision was made to provide a university-level facility for the city. The buildings were designed and built by the Jesuits on a 195-[[acre]] campus.&lt;ref name=JB /&gt;
When it opened in The University's initial student body numbered 45 students, but, by the time that the university was closed, it was admitting about 150 each year, and there were 656 students in total.

In 1960, the construction of a new library building for Al-Hikma University commenced.  It was funded by the Ford Foundation (Qubain 1966), but the Foundation expected the University to find the money for furnishing it.  The building was completed in 1962, when the collection was around 20,000 volumes.  Although the library was not architecturally commendable, it was reported to have attracted some imitators.  The Library had a collection of 327 manuscripts, a private collection donated in 1965, which were catalogued with support funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation (Qazanchi 1970).  In the late 1960s, Gurgis Awad (Librarian of the Iraqi Museum) donated his private collection to the Al-Hikma University Library (Zado 1990).

Al-Hikma University's student body was extremely diverse in ethnicity, religion and gender.  Students were roughly 40 percent Muslim, 32 percent Catholic, 21 percent Orthodox Christian, and about 7 percent Jewish. The staff was also mixed: roughly half of them were Jesuits, while Iraqi lay teachers, both Christian and Muslim, [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright professors]], and a small group of volunteer teachers from abroad made up the rest.&lt;ref name=IJ&gt;{{cite web|work=Iraqi Jews at Al-Hikma University|url=http://iraqijews.awardspace.com/al-hikma.html|title=Al-Hikma University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a law was passed under which the private universities were converted into public universities, but continued to charge tuition fees. In 1968, a new law nationalised Al-Hikma University.  In autumn 1968, an Iraqi was imposed as president of the university.  The University became the object of protests by groups of nationalist students.  Eventually, in November, the American faculty of the university were expelled by the [[Ba'athist Iraq|Baathist government]], and the institution was integrated into Baghdad University.&lt;ref name=IJ /&gt; The college was seized, along with all the Jesuit's property, by the government the following year, and the foreign faculty was also expelled.

Reunions of graduates of both Baghdad College and Al-Hikma University continue to be held bi-annually.  The most recent one was organised in [[Chicago]] in July 2006.&lt;ref name=IJ /&gt;

The history of the Jesuit mission in Iraq has been chronicled by [[the Rev.]] Joseph MacDonnell, S.J., late of [[Fairfield University]], in his book ''Jesuits by the Tigris''.&lt;ref name=JT /&gt;

'''Anne Willem van den Ban''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈɑnə ˈʋɪləm vɑn dɛr bɑn}}; 28 February 1928 – 7 May 2016)&lt;ref&gt;http://resource.wageningenur.nl/en/organisation/show/Anne-van-den-Ban-passed-away.htm&lt;/ref&gt; was a Dutch [[scholar]], whose work focused on [[agricultural extension]].

==Biography==

Van den Ban (son of two extension agents) studied [[Agricultural Economics]] at the ''Landbouwhogeschool'' (agricultural university) in [[Wageningen]] between 1945 and 1953. The ''Landbouwhogeschool'' is currently known as Wageningen University (part of [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]]).

In an article&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M.; Ban, A.W. van den (1963). Research on the diffusion of agricultural innovations in the United States and the Netherlands. Sociologia ruralis 3 . - p. 38 - 51.&lt;/ref&gt; that van den Ban wrote with [[Everett M. Rogers]] (from whom the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory originates), he describes how Professor [[E.W. Hofstee]] made a study-tour in 1950 of [[land-grant universities]] in the U.S. This study-tour was sponsored by the [[Marshall Plan]]. Hofstee had been impressed with the research on the adoption of new farm practices and when he returned to the ''landbouwhogeschool'' he stressed this topic in his lectures. Van den Ban, who was a student of Hofstee, chose the adoption of innovations as topic for his Master’s thesis.

After completing military service, van den Ban started working for the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, for which he did research on agricultural extension at the Department of [[Rural Sociology]] of the ''Landbouwhogeschool''. Based on this research, van den Ban obtained his PhD in 1963 with Prof. E.W. Hofstee being his tutor. His thesis was called ''[http://edepot.wur.nl/121207 Boer en landbouwvoorlichting: de communicatie van nieuwe landbouwmethoden]''(Farmer and agricultural extension, the communication of new farming practices).&lt;ref&gt;van den Ban, A. W. (1963). Boer en landbouwvoorlichting : de communicatie van nieuwe landbouwmethoden. Wageningen, Pudoc.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is believed to be the first empirical study on agricultural extension in Europe.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;http://library.wur.nl/way/index_ban.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 van den Ban started the department of Extension Education. At the time of his retirement, in 1983, the department had grown to be one of the 5 largest departments at the ''Landbouwhogeschool''. Nowadays, this is the department of [[Communication Science]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.com.wur.nl&lt;/ref&gt; with two sub-departments; Communication and Innovation Studies, and Communication Strategies. Although van den Ban retired from the department in 1983, he continued to work as a consultant in different countries, mainly in India and Tanzania.

Van den Ban is advisor to the Executive Council of the International Society for Extension Education (INSEE)&lt;ref&gt;http://inseeworld.com/executive_council.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and received a Life Time Achievement Award in September 2008 for his ''"outstanding contribution in the field of Extension Education, Agricultural Development and Rural Development"''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.com.wur.nl/UK/newsagenda/archive/news/2008/Professor+honoured+in+Goa.htm&lt;/ref&gt; from this organization

Van den Ban was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]] for his outstanding scientific achievements on a national and international level on 15 September 2011. The award was presented during a meeting to mark the award of the 200th scholarship by the [http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/Benefactors/Areas-to-support/The-funds-of-the-Wageningen-University-Fund/Scholarships/Anne-van-den-Ban-Fund.htm Anne van den Ban Scholarship Fund].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wageningen.nl/Actueel/Nieuws/Archief_2011/Prof_dr_ir_Van_den_Ban_benoemd_tot_Officier_in_de_Orde_van_Oranje_Nassau |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927154231/http://www.wageningen.nl/Actueel/Nieuws/Archief_2011/Prof_dr_ir_Van_den_Ban_benoemd_tot_Officier_in_de_Orde_van_Oranje_Nassau |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The work of van den Ban is well known throughout the world. In 1974 he published a book called ''Inleiding tot de voorlichtingskunde'',&lt;ref&gt;van den Ban, A. W. (1974). Inleiding tot de voorlichtingskunde. Wageningen, Landbouwhogeschool.&lt;/ref&gt; which was (together with Helen Stuart Hawkins from Australia) revised, translated and published as ''Agricultural Extension''&lt;ref&gt;van den Ban, A. W. and H. S. Hawkins (1988). Agricultural extension. Burnt Mill, Harlow, Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988. By now it has been translated in 10 different languages. Cees Leeuwis revised this book with contributions from van den Ban and it was published as ''Communication for rural innovation: rethinking agricultural extension'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwis, C. and A. van den Ban (2004). Communication for rural innovation : rethinking agricultural extension. Oxford [etc.], Blackwell Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van den Ban did not limit his work to agricultural extension. With Maria Koelen he wrote a book on ''Health education and health promotion''&lt;ref&gt;Koelen, M. A. and A. W. van den Ban (2004). Health education and health promotion. Wageningen, Wageningen Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; (2004). Different versions of this book were translated and published  in 13 languages.
On 28 February 2008 (van den Ban’s 80th birthday) Wageningen University digitalized his life’s work and made this publicly available through their website. Over 230 publications are offered in open access.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt;

The '''Boulder Outdoor Survival School''' ('''BOSS''') is a wilderness skills and survival school that has been teaching courses in southern Utah since 1968.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.boss-inc.com/about/the-history-of-boss/ The History of BOSS]&lt;/ref&gt; BOSS has been based in the small town of [[Boulder, Utah]] since 1977. BOSS courses are known for being extremely challenging and for traveling through some of the most remote wilderness in the [[United States]].

==History==

In 1968, a [[Brigham Young University]] professor named [[Larry Dean Olsen]], author of ''[[Outdoor Survival Skills]]'', founded a program to take failing college students into the wilderness for 30 days. He traveled with them through challenges in the deep wilderness of southern Utah to give them the opportunity to build resilience, mental toughness, and adaptability. The initial course was a huge success, and students returned to BYU transformed. The BYU Survival Course (also called Youth Leadership 480) was born.

For the next 10 years, under the leadership of a determined group of instructors (Larry Mullins, Doug Nelson, Dave Wescott, and others), Youth Leadership 480 continued to take BYU students into the wilderness of Southern Utah to give them the chance to learn primitive skills and meet the challenges of the wilderness. When Larry Mullins was injured in 1973, Doug Nelson took over management of the program. Under Doug’s leadership the program flourished and grew. Doug streamlined and built the program in the university context, then in 1977 took it out from under the umbrella of BYU and incorporated it as an independent business in the small town of [[Boulder, Utah]].

Doug continued to run BOSS until 1985, when his friend (and another of Larry’s instructors) David Wescott took the reigns as owner. Dave and his wife Paula grew the program to include teaching the traditional skills of the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] and [[Fremont culture]], adding more depth and a strong skills-focus to the program. He hired instructors who appreciated the history and legacy of indigenous people and who could teach the skills of so-called “primitive” cultures to modern outdoor enthusiasts. In the late 80s, BOSS began expanding beyond Utah, offering courses in [[Mexico]]. In 1988, David and other BOSS staff founded the Rabbitstick gathering in Idaho.

By 1990, in addition to its world-famous Field courses, BOSS was offering Skills courses intensively focusing on the practice of traditional skills. With topics ranging from [[ethnobotany]] to primitive pottery to [[stone tool]]s, students had the opportunity to explore the world of these skills and the connection to human history they provide in greater depth, without the challenge of extreme hiking. In the 90s, BOSS also started running courses in Canada with [[Mors Kochanski]].

In 1994, BOSS alumnus and past staff member [[Josh Bernstein]] returned to BOSS as Marketing and Administrative Director, opening a new office in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Josh restructured the BOSS curriculum to include an even greater emphasis on traditional cultures, and eventually took over as owner in 1997. 

In 2001, BOSS’s Field Office in [[Boulder, Utah]] moved from a 1/4 acre parcel of land to 41 acres on Highway 12. Jenny Stein joined BOSS as Customer Service manager, working from the Colorado office. In 2004, Jeff Sanders took over as Program Director. Under Jeff’s leadership, many systems were put in place that ensured smooth field operations, staff development, and consistent delivery of the BOSS curriculum. Under Jenny and Jeff’s supervision, the number of students, courses and staff continued to grow.

In late 2010, Steve Dessinger, Laurel Holding and Bryan Puskar - all long-time instructors of the school - were promoted to Director positions, and in 2014, Josh Bernstein passed the torch of ownership to Steve Dessinger.

In 2015, with the financial support of dedicated BOSS alumni, BOSS Instructor (now Board Member) Jessica Ewing and Laurel Holding established the first-ever BOSS Scholarship fund. Since then BOSS has been awarding grants to students demonstrating financial need and strong merit.

After running the school for four years, Steve decided, with the support of other long-time BOSS staff, to transition the school to a [[501(c)(3) organization]]. The nonprofit organization hit the ground running, with a board of directors initially made up of BOSS staff members Perry Tancredi, Jessica Ewing, Michael Denisoff, Charlie Detar, and Steve Dessinger. The board named Eli Loomis as BOSS’s first executive director. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.boss-inc.com/about/the-history-of-boss/ The History of BOSS]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, BOSS celebrated its 50th year of teaching tough wilderness programs and offering transformative experiences to students.

==Philosophy==

The BOSS philosophy includes teaching skills in context, using simple, durable technology, and building mental toughness and resilience through powerful experiences in the wilderness. One of their principles is, "know more, carry less." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boss-inc.com/about/ About BOSS]&lt;/ref&gt; In the field course, a BOSS staple since 1968, participants carry no [[tent]]s, [[sleeping bag]]s, [[portable stove]]s or [[backpack]]s, and carry little more than a [[knife]], a [[poncho]], and the clothes on their backs. BOSS believes in traveling light and having a positive impact on the land. Field courses last 7 days, 14 days or 28 days. They also offer specialty courses focusing intensively on primitive skills or [[navigation]] lasting 7 or 14 days. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boss-inc.com/courses/ BOSS courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In July 2006, Dave Buschow, a participant in one of BOSS' field courses died of [[dehydration]] and [[electrolyte imbalance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/03/travel/main2757021.shtml Hiker Dies Of Thirst With Water All Around]&lt;/ref&gt;  A lawsuit was filed by the participant's family in May, 2007, and was settled in November, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boss-inc.com/pdf/Buschow_release.pdf "David Buschow Case Resolved"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918094301/http://www.boss-inc.com/pdf/Buschow_release.pdf |date=September 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a website, [http://rememberdave.net rememberdave.net], dedicated to Dave's memory.

==History==
===UAPRE===
A broadcasting association in the United States, BEA underwent several name changes in the developmental years of the association. Initially organized in 1948, the small University Association for Professional Radio Education (UAPRE) almost ceased to exist because of a lack of organization leading to a lack of specific activities and goals.

===APBE===
The group reorganized in 1956 as the Association for Professional Broadcasting Education (APBE). At this point, the organization’s purpose was to combine broadcasters and educators through an affiliation with the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB). In doing so, the APBE was working towards the goal of good career and [[liberal arts]] education in [[broadcasting]]. APBE began publishing Journal of Broadcasting, the quarterly [[scholarly journal]], in the winter of 1956, and the ''Journal of Radio Studies'' ({{ISSN|1095-5046}}). In 1974, APBE changed its name to the Broadcast Education Association (BEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterling, Kittross|first=Christopher, John|title=Stay Tuned: A Concise History of American Broadcasting|year=1990|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-11905-0|pages=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Car Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game]] that was released on January 5, 2003 by [[JoWooD Productions]] under the [[Fishtank Interactive]] brand name. It was the first major game by the developer, Vectorcome Development, and sees the player managing a company that develops and manufactures cars.

==Bugs==
The game has been plagued by bugs from the start. Initially, the player could not save games. Eventually a patch was released that fixed this and a few other bugs, but the game still isn't entirely bug-free. Numerous bugs were never addressed, such as one related to the "big customers". In the game, the player is able to make offers to various local businesses requiring vehicles. The premise is to give the player another way to sell his or her cars. Unfortunately, this never works, as the offers are never accepted.

'''Certificate in Management Studies''' (CMS) also referred as Certificate in Management, Graduate Certificate in Management, Masters Entry Certificate in Management, is a UK undergraduate qualification normally comprising 3-4 modules of study in the area of [[Management]]. It forms the first half of [[Diploma]] in [[Management Studies]] (DMS).

==Pathway==
The CMS &amp; DMS form the pathway for many students going onto complete MBA's. Most of the institutions offering the CMS/DMS offer the [[MBA]] as the final stage or the credit for achieving the DMS can be transferred to another institution. The exams and coursework undertaken at this level serves as a foundation for similar assessment at the MBA level where there is a strong focus on research and written reports.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">'''Dating coaches''' offer [[coaching]] and related products and services to improve their clients' success in dating and relationships. Through discussion, role-playing, behavior modeling, and other forms of direction, a dating coach trains clients to meet and attract romantic partners. Dating coaches may focus on topics important to the art of [[dating]]: [[interpersonal skills]], [[flirting]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|compatibility]], [[fashion]] and [[recreation]]al activities. As dating coaches are unlicensed, their methods vary widely.

==Technique==
Dating coaches offer a wide range of services, such as electronic books and newsletters, personal coaching, small group seminars, and weekend workshops. One-on-one coaching can involve counselling and in-the-field coaching,&lt;ref name=msnbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13821043/|title=Frustrated singles turn to professional help|date=12 July 2006|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can involve practicing [[flirting]]&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; or going out with a coach of the sex the client is attracted to on a mock date and being critiqued throughout the date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waytoosocial.com/experiential-gifts-create-a-can-do-spirit/|title=Experiential Gifts Create a Can-Do Spirit|date=16 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinct from matchmakers because they coach people on finding their own dates whereas [[matchmaking|matchmakers]] arrange dates for their clients.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/fashion/27dating.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=The Dating Coach Is In ($125/Hour) | first=Abby | last=Ellin | date=2007-09-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaching styles and programs differ from provider to provider, and may include advice on the art of [[conversation]], [[pickup lines]], how to dress, appropriate forms of touch, the science of love, and anything else that may improve dating prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080122/ENT03/801220335/1038|title=New Bravo series examines making matches for rich men - Freep.com - Detroit Free Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others provide guidance on how to date multiple people simultaneously, without getting caught.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/girl_in_every_borough_PA2MLNrn40YInXsce6ikAO|title=A girl in every borough|date=8 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common elements of dating coaches' tips include the need to decide what you are looking for and remain positive.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Some coaches claim to know what women want. &lt;ref name=datingcoach.be&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.datingcoach.be|title=Dating coach|first=|last=joost|website=Dating coach|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dating coaches specialize in helping with [[online dating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/11/business/yourmoney/11dating.html?_r=2&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=In the Computer Dating Game, Room for a Coach | first=Jennifer | last=Alsever | date=2007-03-11 | accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could include helping people rewrite their online profiles to obtain better results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Evan Marc Katz|title=If You Are Short, Fat, Older or An Asian Man, You Must Read This.

==Dating seminars==
Dating seminars are taught by coaches working for commercial dating companies. In these seminars, coaches teach participants to meet romantic partners. Sometimes dating coaches take the clients out in public to help the clients approach and seduce women.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt; This method of teaching is heavily linked to the [[seduction community]] and the companies which cater to it.

Different dating seminars can take vastly different approaches to the subject. Christian dating seminars, for example, may stress differences between [[love]] and [[lust]] and knowing one's own self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2006/01/30/Campus/Christian.Dating.Seminar-1520704.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090123041429/http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2006/01/30/Campus/Christian.Dating.Seminar-1520704.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-01-23 |title=Christian Dating Seminar |author=Brown, Akeyla |date=2006-01-30 }}{{broken citation|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim dating seminars may also deal with how to find a mate without compromising religious principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/us/19dating.html|title=It’s Muslim Boy Meets Girl, but Don’t Call It Dating|publisher=New York Times|date=2006-09-19 | first=Neil | last=MacFarquhar | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stigma&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;==
{{Refimprove|section|date=November 2014}}
Dating coaching is often stigmatized. Many people believe that teaching romance is demeaning and unethical, while many others believe it is impossible.  These critics acknowledge that most people seek romantic advice, but argue that professional romantic coaching differs from amateur advice in scope and context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2007&amp;base_name=dating_coaches|title=Ezra Klein|website=www.prospect.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others feel{{who|date=November 2010}} that dating presents challenges unsuited to amateur intervention, and that chaotic dating norms and mixed social messages necessitate some form of instruction. Further, they feel that personal romantic barriers differ from other sorts of personal barriers so that coaching can be uniquely fruitful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=1654&amp;dept_id=57100&amp;newsid=16052168&amp;PAG=461&amp;rfi=9 Westport Minuteman - Dating coaches spur serious relationships&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509170710/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?BRD=1654&amp;dept_id=57100&amp;newsid=16052168&amp;PAG=461&amp;rfi=9 |date=2007-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many argue that changing social norms have been particularly challenging for men. Because many economic and social obstacles to relationship dissolution have been eroded, sex appeal and relationship smarts may be necessary to compensate for devalued traditional traits, such as a strong work ethic or good and stable income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marriage.rutgers.edu/Publications/SOOU/TEXTSOOU2007.htm State of Our Unions 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108083234/http://marriage.rutgers.edu/Publications/SOOU/TEXTSOOU2007.htm |date=2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that the stigma against dating coaches is weakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Angelowicz |first=Ami  |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/personal/03/15/tf.tips.matchmaker.greenwald/ |title=Dating coach's 8 top tips |publisher=CNN |date=March 15, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the film ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'' (featuring [[Will Smith]]) and the reality TV show ''[[The Pick-up Artist (TV series)|The Pick-up Artist]]'' indicate a growing awareness of the presence of dating coaches in society and their function. However, according to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', most men wanting pickup tips do not get coaches but they read books.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} They could be consciously or subconsciously using women for entertainment purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.foxnews.com/love/why-isnt-he-asking-you-out Why Isn't He Asking You Out?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406051438/http://magazine.foxnews.com/love/why-isnt-he-asking-you-out |date=2015-04-06 }} By Ashley Papa, FOX News Magazine Contributor, February 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Delphian Society''' was a national organization that promoted the education of [[women]] in the United States. This organization was founded around 1910 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=speccoll_archives |title=Guide to Delphian Study Club Records |year=2010 |website=San Jose University |publisher=San Jose State University Special Collections and Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Delphian Society takes its name from the historical [[Oracle of Delphi]] of [[Phocis]], [[Greece]]. "Here in remote times [[Apollo]] was believed to reveal his wishes to men through the medium of a priestess, speaking under the influence of vaporous breath which rose from a yawning fissure. Her utterances were not always coherent and were interpreted to those seeking guidance by Apollo's priests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. Vol. 1|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|page=viii|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1913, the Delphian Society wrote, "We know full well today that no priestess upon a tripod can reveal to us the secrets of the future. A thorough understanding of the past must be the safest guide for coming years. No vapor can inspire sudden revelations--the result only of faithful effort and earnest thought. Yet the story of the ancient oracle charms us still and when a name was sought for a national organization, that had for its avowed purposed the promotion of educational interests in a continent, none was deemed more suitable than that which for so many years cast its gracious spell from one sea to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. Vol. 1|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|page=ix|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Delphian Society was inspired by influential [[Harvard]] President, [[Charles William Eliot]]'s belief that education serves the purpose of inspiring lifelong learning and those who do not receive it "seem to live in a mental vacuum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. Vol. 1|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|page=x|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "Fifteen minutes a day of good reading would have given any one of this multitude a really human life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. Vol. 1|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|page=xi|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to his call for lifelong learning, the Delphian Society wrote, "To meet this condition, which prevails through the length and breadth of our land, to stimulate a deeper interest, quicken a latent appreciation and facilitate the use of brief periods of freedom for self-improvement, the Delphian Society was organized and the Delphian Course of Reading made possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. Vol. 1|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|page=xi|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the Delphian Society published the '''Delphian Course of Reading''': "A systematic plan of education, embracing the world's progress and development of the liberal arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. 10 vols|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ten volume course covers "history, literature, philosophy, poetry, fiction, drama, art, ethics, music," however, "Mathematics, being in its higher forms essential to few, has been omitted; languages, requiring the aid of a teacher, and such scenes as make laboratories necessary, are not included."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=The Delphian Society|title=The Delphian Course. Vol. 1|date=1913|publisher=W. B. Conkey Company|location=Hammond|isbn=9781149959961|page=xi|format=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the Delphian Society published several volumes of books containing an outline of human [[knowledge]] for the use of [[conversation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Delphian Society: Topical Outlines. The Delphian Society, 1928, Chicago.

[[File:USMC-07396.jpg|thumb|Instructor and learner divers practicing scuba skills in confined water]]

A '''diving instructor''' is a person who trains underwater divers. This includes [[Free-diving|free-divers]], [[Recreational diving|recreational divers]] including the subcategory [[Technical diving|technical divers]], and [[Professional diving|professional divers]] which includes [[Military diving|military]], [[Commercial diving|commercial]], [[Public safety diving|public safety]] and [[Scientific diving|scientific divers]].

Depending on the jurisdiction, there will generally be specific published codes of practice and guidelines for training, competence and registration of diving instructors, as they have a duty of care to their clients, and operate in an environment with intrinsic hazards which may be unfamiliar to the lay person.&lt;ref name=RRR6291 /&gt;

Recreational diving instructors are usually registered members of one or more recreational diver certification agencies.

Military diving instructors are generally members of the armed force for which they train personnel.

Commercial diving instructors may be required to register with national government appointed organisations,&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"/&gt; but there may be other requirements in some parts of the world.

==Function==
[[File:Scuba_education_levels.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI]]
A diving instructor trains and assesses the competence of persons who intend to become underwater divers. The instructor may use training standards and materials provided by the certifying organisation, or may develop suitable training standards, depending on the training system and authority involved. Most recreational training and certification agencies provide suitable training materials and require their registered instructors to train and assess using the materials provided. 

Commercial diving schools may have a broader scope of options, and may be expected to develop and maintain their own training materials, which may be required to comply with a published training standard.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Diving at Work Regulations 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AS2815.3 1992" /&gt;

==History==
===Recreational===
In 1953, Jack Atkinson, the first National Diving Officer of the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]], and Colin McLeod started a system of training and accreditation for Third Class, Second Class and First Class Divers, which was based on the three-tier system with which they were familiar, as used for divers in the UK armed forces. This programme was developed over the next six years culminating in the first BSAC Diving Manual, published in 1959. [[Oscar Gugen]], one of BSAC's founders, and George Brookes travelled the UK helping to set up branches of BSAC, all of which used amateur instructors to deliver the BSAC training programme within the club setting.&lt;ref name="Rogerson2013" /&gt;

In 1955, Dottie Frazier became the world's first female scuba diving instructor. Dottie Frazier is also recognized as the first female hard-hat diver, first female instructor and the first female to own and operate her own dive shop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.padi.com/blog/2017/03/23/7-women-in-diving-everyone-should-know/|title=7 Women in Diving Everyone Should Know|website=www2.padi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Along with diving, Frazier also paired with the United States Navy to design wet suits and dry suits for the military, as well as recreational divers. 

In 1959, The [[YMCA]] developed the first nationally organised scuba diving course and certified their first skin and scuba diving instructors in the United States.&lt;ref name="DivingHistory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SPUMS1999" /&gt;

==Training and registration==
A diving instructor is as a rule required to be qualified as a diver to at least the same level as the divers to be trained. Additional requirements vary.

===Professional===
[[File:SA DoL Class III Diving Instructor PC160007.jpg|thumb|South African Department of Labour Class III Diving Instructor registration card]]
Instructors of professional divers are generally required to be qualified as supervisors for the level of diver they can train, and may also be required to have some qualification in adult education as facilitators, assessors or moderators, and to be registered with a governing body. There is usually also a requirement for some experience in the industry before a diver can be trained as a supervisor, and similarly before a supervisor can become an instructor. The actual requirements vary depending on the jurisdiction.

In [[South Africa]] a commercial diving instructor is [[Commercial diver registration in South Africa|registered]] by the [[Department of Labour (South Africa)|Department of Labour]] for the class of diving they are considered competent to instruct, and can only instruct learner commercial divers through a commercial diving school, also registered with the Department of Labour.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Diver OC684101"/&gt; The minimum requirement for registration as a commercial diving instructor include registration and practical experience as a Diving Supervisor of the same class and certification or equivalent work experience as a training facilitator in adult education.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;{{rp|14, 25}}

For example, the minimum requirement for registration as a Class IV Commercial Scuba Instructor would be:
*Pass the practical and theory assessments and other requirements for Class IV Commercial Scuba Diver, including a minimum of 30 dives with a minimum logged time of 15 hours and apply for registration. This is usually a full-time course for about 20 working days.&lt;ref name="Class 4 diver training standard" /&gt;
*Have held Class IV Commercial Scuba Diver registration for a minimum of 1 year and 50 logged commercial dives after qualification to qualify for Supervisor training.&lt;ref name="Class 4 supervisor training standard" /&gt;
*Hold in date Level 2 First Aid certification. This is usually a three-day full-time course including assessment.&lt;ref name="Class 4 supervisor training standard" /&gt;
*Hold in date topside or commercial diving certificate of medical fitness issued by a registered [[Diving medicine#Registration|Diving Medical Practitioner]] and registered on the [[Diving medicine#Research organisations|Southern African Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Association]] (SAUHMA) national database.&lt;ref name="Class 4 supervisor training standard" /&gt;
*Attend and pass the requirements of a Class IV Commercial Scuba Supervisor training programme, which includes about 5 days of theory classwork. The practical requirement of a minimum of 100 hours supervisory experience under the direct supervision of a registered supervisor usually takes several months to complete, but it is possible to do it in a month. After this the school will apply for registration  of the applicant as a class IV supervisor.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Class 4 supervisor training standard" /&gt; 
*Have held a Class IV Commercial Scuba [[Diving supervisor|Supervisor]] registration for a minimum of 3 years.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;
*Hold a certification as an adult education training facilitator to a recognised national standard, or equivalent qualification or experience. Minimum 2 days full-time.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;
*Recommendation from the registered commercial diving school at which they are employed.
The total time required is more than 4 years, including training and work experience.

Similar requirements apply to registration as surface supplied and saturation diving instructors. In each case the applicant must first be qualified and have appropriate work experience as a diver, then supervisor in the class of diving before being eligible for application for [[Commercial diver registration in South Africa|registration as an instructor]] for that class of diving.&lt;ref name="CoP Training" /&gt;

===Recreational===
Recreational diving instructors may be subject to significantly less stringent requirements. These are set by the certification agencies to which they are affiliated, and may also be specifically or generally regulated by health and safety legislation. In the UK the Diving at Work Regulations specifically include training of recreational divers, while in the US and South Africa, the professional diving regulations specifically exclude recreational diving instruction.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Diving at Work Regulations 1997" /&gt;

====Diving Instructor====

Minimum requirements to attend a recreational diving instructor training programme vary between certification agencies. The requirements for PADI Instructor Development Course (IDC) are 6 months as a certified diver, Registration as a PADI [[Divemaster]], with 60 logged dives, a medical statement that the applicant does not suffer from a [[Medical fitness to dive|disqualifying medical condition]] and recent participation in PADI Emergency First Response training. The IDC takes five to seven days, and comprises two parts, Assistant Instructor training and Open Water Scuba Instructor training. During the IDC the candidate will learn PADI Standards and Procedures, The PADI system of instruction, diver safety and risk management, The role of the diving instructor in the recreational diving industry, and marketing and sales counseling for recreational diving business. 100 logged dives are required before the applicant can take the two-day Instructor Examination.&lt;ref name="PADI IDC" /&gt;

====Master Instructor====

A Master Instructor is a certificate given in recognition of a minimum level of experience in training divers after certification as a Diving Instructor, issued by PADI and SSI.&lt;ref name="padi msdi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSI MI" /&gt;

[[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] requires a minimum level of experience in a range of instruction activities, attendance at three or more instructor development seminars, a record of adherence to the official PADI training systems, support of the PADI organisation, and a quality assurance record which has been clean for at least six months. It is a prerequisite for application for course director.&lt;ref name="padi msdi" /&gt;

The [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]] rating of Master Instructor is issued in recognition of meeting the required level of experience in training and assessment of recreational scuba divers to SSI standards. No additional training is required. It is a required milestone before application for membership of the SSI Product Review Committee and for admission to an Instructor Trainer program.&lt;ref name="ssi msdi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSI MI" /&gt;

==Legal requirements and duty of care==
{{empty section|date=October 2016}}

==Employment==
===Job satisfaction in the recreational diver training industry===
In 1995, a study conducted on [[Queensland, Australia]] diving instructors showed that positive [[job satisfaction]] correlated with intention to remain in the dive industry and still active in their present job for the next 12 months.&lt;ref name=RRR6374 /&gt; The same study also showed that wages were still a primary concern since it was first noted by Kessler in 1976.&lt;ref name=RRR6374/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kessler1976 /&gt;

The '''Douglas–Coldwell Foundation''' is a left-wing [[Canada|Canadian]] [[think tank]] devoted, in the words of its slogan, to "promoting education and research into [[social democracy]]." It was founded in 1971, and is based in [[Ottawa]].

The Foundation was named for and inspired by [[Tommy Douglas]], the first federal leader of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] from 1961 to 1971, and [[Major James Coldwell|M. J. Coldwell]], leader of its predecessor [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] from 1942 to 1960. Both had desired a Canadian counterpart to the [[Fabian Society]].

In 1987, it merged with the Ontario Woodsworth Memorial Foundation of [[Toronto]], named for Coldwell's predecessor as CCF leader, [[J. S. Woodsworth]].

The foundation has underwritten biographies of Douglas, Coldwell, [[Clarence Gillis]], [[Stanley Knowles]], and [[Grace MacInnis]], and scholarships and lectureships at Canadian post-secondary institutions. The foundation also gives out yearly grants totalling up to $25,000 for projects supporting its mandate of "promoting education and research in social democracy."

The foundation is a registered [[Charitable organization|charitable]] foundation, contributions to which are [[tax deduction|tax-deductible]] in Canada; it accepts memberships and solicits donations from individuals and organizations in the general public. While predominantly associated with NDP members and activists, and concerned in part with the history and future of the party, it is an independent group with no administrative connection to any political party.

Tommy Douglas was the foundation's first president. [[Kalmen Kaplansky]] led the think tank in the 1980s and 1990s. [[Karl Bélanger]] became president of the foundation in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.dcf.ca/2016nov24president The Douglas-Coldwell Foundation elects Karl Bélanger as President] ''Douglas-Coldwell Foundation'', November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the defining features of development today is the relationship between '''education and technology''', stimulated by the spectacular growth in [[Internet access|internet connectivity]] and [[Mobile phone|mobile]] penetration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trends in Telecommunication Reform: Transnational aspects of regulation in a networked society.|last=|first=|publisher=ITU|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; We live in a connected world. An estimated 40% of the world’s population now uses the internet and this number is growing at a remarkable rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The world in 2014: Fact and Figures|last=|first=|publisher=ITU|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are significant variations in internet connectivity among countries and regions, the number of households with such links in the [[North–South divide|global South]] has now overtaken those in the [[North–South divide|global North]]. Moreover, over 70% of mobile telephone subscriptions worldwide are now in the global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trends in Telecommunication Reform, Special Edition. Fourth-generation regulation|last=|first=|publisher=ITU|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five billion people are expected to go from no to full connectivity within the next twenty years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business|last=Cohen|first=J.|last2=Schmidt|first2=E.|publisher=New York, Knopf|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still significant gaps among countries and regions, for example between [[Urban area|urban]] and [[Rural area|rural]] areas. Limited [[broadband]] speed and lack of connectivity hamper access to knowledge, participation in society and economic development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet has transformed how people access information and knowledge, how they interact, and the direction of public management and business. Digital connectivity holds promise for gains in [[health]], [[education]], [[communication]], [[leisure]] and [[well-being]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Artificial intelligence]] advances, [[3D printing|3D printers]], [[Holography|holographic]] recreation, instant transcription, voice-recognition and gesture-recognition software are only some examples of what is being tested. Digital technologies are reshaping human activity from daily life to international relations, from work to leisure, redefining multiple aspects of our private and public life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Such technologies have expanded opportunities for freedom of expression and for social, civic and political mobilization, but they also raise important concerns. The availability of personal information in the cyber world, for example, brings up significant issues of [[privacy]] and [[Computer security|security]]. New spaces for communication and socialization are transforming what constitutes the idea of ‘social’ and they require enforceable legal and other safeguards to prevent their overuse, abuse and misuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Digital Invasion: How Technology Is Shaping You and Your Relationships|last=Hart|first=A.D.|last2=Hart|first2=Frejd S.|publisher=Baker Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such misuse of the internet, mobile technology and [[social media]] range from cyber-bullying to criminal activity, even to terrorism.

==Education and technology in developing countries==

[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology Effects on Education ==
An AI-based tutoring system, Education Dominance, was put into an entry-level IT school in Pensacola by the U.S. Navy. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-technology-is-shaping-the-future-of-education-2017-12|title=Here's how technology is shaping the future of education|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system relates to a human tutor in which the student's progress is monitored while providing individual assessments. According to the Navy, the students that worked with the digital tutoring system consistently performed better on the tests than did the students who did not use the digital tutor. The adaptive technology appears to affect students positively because it can assist individuals that have different learning skills than others and therefor better equipped to learn on their own. Technology programs that are already being used in education fields:  Tablets, such as google chrome book, where students can access a range of google's educational software. DreamBox, Zearn, and ST Math, are math software programs that adapt to students as they learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-technology-is-shaping-the-future-of-education-2017-12|title=Here's how technology is shaping the future of education|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gas Council Engineering Research Station''' was a former engineering [[research institute]] on Tyneside, situated in a distinctively-shaped and listed building, now occupied by the [[North Tyneside|Metropolitan Borough of North Tyneside]]. 

==History==
===Design===
It was designed by Ryder &amp; Yates in 1965, who also designed the [[Television Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Ryder and Yates had formed in 1953 in Newcastle. It was built under the former [[Northumberland County Council]]. The Northern Gas Board had its main headquarters in Killingworth. It was first announced in November 1965. It was built in anticipation of North Sea gas. Killingworth was a north-east new town, known as Killingworth Township. It was planned to open in the summer of 1968. It was built on the site of [[Killingworth Colliery]]. The modernist architecture is developed from [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Berthold Lubetkin]]. 

===Construction===
It was built from 1966-67 on a 10-acre site. An extension was added from 1975-76 to contain a restaurant. 

It was Grade II listed on 27 January 1997 by [[English Heritage]] ([[Historic England]] since 2015).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1259313 Listing at Historic England]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
It is situated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/1831584 Geograph]&lt;/ref&gt; directly between the B1505 to east and the [[East Coast Main Line]] (ECML) to the west, in the west of Killingworth. Nearby to the south was the former distinctively-designed headquarters, Norgas House, of the [[Northern Gas Board]], also designed by Ryder &amp; Yates, until North Tyneside agreed its demolition in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/norgas-house-killingworth-set-demolished-1372524 Norgas House demolition 2012 Evening Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Block A housed the Engineering Research Station and Block B housed the School of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://northtyneside-consult.limehouse.co.uk/portal/lp_draft_15?pointId=1392895878394 North Tyneside Enhancing the Built Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
It housed the main research function of British Gas, where the [[National Transmission System]] (NTS) was designed. The research centre's first function was to design the pipeline system around the UK. It researched [[metallurgy]] and pipelines, and avoiding any cracks in the UK's pipelines.

British Gas left the site in 1995 and North Tyneside Council moved in. In 2008, North Tyneside moved most of its functions to Cobalt Park on the [[A19 road|A19]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1912">The '''Gentile Reform''' of 1923 was a reform of the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Education in Italy|educational system]] through a series of normative acts (royal legislative decrees of 31 December 1922, n. 1679, 16 July 1923, n. 1753, 6 May 1923, n. 1054, 30 September 1923, n. 2102 and 1 October 1923, n. 2185), by the neo-idealist philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]], minister of education in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s first cabinet.  It officially recognized 21 universities in Italy.

==Results==
{{Expand section|date=April 2009}}
*The compulsory age of education was raised to 10 years (only elementary education), and was somewhat based on a ladder system: after the first five years of primary instruction, one could choose the ''scuola media'', which would give further access to the "liceo" and other secondary instruction, or the ''avviamento al lavoro'', which was intended to give a quick entry into the low strata of the workforce.
*Gentile created the ''[[liceo classico]]'' (intended to be the peak of secondary education, with the goal of forming the future upper classes{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}), the only secondary school that gave access to all types of university.  Gentile also created technical, commercial and industrial institutes.
*Instruction in languages other than Italian was abolished, which affected mainly the German language schools in [[South Tyrol]], and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Croatian language]] schools in the [[Julian March]].

'''GlobalScholar''' was an operating unit of [[Scantron Corporation|Scantron]] based in [[Bellevue, Washington]] that developed, manufactured, licensed, and supported a wide range of products and services related to [[education]]. This included products such as an [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software solution, Pinnacle Suite, which supported all aspects of managing education at K-12 schools, including a gradebook, [[learning management system]] (LMS), and teacher development, analytics and online learning.

'''GlobalScholar.com''' was the company's on-demand [[collaboration platform]] for [[tutor]]s, [[parent]]s, and [[student]]s. Parents and students could find pre-screened tutors on a variety of subjects and school levels, and pay for one-time homework help or engage in ongoing tutoring sessions. The sessions occurred on GlobalScholar’s website, which provides an [[online]] [[whiteboard]], audio/video [[Instant messaging|IM]], [[archiving]], and [[Bill (payment)|billing]].&lt;ref name=leader&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/30/globalscholar-raises-27-million-b-round-to-tackle-online-education/ GlobalScholar Raises $27 Million B Round To Tackle Online Education] By Erick Schonfeld in ''TechChrunch''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/130764.asp "GlobalScholar.com lands $27 million, buys Excelsior"]  '' [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]].''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiainteracts.com/videos/2008/04/04/Business-Bytes-Globalscholarcom-Part-1/ Business Bytes] in ''IndiaInteracts''&lt;/ref&gt;

GlobalScholar also operated two other websites, launched in January 2008. SchoolFinder pulled together relevant information for elementary and [[high schools]] and let parents compare one school against another. CollegeFinder did the same for colleges, pulling in rankings from [[U.S. News]] &amp; World Report and the [[Princeton Review]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/30/globalscholar-raises-27-million-b-round-to-tackle-online-education/ "GlobalScholar Raises $27 Million B Round To Tackle Online Education"] ''TechCrunch''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GlobalScholar, formally known as InfiLearn, was founded in December 2006 by Kal Raman, a former [[drugstore.com]] chief executive and [[Amazon.com]] senior vice president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://living.oneindia.in/celebrity/celebrity-interviews/2008/kal-raman-interview-080408.html The New Awakening In Modern India: Interview With Kal Raman] By Dhanyasree M in ''[[OneIndia]].''&lt;/ref&gt; 

GlobalScholar.com acquired Central Data Corporation's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-data.com] Central Data Corporation's&lt;/ref&gt; adaptable learning and educational scaffold assets along with the GlobalScholar name in 2007, using these as the baseline for the initial InfilLearn product.  GlobalScholar.com made a strategic decision on January 31, 2008, to acquire Excelsior Software to expand the solutions it offered school districts and in order to offer Excelsior’s many loyal customers an even broader collection of educational services, leveraging the patented scaffolding structures developed by Central Data Corporation.

In October 2013, Scantron formally retired the GlobalScholar brand and stopped development and support on several products.

==Funding==
The company secured $27 million in round B funding on January 31, 2008 from existing investors Ignition Partners and Knowledge Universe Education. This was on top of a previously undisclosed $15.5 Million of Round A funding the company raised early 2007. The funding included additional investments from Knowledge Universe Education, a leading global education company; Ignition Partners, a premier [[venture capital]] firm; and an added investment from Peter Neupert, an existing board member;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004157366_bizbriefs01.html "InfiLearn changes name, launches tutors"] '' Seattle Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/brierdudley/2007/12/13/ "Kal Raman's learning startup stepping out"] ''Seattle Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Excelsior Software, with long-standing relationships in the education community, was also acquired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2008/02/04/story3.html "GlobalScholar's acquisition of Excelsior opens door to new markets"] ''[[Puget Sound Business Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/39477 GlobalScholar.com lands $27 Mn, buys Excelsior] on SiliconIndia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">'''Hermann Haken''' (born July 12, 1927 in [[Leipzig]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]) is [[physicist]] and [[professor emeritus]] in [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Stuttgart]].  He is known as the founder of [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]]. He is a cousin of the mathematician [[Wolfgang Haken]], who proved the [[Four color theorem]].

[[File:Hermann Haken, Pour le Merite 2014.jpg|thumb|Hermann Haken]]

==Biography==
After his studies in mathematics and physics in [[Halle (Saale)]] and [[Erlangen]], receiving his [[Ph.D.]] in [[mathematics]] in 1951 at the [[University of Erlangen]]&lt;ref&gt;His thesis was supervised by [[Wilhelm Specht]] and titled ''Zum Identitätsproblem bei Gruppen''.&lt;/ref&gt; and being guest lecturer at universities in the [[UK]] and [[United States|U.S.]], Haken was appointed as a full professor in theoretical physics at the University of Stuttgart. His research has been in [[non linear optics]] (his specialities are [[laser physics]], [[particle physics]], [[statistical physics]] and [[group theory]]).

Haken developed his institute in a relatively short time to be an international centre for laser theory, starting in 1960 when [[Theodore Maiman]] built the first experimental laser. The interpretation of the laser principles as [[self-organization]] of [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non equilibrium systems]] paved the way at the end of the 1960s to the development of [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]], of which Haken is recognized as the founder. 
Haken is the author of some 23 textbooks and monographs that cover an impressive number of topics from laser physics, atomic physics, quantum field theory, to synergetics.  Although Haken's early books tend to be rather mathematical, at least one of his books ''Light''&lt;ref&gt;H. Haken, ''Light: Waves, Photons, and Atoms'' (North Holland, Amsterdam, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; is nicely written, for the more general reader, and loaded with physical insights. One of his successful popular books is "Erfolgsgeheimnis der Natur",&lt;ref&gt;H. Haken, Erfolgsgeheimnis der Natur (Ullstein, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; or in English, "The Science of Structure: Synergetics".&lt;ref&gt;H.Haken,The Science of Structure: Synergetics, (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

For his wide range of contributions, he received many international prizes or medals, including the Max Born Prize and Medal by the British Institute of Physics and the German Physical Society in 1976, [[Albert A. Michelson Medal]] of the [[Franklin Institute]], Philadelphia, 1981,&lt;ref name="MichelsonMedal_Laureates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&amp;ln=&amp;fn=&amp;keyword=&amp;subject=&amp;award=MICH+&amp;sy=1967&amp;ey=1997&amp;name=Submit |title=Franklin Laureate Database - Albert A.

A '''high school diploma''' is a North American academic [[school leaving qualification]] awarded upon [[high school]] graduation. The high school diploma is typically studied for over the course of four years, from Grade 9 to Grade 12. The diploma is typically awarded by the school in accordance with the requirements of the local state or provincial government. Requirements for earning the diploma vary by jurisdiction, and there may be different requirements for different streams or levels of high school graduation. Typically they include a combination of selected coursework meeting specified criteria for a particular stream and acceptable passing grades earned on the state [[exit examination]].

==Diplomas in specific jurisdictions==

===Canada===

====British Columbia====
In [[British Columbia]], the  diploma is known as the British Columbia Certificate of Graduation. The province of BC has two distinct graduation programs:  the BC Certificate of Graduation (Dogwood Diploma) and the BC Adult Graduation Diploma (Adult Dogwood).  Students also have the opportunity to meet their educational goals (other than graduation) through the BC School Completion Certificate (Evergreen Certificate).

The current Dogwood requirements have been in place since July 1, 2004.&lt;ref name="BCed"&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/policy/policies/graduation_req.htm British Columbia Graduation Requirements]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under current regulations, students must earn a minimum of 80 [[Credit (education)|credits]] to graduate, which must include 48 credits for required courses, a minimum of 28 elective credits, and 4 credits for "graduation transitions", a standards-based assessment evaluated by schools under BC Ministry of Education guidelines.&lt;ref name="BCed"/&gt;  Required courses include, among other things, language arts, social studies, mathematics, and science courses in grades 10, 11, and 12.  Part of the evaluation of students includes standardized [[provincial examinations]] in a number of the required courses in grades 10 and 12.  As part of the 80 credits for the Dogwood, 16 credits must be at the Grade 12 level, and must include English 12 or Communications 12.

====Ontario====
{{main|Ontario Secondary School Diploma}}

In [[Ontario]], the high school diploma is known as the [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma]]. The diploma is awarded to all students who complete the Ontario educational curriculum. The requirements for the diploma include compulsory credits in English or French, Mathematics, Science, Canadian History, Canadian  Geography, Arts, Health and Physical Education, and a second language; compulsory half credits in Career Studies and Civics; one credit each from three elective groups; 12 optional credits, 4 of which may be obtained through dual-credit classes; 40 hours of community service; and the [[Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test]]. Those who leave school after completing 14 credits but prior to obtaining the diploma can obtain the [[Ontario Secondary School Certificate]].

====Quebec====
[[Quebec]] issued the '''D.E.S.''' ({{Lang-fr|links=no|diplôme des études secondaires}}), formerly Quebec Certificate of Education (and sometimes were known Quebec HS Secondary Certificate and Québécois baccalaureat) before it changed into HS Diploma/{{lang|fr|Diplôme D.E.S.}} at the end of secondary&amp;nbsp;V (grade 11), for graduation from secondary school (high school), a five-year school spanning secondary&amp;nbsp;I (grade 7) to secondary&amp;nbsp;V (grade 11).

====Saskatchewan====

To earn a high school diploma, Saskatchewan students are required to earn a total of 24 credits from grades 10 to 12.  For a regular English program diploma, they must earn 5 credits in English Language Arts, 3 credits in Social Studies, 2 credits in mathematics, 2 credits in science, 1 credit in Physical Education/Health Education, 2 credits in Arts Education/Practical and Applied Arts, and 9 elective credits.

===United States=== 
{{Education in the U.S.}}
A United States high school diploma usually refers to the satisfactory completion of grade schooling including kindergarten through the 12th grade and is then issued by the school district and the high school after a student's graduation.

====Alabama====

In [[Alabama]], all students are required to earn 24 credits. The required credits are: English (4 credits), Math (4 credits), Science (4 credits), History (4 credits), PE/JROTC (1 credit), Health (0.5 credits), Career Prep (1 credit), CTE/arts education/Foreign language (3 credits), and Electives (2.5 credits).

County schools offer Honors, and AP classes.

====California====
In [[California]], students are required to take, and successfully complete the following minimum requirements to earn a high school diploma:
3 years of English,
2 years of Math including Algebra I,
3 years of History/Social Studies including one year of U.S. history and geography; one year of world history, culture, and geography; one semester of American government and civics, and one semester of economics,
2 years of science including biological and physical sciences,
1 year of either visual and performing arts, foreign language, or career technical education,
2 years of Physical Education,
and Beginning in 2005–06, all students must pass the California High School Exit Examination prior to graduation, which is normally first administered in the 10th grade. Most schools' individual graduation requirements far outweigh the state's minimum standards. The California exit exam was suspended until 2018.

This information is taken from the California Department of Education.&lt;ref name="CAGradReq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/gs/hs/hsgrtable.asp|title= California Department of Education Graduation Requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Illinois====
In [[Illinois]], students are required to take [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[social science]], [[world language]], [[fine arts]], [[physical education]], and elective classes meeting selected criteria as part of the program of study for the High School Diploma. Electives may include advanced courses, [[Vocational education|career and technical education]] (CTE), [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (JROTC), dual-enrollment, or additional classes in the required subjects that meet school board requirements. [[Driver's Education]] is required for all students.&lt;ref name="ISBOEGradReq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isbe.net/news/pdf/grad_require.pdf |title= Illinois State Board of Education State Graduation Requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CPSHSReq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/PromotionPolicy/HSGraduationReq_English.pdf |title=2013-2014 High School Graduation Requirements |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009211714/http://cps.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/PromotionPolicy/HSGraduationReq_English.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional requirement is a passing grade on the [[Prairie State Achievement Examination]] which is typically taken in Grade 11.&lt;ref name="PSAE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbe.net/assessment/psae.htm |title=Student Assessment Prairie State Achievement Examination (PSAE) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301214413/http://www.isbe.net/assessment/psae.htm |archivedate=2014-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accommodations are made for select students with unique needs. [[English Language Learner]] (ELL) students may substitute [[English as a Second Language]] for [[English studies|English]] to meet the graduation requirements. Students receiving [[special education]] services may complete modified requirements according to an [[Individualized Education Plan]] (IEP).

====New York====
In [[New York (state)|New York]] State, the high school diploma awarded is known as the Regents Diploma, which is earned upon successful completion of the [[Regents Exams]] in the required subjects.&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hesc.ny.gov/content.nsf/SFC/Regents_Requirements |title=Regents Requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two levels are offered: the standard Regents Diploma and the Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation.&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"/&gt; Both diplomas require 22 credits, including 4 credits in English, 4 credits in Social Studies, 3 credits in Math, 3 credits in Science, 0.5 credits in Health, 1 credit in Art or Music, and 2 credits in Physical Education; the Regents Diploma requires 1 credit of Secondary Language and 3.5 credits in Sequence Courses or Electives, while the Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation requires 3 credits of Secondary Language and 1.5 credits in Sequence Courses or Electives.&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"/&gt;

The subjects for which passing grades on the Regents Exams are required for the Regents Diploma include Comprehensive English, any one Mathematics, Global History, US History, any one Science, and Language Other Than English (LOTE).&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"/&gt; The subjects for which passing grades on the Regents Exams are required for the Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation are Comprehensive English, all three Mathematics, Global History, US History, one physical Science, one life Science, and Language Other Than English (LOTE).&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"/&gt; A passing score is 65 in each subject; the "With Honors" designation is added if the average score in all required exams is 90 or greater.&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"/&gt; A "Technical Endorsement" is given to students enrolled in a [[Vocational education|Career and Technical Education]] (CTE) program who additionally complete an approved technical assessment, a work-based learning experience, and a work-skills employability profile. 
Students are also able to receive a Mastery in Mathematics and Mastery in Science designation on their diploma alongside others.

The New York State Regents Diploma, with or without advanced designation, honors, or mastery, is the most heavily weighed and usually most influential high school diploma offered in the country.{{cn|date=November 2018}} A Regents diploma is often referred to as the most difficult and challenging diploma to obtain.{{cn|date=November 2018}} The highest level of a New York State Regents diploma is with Honors, Advanced Designation, Mastery of Science, Mastery of Mathematics, with a Technical Endorsement.&lt;ref name="HESCRegentsReqs"/&gt;

====Texas====
In [[Texas]], there are three programs offered for graduation: the Minimum High School Program (MHSP), the Recommended High School Program (RHSP), and the Advanced (Distinguished) High School Program (AHSP/DHSP).&lt;ref name="TEAHSP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/graduation.aspx |title=State Graduation Requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Recommended and Distinguished programs are the streams typically chosen by most students, and are expected of students who are college-bound. Also required for graduation is successful completion with passing grades on the Exit Level examination of the [[State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness]] (STAAR), which is typically taken in Grade 11. Multiple re-sits for the exam are available, in case of failure on a previous attempt.

Students in the Recommended and Distinguished programs must take four years of [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[social studies]] classes as part of their program of study.&lt;ref name="DNewsVariedReqs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20100829-Varied-requirements-mean-Texas-high-112.ece |title=Varied requirements mean Texas' high school diplomas aren't one-size-fits-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the Distinguished program must also take a minimum amount of advanced-level coursework, which could include [[Advanced Placement]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] classes or university classes taken as dual-enrollment. Students in the Minimum program have less stringent requirements to complete their diploma than students in the other diploma programs.

By Texas state law, completion of the Recommended or Distinguished programs or a program with an equivalent curriculum and level of rigor, along with suitable scores on the [[SAT]] or the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], is required for a student to be eligible to be considered for admission to a four-year public institution of [[higher education]] in Texas.&lt;ref name="TxStateRDP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admissions.txstate.edu/future/freshman/hs-plan.html |title=Texas Recommended and Distinguished Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===General Education Development (GED)===
{{main|General Education Development}}

The General Education Development (GED) credential is offered as an alternative qualification for those who did not successfully earn a high school diploma. Examination involves taking and passing tests in five subjects: Reading, Writing, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. A Certificate of High School Equivalency is generally offered to those who successfully complete the GED. While the GED itself may not necessarily enable the same higher education and employment opportunities as the high school diploma, the GED can enhance employability prospects for former high school dropouts, and progression is available to [[Higher education in the United States|tertiary study]] at select higher education institutions.

===IB Diploma Programme===
{{main|IB Diploma Programme}}

[[IB World School]]s may offer the [[IB Diploma]]&lt;ref name="IBDiploma"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo.org/diploma/ |title=The IB Diploma Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma. The IB Diploma is an academically rigorous program of study. The program of study for the IB Diploma includes subjects chosen from five subject groups: Studies in Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals and Societies, Sciences, Mathematics, and the Arts.&lt;ref name="IBDiploma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBCurriculum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibo.org/diploma/curriculum/ |title=Diploma Programme curriculum framework}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three subjects are taken at Higher Level, and three are taken at Standard Level.&lt;ref name="IBDiploma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBCurriculum" /&gt; Also included is the Diploma Programme Core, which is composed of Extended Essay; Theory of Knowledge; and Creativity, Action, and Service (CAS) components.&lt;ref name="IBDiploma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IBCurriculum" /&gt; The IB Diploma is an internationally recognized academic school-leaving qualification that provides entry to, and in some cases, advanced standing in, university. International Baccalaureate (IB) exams are typically considered equivalent to [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) exams and are at an academic level above the high school diploma, and thus university credit may be awarded for successful completion of IB subjects by American and Canadian universities as well as Universities around the World.

===British qualifications===

====International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE)====
{{main|International General Certificate of Secondary Education}}

[[International school]]s following the [[United Kingdom|British]] Curriculum of [[Education in the United Kingdom|education]] may offer the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (IGCSE) qualification, which is considered to be at the same level, in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma. The IGCSE is the international counterpart to the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) qualification, taken by [[Secondary education in the United Kingdom|secondary school]] students at [[Key Stage 4]] in the United Kingdom. [[Edexcel]] and [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) are examination boards which offer the IGCSE qualification worldwide.

Students generally take five to ten subjects, according to their desired program of study and the offerings available at their school; an IGCSE with eight subjects at grades A*-C is considered equivalent to the full high school diploma. Unlike the high school diploma, which is typically studied for in years 9-12 and awarded in year 12, the IGCSE is typically awarded at year 11, after which the [[GCE Advanced Level|A Levels]] are studied for and awarded.

====Cambridge Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) Diploma====
{{main|Advanced International Certificate of Education}}

Following successful completion of the GCSE or IGCSE, international schools following the British Curriculum may offer the Cambridge [[Advanced International Certificate of Education]] (AICE) Diploma, developed by the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] board.&lt;ref name="AICEDipQual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cie.org.uk/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-advanced/cambridge-aice-diploma/qualification/ |title=Cambridge AICE Diploma Qualification}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Cambridge AICE Diploma program, students take a combination of Cambridge International [[GCE Advanced Subsidiary Level|AS Level]] and [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] subjects, administered by Cambridge International Examinations with at least one subject taken in each of three subject areas: Mathematics and Science, Languages, and Arts and Humanities; subjects from a fourth subject group, Global Perspecties, may also be chosen.&lt;ref name="AICEDipQual" /&gt; Six credits must be earned to achieve the Diploma; an AS Level counts as a full (single) credit, and an A Level counts as a double credit.&lt;ref name="AICEDipQual" /&gt; The Cambridge AICE Diploma would typically be completed by the final year of high school. AS and A Levels are at a higher academic level than the high school diploma, and thus university credit may be awarded for A Levels completed as part of the Cambridge AICE Diploma by [[North American|American and Canadian]] Universities.

====Edexcel International Diploma (ID)====
As an alternative to the Cambridge AICE Diploma, international schools following the British Curriculum may offer the [[Edexcel]] International Diploma (ID), in lieu of or alongside the traditional high school diploma, following successful completion of the GCSE or IGCSE.&lt;ref name="EdexcelID"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edexcel.com/quals/international_diploma/Pages/Components.aspx |title=Edexcel International Diploma Structure and components}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Diploma requires successful completion of three Edexcel [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]]s or three [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] Level 3 Extended Diplomas, along with a Level 3 [[Extended Project Qualification|Extended Project]] (EPQ), a BTEC Level 3 WorkSkills Plus Certificate, and an Edexcel [[GCE Advanced Subsidiary Level|AS Level]] in General Studies.&lt;ref name="EdexcelID" /&gt; This qualification thus allows for a blended mix of academic studies and vocational training, to prepare students for higher education as well as the workplace.&lt;ref name="EdexcelID" /&gt; The Edexcel International Diploma would typically be completed by the final year of high school. AS and A Levels are at a higher academic level than the high school diploma, and thus university credit may be awarded for A Levels completed as part of the International Diploma by [[North American|American and Canadian]] universities .

===French qualifications===

====Baccalauréat (Bac)====
{{main|Baccalauréat}}

[[International school]]s following the [[France|French]] Curriculum of [[Education in France|education]] may offer the [[Baccalauréat]] (Le Bac) in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma. The Baccalauréat is the traditional school-leaving qualification of French schools. The Baccalauréat is offered in several streams; subjects chosen for the Baccalauréat depend on the stream chosen by the student.

====Baccalauréat Franco Américain (BFA)====
Accredited French international schools in the United States may also offer the Baccalauréat Franco Américain (French American Baccalauréat), as an alternative to the traditional Baccalauréat, in lieu of or alongside a traditional high school diploma.&lt;ref name="FABAC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frenchlanguage.frenchculture.org/french-curriculum-schools/french-american-bac |title=French American BAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBFA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frenchschoolsnorthamerica.org/en/welcome-parents/the-french-school-system/french-american-baccalaureate.html |title=Le Baccalauréat Franco-Américain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French American Baccalauréat is offered as a joint initiative of the [[College Board]] and the French [[Ministry of Education (France)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="FABAC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LBFA" /&gt; The curriculum includes [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) subjects and French classes; in lieu of three French classes, students take three corresponding AP classes in the première (year 11) and terminale (year 12) years of high school.&lt;ref name="FABAC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LBFA" /&gt; AP exams are taken in May of year 11 or year 12, and French Baccalauréat exams are taken according to the normal academic calendar.&lt;ref name="FABAC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LBFA" /&gt; Students may elect to take the Baccalauréat Franco Américain in the Literature (L), Economics (ES), and Science (S) courses of study.&lt;ref name="FABAC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LBFA" /&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |title=International Qualifications for entry into ±college or university in 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChavegnesUSInfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |title=Info for US Families |publisher=Chavegnes International College}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[sixth form|college]] and [[university]] admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt;

As the more academically rigorous [[GCE Advanced Level|A Levels]] awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements. Students who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A Level qualifications and earn points on the [[UCAS Tariff]],&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCASTariffTables"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/explore-your-options/entry-requirements/tariff-tables |title=UCAS Tariff Tables}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may opt to take A Level examinations in British [[international school]]s or as private candidates. College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) tests, such as the [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT]], [[SAT Subject Test]]s, or the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], may also be considered.

The [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt; The [[IB Diploma]] may also be accepted. For the College Entrance Examination Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.&lt;ref name="UCASIntQuals" /&gt;

===United States and Canada===
Within the United States and Canada, there is universal recognition of all officially awarded high school diplomas earned in any jurisdiction. Employers, colleges, and universities generally do not distinguish between high school diplomas based on the jurisdiction of awarding, and consider all high school diplomas of the same level to be equivalent. However, where differences in curriculum requirements or levels of academic rigor are made between diplomas issued in a particular jurisdiction, distinctions may be made. Specific requirements for the curriculum content and the level of academic rigor needed for acceptance may be made by those who request a high school diploma.

The '''history of Queen Mary University of London''' lies in the mergers, over the years, of four older colleges: Queen Mary College, [[Westfield College]], [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] and the [[London Hospital Medical College]]. In 1989 Queen Mary merged with Westfield College to form "Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College". Although teaching began at the London Hospital Medical College in 1785, it did not become part of Queen Mary until 1995. In that same year the two medical schools merged to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College.

In 2000, the college adopted the working title of Queen Mary, University of London while retaining the legal name Queen Mary and Westfield College. In 2013 the legal name of the institution was changed to Queen Mary University of London.

==People's Palace==
Queen Mary College was founded in the mid [[Victorian era]] when growing awareness of conditions in London's [[East End]] led to drives to provide facilities for local inhabitants, popularised in the 1882 novel ''All Sorts of Conditions of Men – An Impossible Story'' by [[Walter Besant]], which told of how a rich and clever couple from [[Mayfair]] went to the East End to build a "Palace of Delight, with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, art and designing schools."{{r|mosssaville|p=15-17}} Although not directly responsible for the conception of the People's Palace, the novel did much to popularise it.

The trustees of the Beaumont Trust, administering funds left by [[Barber Beaumont]], purchased the site of the former Bancroft's School from the [[Drapers' Company]]. On 20 May 1885 the Drapers' Court of Assistants resolved to grant £20,000 "for the provision of the technical schools of the People's Palace."{{r|mosssaville|p=21}} The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1886 and on 14 May 1887 [[Queen Victoria]] opened the palace's Queen's Hall as well as laying the foundation stone for the technical schools in the palace's east wing.

The technical schools were opened on 5 October 1888, with the entire palace completed by 1892. When opening them, the Master of the Drapers' Company declared their aims to be "to improve the scientific and technical knowledge of apprentices and workmen engaged in industrial life". However others saw the technical schools as one day becoming a technical university for the East End.{{r|mosssaville|p=37}} The conflicting demands of pleasure and education were identified by the Assistant Charity Commissioner as early as 1891 and for the next forty years this was to dog the People's Palace. In 1892 the Drapers' Company provided £7,000 a year for ten years to guarantee the educational side income.

==East London College==
===Expansion===
[[Image:Batl-chs01.jpg|thumb|right|Part of the Charterhouse Square site]]
The classes reached a peak of 8000 tickets in 1892–1893 but fell to less than half for the following year, due to competition from the London School Board, despite the Palace's classes being more advanced. With the level of teaching growing, in 1895 [[John Leigh Smeathman Hatton]], Director of Evening Classes (1892–1896; later Director of Studies 1896–1908 and Principal 1908–1933) proposed introducing a course of study leading to the Bachelor of Science degree of the [[University of London]]. By the start of the 20th century the first degrees were awarded and Hatton, along with several other Professors, were recognised as Teachers of the University of London. In 1906 an application for Parliamentary funds "for the aid of Educational Institutions engaged in work of a University nature", led to the College being told it was "of the highest importance that there should be a School of the University in the faculties of Arts, Science and Engineering within easy reach of the very large population of the East End of London." The educational part of the People's Palace was admitted on an initial three-year trial basis as a School of the University of London on 15 May 1907 as '''East London College'''.

===Aeronautics===
[[Image:QMUL-Wind-Tunnel-1909.jpg|thumb|left|The ground-breaking wind tunnel built in the first ever Aeronautical department in the UK.]]Teaching of aeronautical engineering began in 1907 which led to the first UK aeronautical engineering department being established in 1909 which boasted a ground-breaking [[wind tunnel]]. Thus creating the oldest Aeronautical Programme in the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aerospace Engineering Undergraduate Admissions|url=http://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/ugadmissions/programmes/?aerospaceengineering|accessdate=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A. P. Thurston, a former student at the College gaining a first class degree in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in 1906, was encouraged and financially supported by P. Y. Alexander, a wealthy aeronautical enthusiast and acquaintance, and J. L. Hatton, the then Principal, to start regular courses of lectures in aeronautics.&lt;ref name=thurston&gt;{{cite web|title=100 years of aeronautics at Queen Mary|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/qmul/news/newsrelease.php?news_id=687|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319223117/http://www.qmul.ac.uk/qmul/news/newsrelease.php?news_id=687|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronology&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Queen Mary College|url=http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/archives/chronology/queen%20mary%20college|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013205758/http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/archives/chronology/queen%20mary%20college|archivedate=13 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thurston gradually brought in more and more skilled aeronautical engineers, and with the newly built laboratory, started giving lectures in aeronautics ("Flying machines", "Balloons, airships and kites", "The mechanical principles of flight")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A P Thurston's Special Lectures on Aeronautics, 1909|url=http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/node/1569|accessdate=11 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212456/http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/node/1569|archive-date=2014-03-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started extensive research on fundamental matters such as the characteristics of wing sections and propellers, structural and material characteristics, and the forces on struts, leading to use in military aircraft for the First World War.&lt;ref name="chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thurston's DH4 Tests|url=http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/node/1574|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312212434/http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/node/1574|archivedate=12 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1910 to 1934===
In 1910 the College's status in the University of London was extended for a further five years, with unlimited membership achieved in May 1915. During this period the organisation of the governors of the People's Palace was rearranged, creating the separate People's Palace Committee and East London College Committee, both under the Palace Governors, as a sign of the growing separation of the two concepts within a single complex.{{r|mosssaville|p=39–48}}

During the First World War the College admitted students from the [[London Hospital Medical College]] who were preparing for the preliminary medical examination, the first step in a long process that would eventually bring the two institutions together. After the war, the College grew, albeit constrained by the rest of the People's Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east. In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the [[Board of Education]]. In April 1929 the College Council decided it would take the steps towards applying to the [[Privy Council]] for a [[Royal Charter]], but on the advice of the Drapers' Company first devised a scheme for development and expansion, which recommended amongst other things to reamalgamate the People's Palace and the College, with guaranteed provision of the Queen's Hall for recreational purposes, offering at least freedom of governance if not in space.{{r|mosssaville|p=49–57}}

==Queen Mary College==
===Granting of the royal charter===
In the early hours of 25 February 1931 a fire destroyed the Queen's Hall, though both the College and the winter gardens escaped. In the coming days discussions on reconstruction led to the proposal that the entire site be transferred to the College which would then apply for a Charter alone. The Drapers' Company obtained St Helen's Terrace, a row of six houses neighbouring the site, and in July 1931 it was agreed to give these over to the People's Palace for a new site adjacent to the old, which would now become entirely the domain of the College. Separation was now achieved. The Charter was now pursued, but the Academic Board asked for a name change, feeling that "east London" carried unfortunate associations that would hinder the College and its graduates. With the initial proposed name, "Queen's College", having already been taken by [[The Queen's College, Oxford|another institution]] and "Victoria College" felt to be unoriginal, "Queen Mary College" was settled on. The Charter of Incorporation was presented on 12 December 1934 by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] herself.{{r|mosssaville|p=57–62}}

===Second World War and Post War period===
[[File:Queens' Building (2899476115).jpg|thumb|The Queens' Building]]
During the Second World War the College was evacuated to [[Cambridge]], where it shared with [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]]. Meanwhile, the Mile End site was requisitioned for war work and was for a time used as the Municipal Offices of Stepney Borough Council. After the war the College returned to London, facing many of the same problems but with prospects for westward expansion.{{r|mosssaville|p=75–85}}

The East End had suffered considerable bomb damage (although the College itself had incurred little) and consequently several areas of land near to the College site now became vacant. The former church of St Benets' to the immediate east of the College was now defunct and was demolished in 1950, with the space used to build a new block for [[physics]], but most of the acquisitions in the immediate post war years were to the west of the college. Even the new People's Palace was no longer able to meet its needs and it was acquired by the College along with several pieces of land that together formed a significant continuous stretch along the [[Mile End Road]]. New buildings for engineering, biology and chemistry were built on the new sites, whilst the arts took over the space vacated in the original building, now renamed the Queens' Building (to reflect the support and patronage of both Queen Mary and [[Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother]]).

Limited accommodation resulted in the acquisition of further land in [[South Woodford]] (now directly connected to [[Mile End tube station]] by means of the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]'s eastward extension), upon which tower blocks were established. Consequently, student numbers continued to expand. The College also obtained the Co-operative Wholesale Society's clothing factory on the Mile End Road which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Laws (and some other teaching), as well as the former headquarters of [[Spratt's]] Patent Ltd&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/spratt-s|title=Spratt's|work=London Remembers|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (operators of the "largest dog biscuit factory in the world" – see [[Spratt's Complex]]) at 41–47 Bow Road, which was converted into a building for the Faculty of Economics founded by [[Maurice Peston, Baron Peston]]. Both faculties were physically separated from what was now a campus to the west.{{r|mosssaville|p=86–102}}

From the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s the College was in a period of uncertainty and flux. Much planning was dominated by the "BLQ scheme" which proposed to link Queen Mary College with the [[London Hospital Medical College]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] with a joint facility in Mile End, but the land was not yet available. Over the period land that came onto the market was purchased with the intention to consolidate as soon as possible. The Queen Mary College Act 1973 was passed "to authorise the disposal of the Nuevo burial ground in the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and to authorise the use for other purposes thereof..." and gave the authority to disinter and reinter most of the graves to [[Dytchleys]]. A further link with both The London and St. Bartholomew's was made in 1974 when an anonymous donor provided for the establishment of a further hall of residence in Woodford, to be divided equally between Queen Mary College students and the two medical colleges.{{r|mosssaville|p=103–117}}

===Nuclear reactor===
[[Image:QMUL-Nuclear-Reactor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Queen Mary was home to a [[nuclear reactor]] from 1964 to 1982.]]
From 1964 until 1982 QMC maintained a nuclear reactor, the first to be built for a UK university. A reactor was commissioned on the Mile End site beneath [[Mile End Road]] and operated from around 1964 to 1966 at around 1 [[kW]]. This reactor was the brainchild of the first Professor of Nuclear Engineering, [[Walter Murgatroyd]], and was managed by John Shaw. The reactor was purchased from [[de Havilland]]. In 1966 it was decommissioned and a new 100&amp;nbsp;kW reactor was built at the new QMC Nucleonics Laboratory in Marshgate Lane, [[Stratford, London]], upgraded in 1968, and decommissioned in 1982, with the site licence surrendered in November 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/releases/queenmary230906.htm|title=Information released regarding to the decommissioning report for the nuclear research reactor at Queen Mary College in London|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/releases/queenmary230906c.pdf|title=HSE document – Final report on decommissioning and delicensing of Queen Mary College Research Reactor dated 7 March 1984|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marshgate Lane site became part of the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] from 2006; in response to safety concerns about the former purpose of the site, a [[Greenpeace]] spokesman was quoted as saying "In our view there's nothing to worry about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Pallister |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/16/olympics2012.olympicgames |title=Reactor on Olympic site no cause for alarm  |work=The Guardian |date= 16 July 2005|accessdate=13 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980 to 1989===
At the start of the 1980s changing demographics and finances caused much concern through the university sector and led to a reorganisation of the [[University of London]]. At Queen Mary some subjects, such as Russian and [[Classics]] were discontinued, whilst the College became one of five in the University with a concentration of laboratory sciences, including the transfer of science departments from [[Westfield College]], [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology|Chelsea College]], [[Queen Elizabeth College]] and [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College]].{{r|mosssaville|p=117–130}}

From the mid-1980s onwards the College began expanding across the newly acquired land to the east, taking the campus to the [[Regent's Canal]]. A part of the burial ground remains to this day but the rest of the area has been absorbed by the College's expansion. The long planned Pre Clinical Medicine building for the BLQ Scheme finally materialised in the late 1980s, further strengthening the ties between the three colleges.{{r|mosssaville|p=131–146}}

==1989 to 2010==
{{further|Westfield College|Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry}}

In 1989 Queen Mary College (informally known as QMC) merged with [[Westfield College]] to form Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College (often abbreviated to QMW). Over subsequent years, activities were concentrated on the Queen Mary site, with the Westfield site eventually sold.

In 1990, the London Hospital was renamed the Royal London Hospital, after marking its 250th year, and a reorganisation of medical education within the University of London resulted in most of the freestanding medical schools being merged with existing large colleges to form multi-faculty institutions. In 1995 the [[London Hospital Medical College]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]] merged into Queen Mary &amp; Westfield College to form the entity now named [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]].&lt;ref name=chronology /&gt;

In 2000 the college changed its name for general public use to Queen Mary, University of London; in 2013, the college legally changed its name to Queen Mary University of London. The [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA telescope]] is a 4-metre class [[Field of view|wide-field]] [[telescope]] at the [[Paranal Observatory]] in Chile that was conceived and developed by Queen Mary University, costing approximately £36m.&lt;ref name=VISTA&gt;{{cite web|title=VISTA telescope|url=http://www.vista.ac.uk/|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Westfield Student Village opened in 2004 on the Mile End Campus, bringing over 2,000 rooms to students and a huge array of facilities, restaurants, and cafes.&lt;ref name=chronology /&gt;&lt;ref name="accommodation landing page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Student accommodation|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/studentlife/accommodation/index.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blizard Building]], home to the Medical School's Institute of Cell and Molecular Science opened at the [[Whitechapel]] campus in 2005. The award-winning building was designed by [[Will Alsop]], and is named after [[William Blizard]], an English surgeon and founder of the [[London Hospital Medical College]] in 1785.&lt;ref name="alsop blizard building"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alsop Design/AMEC Blizard Building|url=http://www.arcspace.com/architects/alsop/blizard/blizard.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science|url=http://www.icms.qmul.ac.uk/|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2006 saw the refurbishment of The Octagon, the original library of the People's Palace dating back to 1888.&lt;ref name="octagon history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of The Octagon|url=http://www.octagon-venue.com/history/index.html|accessdate=13 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003071840/http://www.octagon-venue.com/history/index.html|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 parts of the School of Law – postgraduate facilities and the [[Centre for Commercial Law Studies]] – moved to premises in [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] in central London. The Women at Queen Mary Exhibition was staged in the Octagon, marking 125 years of Westfield College and 120 years of Queen Mary College.&lt;ref name=chronology /&gt;

In September 2009, the world's first science education centre located within a working research laboratory opened at the Blizard Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, hoping to inspire children with school tours and interactive games and puzzles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Education centre opens inside lab|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8235770.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=13 September 2011|date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 to present==
Queen Mary became one of the few university-level institutions to implement a requirement of the A* grade at A-Level after its introduction in 2010 on some of their most popular courses, such as Engineering, Law, and Medicine.&lt;ref name=requirements&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry requirements|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/entry/index.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2012 prospectus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen Maru 2012 Wntry Prospectus|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/docs/prospectus/45481.pdf|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following on from the [[student protests|2010 UK student protests]], Queen Mary set fees of £9,000 per year for September 2012 entry, while also offering bursaries and scholarships.&lt;ref name="2012 fees"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fees and funding for 2012 entry|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/feesandfunding/2012tuitionfees/index.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2012 it was announced that Queen Mary would be joining the [[Russell Group]] in August 2012.&lt;ref name=RussellExpansion&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Group of universities agrees to expand|url=http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/russell-group-latest-news/151-2012/5216-russell-group-of-universities-agrees-to-expand/|publisher=Russell Group|accessdate=12 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314221641/http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/russell-group-latest-news/151-2012/5216-russell-group-of-universities-agrees-to-expand|archivedate=14 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=419394&amp;c=1|title=Russell Group expansion leaves 1994 Group short|accessdate=2 May 2012|work=Times Higher Education|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in March, Queen Mary and the [[University of Warwick]] announced the creation of a strategic partnership, including research collaboration, joint teaching of English, history and computer science undergraduates, and the creation of eight joint post-doctoral research fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/20/warwick-queen-mary-universities-share?newsfeed=true|title=Warwick and Queen Mary universities to share lecturers|accessdate=2 May 2012|work=The Guardian|date=20 March 2012|first=Jessica|last=Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=419394&amp;c=1|title=Warwick and Queen Mary collaborate on teaching and research|accessdate=2 May 2012|work=The Guardian|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Queen Mary established the world's first professorial chair in animal replacement science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=422424&amp;c=1|title=Professorial chair to lead search for animal testing alternatives|accessdate=20 January 2013|work=Times Higher Education|date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014, Queen Mary began awarding its own degrees, rather than those of the University of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Examination Board Briefing|url=http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/examinations/examination_boards/ExaminationBoardBriefing2012-13.ppt|accessdate=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113055311/http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/examinations/examination_boards/ExaminationBoardBriefing2012-13.ppt|archivedate=2013-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homeroom''' or '''advisory''' is the classroom session in which a teacher records attendance and makes announcements. It can also be called '''Registration''' or '''Planning Period'''. The concept is used in schools around the world.

== Asia==

===[[Education_in_Jordan|Jordan]]===
In Jordan, the home room concept (مربي الصف) is widely used in schools. The homeroom teacher is responsible for almost everything concerning their class. At the start of the school year, it's the homeroom teacher's responsibility to make sure that everyone gets their textbooks and materials, which are supplied by the government.

===[[Education_in_Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]===
In Afghanistan, the home room concept (نگران) is widely used in schools. The home room teacher is responsible for almost everything concerning their class. At the start of the school year, it's the homeroom teacher's responsibility to make sure that everyone gets their textbooks and materials, which are supplied by the government. The teacher is also responsible for recording attendance.

===[[Education_in_Bangladesh|Bangladesh]]===
In Bangladesh a homeroom teacher, also referred to as "class teacher", has the duty of taking attendance records of students in a class and making any minor announcements not covered during assembly.

===[[Education_in_China|China]]===
In China, students often do not move between classes for different lessons and have a 10-minute period in which additional home room tasks can be done. Often these tasks include the collection or distribution of homework or the cleaning of the classroom. In competitive schools, the composition of home room classes is sometime based on ability in one or more core subjects. For example, students with a talent for science and math might be grouped together in one home room, while students with more practical or artistic skills would be put together in another. In such cases, the class' home room teacher often specializes in one of the core areas used to select his or her class, in addition to provide both academic and life advises to students. Usually there will also be a student elected by the others as a class monitor to assist their teachers with homeroom tasks and act as intermediate between the teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hsu, Wu|first1=Shihkuan, Yuh-Yin|title=Education as Cultivation in Chinese Culture|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-287-223-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcEUBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===[[Education_in_India|India]]===
In India a homeroom teacher is referred to as a class teacher. A class teacher teaches his or her subject in the homeroom and takes the attendance records of students in a class and makes small announcements regarding trips etc.

===[[Education_in_South_Korea|South Korea]]===
Homeroom hour in Korea takes a significant role in a child's education. Homeroom teachers play many roles; acting as counselors, administrators, and disciplinarians. Homeroom classes in high school are specially important as the students make their transition to college. Homeroom hour starts before 1st period and also after the last period, lasting between 20–30 minutes each time. Teachers use this time to make announcements, discipline students, and take care of other administrative duties. More importantly, teachers take this time to establish order in class. If a teacher is easygoing, the class is likely to be disruptive. Likewise, if the teacher is strict, the class is likely to be orderly. School administrators and staff see the homeroom classes as a reflection of the teachers.  Moreover, if the class has bad test scores, it is subsequently blamed on the teacher. The homeroom teacher is responsible for pushing the students to do their best. Students often see their homeroom teachers as their role models and often visit them in the staff room. It is also common for students to stop by to tease the teacher or ask frivolous questions. In the 12th grade, homeroom teachers especially press on the students to do well on their college entrance exam.  The 12th grade homeroom teacher is considered to be the most important teacher in the student's education. Subsequently, they (12th grade teachers) have a lot of work and are reluctant to take on teaching this grade. After graduating, students often come back and visit their homeroom teachers. It is customary to come with gifts or food.

===[[Education_in_Japan|Japan]]===
Home room in Japanese schools forms a greater part of students' lives, with home room teachers acting as a substitute parent in many ways. Students usually have the same home room teacher and fellow students during their entire life at a given school. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room, including cleaning, day duty (note-taking and classroom organisation), and the organisation of competitive events between home room classes. Students also often eat lunch in their home room. Since teachers must usually travel to the students' home room, rather than students going to a classroom dedicated to a particular subject, the depth of lessons often suffers. Teachers must carry all materials needed for multiple classes, therefore the lessons usually end up taking on a lecture style with students simply taking notes in preparation for testing.

===[[Education_in_Singapore|Singapore]]===
Homeroom periods varies between schools in [[Singapore]]. Usually homeroom periods are used for class contact time and also a time to discuss about what is going on around the school itself or sometimes students go to the hall for briefing before any important events like a marathon or an exam. Most secondary schools call homeroom, contact time period or Form Teacher (FT) period as the term homeroom is rarely used.

==Americas and Oceania==
===[[Education_in_Argentina|Argentina]]===
Home room is a concept that does not exist in Argentinian schools, as a single classroom is often used for all assignments (except for lab work or outdoors exercise).  Students usually stay in groups of 20 to 40 for at least 2 years without being reshuffled and often maintain the same grouping throughout both primary and secondary education, with only the group's room and assigned member of staff changing.
Typically, [[Argentina|Argentine]] schools will have a 15-30 minute '''form period''' in the morning, a one-hour period for lunch, and a similar period after lunch, albeit not all schools are required to have classes in both the morning and the afternoon.  Schools (particularly private ones) will often use classes in the afternoon for secondary languages (English, French, etc.) and sports activities.
Students are usually not given much choice in the subjects they study and they all are subject to most academic subjects.  The main choice a student has to make in entering secondary school is in deciding a high school that leans towards general knowledge ("bachiller", which encompasses arts and a general overview of science), economics ("comercial", whose orientation is towards math, primarily oriented towards accounting and business), engineering ("técnico" whose orientation is towards engineering and sciences) or pedagogical ("normal", whose orientation is forming elementary school teachers).  Each school is given a lot of latitude in terms of extracurricular activities (teaching of secondary languages, sports, etc.).
Argentinian's education is often in flux, as governments every 5 years or so change the curriculum and number of required classes.

===[[Education_in_Australia|Australia]]===
Home room in Australia is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school. Some schools do not have home room at all, and attendance and announcements are made during the first period of the school day in a "student bulletin"{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, while other schools run a home room system which is identical to that run in [[United States|American]] schools.

Alternative names for home room in Australia are "admin" or "administration," "form-class," "form-period," "roll-call" or "DEAR" (drop everything and read).
Most schools, as well as having a form-class, also have an "assembly" which is attended by the entire population of the school. This often entails announcements, advertising for various aspects of school life and listening or singing along with the national anthem.

In many private schools, usually Catholic schools, home room is referred to as "PCG" (pastoral care group) where the teacher is called a "PCA" (pastoral care advisor). As in Romania,  a 'PCA' also performs the role of a counsellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasalle.wa.edu.au/the_college/pastoral_care.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830021618/http://www.lasalle.wa.edu.au/the_college/pastoral_care.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-30 |title=Pastoral Care |publisher=Lasalle.wa.edu.au |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.chisholm.wa.edu.au/general/year-12-pastoral-care-advisors.html |title=Chisholm Catholic College |publisher=.chisholm.wa.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Education_in_Canada|Canada]]===
Home room in Canadian schools follows the US model as well, but the time it occurs differs depending on the school district (and, in many cases, varies by the individual school). Some schools do not have homerooms but the day is broken into 5 periods.

=== [[New Zealand]] ===
Home room (or "form-class") in New Zealand is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school. Mostly used in high schools because classes are taught by different subject teachers. where classmates in the same form class often split up for different subjects. Form classes in the morning combines form period and roll call in the morning, and DEAR (called "SSR", or silent sustained reading) occurs after lunch. Form classes can precede the first period, and after the school assembly.

===[[Education_in_Panama|Panama]]===
Home room in Panamanian schools is similar to the US model. However, it is not an optional period as all students are required to attend home room sessions every Monday morning (in some rare cases, every day). It is called 'Consejería' (Counseling) and takes place every Monday morning as the first period. The teacher fulfills the role of a counselor (consejero) as s/he is in charge of registering attendance, collecting homework and other assignments, and make announcements. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room including cleaning, morning prayer, classroom organization, homework and assignment handling. Home room may also be used for reading and writing after main activities have been fulfilled.

===[[Education_in_the_United_States|United States]]===
In the United States, homeroom is considered a planning period or registration. It is scheduled often at the first period of the day or it may follow the [[lunch]] break. Sometimes it can be at the end of the day after all lessons have finished. In schools where the first period of the day is optional, home room may be deferred to the second period. During homeroom, [[teacher]]s take attendance registers, may collect lunch orders, and carry out other administrative activities. Announcements may be made, correspondence distributed, and the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] said. It may be used for a period of reading, or finishing homework. In some schools, students are permitted to socialize, do group activities, watch [[television news]] or read. The home room teacher is often believed to serve a pastoral role for their students, as well as an educational one. Homerooms are sometimes also considered a free period.{{by whom|date=August 2011}}

==Europe==

===[[Education_in_Austria|Austria]]===
In Austrian education (from lower secondary schools on), each class mostly stays in the same classroom and teachers move between the classes. Each class has a homeroom teacher (named "Klassenvorstand" in Austrian German, "form teacher" in British English). There may be special hours reserved for announcements etc., but  Homeroom teachers perform such activities  either during regular lesson periods, or a so called „Klassenvorstandsstunde“ which could roughly be translated as „form teacher period“, which are mandatory for the students. Additionally the attendance is usually checked at the begin of every period.

===[[Education_in_France|France]]===
The equivalent in France would be the "professeur(e) principal(e)", who teaches the class in a specific subject (as do other teachers) but accepts additional duties such as distributing administrative documents, giving advice on courses to follow, acting as intermediary in cases of conflict, collating other teachers' impressions of the class and of individual students in preparation for the quarterly report, and various other tasks. For this (s)he receives a small salary bonus.

===[[Education_in_Germany|Germany]]===
For Germany basically same is true as for Austria (the teacher is called "Klassenlehrer"). Teachers normally do not receive a salary bonus but are expected to take classes in turn.

===[[Education_in_Romania|Romania]]===
Homeroom is practiced in all educational institutions in Romania under the name of ''Dirigenţie'', which takes its name from the homeroom teacher, called ''Diriginte''. He or she also fulfills the role of a [[School counselor|counselor]].

===[[Education_in_Russia|Russia]]===
Homeroom period in Russian schools is called "klassny chas" (class hour). Students of the same grade ("the parallel") are divided into "classes" - groups of on average 20-30 people; this varies by school and grade. Classes are assigned letters to distinguish between them, for example, 6th grade students may be divided into 5 classes - A, B, C, D, E, and each class gets  a homeroom teacher (klassny rukovoditel). This homeroom teacher schedules the homeroom period approximately once a month and uses it to make announcements and decide various matters by student voting.

===[[Education_in_Spain|Spain]]===
In Spain happens basically the same as in France, there's one main teacher called "tutor". Some schools do have an hour a week of homeroom, being called "tutoría", which is usually placed in High School education.

===[[Education_in_the_United_Kingdom|United Kingdom]]===
Although the term homeroom is not used in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], students are usually assigned to a [[tutor group]] or [[form (education)|form]], with a daily registration period which generally serves the same purpose as a homeroom. The groupings and activities within a tutor group vary between schools and age groups; generally speaking, primary school students remain in their form groups for the majority of the time and there is no clear 'form time'. In secondary school, registration periods (or extensions thereof, such as weekly tutorials) may be the only period a form has with their form tutor - their first point of pastoral contact within a school - and the time is often used for a variety of purposes from administration (taking the register, making announcements, university and career applications) to more general studies such as personal, social and health education.

In Scotland, the use of SEEMIS software to monitor attendance has been trialed, which may lead to more integrated period-by-period registration of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jghs.edin.sch.uk/frontpage/schoolimprovementplan.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331191858/http://www.jghs.edin.sch.uk/frontpage/schoolimprovementplan.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-31 |title=The City of Edinburgh Council |publisher=Jghs.edin.sch.uk |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Education in the Netherlands|The Netherlands]]===
In the Netherlands, the students are put in a group which more or less stays the same during their high school career. Those groups are sorted in levels, depending on a test children take at the end of primary school and their teachers' advice. Those levels determine how long you stay in high school and what kind of school you can attend after high school. Usually, the only reason to switch groups is when you go up a level or drop a level at the end of a year, based on your grades and performance. 
So students always take all classes with the exact same group, have lunch breaks at the same time etcetera.

Each group is assigned a mentor, which is a teacher who teaches a certain subject to multiple groups of all levels. In the mean time, those mentors are responsible for their students well-being, grades and performances, the group dynamics and more. They also are there to advice students regarding choices they have to make like what school to go to next or what career to pick, help them with personal issues and most of them plan a few fun activities or trips during the schoolyear. 
All of this has to happen during the mentor's own class. There is no homeroom. 
Some schools however schedule a mentor class once a week or once a month, and most mentor's make room to talk to each student once or twice in private before or after school.

== History ==

The organization started in 2008 when Salman Khan tutored one of his cousins in mathematics on the Internet using a service called [[Yahoo!]] Doodle Images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9568850/Khan-Academy-The-man-who-wants-to-teach-the-world.html|title=Khan Academy: The man who wants to teach the world|last=de Bertodano|first=Helena|date=2012-09-28|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, Khan's other cousins began to use his tutoring service. Due to the demand, Khan decided to make his videos watchable on the Internet, so he published his content on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Dreifus"&gt;{{Cite news|first = Claudia|last = Dreifus|date = 2014-01-27|title = Salman Khan Turned Family Tutoring Into Khan Academy|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/science/salman-khan-turned-family-tutoring-into-khan-academy.html|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|access-date = 2015-11-07|issn = 0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he used a drawing application called SmoothDraw, and now uses a [[Wacom (company)|Wacom]] tablet to draw using [[ArtRage]]. Tutorials are recorded on the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxJgPHM5NYI&amp;t=62s | publisher = [[CBS News]] | work = [[60 Minutes]] | title = Khan Academy: The future of education? | date=March 11, 2012 |via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Khan Academy has been criticized because its creator Salman Khan lacks a formal background or qualifications in [[pedagogy]], or teaching.&lt;ref name="how-well"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Christopher Danielson |author2=Michael Paul Goldenberg |title=How well does Khan Academy teach?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/how-well-does-khan-academy-teach/2012/07/27/gJQA9bWEAX_blog.html|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2012-07-27|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Does the Khan Academy know how to teach?|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/how-well-does-khan-academy-teach/2012/07/27/gJQA9bWEAX_blog.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2012-07-27|access-date = 2015-11-07|issn = 0190-8286|first = Valerie|last = Strauss}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in several videos have been questioned for their technical accuracy, especially in the area of history.&lt;ref name="using-contractors" /&gt; In response to these criticisms, the organization has corrected errors in its videos, expanded its faculty and formed a network of over 200 content experts.&lt;ref name="using-contractors"&gt;{{cite web|author= Strauss, Valerie|title=Khan Academy using contractors to check Web site’s videos|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/22/khan-academy-using-contractors-to-check-websites-videos/|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2013-10-22|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview from January 2016, Khan defended the value of Khan Academy [[online lecture]]s while acknowledging their limitations: "I think they're valuable, but I'd never say they somehow constitute a complete education."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Khan Academy positions itself as a supplement to in-class learning, with the ability to improve the effectiveness of teachers by freeing them from traditional lectures and giving them more time to tend to individual students' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Khan|first=Sal|publisher=[[TED (conference)]]|title=Let's use video to reinvent education|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education|language=en|accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==

'''Knight-Hennessy Scholars''' is an international graduate-level scholarship program for study at [[Stanford University]]. Established in 2016, the program prepares students to take leadership roles in finding creative solutions to complex [[global issue]]s. Scholars receive full funding to pursue any graduate degree at Stanford and have additional opportunities for leadership training, mentorship, and experiential learning across multiple disciplines.

==History==
On February 22, 2016, Stanford University announced that [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] co-founder and [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] alumnus [[Phil Knight]] had pledged $400 million to Stanford to establish the Knight-Hennessy Scholars program.&lt;ref name="astanley"&gt;Alessandra Stanley, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/business/philip-knight-of-nike-to-give-400-million-to-stanford-scholars.html "Philip Knight of Nike to Give $400 Million to Stanford Scholars,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', February 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sgermano"&gt;Sara Germano, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-founder-phil-knight-donates-400-million-to-stanford-1456324096 "Nike Founder Phil Knight Donates $400 Million to Stanford,"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', February 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest ever one-time donation to Stanford.&lt;ref name="sgermano"/&gt; In total, the program raised a $750 million endowment,&lt;ref name="astanley"/&gt; making it the largest fully endowed scholarship program in the world.&lt;ref name="mgioia"&gt;Michael Gioia, [http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/02/24/stanford-launching-knight-hennessy-scholarship-to-attract-top-graduates/ "Stanford launching Knight-Hennessy scholarship to attract top graduates,"] ''[[Stanford Daily]]'', February 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is named for Phil Knight and [[John L.

==Program==
The Knight-Hennessy Scholars program is inspired by programs such as the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], with a focus on attracting students with a wide range of backgrounds from around the world.&lt;ref name="sgermano"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merrit Kennedy, [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/24/467937476/nike-co-founder-donates-400-million-to-stanford-university "Nike Co-Founder Donates $400 Million To Stanford University,"] [[NPR]], February 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvardmagazine.com/2016/05/brevia "Stanford Stays the Course,"] ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', May–June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their graduate studies, scholars participate in leadership development programs and immersive study trips, and have opportunities for mentorship with thought leaders in business, government and nonprofit fields.&lt;ref name="mgioia"/&gt;

==Selection==
Starting in 2018, the program will annually offer financial support comprising full tuition and fees, room and board, related academic expenses, and a stipend for living expenses.

==Campus==
Scholars will be housed among Stanford's graduate students, approximately 80% of whom live on campus. Stanford is constructing Denning House on the shore of [[Lake Lagunita]]; the on-campus building will serve as the center for the Knight-Hennessy Scholars community.&lt;ref name="mgioia"/&gt; Scholars will gather at Denning House for presentations, workshops and social events. New York architectural firm Ennead designed the two-story building, which will have classrooms, a dining area, and meeting and lecture rooms, as well as office space for a fellow-in-residence and for the program's administrative staff.&lt;ref name="ksullivan083016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ksullivan120616"&gt;Kathleen J.

'''Little Blue Books''' are a series of small staple-bound books published from 1919 through 1978 by the Haldeman-Julius Publishing Company of [[Girard, Kansas]]. They were extremely popular, and achieved a total of 300-500 million booklets sold over the series' lifetime.&lt;ref name="sales"&gt;pg 265 of [[Susan Jacoby]]'s ''Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism'', 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7776-6}}, {{ISBN|0-8050-7776-6}}. Published by [[Henry Holt and Company]]; cover design John Candell&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Big Blue Book]] range was also published.

==Origins==
[[E. Haldeman-Julius|Emanuel Haldeman-Julius]], an atheist-[[Jew]], [[socialist]], and [[newspaper]] publisher, and his wife, [[Anna Marcet Haldeman|Marcet]], set out to publish small low price paperback pocketbooks that were intended to sweep the ranks of the working class as well as the "educated" class. Their goal was to get works of [[literature]], a wide range of ideas, common sense knowledge and various points of view out to as large an audience as possible.  These books, at approximately 3½ by 5&amp;nbsp;inches (8½ by 12¾ cm) easily fit into a working man's back pocket or shirt pocket. The inspiration for the series were cheap 10-cent paperback editions of various expired copyright classic works that Haldeman-Julius had purchased as a 15-year-old (the ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' being especially enthralling). He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was winter, and I was cold, but I sat down on a bench and read that booklet straight through, without a halt, and never did I so much as notice that my hands were blue, that my wet nose was numb, and that my ears felt as hard as glass. Never until then, or since, did any piece of printed matter move me more deeply...I'd been lifted out of this world - and by a 10¢ booklet. I thought, at the moment, how wonderful it would be if thousands of such booklets could be made available.&lt;ref name="quote-1"&gt;pg 28 of ''The World of Haldeman-Julius'', Emanuel Haldeman-Julius, 1960, published in New York; citation and quotation taken from [[Susan Jacoby]]'s ''Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism'', 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7776-6}}, {{ISBN|0-8050-7776-6}}. Published by [[Henry Holt and Company]]; cover design John Candell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1919 they purchased a publishing house in [[Girard, Kansas]] from their employer ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]]'', a socialist weekly which had seen better days and that Haldeman-Julius edited. Though the ''Appeal to Reason'' was not the influential newspaper it had been, its printing presses (and more importantly the 175,000 names on its subscriber lists) would prove to be crucial. Haldeman-Julius, before anything had even been printed, sent an appeal to the ''Appeal to Reason''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s subscribers to send him a prepayment of $5; at 10 cents a pamphlet, he would then send them at staggered intervals 50 pamphlets which he would be able to print with the advanced monies. Things went very well:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Five thousand readers took me up, which meant I had $25,000 to work with. I hurried through the 50 titles (and they were good ones, too, for I haven't believed in trash at any time in my life) and got many letters expressing satisfaction with the venture. Encouraged, I announced a second batch of 50 titles, and called for $5 subscriptions...Meanwhile, the booklets were selling well to readers who hadn't subscribed for batches of 50.&lt;ref name="quote-2"&gt;pg 30 of ''The World of Haldeman-Julius'', Emanuel Haldeman-Julius, 1960, published in New York; citation and quotation taken from [[Susan Jacoby]]'s ''Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism'', 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7776-6}}, {{ISBN|0-8050-7776-6}}. Published by [[Henry Holt and Company]]; cover design John Candell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
In 1919 they began printing these works at a rate of 24,000 a day&lt;ref name="sales"/&gt; in a series called Appeal's Pocket Series on cheap pulp paper, stapled and bound with a red stiff paper cover for 25 cents. The name changed over the first few years (as did the color of the binding), at times known as the People's Pocket Series, the Appeal Pocket Series, the Ten Cent Pocket Series, the Five Cent Pocket Series, and finally the one that took, Little Blue Books in 1923. The price remained at 5-cents a copy for many years.

==Popularity==
In just nine years the idea caught on all around the globe as the Little Blue Books were finding their ways into the pockets of laborers, scholars, and the average citizen. The St. Louis Dispatch called Haldeman-Julius "the [[Henry Ford]] of literature". Among the better known names of the day to support the Little Blue Books were Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] of [[Ethiopia]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]], who took along a set to the [[South Pole]], and [[Franklin P. Adams]] of [[Information, Please!]]

Most were sold by [[mail order]] and promoted through sensationalistic advertisements (e.g. “At last! Books are cheaper than hamburgers!”) in newspapers and magazines such as ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[Popular Science]]'', and ''[[Ladies’ Home Journal]]''. To save ad space, only the book titles were listed, organized by topic headings such as “Philosophy,” “How-To,” or “Sex.” Many classics were cut down to fit the publishing requirements, which Haldeman-Julius justified as "boring text", pioneering the concept later used by ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.  A pioneer in [[guerrilla marketing]], Haldeman-Julius sold his books not only in bookstores but everywhere he could reach the consumer, including drugstores, toy stores, even his own line of vending machines.  Mail-order customers checked-off the titles they wanted and mailed in the order form, with $1 (20 books) being the minimum order.  Many bookstores kept a book rack stocked with many Little Blue Book titles.  Their small size and low price made them especially popular with travelers and transient working people.

If a book sold less than 10,000 copies in one year, Haldeman-Julius would remove it from his line, but usually only after trying a new title, often creating a hit.  For instance, "The Tallow Ball" by Guy de Maupassant sold 15,000 copies one year, but 54,700 the next year after the title was changed to "A French Prostitute's Sacrifice".

Many famous people grew up on Little Blue Books. [[Louis L'Amour]] cites them as a major source of his own early reading in his autobiography ''Education of a Wandering Man''.&lt;ref&gt;See quotation [[E. Haldeman-Julius#Career|here]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers who recall reading the series in their youth include [[Saul Bellow]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Jack Conroy]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Studs Terkel]].

The works covered were frequently classics of [[Western literature]].  [[Goethe]] and Shakespeare were well represented, as were the works of the [[Ancient Greeks]], and more modern writers like [[Voltaire]], [[Émile Zola]], [[H. G. Wells]]. Some of the topics the Little Blue Books covered were on the cutting edge of societal norms. Alongside books on making [[candy]] (#518 - "How to Make All Kinds of Candy" by Helene Paquin)  and classic literature (#246 - [[Hamlet]] by [[William Shakespeare]]) were ones exploring [[homosexuality]] (#692 - "Homo-Sexual Life" by William J Fielding) and [[agnostic]] viewpoints (#1500 - "Why I Am an Agnostic: Including Expressions of Faith from a Protestant a Catholic and a Jew" by [[Clarence Darrow]]).  Shorter works from many popular authors such as [[Jack London]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] were published, as were a number of anti-religious tracts written by [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]], ex-Catholic priest [[Joseph McCabe]], and Haldeman-Julius himself. A young [[Will Durant]] wrote a series of Blue Books on philosophy which were republished in 1926 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] as ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]'', a popular work that remains in print today.

==Decline in popularity==
Demand for existing titles remained steady throughout the [[Great Depression|Depression]] although only about 300 new titles would be released during the 1930s, the bulk appearing prior to 1932.[http://www.haldeman-julius.org/haldeman-julius-resources/authors/]  Following [[World War II]], the [[FBI]] under [[J. Edgar Hoover]] viewed the Little Blue Books' inclusion of such subjects as socialism, atheism, and frank treatment of sexuality as a threat and put Haldeman-Julius on their enemies list, getting him convicted of income tax evasion.  This persecution caused a rapid decline in the number of bookstores carrying the Little Blue Books, and they slowly sank into obscurity by the 1950s, although still well remembered by older people who had read them in the 1920s and 1930s. The Cardinal Francis Spellman FBI file [https://vault.fbi.gov/Cardinal%20Francis%20Spellman] contains clear indications concerning the interest of the FBI on Haldeman-Julius Publications by 1955, after an anonymous letter in late 1954 alerted the government to a book that was under press "vilifying" the Cardinal. Spellman maintained a deep personal friendship with [[J. Edgar Hoover]].

At the time of Emanuel Haldeman-Julius's death on July 31, 1951, the series would support 1873 active titles.[http://www.haldeman-julius.org/haldeman-julius-resources/authors/] The works continued to be reprinted until the Girard printing plant and warehouse was destroyed by fire in 1978 with 1914 total titles published.  In the 1950s the San Diego, California-based atheist-Freethinker publication ''[[The Truth Seeker]]'' bought out most of their supply and raised prices.

Several complete collections are known to exist including one at [[Pittsburg State University]]'s Leonard H Axe Library.

'''Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board''' (MPPEB), popularly known as '''Vyapam''' (व्यापम; an abbreviation of its Hindi name Madhya Pradesh ''Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal'', व्यवसायिक परीक्शा मण्डल), is a professional examination board of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. It conducts various tests for admission to professional courses and streams. It is the largest examination conducting body of Madhya Pradesh and comes directly under the Directorate of Technical Education (Government of Madhya Pradesh). The Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board is a self-financed, autonomous incorporated body of State Govt. The Government has re-constituted the Board of Directors for taking decisions on policy and organizational matters through Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board Act. 2007.

It was in national news for the [[Vyapam Scam|Vyapam scam]], which was a massive admission and recruitment scam involving politicians, senior officials and businessmen. After the scam was unearthed, 2000 people were arrested, including the state's former education minister Laxmikant Sharma and MPPEB's exam controller Pankaj Trivedi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-exam-scam-supreme-court-gives-4-month-extension-to-conclude-investigation-748915 Madhya Pradesh Exam Scam: Supreme Court Gives 4 Month Extension To Conclude Investigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vyapam scam was a massive admission and recruitment scam involving politicians, senior officials and businessmen. Indore Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court served notices to Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) and Medical Council of India (MCI) following a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by parents of some students after reports that more than 300 ineligible candidates managed to get into the merit list. Complaints of irregularities and crooked deals in pre-medical test (PMT) were surfacing since 2009 but in the year 2013, a major scam was unearthed involving several officials and politicians from the state ruling party. The kingpin of the impersonation racket Dr. Jagdish Sagar was arrested and subsequently several other influential people were arrested including ex-Education Minister Laxmikant Sharma, MPPEB’s exam controller Pankaj Trivedi, MPPEB’s system analysts Nitin Mahendra and Ajay Sen and state PMT’s examination in-charge C. K. Mishra. The credit to expose the scam goes to Indore-based medical practitioner Dr. Anand Rai.

==Establishment==

Later, in the year 1981, Pre Engineering Board was constituted. Soon after, in the year 1982 both these Boards were amalgamated and named as Professional Examination Board (P.E.B.).

In 2008 Charlie Bowles hosted the NMCA's summer training intensive in Arlington, TX. His involvement quickly escalated, becoming the Secretary and Treasurer on the NMCA Board. Charlie also acts as the Executive Producer of NMCA programming and was responsible for the creation the current NMCA training format and its sister publications.

'''OSS Watch''' is the [[United Kingdom]]'s advisory service for issues relating to [[free software]] and [[open source software]] based at the [[University of Oxford]].

OSS Watch started as a pilot project funded by [[Jisc]] in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Oxford |url=http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/internal/annrep/annrep0304/index.xml?ID=isg/|title=Oxford University Computing Services Annual Report 2003-4 |publisher=OSS Watch |date= |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has provided consultations and briefing materials about the legal, social, technical and economic aspects of open source software. OSS Watch also organises and attends conferences and workshops relating to free and open source software both within and outside the academic sector.

From 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elena Blanco |url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/ |title=Open source software advisory service |publisher=OSS Watch |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2013, OSS Watch received funding via the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC) to provide support to the [[Further Education]] (FE) and [[Higher Education]] (HE) sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OSS Watch|url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/press/ossw |publisher=OSS Watch|date=2013-02-15 |title=Future Directions}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013, OSS Watch is funded partly from the University of Oxford, and partly from consultancy, training and other services, and is not restricted to supporting education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OSS Watch|url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/about/ |date=2013-03-01 |title=About us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSS Watch is not an [[advocacy group]]. Instead it seeks to provide rounded and unbiased advice and guidance, both for organisations selecting software solutions, and for those creating software.

== Services ==

OSS Watch provides assistance to organisations, communities and projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elena Blanco |url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/about/ |title=About us |publisher=OSS Watch |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; including
* building and engangement with development communities to aid sustainability
* software licence advice, to allow projects
* engaging with commercial companies for software procurement
* commercial exploitation of software outputs
* evalutation of open source or proprietary software solutions

==Open Source Options==
In 2013, OSS Watch began publishing Open Source Options for Education, a list of free and open source software packages that could be used in place of commonly used closed-source solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/ossoptionseducation|title=Open Source Options For Education|author=OSS Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; This built upon the work of the UK Cabinet Office, which released a list for the UK public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/ossoptions|title=Open Source Options: Making Use Of The Cabinet Office Guidance On Open Source Software|author=OSS Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supported projects ==

OSS Watch provides both reactive and proactive support to a wide range of projects. Their mission is to ensure that software developed using public funding is, wherever possible, made available under free and open source licenses. Recent success stories have seen them participate in the creation of [[Opencast Matterhorn]], a worldwide community project building audio and video capture and delivery software, as well as the migration of a W3C Widget standards compliant [[widget engine]] from an EU funded project into the Apache Software Foundations Incubator.

== Publications ==

The organisation also produces a wide range of high quality and regularly reviewed briefing notes on topics relating to open source use, development and adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elena Blanco |url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/ |title=Publications |publisher=OSS Watch |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An index of these documents can be found one the OSS Watch Website. All OSS Watch materials are available for reuse under a creative commons license.

Being a non-advocacy service OSS Watch is uniquely positioned to provide an unbiased opinion on free and open source in general, without the influence of commercial need. For this reason their materials are often regarded as the clearest and most thorough on the subject of Free and Open Source Software since there is little need to "read between the lines" in order to interpret opinion against the potential for a hidden agenda.

== Events ==

In addition to consultations and the production of briefing materials OSS Watch organise a number of education and training events each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Sebastian Rahtz]] |url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/events/ |title=Events |publisher=OSS Watch |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with their publications, OSS Watch are able to use their non-advoacy status to attract speakers from all areas of the computing sphere in order to create extremely well informed events.

Members of OSS Watch also attend events both nationally and internationally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lanyrd.com/profile/osswatch/ |title=OSS Watch's conference talks and presentations |publisher=Lanyrd |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to engange with the wider software and education communities.

== The team ==

The OSS Watch team is made up of a balance of academic and business oriented people with a wide range of backgrounds. Between June 2007 and June 2010 the team was led by [[Ross Gardler]], a recognised open source participant (Ross has served in many roles, including Vice President of Community Development, a member of the Board of Directors at The [[Apache Software Foundation]], President of the ASF and mentor for many other project communities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apache.org/foundation/ |title=Foundation Project |publisher=Apache.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 Ross left to form a spin-out company (and later joined Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc in 2013) and was replaced as OSS Watch manager by Sander van der Waal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osswatch.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2011/06/28/exciting-times-for-oss-watch/ |title=Exciting times for OSS Watch at OSS Watch team blog |publisher=Osswatch.jiscinvolve.org |date=2011-06-28 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Scott Wilson of [[CETIS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jisc.cetis.ac.uk//contact |title=Centre for Educational Technology and Interoperability Standards |publisher=Cetis |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Apache Wookie&lt;ref name="apache1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wookie.apache.org/people.html |title=Apache Wookie - Some of our contributors |publisher=Apache Software Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; project joined OSS Watch replacing Sander as Service Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osswatch.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2012/09/03/scott-wilson-and-mark-johnson-join-the-oss-watch-team/ |title=Scott Wilson and Mark Johnson join the OSS Watch team at OSS Watch team blog |publisher=Osswatch.jiscinvolve.org |date=2012-09-03 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current team features three full-time staff and several other members with a variety of backgrounds from Computer Science to Anthropology.&lt;ref name="apache1"/&gt; The organisation's advisory committee includes representatives from the academic, not-for-profit and business sectors.

This mix of skills and resources allows the team to examine free and open source software from many different angles, including practical, statistical and cultural.

== Work with the University of Oxford ==

Although OSS Watch is a group within the IT Services unit of the University of Oxford (formerly [[Oxford University Computing Services]]), for most of its history it has been funded to operate as a national service rather than to support the University of Oxford. However, one impact of the changes to national funding in 2013 has been that the organisation has focused more of its effort on supporting academic departments and central IT services at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oss-watch.ac.uk/about/university|title=OSS Watch: Our Services For University Of Oxford Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

Being an organisation based in an academic institution and targeting academic developers may be somewhat limiting to for OSS Watch. Although there are many excellent minds in the sector their primary job function is rarely to develop software. As a result, the driving forces behind these individuals may be quite different from those in for-profit organisations. Even where individuals are employed as software developers, in administration and support teams for example, the sector usually sees itself as being unique and therefore with little to share.

Similarly, most academic related software development projects are short lived experimental projects. This often means that they are never intended to be long lived, only to prove or disprove the applicability of an approach. Some people therefore question the value of academically developed software.

Moving from a funded service within the education sector to a self-sustaining model addresses some of these limitations, but will bring other challenges.

== Spin-out company ==

In June 2011 [[Ross Gardler]] and Steve Lee span out a company from OSS Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osswatch.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2011/06/20/all-change-please-situation-normal/ |title=All Change Please (situation normal) at OSS Watch team blog |publisher=Osswatch.jiscinvolve.org |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This company, OpenDirective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendirective.com/ |title=OpenDirective |publisher=OpenDirective |date= |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides very similar services to OSS Watch in both the public and private sectors. This company remains closely connected with the University of Oxford and OSS Watch and seeks to expand the revenue streams available to OSS Watch as well as to provide more proactive support rather than just advice. OpenDirective is providing support to a number of the flagship projects that are of interest to the commercial sector while OSS Watch continues to provide services to those projects that are solely of interest to the academic sector.

'''Paul Harding''' (born 1967) is an American musician and author, best known for his [[debut novel]] ''[[Tinkers (novel)|Tinkers]]'' (2009), which won the [[2010 Pulitzer Prize|2010 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]]&lt;ref name=seacoast&gt;[http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20100711-LIFE-1010927 "From Drum Set to Pulitzer"], SeaCoast Online, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2010 [[PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/pen-american-center-names-award-winners/ PEN American Center Names Award Winners],&lt;/ref&gt; among other honors. Harding was the drummer in the band [[Cold Water Flat]] throughout its existence from 1990 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cold-water-flat-p37984/biography "Cold Water Flat"] at Allmusic.com; and [http://screenwritingfromiowa.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/yawn-another-pulitzer-prize/ "(Yawn)...Another Pulitzer Prize"] at Screenwriting from Iowa. Both retrieved 26 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Paul Harding grew up on the north shore of Boston in the town of [[Wenham, Massachusetts]]. As a youth he spent a lot of time "knocking about in the woods," which he attributes to his love of nature.&lt;ref name="os"&gt;[http://www.radioopensource.org/paul-hardings-magical-tinkers/ Paul Harding’s Magical ‘Tinkers’], audio interview with [[Christopher Lydon]], May 7th, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather fixed clocks and he apprenticed under him, an experience that found its way into his novel ''Tinkers''.&lt;ref name=QianPaulHardingInterview/&gt;  Harding has a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openlooppress.org/interviews/paul-harding/ The Literary Horologist: Paul Harding “Tinkers” With Time], OpenLoopPress interview&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] and has taught writing at [[Harvard University]] and the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name=pp-bio/&gt;

After graduating from the University of Massachusetts, he spent time touring with his band [[Cold Water Flat]] in the US and Europe. He had always been a heavy reader and recalls reading [[Carlos Fuentes]]' ''[[Terra Nostra (novel)|Terra Nostra]]'' and thinking "this is what I want to do". In that book Harding "saw the entire world, all of history". When he next had time off from touring with the band he signed up for a summer writing class at [[Skidmore College]] in New York. His teacher was [[Marilynne Robinson]] and through her he learned about the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] writing program. There he studied with [[Barry Unsworth]], [[Elizabeth McCracken]] and later Robinson. At some point he realized some of the people he admired most were "profoundly religious" and so he spent years reading [[theology]], and was "deeply" influenced by [[Karl Barth]] and [[John Calvin]]. He considers himself a "self-taught modern New England [[transcendentalist]]".&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;

Harding's second novel, ''Enon'' (2013), concerns characters from his first novel, ''Tinkers'', looking at the lives of George Crosby's grandson, Charlie Crosby, and his daughter Kate.&lt;ref name=pp-bio/&gt;

Musically, he admires jazz drummers and considers [[John Coltrane]]'s drummer, [[Elvin Jones]], the greatest.&lt;ref name="os"/&gt;

Harding lives near Boston with his wife and two sons.&lt;ref name="pp-bio"&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/biography/2010-Fiction "2010 Pulitzer Prizes"]. [[The Pulitzer Prizes]]. Retrieved April 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">A '''riding school bus''' is a group of schoolchildren supervised by one or more adults, riding [[bicycle|pedal cycles]] along a set route, picking children up at "bus stops" along the way until they all arrive at school.  Riding school buses are similar to [[walking bus]] programs. Like a traditional bus, riding school buses (also known as RSBs) have a fixed route with designated "bus stops" and "pick up times" in which they pick up children. Ideally the riding school bus will include at least 1 adult ‘driver’, who leads the group, and an adult ‘conductor' who supervises from the end of the group.

Riding school bus programs have been developed in a number of local councils in Victoria, Australia, including [[City of Moreland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelsmart.vic.gov.au/web4/tsmart.nsf/272d1dc784604ec74a2568c50082ce7d/d9f688bb34d5ba2eca2570c300725f1a?OpenDocument&amp;CollapseView TravelSmart - Riding School Bus program in Moreland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Shire of East Gippsland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egipps.vic.gov.au/Page/page.asp?Page_Id=596&amp;h=0 East Gippsland Shire Council - RIDING SCHOOL BUSES BEGIN SERVICE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding school bus programs deliver a number of benefits:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moreland.vic.gov.au/news/mr310706.htm Avoid the schoolyard traffic jam - use the Riding School Bus instead!: Media Release 31 July 2006 - Moreland City Council&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improvement in child fitness and health
*Environmental benefits - reduction in car trips and associated air pollution
*Development of traffic skills and confidence in children
*Socialization and increased community engagement for children
*Reduction of traffic congestion around schools

Riding school buses are also known as '''pedal pods'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bv.com.au/join-in/40463/ Holy Rosary's new Pedal Pod - Bicycle Victoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Cycling School Buses''' &lt;!-- http://www.goforgreen.ca/asrts/tools_e.html#WCSB --&gt;

{{Music education|settings}}
A '''school band''' is a group of [[student]] musicians who rehearse and perform [[instrumental]] [[music]] together. A [[concert band]] is usually under the direction of one or more [[conducting|conductors]] (band directors). A school band consists of [[woodwind instrument]]s, brass instruments and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] instruments, although upper level bands may also have [[string basses]] or [[bass guitar]].

School bands in the [[United Kingdom]] are generally similar to those in the US although pure brass bands are more commonplace in schools than in the US. Some countries usually prefer certain special types of bands, usually drums, over conventional ones. The school band movement in Japan is unusually strong, organized around an enormous competition system administered by the [[All-Japan Band Association]]. Many international observers of Japanese school bands consider them to be the most impressive in the world, particularly among very young students, and Japan is also home to one of the world's leading professional concert bands, the [[Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra]].

==Middle school/Elementary school bands==
[[Image:JapaneseJr.HighBand.jpg|thumb|Junior High School Students band at Demachi Jr. High, Tonami City, Toyama, Japan]]
Although some children learn an instrument prior to entering a [[middle school]] (or junior high), students in [[music education]] programs within the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] generally start daily band classes in the 6th or 7th Grade. Many band programs begin as early as 4th or 5th grade. The students usually make up a band based upon their grade, which may then be broken up into sectionals to provide better instrument-specific instruction. It is sometimes required for beginner students to play a recorder for a year before learning another instrument, so that basics, such as scales, [[embouchure]], etc. can be taught easily.  Other requirements may include learning a piano or guitar to understand basic music theory, notation, etc.

A "beginning" band, consisting of the youngest students in the school, usually gives two or three [[concerts]] a year, and may participate in a local/state contest. These bands are given easy music to learn, often with many duplicate parts and simple [[rhythms]]. Students sometimes may be required to memorize the [[Major Scale|12 major scales]].
Depending upon the size of the school,  there may be one to three "higher level" bands after the beginning band. These bands are usually divided similarly to [[high school]] bands. Some schools require students to audition and be placed in a band according to their ability on their instrument. Others will assign students based on their performance as seen in class. Yet others will simply sort the students according to their age or grade level. Most of these decisions are decided by the conductor.  These higher level bands will occasionally play in high school games and pep rallies to augment the local high school band, although in small schools they always come to these events. Beginning bands usually are used in the spot of an elective.

Instruments typically in beginning bands:

*Woodwind:
**[[Flutes]],
**[[Oboes]], 
**[[Clarinets]],
**Alto, Tenor, and occasionally Baritone [[saxophones]],
**[[Bassoons]]
*Brass:
**[[Tuba]]s,
**[[Trombones]],
**[[Trumpets]],
**[[French Horns]],
**Occasionally [[baritone horn|Baritones]], or [[Euphoniums]]

Some bands will also have a ''percussion kit'', which will allow them to play bells and drums

==High school bands==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - G 14 - Life in Ziguinchor, Senegal - PAIGC boarding school band, Ziguinchor - 1973.tif|thumb|[[PAIGC]] High school band in [[Ziguinchor]], Senegal, 1973]]
High school bands typically challenge students musically more than those in middle school. Music is much more difficult with more complex passages, intricate rhythms and more involved phrasing. Selections also vary in style. A well-rounded band is expected to be able to play a wide variety of music, ranging from serious '[[program music]]' to lighter 'pop-style' music. For many high school students, school bands are the main form of [[music education]] available to them in school. [[March (music)|Marches]] were the first major contributions to the wind band repertoire.  There are many pieces other than marches written for wind band at present, but there are some historical standards that should be included into the repertoire of advanced ensembles.   Some of the most notable of these pieces are [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|First Suite in E-flat]]'' and ''[[Second Suite in F for Military Band|Second Suite in F]]'', and [[Percy Grainger|Grainger's]] ''Children's March'' and ''[[Lincolnshire Posy]]'' among others.

Below is a list of the [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]] in a typical [[concert band]] at the high school level. The number of instruments in each section varies, but listed below are usually the average number of members. Middle school/junior high bands are usually around the upper values for each instrument. Instrumentation in beginner bands is usually much larger than this. College and professional bands generally have smaller numbers of players. These numbers may vary widely, based on the instrument and the people playing them (as many people playing instruments such as trombones may drop out, causing others to change instruments to fill the need).  Some bands have a set number of performers per section while other bands have open unlimited participation.

'''Woodwind'''
*1 or no [[Piccolo|Piccolo in C]]
*8-10 [[Flute]]s
*1-2 [[Oboe]]s
* 1 or no [[Cor anglais|English Horn]]
*1-2 [[Bassoon]]s
*1 or no [[E-flat clarinet|E♭ Clarinet]]
*8-10 [[Soprano clarinet|B♭ Clarinets]]
*1 or no [[Alto clarinet|E♭ Alto Clarinet]]
*1-2  [[Bass clarinet|B♭ Bass Clarinets]]
*1 or no [[Contra-alto clarinet|EE♭ Contra-alto Clarinet]]
*1 or no [[Contrabass clarinet|BB♭ Contrabass Clarinet]]
*1 or no [[Soprano saxophone|B♭ Soprano Saxophone]]
*4-6 [[Alto saxophone|E♭ Alto Saxophones]]
*2-3 [[Tenor saxophone|B♭ Tenor Saxophones]]
*1-2 [[Baritone Saxophone|E♭ Baritone Saxophone]]

'''Brass'''
*8-10 [[Trumpet|B♭ Trumpet]]s
*4-6 [[French horn|Horns in F]]
*3-9 [[Trombone]]s (sometimes including 1 [[Bass Trombone]])
*1-4 [[Baritone horn]]s or [[Euphonium]]s
*1-4 [[Tuba]]s

'''Strings'''
*1 or no [[String Bass]] or [[Bass Guitar|Electric Bass]]

'''Percussion'''
* Percussionists playing:
*[[Snare drum]]
*[[Tom-tom drum|Tom-toms]]
*[[Bass drum]]
*[[Cymbal]]s including [[Crash cymbal|crash]], [[Ride cymbal|ride]], and [[suspended cymbal|suspended]]
*[[Tambourine]]
*2 playing [[Mallet Percussion]], including [[orchestra bells]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]], [[chimes]] and [[vibraphone]]
*1 [[Timpani]]
*1 [[Drum kit]]
*A variety of other auxiliary percussion instruments used on specific pieces, including [[Cabasa]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]], and [[Maraca]]s.

In most middle school bands, strings (besides the string bass) are not used. If they are, the band is generally considered an orchestra.

The first high school band in the United States was the Boston Farm and Trade School Band, founded in 1856.
The oldest high school band in America is [[The Christian Brothers Band (Memphis)]] founded in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Patrick (2009). The Christian Brothers Band, "The Oldest High School Band in America" 1872-1937. Christian Brothers Archives: Master's Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College bands==
Many colleges/universities have band as a class. Some are integrated within a 'Music' course while others are not. They tend to be larger than a high school band and play at a higher level.

==Other school bands==
There are many other school band opportunities for students. Most of these fall under the jurisdiction of the director that teaches the daily band classes, whether or not the smaller groups meet daily or during school hours.

[[Image:TTUband.jpg|thumb|left|[[Texas Tech University Goin' Band from Raiderland|Goin' Band from Raiderland]], a college marching band in the United States]]

===Marching band===
{{Main|Marching band}}
Many schools, especially high schools in the United States, have a [[marching band]]. A school marching band may contain from 11 to over 500 students.  Marching bands often practice frequently during the late summer and early fall and most often attend their school's [[American football|football]] games, playing music in the stands, and marching a show during halftime. A show is usually between 6 and 10 minutes long, but many competitions place restrictions on length. Bands often compete in marching band competitions throughout the marching season (typically the same time as football season). Competitions vary in intensity. Some areas have many smaller, local competitions hosted by individual schools. Others host a regional competition.  Others, such as [[Bands of America]] competitions are nationally known and take place in professional arenas.

In addition to their show, marching bands often march parades. Often this is limited to their city or town's municipal parades, but some bands travel to participate in well known parades, such as the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on New Years Day.

===Jazz band===
{{Main|Jazz band}}
Many schools have jazz programs in addition to their concert program. Different schools have different time slots for their jazz band. Some meet as an actual class during the school day. Others choose to practice after school or before school two or three times a week. Meeting as a class during school can often cause schedule conflicts with students' academic classes.  Many times jazz band may rehearse during the [[study hall]], [[free period]], or part of the  lunch period. Typical instrumentation for jazz ensembles will include trumpets, trombones, alto, tenor and baritone saxophones, a drum set (often called a "trap set",) guitar, bass guitar, piano, clarinet and often, a vibraphone or marimba. Many areas have jazz festivals, but the popularity of these widely vary from different regions of the country. Jazz bands are most often used as an ambassador ensemble for the band program as a whole.  In addition, jazz education is seen as growing in popularity as a specialty area within school music departments. Possibly a person can only be in the jazz band if they are 7th grade or higher.

===Chamber ensembles===
Schools rarely have chamber music ensembles that meet as real classes, usually depending on the region, state and budget. Most of these groups are ''ad hoc'' ensembles put together by the director or the students themselves for a contest or recital. Examples would be clarinet quartets, woodwind quintet, brass quintet, duets, and trios. Groups consisting of the entire woodwind or brass section, or even percussion section of a band are also sometimes formed.

===All-region bands===
Perhaps not associated with the individual school, All-Region bands are audition-only groups for the most advanced players in each school. There are many different "All-Region" bands, ranging from the most local "All-County" or "All-District"(when referring to school districts) to the more prestigious "All-State".  Many states also have a level between County and State bands which varies in name according to the area. These events are often highly enjoyed by the students that attend them. Musical literature is often increased in difficulty for the concerts, providing a challenge that isn't seen at schools. Students also get to meet new players on their instrument and share stories from their own band experiences. Region bands typically last over a weekend, though some may meet for over a week before performing a concert.

Though not associated with All-State, [[Florida]] has a statewide band festival called Festival of Winds, held in [[Tampa]] at [[The University of South Florida]] in the first weekend of December. Also, Florida, [[Alabama]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] have a band festival called Tri-State, held in [[Tallahassee]], Florida at [[Florida State University]] in the same time period as Festival of Winds.

===Modern band===

Modern band &lt;ref&gt;''Modern Band: The Next Step in the Evolution of Music'' from ''School Band and Orchestra'' (March, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  is an instrumental and vocal school music program taught in a growing number of public schools systems in the U.S.  Instrumentation typically includes acoustic guitar, electric guitar, electric bass, keyboard, vocals, computers and percussion instruments. The repertoire of modern band is evolving as it draws from commercially dominant and contemporary music styles of the day such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[disco]], [[reggae]], [[hip-hop]] and more.

Major public school systems that offer Modern Band programming include those in the [[New York City Department of Education]], [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], [[Chicago Public Schools]] and others. Modern band is a new movement in public school music education circles. The term "Modern Band" was coined by a music education non-profit, Little Kids Rock, who partners with school districts from economically challenged communities to expand their music programs.

==Stereotypes and popular culture==

==='Band geek'===
{{redirect2|Band geek|Band geeks|the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode|Band Geeks}}
"Band geek" or "band [[nerd]]" is a [[high school stereotype]] of a person obsessed with playing band music. However, the term usually relates to the belief that most people who are in school bands are socially inept.&lt;ref&gt;Patnaik, G. and Shinseki, M. (2000) ''The Secret Life of Teens: Young People Speak Out About Their Lives.'' HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilsland, B. (2004) ''What It Means To Be In A Marching Band: A Band Geek Perspective For The Musically Challenged.'' Authorhouse.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, A. (2003) ''Lita: A Less Traveled R.O.A.D.--The Reality of Amy Dumas.'' Simon and Schuster. p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes used to describe any student who plays an instrument and is in a band class (including students in the [[String orchestra|orchestra]]).&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, J.L. (2004) ''Taste Berries for Teens #4: Inspirational Short Stories and Encouragement.'' HCI Teens Publishing. p 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willman, C. (2005) ''Rednecks &amp; Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music.'' p 135.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Orch dork" is a variation specifically for members of school [[orchestra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trope, Z. (2003) ''Please Don't Kill the Freshman: A Memoir.'' HarperCollins. p 44.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms have become a label of pride for many band members, being found on T-shirts, bumper stickers, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Gender stereotypes in instrument selection===
In school bands, more girls than boys tend to play most woodwind instruments, especially flute, and more boys than girls tend to play brass instruments, saxophone, and percussion.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  However, this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/articles4/walker/index.htm |title=Influences of Gender and Sex-Stereotyping of Middle School Students' Perception and Selection of Musical Instruments: A Review of the Literature |author=Mark J. Walker |journal=Visions of Research in Music Education |date=January 2004 |volume=4 |accessdate=14 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002080741/http://www-usr.rider.edu/~vrme/articles4/walker/index.htm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stereotypes can be avoided when band directors assess each student for musical capacity, as well as, meet with students individually to analyze their physical characteristics.  For example, petite students would be more successful playing the clarinet over the tuba.  Additionally, the role of gender bias in musical instrument assignment is highly debated in the field of music education.  Some feel that it should be left alone while others want to combat it.  One way band directors can overcome these stereotypes is to have live demonstrations from musicians playing gender atypical instruments (i.e., males playing flute, females playing tuba).&lt;ref&gt;Dale, E. B. (2005). An investigation of the instrument selection processes used by directors of beginning band. Contributions to Music Education, 32(1), 9-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stand for the Second''' was a student-led demonstration in support of the United States [[Second Amendment]] held on May 2, 2018. The demonstration was in response to the [[March for Our Lives]] protest held on March 24, 2018. 

==Background==
Will Riley, an 18 year old high school senior from [[Carlsbad High School (Carlsbad, New Mexico)|Carlsbad High School]] in  [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]], New Mexico, organized the event with the help of the [[Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund]].&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brito|first1=Christopher|title="Stand for the Second": Students hold school walkouts for gun rights|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pro-gun-rights-teen-activists-hold-national-walkout-stand-for-the-second/|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riley stated in the aftermath of the  [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], "I'm watching the news and I see they're saying, 'We have to do something about this. We have to enact some sort of gun control legislation because this is what the kids are asking for.' And I'm thinking, 'I'm not asking for that. I look at my friends and I think 'They're not asking for that.'"&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayes|first1=Christal|title='We are for your rights': Students stage walkouts across U.S. to back Second Amendment|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/02/students-hold-walkouts-support-second-amendment/573420002/|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=USA Today|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riley wrote an op-ed for the ''[[Carlsbad Current-Argus]]'' on April 11, 2018, where he wrote about the walkout to garner interest.&lt;ref name="Coaston"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coaston|first1=Jane|title=Pro-gun rights high school students are staging a walkout of their own|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/5/2/17310996/guns-student-walk-out-high-school-second-amendment|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=Vox|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
The event's website stated "We have not ignored the huge movement of our peers against these fundamental human rights and liberties, but the American people must know not all of our generation shares in the shortsighted destruction of our Constitution."&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Hayley|title=Students Nationwide Walk Out Of Schools To Show Support For Second Amendment Rights|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/students-walkout-gun-rights_us_5ae9fb9be4b022f71a047db3|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=Huffington Post|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The protests started at 10:00AM and lasted for 16 minutes, one minute less than the March for our Lives protest.&lt;ref name="Thomsen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomsen|first1=Jacqueline|title=Hundreds of students walk out of classes in support of gun rights|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/385925-hundreds-of-students-walk-out-of-classes-in-support-of-gun|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=The Hill|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official website listed over 500 schools in 40 states across the U.S. participating in the event, but the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote those numbers could not be independently verified.&lt;ref name="Adelmann"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adelmann|first1=Bob|title=“Stand for the Second” Student Walkout Extends Across the Land|url=https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/28953-stand-for-the-second-student-walkout-extends-across-the-land|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=The New American|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowe"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crowe|first1=Jack|title=‘Stand for the Second’ Students Hold Nationwide Walkout in Support of Gun Rights|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/news/stand-for-the-second-students-hold-nationwide-walkout-in-support-of-gun-rights/|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=National Reivew|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Michael|title=Students stage another walkout over guns — this time in favor|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-student-walkouts-second-amendment20180502-story.html|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Washington Times]]'' reported no celebrities endorsed or attended the event and it received much less media attention.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=Valerie|title=Second Amendment school walkout delivers message with less media, no stars|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/3/second-amendment-school-walkout-delivers-message-l/|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=The Washington Times|date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Kyle Kashuv]], a survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, tweeted "I will not be walking out today. I don't believe it is the correct thing to do.

Riley was commended for the protest by the [[Eddy County, New Mexico|Eddy County]] Sheriff Mark Cage on April 25, 2018. Riley was sworn in as an honorary sheriff's deputy for his efforts.

The '''United Nations Institute for Namibia (UNIN)''' was an educational body set up by the [[United Nations Council for Namibia]] from 1976-1990.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/44/a44r243.htm Dissolution of the United Nations Council for Namibia] Resolution 44/243 of the United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; Based in [[Zambia]]'s capital of [[Lusaka]], UNIN was the brainchild of [[United Nations Commissioner for Namibia]] [[Seán MacBride]], the proposal creating UNIN was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in December 1974.&lt;ref name=Rogerson&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/160803?seq=1 A Future 'University of Namibia'?: The Role of the United Nations Institute for Namibia], by Christian M. Rogerson, 1980, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; The forerunner to the current [[University of Namibia]], UNIN sought to educate Namibians for roles in an independent Republic of Namibia.&lt;ref name="Rogerson"/&gt;

==Background==
As states across Africa achieved independence, Namibia remained illegally ruled by [[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]]. Treated as a fifth province, Namibia did not have its own tertiary educational system. [[Bantu Education Act|Bantu Education]], or purposely inferior education for Black Namibians, was the norm [[education in Namibia]] for Black Namibians. The United Nations Council for Namibia under Seán MacBride put forth a plan in February 1974 for a tertiary educational institution for Namibia in [[Africa]], preferably Zambia.&lt;ref name=Rogerson /&gt; On 26 August 1976 ([[Heroes' Day (Namibia)|Namibian Heroes' Day]]), [[President of Zambia]] [[Kenneth Kaunda]] formally inaugurated the institute in Lusaka.&lt;ref name=Rogerson /&gt;

==Funding==
Funding for UNIN was provided for, on a short term basis, by the [[United Nations Fund for Namibia]], itself funded by individual government donations and private organizations such as the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Rogerson /&gt;

==Since independence==
Closing in September 1990 (6 months after formal independence was achieved), UNIN's files have been transferred to the archival unit at the University of Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.unam.na/libr-archives.html Archives of the University of Namibia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120114437/http://library.unam.na/libr-archives.html |date=January 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This page includes some history of [[Video game|video games]] being used as an additional or alternative method to [[education]]. It also goes over whether or not it may be beneficial to use video games for educational purposes in the classroom and the limitations that teachers have to using video games in the classroom. This page additionally discusses how learning from video games outside the classroom is possible as well. 

==Compared to a classroom model==

Video games have been found to be more engaging; instead of providing information over an extended class period, games provide small amounts of information at relevant stages. It is traditionally considered optimal for a game to provide gameplay that is doable but challenging enough that the player must work at its completion. Because games follow this model, they create a certain degree of frustration in the player; however, this does not deter them from wanting to play, instead giving them more motivation to continue playing. Whether this engagement facilitates learning is still uncertain. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Educational setting==

As early as 1978, research was conducted relating video games to the motivational effects involved in learning as well as their [[cognitive]] potential. As video games spread in the 1980s, the research became more diversified. Its findings showed that the visual and motor coordination of game players was better than that of non-players. Initial research also indicated the importance of electronic games for children who proved to have difficulty learning basic subjects and skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greenfield, P.M.|year=1985|title=El niño y los medios de communicatión|location=Morata, Madrid|isbn=9788471123022}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that:
* Video games helped students to identify and attempt to correct their deficiencies.
* The adaptability of video games, and the control that players have over them, motivate and stimulate learning.
* In cases where students have difficulty concentrating, video games can be highly useful.
* The instant feedback given by video games help arouse curiosity and in turn allows for greater chances of learning. 
* Video games teach cooperation.

One common argument for the use of video games in education is that they enable learning from the simulation while having no danger associated with mistakes. For instance, the [[Air Force]] uses [[Flight simulator|piloting simulation]]s in order to teach their pilots how to fly the airplanes. These simulations are meant to prepare the training pilot for real-world flight conditions while at the same time preventing any damage or loss of life in the process. A pilot could crash in the simulation, learn from their mistake and then reset and try again. This process leads to distinct levels of mastery over the simulation and in turn the plane they will also be flying in the future. The [[military]] also utilizes games such as the ''[[ARMA (series)|ARMA]]'' and ''[[SOCOM (series)|Socom]]'' franchises in their training. Games like these immerse the gamer into the realm of the game and will attempt to achieve whatever objective is set out for them using their [[Military tactics|tactical]] skills. This allows for the military to show their [[soldier]]s how to engage certain situations without the risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K.D. Squire|title=Video games in education|journal=Int. J. Intell. Games &amp; Simulation|volume=2|issue=1|year=2003|pages= 49–62|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.543.5729&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games of all types have been shown to increase a different array of skills for players. Attempts have been made to show that [[arcade game#arcade action games|arcade-style action]] and [[platforming game]]s can be used to develop motor co-ordination, manual skills, and reflexes. &lt;!-- Games have also been researched to find a connection with some kinds of games and stress relief. [But what does this have to do with education?] --&gt; Many authors have noted the educational potential of games like ''[[The Sims]]'' (for its [[social simulation]]) or the ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' series (for its historical and strategy elements), concluding that video games as a whole promote intellectual development, and suggest that players can use them to develop knowledge strategies, practice [[problem-solving]], and can improve [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|spatial]] skills.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=M. De Aguilera|author2=A. Mendiz|title=Video games and education: (Education in the Face of a 'Parallel School')|magazine=Computers in Entertainment (CIE)|volume=1|issue=1|year=2003|page=1|doi=10.1145/950566.950583|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220686511_Video_games_and_education_Education_in_the_face_of_a_parallel_school}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using video games in the classroom==

===Possible benefits===
Some teachers have attempted to use video games within a classroom setting. There is some evidence which shows that for young children, [[educational video game]]s promote student engagement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nick Tannahill|author2=Patrick Tissington|author3=Carl Senior|title=Video Games and Higher Education: What Can 'Call of Duty' Teach our Students?|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=3|page=210|year=2012|pmc=3382412|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00210|pmid=22737142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games are inherently incentive-based systems with the player being rewarded for solving a problem or completing a mission, while meeting certain criteria.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; As a result, video games train a systematic way of thinking as well as an understanding for how different variables affect each other.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Furthermore, video games can constantly and automatically assess the learner's ability at any given moment due to the software-based nature of the medium; modular education structures tend to deliver assessments in large chunks and present a relatively limited picture of student progress.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Video games such as ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' have been suggested as platforms for teachers to experiment with their educational abilities. ''Minecraft'' is a [[sandbox game]] in which the user can create objects using the [[crafting (gaming)|crafting system]], while ''Portal'' is a [[physics game]]: the player uses the [[laws of physics]], such as [[gravity]] and [[inertia]], to advance through the game's series of test chambers. [[Critical thinking]] and problem solving are inherent in the latter game's design. Both ''Minecraft'' and ''Portal'' are adaptable to some learning environments; for instance, ''Minecraft'' has been used for young children while ''Portal'' has been used by high school physics teachers. ''Portal 2'' has also been used to develop cognitive skills in older undergraduate students, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shute, Valerie J.|title=The power of play: The effects of Portal 2 and Lumosity on cognitive and noncognitive skills|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=80|year=2015|pages=58–67|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131514001869|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.013|displayauthors=etal}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found that games including ''Portal 2'', ''[[Borderlands 2]]'', ''[[Gone Home]]'' and ''[[Papers, Please]]'' may be used to develop a range of skills in undergraduate students, such as communication, resourcefulness and adaptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barr, Matthew|title=Video games can develop graduate skills in higher education students|journal=Computers &amp; Education|volume=113|year=2017|pages=86–97|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131517301215|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.016}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Poli, Dorothybelle|title=Bringing Evolution to a Technological Generation: A Case Study with the Video Game SPORE|journal=American Biology Teacher|volume=74|issue=2|year=2012|pages=100–103|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1525/abt.2012.74.2.7|doi=10.1525/abt.2012.74.2.7|displayauthors=etal}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that using a video game as part of class discussions, as well as including timely and engaging exercises relating the game to class material, can improve student performance and engagement. Instructors assigned groups of students to play the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|SPORE]]'' in a freshman undergraduate biology course on evolution. The group of students that was assigned to play SPORE and complete related exercises, in a total of five sessions throughout the semester, had average class scores about 4% higher than the non-gaming group. The game's inaccuracies helped to stimulate critical thinking in students; one student said it helped her understand "the fine parts of [[natural selection]], [[artificial selection]], [[survival of the fittest]], and [[genetic diversity]] because of the errors within the game. It was like a puzzle." However, because the game was accompanied by additional exercises and instructor attention, this study is not overwhelming evidence for the hypothesis that video games in isolation increase student engagement.

Students who have played ''[[Europa Barbarorum]]'' had knowledge of historical geography beyond the scope taught during the basic [[ancient history]] course. They were able to identify the most important stages of civilization development in the case of states of the Hellenistic era and were very knowledgeable about [[military history]] and [[history of art]]. This knowledge was in large part derived from the comprehensive descriptions included in the game; students also admitted that after playing the game they were much more eager to turn to books dealing with the given historical period. However, Whether or not this intention materialized into more reading of historical periods is not clear. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3301669/Video_games_in_the_process_of_historical_education_at_the_academic_level_Colloquium_t._4_2012_p._75-82|title=Ł.

Another source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Squire, K.D.|year=2005|title=Changing the game: what happens when video games enter the classroom?|journal= Innovate: Journal of Online Education|volume=1|number=6|issn=1552-3233 |url=http://www.academiccolab.org/resources/documents/Changing%20The%20Game-final_2.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied teachers using ''Civilization III'' in high school history classrooms, both during and after school. In this study, not all students were in favor of using the game. Many students found it too difficult and tedious. Some students, particularly high-performing students, were concerned about how it could affect their studies; they felt that "Civilization III was insufficient preparation for the 'game' of higher education." However, students who were failing in the traditional school setting often did significantly better in the game-based unit, and the game seemed to get their attention where traditional schooling did not.

According to an article on interactive video games in physical education, many of these types of games are not just animated exercise. Many have different assessments and scores based on performance of skills. Some have heart rate monitors and estimate caloric expenditure. Others are designed with enhancing motor abilities in mind. Abilities such as balance, hand-eye coordination, agility and core strength are a few of the motor skills enhanced. These  engaging and interactive games have the ability to teach kids about the some physiological functions of the body. One example is that these games can help show kids how their heart reacts to different activities by using the heart rate monitor within the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trout|first=Josh|last2=Christie|first2=Brett|date=2007-05|title=Interactive Video Games in Physical Education|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1080%2F07303084.2007.10598021|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|language=en|volume=78|issue=5|pages=29–45|doi=10.1080/07303084.2007.10598021|issn=0730-3084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study took the game Semideus to see if it could help to improve performance on rational number tasks, the understanding of whole numbers and mathematical thinking in general. The study concluded if kids were introduced to games that have math well integrated into the gameplay then it kids then it will help them with their skills. the study recommended that the teacher be involved the game based learning to improve its effectiveness in the students learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.seriousgamessociety.org/index.php/IJSG/article/view/98/pdf_30|title=View of Using video games to combine learning and assessment in mathematics education|website=journal.seriousgamessociety.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journal article, simulation video games makes the player  to learn to think critically while gaining knowledge of the environment. The player learns to solve problems through trial and error. Players are able to learn by doing. They learn by experiencing things first-hand and role-playing. These virtual environments enable better learning, collaboration, and enhanced practical reasoning skills.&lt;ref&gt;Annetta, Leonard A. “Video Games in Education: Why They Should Be Used and How They Are Being Used.” ''Theory Into Practice'', vol. 47, no. 3, 2008, pp. 229–239. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40071547.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== P'''ossible negative effects''' ===
One argument for possible negative effects explains how kids are already spending too much time with technology outside the classroom. It explains that over seven and a half hours a day are being used by children eight to eighteen on media outside of school. With the large amount of time technology is being used by children, this argument claims that the time spent on screens may be replacing critical face to face communication may be negatively affecting children's face to face communication skills. To find out if this was true or not an experiment was done where two groups were taken from the same school. One group had many different bonding activities without access to a screen throughout the course of five days. While the second group was allowed to use their screens how they normally do. To test their face to face communication skills both groups took pre and post tests for comparison. The results suggested that those who were went away for the five days did much better in reading facial emotion than the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-10-01|title=Five days at outdoor education camp without screens improves preteen skills with nonverbal emotion cues|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214003227|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|language=en|volume=39|pages=387–392|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.05.036|issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barriers to the use of games===

Many teachers have reservations about using video games. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baek, Y.K.|year=2008|title=What hinders teachers in using computer and video games in the classroom? Exploring factors inhibiting the uptake of computer and video games|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|volume=11|issue=6|pages=665–671|doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0127|pmid=19006464}}&lt;/ref&gt; asked teachers who had some experience using games in class why they didn't do it more often. Six general categories of factors were identified as problem areas:

* '''Inflexibility of curriculum''': Teachers find it difficult to integrate games with the already-set [[curriculum]] present in classrooms. It can be difficult to locate a game that is educational as well as fun. And many teachers have no experience in using games to teach.  Learning with games may not be accepted by skeptical parents who personally learned with more conventional techniques.
* '''Psychological issues''': Gaming can promote student [[Video game addiction|addiction]] as well as physical problems. Students may also lose their desire to learn in the traditional setting. It can also remove teacher control and result in "excessive competition".
* '''Students' lack of readiness''': Students have varying levels of skill and [[computer literacy]], which may be affected by their [[Achievement gap|socioeconomic status]]. It takes time to teach them the rules of games, and games are harder for them to understand than traditional audiovisuals.
* '''Lack of supporting materials''': Teachers do not have access to supporting text or work for students to do alongside games. 
* '''Fixed class schedules''': Teachers have time constraints and their school may not allow them to use games.  More sophisticated games, often yielding the most learning content, often take hours to learn, and more time to play.   The tutorials for Civilization V take an hour to finish, and complete games can take 10s of hours.
* '''Limited budgets''': Computer equipment, software, and fast Internet connections are expensive and difficult for teachers to obtain.
* '''Relevance to Common Core''': The educational systems is increasingly driven by standardized testing focused on assessment of common core topics.   Games exist for these topics (glasslabgames.org) but gameplay is generally not competitive with commercial video games. 

Some teachers were more concerned about some problems than others. Male teachers were less concerned about limited budgets, fixed class hours, and the lack of supporting materials than were female teachers. Inexperienced teachers were more worried about fixed class schedules and the lack of supporting materials than were experienced teachers.

==Learning from video games outside the classroom==

Commercial video games in general, referred to as [[commercial off the shelf]] (COTS) games, have been suggested as having a potentially important role to assist learning in a range of crucial transferable skills.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; One example of this would be in [[first-person shooter]] games such as the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' franchise (although these games are violent by nature, and they have been subject to massive negative reception by parents with varying justification). While the ''Call of Duty'' franchise itself falls short of actual tactical strategy or realism in depth, there are many games in the same ''genre'' (first-person shooters) from which one can learn key skills from the games: they stimulate the player at the cognitive level as they move through the level, mission, or game as a whole.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; They also teach strategy, as players need to come up with ways to penetrate enemy lines, stealthily avoid the enemy, minimize casualties, and so on. Players can test their usage of these skills using the multiplayer aspect of these games. These games also allow players to enhance their [[peripheral vision]], because they need to watch for movement on the screen and make quick decisions about whether it is a threat, to avoid wasting ammunition or harming allied players.

Other games, such as the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' franchises, have been used to provide insight to the basic nature of education in video games. Success at these games requires the player to first fail multiple times – this is the only way to learn the proper actions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; These games also provide real-time feedback on how well the player is doing, an area in which traditional educational systems are lacking.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The main advantage with video games is that there is nothing to lose from failing, unlike in real life, where failing usually results in negative consequences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Shatz, I.|year=2015|url=http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Using-Gamification-and-Gaming-in-Order-to-Promote-Risk-Taking-in-the-Language-Learning-Process.pdf|title=Using Gamification and Gaming in Order to Promote Risk Taking in the Language Learning Process|conference=Proceedings of the 13th Annual MEITAL National Conference|pp=227–232|location=Haifa, Israel|publisher=Technion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research project involving positive use of video games is outlined in an article that focuses on studies that suggest there are health benefits to playing video games.  This article&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt; presents information from studies from the [[University of Utah]], [[Deakin University]] in Melbourne, Australia, 2009's ''Annual Review of Cybertherapy and Telemedicine'', [[University of Washington]], Visual Development Lab of Ontario's [[McMaster University]], [[University of Rochester]] in New York,  and [[North Carolina State University]].  The researchers from these universities found that video games are therapeutic for children with [[chronic illness]]es, can improve preschoolers' motor skills, reduce stress and depression, provide relief from pain, improve vision, improve decision making skills, and maintain happiness in old age as well.&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite web|title=7 health benefits of playing video games|last=Gallagher|first=Danny|date=March 10, 2013|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/241121/7-health-benefits-of-playing-video-games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study suggests that commercial video games can help players to improve in certain skills such as communication, resourcefulness, and adaptability. In this study undergraduate students were assigned at random to be in either an intervention or a control group. To measure adaptability, resourcefulness and communication, there were self-report instruments given to both groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-01|title=Student attitudes to games-based skills development: Learning from video games in higher education|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563217306684|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|language=en|volume=80|pages=283–294|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.11.030|issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Games for Educational Enrichment===

As noted above games are potentially a useful learning tool, but there are significant barriers to the use of video games in the classroom, including the time to learn and play, teacher and parent support, relevance to the Common Core (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core_State_Standards_Initiative), and uncertain overall educational benefits of the medium as a whole. While video games have been found to promote student engagement, whether video games also promote subject learning or other benefits over the traditional classroom model is uncertain.
