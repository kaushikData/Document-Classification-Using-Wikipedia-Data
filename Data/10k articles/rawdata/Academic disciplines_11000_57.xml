'''ASA style''' is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers in the field of [[sociology]]. It specifies the arrangement and punctuation of [[footnote]]s and [[bibliography|bibliographies]]. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA [[Style Guide]], which is published by the [[American Sociological Association]], the main scholarly organization for academic sociologists in the [[United States]]. The ''ASA Style Guide'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]], is designed to aid authors preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

==General features==

ASA style is closely related in appearance and function to APA (American Psychological Association) style. As with [[APA style]], the general format for citing references is [[parenthetical referencing]]. All references are to be included at the end of the paper in a section titled "References," rather than "Works Cited" as in [[MLA style]]. Also unlike MLA style, parenthetical references include the year of publication. The "author-date" in text citation system is a readily recognizable feature of ASA style. This emphasis on dates is carried over into the references section, where the date is the first piece of information to follow the author's or authors' name(s).

==Software support==

ASA style is supported by most major [[reference management software]] programs, including Endnote, Procite, Zotero, Refworks, and so forth, making the formatting of references a fairly straightforward task.

'''Backyard Worlds: Planet 9''' is a [[NASA]]-funded [[citizen science]] project which is part of the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] [[web portal]].&lt;ref name="nasawantsyou"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA wants you to help find a new planet|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/16/us/nasa-search-worlds-trnd/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|date=16 February 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It aims to discover new [[brown dwarf]]s and other low-mass stars, some of which might be among the [[List of nearest stars and brown dwarfs|nearest neighbors of our solar system]], and might conceivably detect [[Planet Nine]].  The project's principal investigator is [[Marc Kuchner]], an astrophysicist at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name="huntforplanet9"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt for Planet 9: how you can help NASA search for brown dwarfs and low-mass stars|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/Spacebound/2017/0217/Hunt-for-Planet-9-how-you-can-help-NASA-search-for-brown-dwarfs-and-low-mass-stars|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=17 February 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Backyard Worlds was launched in February 2017 shortly before the 87th anniversary of the discovery of [[Pluto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/backyard-worlds-planet-9|title=Backyard Worlds: Planet 9|website=nasa.gov|date=13 March 2017|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which until [[Pluto#IAU classification|its reclassification]] as a [[dwarf planet]] in 2006 was considered the Solar System's ninth major planet.  Since that reclassification evidence has come to light that there may be another planet located in the outer region of the Solar System far beyond the [[Kuiper belt]], most commonly referred to as [[Planet Nine]].  This hypothetical new planet would be located so far from the Sun that it would reflect only a very small amount of visible light, rendering it too faint to be detected in most [[astronomical survey]]s conducted to date.&lt;ref name=lurking&gt;{{cite news |last=Achenbach |first=Joel |last2=Feltman |first2=Rachel |date=20 January 2016 |title=New evidence suggests a ninth planet lurking at the edge of the solar system |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/20/new-evidence-suggests-a-ninth-planet-lurking-at-the-edge-of-the-solar-system/ |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasawantsyou"/&gt;  Models of the conjectured planet's atmosphere suggest however that methane condensation could in some cases make it detectable in infrared images captured by the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) space telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fortney |first1=Jonathan J. |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=The Hunt for Planet Nine: Atmosphere, Spectra, Evolution, and Detectability |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=824 |issue=2 |pages=L25 |arxiv=1604.07424 |bibcode=  2016ApJ...824L..25F|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/824/2/L25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the effects of [[proper motion]] and [[parallax]] Planet Nine would appear to move in a distinctive way between images taken of the same patch of sky at different times.  In addition to Planet Nine other objects such as nearby brown dwarfs would also be seen to move.

The citizen scientists search through a [[flip book]]-style animation of specially processed infrared images captured by WISE, taken with filters at the wavelengths of 3.4 and 4.6 [[Micrometre|micrometer]]s. The images contain [[Artifact (error)|instrumental artifacts]] and are [[image noise|noisy]], which hampers the use of automated [[image processing]] software and makes the task ideal for exploiting human visual recognition capabilities.&lt;ref name="nasawantsyou"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huntforplanet9"/&gt;

The project has been awarded a grant from NASA's Astrophysics Data Analysis Program which will fund it until 2020.&lt;ref name="blogpost20180214"/&gt;

==Discoveries==
In June 2017, it was announced that Backyard Worlds had made its first official discovery: a brown dwarf designated [[WISEA 1101+5400]], of [[spectral type]] T5.5 and located 34 parsecs (111 light years) from Earth. A paper announcing the discovery was accepted for publication in ''[[Astrophysical Journal Letters]]'', and Backyard Worlds now holds the record among all Zooniverse projects as having the shortest time from project launch to first publication.&lt;ref name="blogpost20170608"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2017/06/08/our-first-paper-the-discovery-of-brown-dwarf-wisea-11015400/|title=Our First Paper: the Discovery of Brown Dwarf WISEA 1101+5400|date=8 June 2017|website=Blog.backyardworlds.org|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kuchner |first1=Marc J. |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=The First Brown Dwarf Discovered by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 Citizen Science Project |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=841 |issue=2 |pages=L19 |arxiv=1705.02919 |bibcode=  2017ApJ...841L..19K|doi=10.3847/2041-8213/aa7200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, seven new brown dwarfs were confirmed, as well as two [[Subdwarf#Cool subdwarfs|cool subdwarf]]s. The spectral types of the new brown dwarfs were T0, T2.8, T5, T6, T6.5, and two of type T8. In addition, there were 337 brown dwarf candidates awaiting spectra for confirmation.&lt;ref name="blogpost20171222"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2017/12/22/snow-white-and-the-seven-new-confirmed-brown-dwarfs/|title=Snow White and the Seven New Confirmed Brown Dwarfs|date=22 December 2017|website=Blog.backyardworlds.org|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the first anniversary of the project in February 2018, the project has so far discovered 17 brown dwarfs and two cool subdwarfs. The coldest object discovered is of spectral type T9, which raises hopes of discovering type Y dwarfs in the future. In addition, a spectrum was also taken of one possibly variable object of unknown type that does not actually exhibit proper motion. There are 432 objects of interest awaiting verification, of which 38 are Y dwarf candidates.&lt;ref name="blogpost20180214"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2018/02/14/we-love-you-and-happy-anniversary/|title=We Love You! And Happy Anniversary!|date=14 February 2018|website=Blog.backyardworlds.org|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018 an update on the project's blog stated that in total 42 brown dwarfs have so far been spectroscopically confirmed from a list of 879 candidates.  Fourteen of those confirmed are closer to the solar system than {{convert|20|pc|ly|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="blogpost20180711"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2018/07/11/42-confirmed-brown-dwarfs-and-counting/|title=42 Confirmed Brown Dwarfs and Counting

'''Ballooning''', sometimes called '''kiting''', is a process by which [[spider]]s, and some other small [[invertebrate]]s, move through the air by releasing one or more [[Gossamer (spider silk)|gossamer threads]] to catch the wind, causing them to become airborne at the mercy of [[air current]]s, and more importantly, [[electric current]]s. This is primarily used by spiderlings to disperse; however, larger individuals have been observed doing so as well. The spider climbs to a high point and takes a stance with its abdomen to the sky, releasing fine silk threads from its [[spinneret]] until it becomes aloft. Journeys achieved vary from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres. Even atmospheric samples collected from balloons at five kilometres altitude and ships mid-ocean have reported spider landings. Mortality is high.

Many spiders use especially fine [[Spider silk|silk]] called ''gossamer''&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed.: Gossamer, noun and adjective: fine filmy substance, consisting of cobwebs, spun by small spiders, which is seen floating in the air in calm weather, esp. in autumn, or spread over a grassy surface: occas. with a and pl., a thread or web of gossamer.&lt;/ref&gt; to lift themselves off a surface, and silk also may be used by a windblown spider to anchor itself to stop its journey.&lt;ref name=anchor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schneider |first=J.M. |author2=Roos, J. |author3=Lubin, Y. |author4=Henschel, J.R. |date=October 2001 |title=Dispersal of ''Stegodyphus Dumicola'' (Araneae, Eresidae): They do balloon after all! |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=114–116 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v29_n1/arac_29_01_0114.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-18 |doi=10.1636/0161-8202(2001)029[0114:DOSDAE]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "gossamer" is used [[metaphor]]ically for any exceedingly fine thread or fabric. Biologists also apply the term "balloon silk" to the threads that mechanically lift and drag systems.{{elucidate|date=September 2014}}

It is generally thought that most spiders heavier than 1&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] are unlikely to use ballooning.&lt;ref name="Suter"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Suter, R.B.|year=1999|title=An aerial lottery: The physics of ballooning in a chaotic atmosphere |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=27|pages=281–293|url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_Congress/JoA_v27_n1/arac_27_01_0281.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211140214/http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_Congress/JoA_v27_n1/arac_27_01_0281.pdf|archivedate=2006-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because many individuals die during ballooning, it is less likely that adults will balloon compared to spiderlings. However, adult females of several social ''[[Stegodyphus]]'' species (''S. dumicola'' and ''S. mimosarum'') weighing more than 100&amp;nbsp;mg and with a body size of up to {{convert|14|mm|in}} have been observed ballooning using rising [[thermal]]s on hot days without wind. These spiders use tens to hundreds of silk strands, which form a triangular sheet with a length and width of about {{convert|1|m|in}}&lt;ref name=anchor /&gt;

In Australia, in 2012 and in May 2015, millions of spiders were reported to have ballooned into the air, making the ground where they landed seem snow-covered with their silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Millions of Spiders Rain Down on Australia—Why?|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150518-spiders-australia-silk-webs-animals-environment|website = National Geographic News|accessdate = 2015-05-19|first = Christine|last = Dell'Amore|first2 = National Geographic PUBLISHED May|last2 = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A close association has been found between ballooning behaviors and the ability for a species of spiders to survive afloat on water. Water-repellent legs keep them alive on both fresh and salt water, enabling them to survive waves up to 0.5 metres in height. In wind many species raised their legs or abdomens to use as sails, propelling themselves across the water's surface. Many species of spiders also drop silk to anchor themselves in place while afloat. Said spiders did not show these behaviours on land, suggesting that they are adaptations to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sail or sink: novel behavioural adaptations on water in aerially dispersing species|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/15/118/abstract|journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology|date = 2015-07-03|issn = 1471-2148|pmid = 26138616|pages = 118|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/s12862-015-0402-5|language = en|first = Morito|last = Hayashi|first2 = Mohammed|last2 = Bakkali|first3 = Alexander|last3 = Hyde|first4 = Sara L.|last4 = Goodacre|pmc=4490750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/airborne-spiders-can-sail-on-seas-1.17906|title=Airborne Spiders Can Sail on Seas|last=Cressey|first=Daniel|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=2015-07-08|work=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7559/full/523130d.html|title=Flying spiders also sail on water|date=|doi = 10.1038/523130d|accessdate=2015-07-09|work=Nature|volume=523|pages=130–131|bibcode=2015Natur.523T.130.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

'''''Bucket and Cone''''' refer to twin attributes that are frequently held in the hands of [[winged genie]]s depicted in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] art and especially [[Assyrian palace reliefs]] - sometimes, however, only the bucket is held, and the other hand is held up in what may be a [[blessing]] gesture. These objects are often displayed in association with a stylised tree, before floral decorations, guardian figures, the king and / or his attendants and open doorways or portals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chronofus.net/inanna/concepts.htm |title=Sumerian Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cone was apparently held up in the right hand, the bucket held hanging downwards in the left hand of the figure, which is almost always that of a winged genie or an animal-headed [[demon]] or [[monster]] (though not necessarily with the same negative connotations) - only very occasionally might these attributes be borne by a fully human figure.

As to the identity of the twin objects, the "cone" is generally recognised as a pine or fir cone ([[pinus brutia]]); alternative identifications suggest the male flower of the [[date palm]], or as a clay model imitating the form of one or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibleorigins.net/ezekielscherubim.html |title=Ezekiel's Cherubim and Ancient Near Eastern Exemplars (9th-6th centuries B.C.) |author=Walter Reinhold Warttig Mattfeld y de la Torre |work=Bible Origins |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bucket was presumably either of metal or [[basketry]] and is thought to have held either water or pollen or both.

Although explanatory texts regarding these objects are exceedingly rare, it does seem likely that they were together employed in [[Ritual purification|rituals of purification]], as revealed by their [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] names: banddudû ("bucket") and mullilu ("purifier").&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite book |title=Assyrian Reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal|last=Collins|first=Paul |year=2010 |chapter=Attending the King and Eternity|isbn=978-1-58465-817-7 |pages=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case the fir cone would be dipped in the bucket of water before being shaken in order to ritually purify a person or object.&lt;ref name=atac /&gt; Alternatively the close association of the objects with depictions of stylised trees has led to the suggestion that it depicts fertilisation.&lt;ref name=atac /&gt; In this case the pollen from the male flower of the date palm would be being shaken onto the tree.&lt;ref name=atac&gt;{{cite book |title=Assyrian Reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal|last=Ataç|first= Mehmet-Ali |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |chapter=Time and Eternity|isbn=978-1-58465-817-7 |page=167 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cruachan Power Station''' (also known as the '''Cruachan Dam''') is a [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage]] [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power station in [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Scotland]]. The scheme can provide 440MW of power and has a capacity of 7.1 GWh.

The [[turbine]] hall is located inside [[Ben Cruachan]], and the scheme takes water between [[Cruachan Reservoir]] to [[Loch Awe]], a height difference of {{convert|396|m}}. It is one of only four pumped storage power stations in the UK, and is capable of providing a [[black start]] capability to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].

Construction began in 1959 to coincide with the [[Hunterston A nuclear power station]] in Ayrshire. Cruachan uses cheap off-peak electricity generated at night to pump water to the higher reservoir, which can then be released during the day to provide power as necessary. The power station is open to visitors, and around 50,000 tourists visit it each year.

==Location==
The power station is on the [[A85 road]], about 8 km or 5 miles west of [[Dalmally]], on a branch of [[Loch Awe]] leading to the [[River Awe]], which is the outflow from the loch, at its NW corner. There is a seasonally open [[Falls of Cruachan railway station]] nearby.

==History==
Construction commenced in 1959, and the power station was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 15 October 1965.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcruachan.co.uk/about/history.asp |title=Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain: History |publisher=Visit Cruachan |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was designed by Sir Edward MacColl, who died before it opened.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=beeb/&gt; The civil engineering design of the scheme was carried out by [[James Williamson &amp; Partners]] of Glasgow, and the main project contractors were [[William Tawse]] of Aberdeen and [[BAM Nuttall|Edmund Nuttall]] of Camberley. Consulting  electrical engineers were Merz &amp; McLellan of Newcastle on Tyne.&lt;ref name=con/&gt;&lt;ref name=gaz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst2013.html |title=Cruachan Power Station |publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of the construction, there were around 4,000 people working on the project.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt; Thirty-six men died in the construction of the power station and dam,&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/07/23/reg_man_delves_deep_to_find_the_power/ |title=Boffins, Tunnel Tigers and Scotland's world-first power mountain |author=Bill Ray |newspaper=The Register |date=23 July 2013 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cost of the scheme was {{GBP|24.5 million}}.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

Cruachan was one of the first reversible [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage system]]s, where the same turbines are used as both pumps and generators.&lt;ref name=con/&gt; Previous pumped-storage systems used separate pumps with a network of pipes to return water to the upper reservoir, making them much more expensive to build than conventional hydroelectric systems.&lt;ref name=f70&gt;{{harvnb|Fleetwood|2010|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruachan is predated by the smaller {{convert|232|MW}} [[Lünerseewerk]] ([[w:de:Lünerseewerk|de]]) of 1958 and the {{convert|360|MW}} [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] of 1963.&lt;ref name=f72&gt;{{harvnb|Fleetwood|2010|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of four pumped storage schemes in the UK.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26124572 |title=Cruachan hydro power station output 'could double' |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its construction was linked to that of [[Hunterston A nuclear power station]], to store surplus night-time nuclear generated electrical energy.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/mountain-of-power-to-get-pounds-18-5m-facelift-1.118295 |title=Mountain of power to get £18.5m facelift |author=James Freeman |newspaper=The Herald |date=19 May 2003 |accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power station was originally operated by the [[North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board]], before being transferred to the [[South of Scotland Electricity Board]].&lt;ref name=dno/&gt; It has been owned by [[Scottish Power]] since the [[Timeline of the UK electricity supply industry|privatisation of Britain's electricity industry]] in 1990,&lt;ref name=gaz/&gt; and they are looking to increase capacity to 1,040 MW.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Catherine. "[http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/opinion/opinionpumped-storage-what-are-its-prospects-4292101/ Pumped storage: what are its prospects?]" ''AECOM'' / ''International Water Power and Dam Construction. Global Trade Media'', 13 June 2014. Retrieved: 21 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its early life was fraught with technical difficulties, but the size of the maintenance team has been reduced from 30 in 1989 to 12 in 2010.&lt;ref name=dno/&gt; Maintenance of the [[penstock]]s, which formerly required them to be drained, is now done using a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]].&lt;ref name=dno/&gt;

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the station's opening, a 2015 BBC radio documentary "Inside the Rock" covered the history of construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06gw3k9 BBC documentary "Inside the Rock"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Cruachan station temporarily stores energy at times of low demand, and releases it at times of high demand, when electricity prices are higher,&lt;ref name=spew/&gt; reducing the maximum power that must be provided by power stations.

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Degrowth''' (&lt;!--originally a French term--&gt;{{lang-fr|décroissance}}) is a political, economic, and social movement based on [[ecological economics]], [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;  It is also considered an essential economic strategy responding to the [[The Limits to Growth|limits-to-growth]] dilemma (see ''[[The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries]]'' and [[post-growth]]). Degrowth thinkers and activists advocate for the downscaling of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—the contraction of [[Economy|economies]]—arguing that [[overconsumption]] lies at the root of long term [[environmental issue]]s and [[Social inequality|social inequalities]]. Key to the concept of degrowth is that reducing consumption does not require individual [[Martyr|martyring]] or a decrease in [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln &amp; London|isbn=0803237758|pages=178–183, 339–342|url=http://GreenIllusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "degrowthers" aim to maximize happiness and well-being through non-consumptive means—sharing work, consuming less, while devoting more time to art, music, family, nature, culture and community.

==Background==
The movement arose from concerns over the perceived
consequences of the [[productivism]] and [[consumerism]]
associated with industrial societies (whether
[[Capitalism|capitalist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]]) including:&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;
* The reduced availability of energy sources (see [[peak oil]])
* The declining quality of the environment (see [[global warming]], [[pollution]], [[Biodiversity#Threats|threats to biodiversity]])
* The decline in the health of flora and fauna upon which humans depend (see [[Holocene extinction]])
* The rise of negative societal side-effects (see un[[sustainable development]], poorer [[health]], [[poverty]])
* The ever-expanding use of resources by [[First World]] countries to satisfy lifestyles that consume more food and energy, and produce greater waste, at the expense of the [[Third World]] (see [[neocolonialism]])

===Resource depletion===
{{Main article|Resource depletion}}
As economies grow, the need for resources grows accordingly (unless there are changes in efficiency or demand for different products due to price changes). There is a fixed supply of non-renewable resources, such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. Renewable resources can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367&lt;/ref&gt; There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119&lt;/ref&gt; Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org  ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of degrowth argue that decreasing demand is the only way of permanently closing the demand gap. For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological footprint===
{{Main article|Ecological footprint}}

The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human 
population consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].
According to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,&lt;ref name=footprintnetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of 
[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, 
while current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would 
reduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].

=== Degrowth and sustainable development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farewell to Growth|last=Latouche|first=Serge|publisher=Polity Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7456-4616-9|location=Cambridge|pages=9-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Degrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).  It is, thus, opposed to the current form of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lorek-_Fuchs-2013.pdf|title=Strong sustainable consumption governance - precondition for a degrowth path?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the concern for 
[[sustainability]] does not contradict degrowth, sustainable development is rooted in mainstream [[international development|development]] ideas that aim to increase capitalist growth and consumption. Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref name=Latouche/&gt; as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. 
Critics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increase [[poverty]] and decrease income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth—self-sufficiency, material responsibility—and would indeed lead to decreased 
employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate for a complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic system, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.&lt;ref name=Latouche&gt;Latouche, S. (2004).&gt;[https://mondediplo.com/2004/11/14latouche Degrowth Economics: Why less should be so much more.] ''Le Monde 
Diplomatique''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The rebound effect"===
{{Main article|Rebound effect (conservation)}}
Technologies designed to reduce resource use and improve efficiency are often touted as sustainable or green solutions. Degrowth literature, however, warns about these technological advances due to the "[[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Neb. Pr.|location=Lincoln|pages=172–73, 333–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept is based on observations that when a less resource-exhaustive technology is introduced, [[Jevons paradox|behaviour surrounding the use of that technology may change]], and consumption of that technology could increase or even offset any potential resource savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Binswanger |first=M. |year=2001 |title=Technological Progress and Sustainable Development: What About the Rebound Effect? |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=119–32 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the rebound effect, proponents of degrowth hold that the only effective 'sustainable' solutions must involve a complete rejection of the growth paradigm and a move toward a degrowth paradigm. There are also fundamental limits to technological solutions in the pursuit of degrowth, as all engagements with technology increase the cumulutive matter-energy throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkurinen|first=Pasi|title=Degrowth by means of technology? A treatise for an ethos of releasement|url= |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.070}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the convergence of [[digital commons]] of knowledge and design with [[distributed manufacturing]] technologies may arguably hold potential for building degrowth future scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kostakis |first1=Vasilis |last2=Latoufis |first2=Kostas |last3=Liarokapis |first3=Minas |last4=Bauwens |first4=Michel |title=The convergence of digital commons with local manufacturing from a degrowth perspective: Two illustrative cases|url= |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the movement==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
The contemporary degrowth movement can trace its roots back to the anti-industrialist trends of the 19th century, developed in Great Britain by [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] (1819–1900), in the United States by [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), and in Russia by [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "degrowth" proper appeared during the 1970s, proposed by [[André Gorz]] (1972) and intellectuals such as [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edward Goldsmith]] and [[Ivan Illich]], whose ideas reflect those of earlier thinkers, such as the economist [[E. J. Mishan]],&lt;ref&gt;Mishan, Ezra J., ''The Costs of Economic Growth'', Staples Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; the industrial historian [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rolt|first=L. T. C.|title=High Horse Riderless|year=1947|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=171|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/HIGH-HORSE-RIDERLESS-L-T-C-Rolt/dp/B0006ARC3W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the radical socialist [[Turner Controversy|Tony Turner]]. The writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[J. C. Kumarappa]] also contain similar philosophies, particularly regarding his support of [[Simple living|voluntary simplicity]].

More generally, degrowth movements draw on the values of [[humanism]], [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[anthropology]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;D’Alisa, G., Demaria, F., Cattaneo, C. (2013). Civil and Uncivil Actors for a Degrowth Society. Journal of Civil Society 9 (2): 212-224.

=== Club of Rome reports ===
In 1968, the [[Club of Rome]], a [[think tank]] headquartered in [[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]], asked researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for a report on practical solutions to problems of global concern. The report, called ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', published in 1972, became the first important study that indicated the ecological perils of the unprecedented economic growth the world was experiencing at the time.

The reports (also known as the Meadows Reports) are not strictly the founding texts of the degrowth movement, as these reports only advise [[Steady-state economy|zero growth]], and have also been used to support the [[sustainable development]] movement. Still, they are considered the first official studies explicitly presenting economic growth as a key reason for the increase in global [[environmental issue|environmental problems]] such as pollution, shortage of raw materials, and the destruction of [[ecosystem]]s. A second report was published in 1974, and together with the first, drew considerable attention to the topic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen ===
{{Main article|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen}}
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Declining-state economy }}

The degrowth movement recognises [[Romanian Americans|Romanian American]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[economist]] [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] as the main intellectual figure inspiring the movement.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}} &lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;{{rp|1f}} In his magnum opus on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all [[natural resource]]s are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth—that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels—is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen's intellectual inspiration to degrowth goes back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Levallois2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levallois|first1=Clément|title=Can de-growth be considered a policy option? A historical note on Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=69|issue=11|year=2010|pages=2271–2278|issn=09218009|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Georgescu-Roegen delivered a lecture at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher {{ill|Jacques Grinevald|fr}}, who had earlier been introduced to [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|Georgescu-Roegen's magnum opus]] by an academic advisor. Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon made friends, and Grinevald started devoting his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979 Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la décroissance: Entropie – Écologie – Économie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy – Ecology – Economy').&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''décroissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('Tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in these second and third editions.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}}&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}}

By the time Grinevald suggested the term ''décroissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early 1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently hereof, Georgescu-Roegen had criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on ''Energy and Economic Myths'', delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and onwards at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following view:

{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366f}}&lt;br&gt;... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}

When reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates progressing by the time; this resemblance then transformed into the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French ''both'' fed on ''and'' gave further impetus to the concept of ''décroissance'' in the country—and everywhere else in the francophone world—thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|197f}}

By the 2000s, when ''décroissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term 'decline' was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: 'Decline' usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] 'degrowth' was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis—as in the prevailing French usage of the term—something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=gk01/&gt;{{rp|874–876}}

When the first international degrowth conference of its kind was held in Paris in 2008, the participants bestowed a generous amount of credit and appreciation on Georgescu-Roegen and his work.&lt;ref name=ff01/&gt;{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} Further, in his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit traité de la décroissance sereine'' ('Farewell to Growth'), leading French champion of the degrowth movement [[Serge Latouche]] has credited Georgescu-Roegen as 'a main theoretical source of degrowth.'&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] has considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be 'one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.'&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}}

=== Serge Latouche ===
[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]
[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:

{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth. In 1991, the United States spent 115 billion dollars, or 2.1% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on the protection of the environment. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] increased this cost by 45 or 55 million dollars per year. [...] The [[World Resources Institute]] tried to measure the rate of the growth taking into account the punishment exerted on the [[natural capital]] of the world, with an eye towards sustainable development. For Indonesia, it found that the rate of growth between 1971 and 1984 would be reduced from 7.1 to 4% annually, and that was by taking only three variables into consideration: [[deforestation]], the reduction in the reserves of oil and natural gas, and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Kempf, ''L'économie à l'épreuve de l'écologie'' Hatier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latouche, Serge (2003) ''Decrecimiento y post-desarrollo'' El viejo topo, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Schumacher and Buddhist economics ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]]'s 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] model of economic development, arguing that an increasing "standard of living", based on consumption, is absurd as a goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as [[Buddhist economics]], we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered. New York: Perennial Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological and social issues ===
In January 1972 [[Edward Goldsmith]] and Robert Prescott-Allen—editors of ''[[The Ecologist]]'' journal—published ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and [[deindustrialization]] to prevent what the authors referred to as ''"the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet"''.

===Conferences===
The movement has also included international conferences,&lt;ref name="MOINS12"&gt;{{fr}} « La genèse du Réseau Objection de Croissance en Suisse », Julien Cart, in ''[[Moins!]]'', journal [[Suisse romande|romand]] d'écologie politique, n°12, juillet-août 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by the network Research&amp;Degrowth (R&amp;D),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/|title=Research &amp; Degrowth|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/|title=Décroissance économique pour la soutenabilité écologique et l'équité sociale|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|title=Degrowth Conference Barcelona 2010|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.degrowth.org/|title=International Conference on Degrowth in the Americas}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venice]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezia2012.it/|title=International Degrowth Conference Venezia 2012 |accessdate=5 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leipzig]] (2014), [[Budapest]] (2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://degrowth.org/2015/03/26/5-international-degrowth-conference-budapest-2016/|accessdate=2018-01-31|title=5^ International Degrowth Conference in Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malmö]] (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malmo.degrowth.org|title=Dialogues in turbulent times|website=Dialogues in turbulent times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona Conference (2010)===
The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity of [[Paris]] (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of [[capitalism]] and an explanation of the main principles of the degrowth.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the Paris 2008 Conference''. Retrieved from: http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Declaration-Degrowth-Paris-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Second International Conference of [[Barcelona]] on the other hand focused on specific ways to implement a degrowth society.

Concrete proposals have been developed for future political actions, including:
* Promotion of [[Local currency|local currencies]], elimination of [[fiat money]] and reforms of [[interest]]
* Transition to non-profit and small scale companies
* Increase of local commons and support of participative approaches in [[decision-making]]
* Reducing working hours and facilitation of [[volunteering|volunteer work]]
* Reusing empty housing and [[cohousing]]
* Introduction of the [[basic income]] and an income ceiling built on a maximum-minimum ratio
* Limitation of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and preservation of the [[biodiversity]] and culture by regulations, taxes and compensations
* Minimize the [[waste]] production with education and legal instruments
* Elimination of mega infrastructures, transition from a car-based system to a more local, biking, walking-based one.
* Suppression of advertising from the public space&lt;ref&gt;2nd Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Ethic. 2010. ''Degrowth Declaration Barcelona 2010'' and ''Working Groups Results''. Retrieved from: http://barcelona.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the real willingness of reform and the development of numerous solutions, the conference of Barcelona didn’t have a big influence on the world economic and political system. Many critiques have been made concerning the proposals, mostly about the financial aspects, and this has refrained changes to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Responsabilité, Innovation &amp; Management. 2011. ''Décroissance économique pour l’écologie, l’équité et le bien-vivre par François SCHNEIDER.'' Retrieved from http://www.openrim.org/Decroissance-economique-pour-l.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degrowth around the world ===
Although not explicitly called Degrowth, movements using similar concepts and terminologies can be found around the world, such as Buen Vivir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Latin America or Eco-Swaraj&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://degrowthcanada.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/alternatives-to-sustainable-development-buen-vivir-degrowth-and-eco-swaraj/|title="Alternatives to Sustainable Development: Buen vivir, Degrowth and Eco-Swaraj"|last=Thomson|first=Bob|date=2015-12-28|website=Degrowth / Decroissance Canada|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India.

=== Relation to other social movements ===
The degrowth movement has a variety of relations to other social movements and alternative economic visions, which range from collaboration to partial overlap. The Konzeptwerk Neue Ökonomie (Laboratory for New Economic Ideas), which hosted the 2014 international Degrowth conference in Leipzig, has published a project entitled “Degrowth in movement(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.degrowth.info/en/dim/degrowth-in-movements/|title=Degrowth in movement(s)|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;” in 2017, which maps relationships with 32 other social movements and initiatives.

== Criticisms ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

===Marxist critique===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Capitalism without growth }}
[[Marxism|Marxists]] distinguish between two types of growth: that which is useful to mankind, and that which simply exists to increase profits for companies. Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;''L'écologie politique à l'ère de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;
However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]&lt;ref name="The Ecological Rift"&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Magdoff,&lt;ref name="Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|work=Monthly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism.  This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable.  Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]].

===Systems theoretical critique===
In stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticised unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society. A corresponding recoding of growth-obsessed or capitalist organisations has recently been proposed.&lt;ref name="Growth and function. A viral research program for next organizations, International Journal of Technology Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steffenroth.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/15-12-15-growth-and-function1.pdf|last=Roth|first=Steffen|title=Growth and function. A viral research program for next organizations|work=International Journal of Technology Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Attributes of God}}

In [[theology]], '''divine providence''', or just '''providence''', is [[God]]'s intervention in the [[Universe]]. The term ''Divine Providence'' (usually capitalized) is also used as a [[names of God|title of God]]. A distinction is usually made between "general providence", which refers to God's [[God the Sustainer|continuous upholding]] of the existence and [[natural law|natural order]] of the Universe, and "special providence", which refers to God's extraordinary intervention in the life of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Providence.aspx#1O101-Providence |title=Providence |work=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] |date= |access-date=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miracle]]s generally fall in the latter category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Providence, and Miracle |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/creation-providence-and-miracle |publisher=[[Reasonable Faith]] |access-date=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word comes from Latin ''providentia'' "foresight, [[prudence]]", from ''pro-'' "ahead" and ''videre'' "to see". The current use of the word has the sense of "knowledge of the future" or [[omniscience]], understood as an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute of God]].

==Catholic theology==
[[Augustine of Hippo]] is perhaps most famously associated with the doctrine of divine providence in the Latin West. Augustine held that since God's governance takes place in the universe comprising a vast multitude of relatively independent individuals differing in nature, function, and end, this implies the continuous control and unifying governance of a single supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12510a.htm Walker, Leslie. "Divine Providence." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 19 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Christian teaching on providence in the [[High Middle Ages]] was most fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. The concept of providence as care exercised by God over the [[universe]], his foresight and care for its future is extensively developed and explained both by Aquinas himself and modern [[Thomism|Thomists]]. One of the foremost modern Thomists, [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] father [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], wrote a study of providence entitled "Providence: God's loving care for man and the need for confidence in Almighty God." In it, he presents and solves, according to Catholic doctrine, the most difficult issues as related to providence.

==Reformed theology==
{{See also|Reformed theology}}
This term is an integral part of [[John Calvin]]'s theological framework known as [[Calvinism]], which emphasizes the [[total depravity]] of man and the complete sovereignty of God. God's plan for the world and every soul that he has created is guided by his will, or providence. According to Calvin, the idea that man has [[free will]] and is able to make choices independently of what God has already determined is based on our limited understanding of God's perfection and the idea that God's purposes can be circumvented. In this mode of thought, providence is related to absolute free will. This concept remains prominent among many [[Protestant]] denominations that identify with Calvinism, the [[Reformed churches]].

==Lutheran theology==
{{See also|Lutheranism}}
In [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] theology, divine providence refers to God's preservation of [[ex nihilo|creation]], his cooperation with everything that happens, and his guiding of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House. 1934. pp. 189-195 and Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 635 and [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=P&amp;word=PROVIDENCE Christian Cyclopedia] article on Divine Providence.

God concurs with an act's effect, but he does not cooperate in the corruption of an act or the evil of its effect.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Steven P.,''Called to Believe, Teach, and Confess''. Wipf and Stock. 2005. pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutherans believe everything exists for the sake of the Christian Church, and that God guides everything for its welfare and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, J.T., ''Christian Dogmatics''. Concordia Publishing House: 1934. pp. 190 and Edward. W. A.,''A Short Explanation of Dr. Martin Luther's Small Catechism''. Concordia Publishing House. 1946. p. 165. and [http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1122 Divine Providence and Human Adversity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707130929/http://www.wlsessays.net/node/1122 |date=2010-07-07 }} by Markus O. Koepsell&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Martin Luther]], divine providence began when God created the world with everything needed for human life, including both physical things and [[natural laws]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/luthersworksvolu009862mbp Luther's Works Vol. 1 Lectures on Genesis Chapters 1-5] page 25, 47&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Luther's Small Catechism]], the explanation of the first article of the [[Apostles' Creed]] declares that everything people have that is good is given and preserved by God, either directly or through other people or things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/smallcatechism.html#creed |title=Luther's Small Catechism, The Apostle's Creed |publisher=Bookofconcord.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the services others provide us through family, [[government]], and work, he writes, "we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God."&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"&gt;[http://www.bookofconcord.org/largecatechism/3_tencommandments.html Luther's Large Catechism, First Commandment]&lt;/ref&gt; Since God uses everyone's useful tasks for good, people should look not down upon some useful vocations as being less worthy than others. Instead people should honor others, no matter how lowly, as being the means God uses to work in the world.&lt;ref name="bookofconcord1"/&gt;

==Eastern Orthodox theology==
The doctrine of providence in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is set out by St [[John of Tobolsk]]:
"St. John Damascene describes it thus: 'Providence is Divine will which maintains everything and wisely rules over everything' ... It was not by chance that the iniquitous Israeli King Ahab was struck by an arrow that flew in between the seams of his armor. Truly that arrow was directed by the hand of God, just as was the one which struck Julian the Apostate; only for the soldier who let fly the arrow was it accidental. It was not by chance that swallows flew into the home of Tobit and blinded the righteous man. This happened at God’s command, in order to hold Tobit up as an example to succeeding generations, as we learn from the Angel who accompanied his son Tobias. Nothing happens by chance. It was not by chance that Caesar Augustus ordered the census to be taken in the year of Christ’s Nativity. It was not by chance that Christ met with the Samaritan woman at the well in Sychar and spoke with her. All this was foreseen and written down in the books of Divine Providence before the beginning of time.”&lt;ref&gt;http://livingorthodoxfaith.blogspot.co.za/2009/11/divine-providence-by-st-john-of-tobolsk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swedenborgian theology==
{{See also|The New Church}}
''Divine Providence'' is a book published by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in 1764 which describes his [[systematic theology]] regarding providence, free will, [[theodicy]], and other related topics. Both meanings of providence are applicable in Swedenborg's theology, in that providence encompasses understanding, intent and action. Divine providence relative to man is 'foresight', and relative to the Lord is 'providence'.&lt;ref&gt;S. Warren, Compendium of Swedenborg's Theological Writings, page 480&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg proposes that one law of divine providence is that man should act from freedom according to reason, and that man is regenerated according to the faculties of rationality and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. Divine Providence, note 71-73&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Jewish thought==
{{Main|Divine providence (Judaism)}}
Divine providence ({{lang-he-n|השגחה פרטית}} ''Hashgochoh Protis'' / ''Hashgachah Pratit'' lit. [Divine] supervision of the individual) is discussed throughout [[Rabbinic literature]], and in particular by the classical Jewish philosophers. These writings maintain that divine providence means that God is directing (or even recreating) every minute detail of creation. This analysis thus underpins much of [[Orthodox Judaism]]'s [[world view]], particularly as regards questions of interaction with the natural world.

==LDS theology==
There is little theological literature on the terms '''provenance''' or '''providence''' in LDS studies. As stated above, Reformed theology relates these terms to predestination, which does have more prominence in LDS theology, if only as a polemical term. 

One particular text that could be interpreted as being related to such terms is in the Book of Abraham. As Abraham is shown the heavens, he is also shown the pre-mortal spirits of mankind. &lt;blockquote&gt;And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng|title=Abraham 3|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The "making of rulers" above is explained as foreordination (in the chapter summary) as opposed to "predestination"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/12/i-have-a-question?lang=eng|title=I Have a Question - Ensign Dec. 1990 - ensign|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This differentiation balances free will (or free agency in LDS theology) against Divine intervenion. Noted LDS scholar Richard Draper has described the church's position thusly, "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints rejects the belief in predestination-that God predetermines the salvation or the damnation of every individual ... The LDS position is based in part on the teachings of Paul that God "will render to every man according to his deeds" and that "there is no respect of persons with God" (Rom. 2:6, 11). These two principles provide a basis for understanding Paul's use of the term "predestination." The term apparently connoted "to be ordained beforehand for godly labor." In the sense that one's potential or calling has been recognized and declared, this interpretation conforms with the Greek term Paul used, ''proorizo'', and does not denote an irreversible or irresistible predetermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Predestination|title=Predestination - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not imply a passive God. In fact, LDS theology favours a more active, interventionist God. In its more recent General Conferences of the church, Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, clearly articulates this, "Our lives are like a chessboard, and the Lord moves us from one place to another"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/by-divine-design?lang=eng|title=By Divine Design - By Elder Ronald A. Rasband|last=Rasband|first=By Elder Ronald A.|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rasband continues by citing a well-known text from in the Book of Mormon&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng|title=1 Nephi 4|last=|first=|date=|website=www.lds.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which Nephi finds his nemesis unconscious from inebriation in front of him, he concludes, "Was he fortunate to just happen upon Laban? Or was it by “divine design”?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the text itself limits the interaction of the Divine to the "Spirit" to commanding Nephi to "Slay him."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to note, though, that God also limits his involvement. Rasband interprets one particular passage from the Book of Mormon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/4.24-25?lang=eng#23|title=Helaman 4|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; as saying that God (through his Spirit) will only intervene based on righteousness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rasband concludes that, "When we are righteous, willing, and able, when we are striving to be worthy and qualified, we progress to places we never imagined and become part of Heavenly Father’s “divine design.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specific examples==

===Text of Scripture===
Those who believe in the [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the original [[biblical manuscript]]s often accompany this belief with a statement about how the biblical text has been preserved so that what we have today is at least substantially similar to what was written. That is, just as God "divinely inspired the text," so he has also "divinely preserved it throughout the centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.quodlibet.net/weil-inerrancy.shtml |title=Inerrancy and its Implications for Authority: Textual Critical Considerations in Formulating an Evangelical Doctrine of Scripture |journal=[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]] |volume=4 |issue=4 |date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] states that the Scriptures, "being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical."&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Confession of Faith]], I.viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an important argument in the [[King James Only movement|King James Only]] debates. [[Edward F. Hills]] argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed [[Textus Receptus]] must be the closest text to the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[autograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''King James Version Defended!'', pp. 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">{{About|the narrative device|other uses of "epilogue" and "epilog"|Epilogue (disambiguation)}}
An '''epilogue''' or '''epilog''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐπίλογος ''epílogos'', "conclusion" from ἐπί ''epi'', "in addition" and λόγος ''logos'', "word") is a piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, usually used to bring closure to the work.&lt;ref name="EpiDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Epilogue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks indirectly to the reader, that is more properly considered an [[afterword]]. The opposite is a [[prologue]]&amp;mdash;a piece of writing at the ''beginning'' of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest.&lt;ref name="ProDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Prologue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, for example [[television programs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[video games]], call the epilog an "outro" patterned on the use of "intro" for "introduction".

==In literature==
[[Image:Grandville, Autre Monde, Epilog.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Illustration from ''Un Autre Monde'' epilogue, by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]].]]

An epilogue is the final [[chapter (books)|chapter]] at the end of a [[narrative|story]] that often serves to reveal the fates of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s. Some epilogues may feature [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main [[plot (narrative)|plot]] has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to "speak freely".

An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a [[sequel]].

==In film==
In [[film]]s, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''.

There are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.

The epilogue of ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. 

In many [[documentaries]] and [[biopics]], the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.

==In video gaming==
In [[Video game|video gaming]], epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in [[film]] and [[literature]], providing closure to the end of a story.

However, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. For example, there are four possible endings to ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'', and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.

In games that feature the [[Permadeath|permanent death]] of [[Player character|playable characters]], an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game ''[[Until Dawn]]'' features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.

A [[visual novel]] can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.

==In television==
For many years ''[[The Epilogue]]'', a reflective 5-minute [[sermonette]], was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by [[BBC]] radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.

Since single flexure features are limited both in travel capability and degrees of freedom available, compound flexure systems are designed using combinations of these component features.  Using compound flexures, complex motion profiles with specific degrees of freedom and relatively long travel distances are possible.

== Design aspects ==

In the field of [[precision engineering]] (especially high-precision [[motion control]]), flexures have several key advantages. High precision alignment tasks might not be possible when [[friction]] or [[stiction]] are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=966610&amp;resultClick=1 |title=Three-degree-of-freedom flexure-based manipulator for high-resolution spatial micromanipulation |last=Speich|first=John |publisher=Proc. SPIE Vol. 3519 |date=5 Oct 1998 |website=SPIE Digital Library |access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, conventional [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s or [[linear slide]]s often exhibit positioning [[hysteresis]] due to [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]] and friction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/optomech/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2016/10/Zago-1997.pdf |title=Application of Flexure Structures to Active and Adaptive Opto-Mechanical Mechanisms |last=Zago |first=Lorenzo |publisher=Proc. SPIE Vol. 2871 |date=Mar 1997 |website=University of Arizona Opto-Mechanical Papers Reference |access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexures are able to achieve much lower resolution limits (in some cases measured in the [[nanometer]] scale), because they depend on [[bending]] and/or [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] of flexible elements, rather than surface interaction of many parts (as with a [[ball bearing]]). This makes flexures a critical design feature used in [[optical instrument]]ation such as [[interferometer]]s.

Due to their mode of action, flexures are used for limited range motions and cannot replace long-travel or continuous-rotation adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wp.optics.arizona.edu/optomech/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2016/10/Mir-Presentation.ppt |title=Flexure Mounts for High Resolution Optical Elements |last=Salek |first=Mir |date=2008 |website=University of Arizona Opto-Mechanical Papers Reference |format=PPT |access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, special care must be taken to design the flexure to avoid [[Yield (engineering)|material yielding]] or [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], both of which are potential [[failure cause|failure modes]] in a flexure design.

'''Gender polarization''' is a concept in [[sociology]] by American psychologist [[Sandra Bem]] which states that societies tend to define [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] as polar opposite [[gender]]s, such that male-acceptable behaviors and attitudes are not seen as appropriate for women, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=twsMonnier&gt;Christine Monnier, 2011, Global Sociology, [https://globalsociology.pbworks.com/w/page/14711182/Gendered%20Society%20%E2%80%93%20Basic%20Concepts Gendered Society – Basic Concepts], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, "... Another aspect of such a list of gender traits is that there is no overlap ... societies and cultures create polarized version of gender where one is the opposite of the other...Popular culture is indeed a major conveyor ... "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsRyle&gt;Questioning Gender: A Sociological Exploration, Robyn Ryle, Pine Forge Press, 2012, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G6zKUEYYpwQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=%22Gender+polarization%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GwRYikrZV6&amp;sig=GIWm0ArEiPzRIqGfkPrWjNr4-X8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1N33U--FGI6pyATMiYL4Dw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gender%20polarization%22&amp;f=false ], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, Chapter 4 page 135, "..Gender polarization ... describes the way in which behaviors and attitudes that are viewed as appropriate for men are seen as inappropriate for women and vice versa...."&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is an extension of the [[sex and gender distinction]] in sociology in which [[sex]] refers to the biological differences between men and women, while [[gender]] refers to the cultural differences between them, such that ''gender'' describes the "socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women".&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ ''What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"?'' (World Health Organization (WHO &gt; Programmes and Projects &gt; Gender, Women and Health))], as accessed Aug. 24, 2010 (no author or date &amp; boldfacing omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bem, gender polarization begins when natural sex differences are exaggerated in culture; for example, women have less hair than men,&lt;ref&gt; 5 October 2013, BBC, [http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131004-why-do-men-grow-facial-hair Why can men grow facial hair but women cannot], Retrieved May 24, 2016, "...Androgens are present in both sexes ...

Bem saw gender polarization as an organizing principle upon which many of the basic institutions of a society are built.&lt;ref name=twsDaniels&gt;Polygendered and Ponytailed: The Dilemma of Femininity and the Female Athlete, 2009, Women's Press, Dayna B.

According to Scott Coltrane and Michele Adams, gender polarization begins early in childhood when girls are encouraged to prefer pink over blue, and when boys are encouraged to prefer toy trucks over dolls, and the male-female distinction is communicated to children in countless ways.&lt;ref name=twsRowman&gt;Gender and Families, Scott Coltrane, Michele Adams, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_Hv2Rrj7ukwC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Gender+polarization%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RcqbRS-N5P&amp;sig=u_Ke-oATVkadDLNRNDsy250Huf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1N33U--FGI6pyATMiYL4Dw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gender%20polarization%22&amp;f=false Engendering Children (chapter)], Retrieved Aug. 22, 2014, (page 183+) "...Gender polarization organizes the daily lives of children from the moment they are born: pink vs. blue to dolls vs. trucks...."&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn by observing others and by direct tutelage what they "can and cannot do in terms of gendered behavior", according to Elizabeth Lindsey and Walter Zakahi.&lt;ref name=twsDindia&gt;Sex Differences and Similarities in Communication, edited by Kathryn Dindia, Daniel J.

Further, any deviation from these scripts was seen as problematic, possibly defined as "immoral acts" which flout religious customs, or seen as "psychologically pathological".&lt;ref name=twsDaniels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], '''homotopy type theory''' ('''HoTT''' {{IPAc-en|h|ɒ|t}}) is the [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]] turning the judgement that two terms of a given type are equal in [[intensional type theory]] into an actual identity type. More broadly, homotopy type theory refers to various lines of development of [[intensional type theory]], based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract) [[homotopy theory]] applies.
		 	
This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and [[Higher category theory|higher-categorical]] [[Model (mathematical logic)|models]] for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or [[internal language]]) for abstract homotopy theory and [[higher category theory]]; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic [[foundation of mathematics|foundation]] (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the [[Formal proof|formalization]] of each of these in computer [[proof assistant]]s.

There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the [[univalent foundations]] project.  Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Shulman|first=Michael|author-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician) |eprint=1601.05035v3|title=Homotopy Type Theory: A synthetic approach to higher equalities |date=2016-01-27}}, footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.

== History ==

===Prehistory: the groupoid model===
At one time the idea that types in [[Intuitionistic type theory#Extensional versus intensional|intensional type theory]] with their identity types could be regarded as groupoids was [[mathematical folklore]]. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and [[Thomas Streicher]] called "The groupoid interpretation of type theory", in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of [[groupoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Martin |last1=Hofmann |last2=Streicher |first2=Thomas |author2-link=Thomas Streicher| chapter=The groupoid interpretation of type theory |mr=1686862 |editor1-first=Giovanni |editor1-last=Sambin |editor2-first=Jan M. |editor2-last=Smith |title=Twenty Five Years of Constructive Type Theory |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLnKggT_In4C&amp;pg=PA83 |date=1998 |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-158903-4 |pages=83–111 |series=Oxford Logic Guides |volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first truly "[[Homotopical algebra|homotopical]]" model of type theory, albeit only "1-[[dimension]]al" (the traditional models in the [[category of sets]] being homotopically 0-dimensional).

Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called "universe extensionality", which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the ''univalence axiom'' that [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a [[Coherence condition|coherence]] notion of "equivalence" is not required.)  They also defined "categories with isomorphism as equality" and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have "equivalence is equality"; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benedikt |last=Ahrens |first2=Krzysztof |last2=Kapulkin |first3=Michael |last3=Shulman |author3-link=Michael Shulman (mathematician)|title=Univalent categories and the Rezk completion |journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science |volume=25 |year=2015|issue= 5|pages= 1010–1039|arxiv=1303.0584 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000486|mr=3340533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history: model categories and higher groupoids===
The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using [[Model category|Quillen model categories]]. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/FMCS/FMCS_06/FMCS06.html Foundational Methods in Computer Science, University of Calgary, June 7th - 9th, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; at which Warren gave a talk titled "Homotopy models of intensional type theory", which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren's thesis prospectus abstract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mawarren.net/papers/prospectus.pdf Michael Warren, "Homotopy Models of Intensional Type Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a subsequent workshop about identity types at [[Uppsala University]] in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.math.uu.se/~palmgren/itt/ Identity Types - Topological and Categorical Structure, Workshop, Uppsala, November 13-14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, "Factorisation systems for type theory",&lt;ref&gt;[http://comp.mq.edu.au/~rgarner/Papers/Uppsala.pdf Richard Garner, Factorisation axioms for type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; and one by Michael Warren, "Model categories and intensional identity types". Related ideas were discussed in the talks by [[Steve Awodey]], "Type theory of higher-dimensional categories", and [[Thomas Streicher]], "Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems". At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled "Types as weak omega-categories" where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.

All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=Benno van den |last=Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Topological and simplicial models of identity types |date=27 July 2010 |arxiv=1007.4638}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general solution, building on Voevodsky's construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter LeFanu |last=Lumsdaine |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=The local universes model: an overlooked coherence construction for dependent type theories |date=6 November 2014 |arxiv=1411.1736 |doi=10.1145/2754931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the PSSL86 in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/psslHomeEN.html 86th edition of the Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic, Henri Poincaré University, September 8-9 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Awodey gave a talk titled "Homotopy type theory" (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loria.fr/~lamarche/listPart.html Preliminary list of PSSL86 participants]&lt;/ref&gt;). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper "Homotopy theoretic models of identity types", which was posted on the [[ArXiv]] preprint server in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steve |last=Awodey |first2=Michael A. |last2=Warren |title=Homotopy theoretic models of identity types |date=3 September 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0709.0248 |doi=10.1017/S0305004108001783 |volume=146 |journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |page=45|bibcode=2008MPCPS.146...45A }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren's thesis "Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory" in 2008.

At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list  "A very short note on homotopy [[lambda calculus]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/Voevodsky_note.ps ''A very short note on homotopy λ-calculus'', by Vladimir Voevodsky, September 27, 2006] PDF&lt;/ref&gt; which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan [[simplicial set]]s. It began by saying "The homotopy λ-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system" and ended with "At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial" referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of "equality types" that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.

On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an ω-category, and indeed a ω-groupoid, in the "globular, algebraic" sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper "Types are weak omega-groupoids" (published 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Benno |last=van den Berg |first2=Richard |last2=Garner |title=Types are weak omega-groupoids |date=1 December 2007 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=0812.0298 |doi=10.1112/plms/pdq026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper "Weak ω-Categories from Intensional Type Theory" (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis "Higher Categories from Type Theories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Lumsdaine |title=Higher Categories from Type Theories |date=2010 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |url=http://lib.rett.org.uk/~peterlefanulumsdaine/research/Lumsdaine-2010-Thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The univalence axiom, synthetic homotopy theory, and higher inductive types===
The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/vladimirias/2006_Mar_Homotopy_lambda_calculus Notes on homotopy lambda calculus, March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-Löf type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-Löf type theory appeared only in 2009.

Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in [[Kan complex]]es, and observed that the existence of a universal [[Kan fibration]] could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield,  that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.

To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way  to define "equivalences" syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement "f is an equivalence" was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a ''syntactic'' statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher's "universe extensionality" to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of "synthetic homotopy theory" in the proof assistant [[Coq]]; this formed the basis of the library later called "Foundations" and eventually "UniMath".&lt;ref name=UniMath&gt;[https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath GitHub repository, Univalent Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and [[Robert Harper (computer scientist)|Robert Harper]], Dan Licata, [[Michael Shulman (mathematician)|Michael Shulman]], and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky's good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.

The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]] in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-Löf, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled "The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hottheory.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/report-11_2011.pdf Mini-Workshop: ''The Homotopy Interpretation of Constructive Type Theory'', Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach, February 27th – March 5th, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/andrejbauer/Homotopy GitHub repository, Andrej Bauer, Homotopy theory in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; based on Voevodsky's ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the "HoTT" Coq library&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/commit/1fb4ed9e5cdc5494f26ae6d13c4ebc851b81e1ba GitHub Basic homotopy type theory, Andrej Bauer &amp; Vladimir Voevodsky, Apr 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first commit of the latter&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT GitHub repository, Homotopy type theory]&lt;/ref&gt; by Michael Shulman notes "Development based on Andrej Bauer's files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky's files"). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Shulman |title=Univalence for inverse diagrams and homotopy canonicity |date=15 March 2012 |publisher=Cornell University Library |arxiv=1203.3253 |doi=10.1017/S0960129514000565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~drl/pubs/lh112tt/lh112tt.pdf ''Canonicity for 2-Dimensional Type Theory'', by Daniel R. Licata and Robert Harper, Carnegie Mellon University, July 21, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky's Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).

Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the ''Homotopy Type Theory website and blog''&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/blog Homotopy Type Theory blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Univalent foundations==
The phrase "univalent foundations" is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way.  It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/ Type Theory and Univalent Foundations]&lt;/ref&gt;

As Voevodsky's work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, "univalent foundations" was sometimes used interchangeably with "homotopy type theory",&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;  and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncatlab.org/homotopytypetheory/show/References Homotopy Type Theory: References]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as "univalent foundations", although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations.  The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled "Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics"; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.&lt;ref name=hott/&gt;

[[File:The making of HoTT book.webm|thumb|An animation showing development of the HoTT Book on the GitHub repository by the participants in the Univalent Foundations Special Year project.]]
In 2012–13 researchers at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] held "A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/univalent IAS school of mathematics:  Special Year on The Univalent Foundations of Mathematics]&lt;/ref&gt;  The special year brought together researchers in [[topology]], [[computer science]], [[category theory]], and [[mathematical logic]]. The program was organized by [[Steve Awodey]],  [[Thierry Coquand]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky]].

During the program  [[Peter Aczel]], who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called '''HoTT Book''')&lt;ref name=hott&gt;{{cite book|author=Univalent Foundations Program|title=Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics|year=2013|publisher=Institute for Advanced Study|url=http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Official announcement of The HoTT Book, by Steve Awodey, 20 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on [[GitHub]], is released under a [[Creative Commons license]] that allows people to [[fork (software development)|fork]] their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=D |last=Monroe |title=A New Type of Mathematics? |journal=Comm ACM |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=13–15 |year=2014 |doi=10.1145/2557446 |url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2014/2/171675-a-new-type-of-mathematics/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2013/06/the_hott_book.html Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Mike Shulman at The n-Category Café, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.andrej.com/2013/06/20/the-hott-book/ Announcement of The HoTT Book, by Andrej Bauer, June 20, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.

=== "Propositions as types" ===
HoTT uses a modified version of the "[[Propositions as types principle|propositions as types]]" interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs.  In HoTT, however, unlike in standard "propositions as types", a special role is played by 'mere propositions' which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to [[propositional equality]].  These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.

=== Equality ===
The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the [[path (topology)|path]]. In HoTT, the type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; is the type of all paths from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. (Therefore, a proof that a point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; equals a point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the same thing as a path from the point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to the point &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.) For any point &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; can be inverted, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;b = a&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; resp. &lt;math&gt;b = c&lt;/math&gt; can be concatenated, forming a path of type &lt;math&gt;a = c&lt;/math&gt;; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.

Most importantly, given a path &lt;math&gt;p:a=b&lt;/math&gt;, and a proof of some property &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt;, the proof can be "transported" along the path &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to yield a proof of the property &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently stated, an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt; can be turned into an object of type &lt;math&gt;P(b)&lt;/math&gt;.) This corresponds to the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; has been established, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.

In general, a "proposition" can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, the space of paths &lt;math&gt;a = a&lt;/math&gt; may be non-trivial in some way. A "mere proposition" is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial [[Path space (algebraic topology)|path space]].

Note that people write &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;Id_A(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;, 
thereby leaving the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; implicit. 
Do not confuse it with &lt;math&gt;id_A : A\to A&lt;/math&gt;, denoting the identity function on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Type equivalence ===
Two types &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; belonging to some universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; are defined as being ''equivalent'' if there exists an ''equivalence'' between them. An equivalence is a function 
:&lt;math&gt;f:A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, the following types are both inhabited:
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{B\rightarrow B}(f \circ g, id_B),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Id_{A \rarr A}(h \circ f, id_A).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;f \circ g =_{B\rightarrow B} id_B,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h \circ f =_{A\rightarrow A} id_A.&lt;/math&gt; 
This expresses a general notion of "f has both a left inverse and right inverse", using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types &lt;math&gt;A\rarr A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B\rarr B&lt;/math&gt;.  One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{y:B}.\ Id_B((f \circ g)(y), id_B(y)),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi_{x:A}.\ Id_A((h \circ f)(x), id_A(x)).&lt;/math&gt; 
i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;x:A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y:B&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;f(g(y)) =_B y,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h(f(x)) =_A x.&lt;/math&gt;

The functions of type
:&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;
together with a proof that they are equivalences are denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;A \simeq B&lt;/math&gt;.

=== The univalence axiom ===
Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.
In other words, there is a function of the type
:&lt;math&gt;(A = B) \to (A \simeq B),&lt;/math&gt;
which expresses that types &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.

The '''univalence axiom''' states that this function is itself an equivalence.&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|115}}  Therefore, we have

: &lt;math&gt;(A = B) \simeq (A \simeq B)&lt;/math&gt;

"In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence. In particular, one may say that 'equivalent
types are identical'."&lt;ref name=hott /&gt;{{rp|4}}

== Applications ==

=== Theorem proving ===
HoTT allows mathematical proofs to be translated into a [[computer programming language]] for computer [[proof assistant]]s much more easily than before. This approach offers the potential for computers to check difficult proofs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/new-foundation-mathematics?et_cid=4133336&amp;et_rid=677699018&amp;location=top|title = A new foundation for mathematics|date = 3 September 2014|accessdate = 6 September 2014|website = |publisher = R&amp;D Magazine|last = Meyer|first = Florian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal of mathematics is to formulate axioms from which virtually all mathematical theorems can be derived and proven unambiguously. Correct proofs in mathematics must follow the rules of logic. They must be derivable without error from [[axiom]]s and already-proven statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

HoTT adds the univalence axiom, which relates the equality of logical-mathematical propositions to homotopy theory. An equation such as “a=b” is a mathematical proposition in which two different symbols have the same value. In homotopy type theory, this is taken to mean that the two shapes which represent the values of the symbols are topologically equivalent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These topological equivalence relationships, [[ETH Zürich]] Institute for Theoretical Studies director [[Giovanni Felder]] argues, can be better formulated in homotopy theory because it is more comprehensive: Homotopy theory explains not only why “a equals b” but also how to derive this. In set theory, this information would have to be defined additionally, which makes the translation of mathematical propositions into programming languages more difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Computer programming ===
{{section expand|date=December 2014}}
As of 2015, intense research work was underway to model and formally analyse the computational behavior of the univalence axiom in homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2676983|title = Higher Inductive Types as Homotopy-Initial Algebras|last = Sojakova|first = Kristina|date = 2015|conference = POPL 2015|doi = 10.1145/2676726.2676983|access-date = |arxiv = 1402.0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cubical type theory'' is one attempt to give computational content to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cubical Type Theory: a constructive interpretation of the univalence axiom|url=https://hal-iogs.archives-ouvertes.fr/INRIA/hal-01378906v2|last1=Cohen|first1=Cyril|last2=Coquand|first2=Thierry|last3=Huber|first3=Simon|last4=Mörtberg |first4=Anders|conference=TYPES 2015|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is believed that certain objects, such as semi-simplicial types, cannot be constructed without reference to some notion of exact equality. Therefore, various ''two-level type theories'' have been developed which partition their types into fibrant types, which respect paths, and non-fibrant types, which do not. Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory is the first two-level type theory which gives a full computational interpretation to homotopy type theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Cartesian Cubical Computational Type Theory: Constructive Reasoning with Paths and Equalities| last1=Anguili|first1=Carlo|last2=Favonia|last3=Harper|first3=Robert|conference=Computer Science Logic 2018|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/cartesian/paper.pdf|year=2018|accessdate=26 Aug 2018}} (to appear)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hossein Alizâdeh''' ({{lang-fa|حسین علیزاده}}) is an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] musician, composer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/News/?id=51431|title=همشهری آنلاین|website=Hamshahrionline.ir|date=November 21, 2011|accessdate=December 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916170156/http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/News/?id=51431|archivedate=September 16, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[radif (music)|radif]]-preserver, researcher, teacher, and [[tar (lute)|tar]] and [[setar (lute)|setar]] instrumentalist and improviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Craig|title=Hossein Alizâdeh &gt; Biography|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p141810|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has performed with such musicians as [[Shahram Nazeri]], [[Madjid Khaladj]], and [[Jivan Gasparyan]], as well as with a number of orchestras and ensembles.

==Music career==
Alizâdeh was born in 1951 in [[Tehran]] to an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] father (from [[Urmia]]) and a [[Persian people|Persian]] mother (from [[Arak, Iran|Arak]]).&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hossein-aliz%C3%A2deh-mn0000264913/biography |title=Hossein Alizâdeh: Artist Biography|last=Harris|first=Craig|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager he attended [[secondary school]] at a music conservatory&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; until 1975. His music studies continued at the [[University of Tehran]], where his focus was [[Musical composition|composition]] and performance.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; He began postgraduate studies at the [[Tehran University of Art]]. After the [[Iranian Revolution]], he resumed his studies at the [[University of Berlin]], where he studied  composition and [[musicology]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Alizâdeh plays the ''[[Tar (string instrument)|tar]]'' and ''[[setar]]''. He has performed with two of Iran's national orchestras, as well as with the [[Aref Ensemble]], the Shayda Ensemble,&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; and [[Masters of Persian Music]]. In Europe, his first professional performance was with the Bejart Ballet Company’s orchestra in a performance of a [[Maurice Béjart]] ballet called ''Golestan''.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Over the years Alizâdeh's teachers have included [[Houshang Zarif]], [[Ali Akbar Shahnazi]], [[Nur-Ali Borumand]], [[Mahmoud Karimi (musician)|Mahmoud Karimi]], [[Abdollah Davami]], [[Yusef Forutan]], and [[Sa'id Hormozi]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}

==Awards==
He has been nominated for the 2007 Grammy Award along with Armenian musician, [[Djivan Gasparyan]], for their collaboration album, ''The Endless Vision''.
In 2008, he was voted as "Iran's most distinguished musician of the year".

In November 28, 2014 he refused to accept France’s high distinction in art, [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.mehrnews.com/detail/News/104838|title=Iranian musician refuses French Chevalier of Legion of Honor|date=November 29, 2014|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions==
* ''Dâd o Bidâd'': A new [[dastgah|maqâm]] in Persian music, through combining the [[dastgah|gusheh]] of dâd in [[dastgah]] of Mahour and the gusheh of bidâd in dastgah of Homayoun.
* ''[[Sallaneh (lute)|Sallaneh]]'' and ''[[Shurangiz|Shoor-Angiz]]'': Two new musical instruments derived from the ancient Persian lute ''barbat''.

'''Looted art''' has been a consequence of [[looting]] during war, [[natural disaster]] and [[riot]] for centuries. Looting of [[art]], [[archaeology]] and other cultural property may be an opportunistic criminal act or may be a more organized case of [[Crime|unlawful]] or [[unethical]] pillage by the victor of a conflict.  The term "looted art" reflects bias, and whether particular art has been taken legally or illegally is often the subject of conflicting laws and subjective interpretations of governments and people; use of the term "looted art" in reference to a particular art object implies that the art was taken illegally.

Related terms include ''[[art theft]]'' (the stealing of valuable artifacts, mostly because of commercial reasons), ''[[illicit antiquities]]'' (covertly traded antiquities or artifacts of archaeological interest, found in illegal or unregulated excavations), ''[[provenance]]'' (the origin or source of a piece of art), and ''[[art repatriation]]'' (the process of returning artworks and antiques to their rightful owners).

Art [[looting]] has a long history, the winning party of armed conflicts often plundering the loser, and in the absence of social order, the local population often joining in. The contents of nearly all the tombs of the [[Pharaoh]]s were already completely looted by [[grave robber]]s before the invasion of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. There have been a total of seven [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sackings of Rome]]. The [[Old Testament]] includes several references to looting and to the looting of art and treasures; in the [[Book of Chronicles]] it is said: "King [[Shishak]] of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that [[Solomon]] had made",&lt;ref&gt;2 Chronicles. Chapter. 12:9. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Book of Jeremiah]] 15:11 [[The name of God in Judaism#In English|the Lord]] says: "Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good. I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress ... I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder. I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah 15:11. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous examples include the Roman [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Sack of Corinth]] in 146 BC, the Sack of  [[Constantinople]] by the [[Fourth Crusade]], the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Sack of Baghdad in 1258]], [[Hernán Cortés]] and the looting of the [[Aztec]] gold. In only some of these was the removal of artworks for their own sake (rather than the value of their materials for example) a primary motivation.

Since the rise of an [[Illicit antiquities|art market]] for monumental sculpture, abandoned monuments all over the world have been at risk, notably in [[Iran]], the old territories of [[Mesoamerican culture]] and Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;Mydans, Seth. Raiders of Lost Art Loot Temples in Cambodia. New York Times, April 1, 1999,Section A, Page 4, Column 3, 1152 words&lt;/ref&gt;

After the looting of Europe by Napoleon, others copied the institutionalized model of systematic plunder and looting. During the [[American Civil War]], legal frameworks and guidelines emerged that justified and legalized the plunder and looting of opposing parties and nations. [[Henry Wager Halleck]], a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer argued: "No belligerent would be justifiable in destroying temples, tombs, statutes [sic], paintings, or other works of art (except so far as their destruction may be the accidental or necessary result of military operations.) But, may he not seize and appropriate to his own use such works of genius and taste as belong to the hostile state, and are of a moveable character?".&lt;ref&gt;Halleck. International law, or, Rules regulating the intercourse of states in peace and war. Ch. XIX, Sections 10–11. (1861)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, [[Francis Lieber]], a professor at [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], who had worked with Halleck on guidelines for guerrilla warfare, was asked by Halleck, now [[General-in-Chief]] of [[Union Army|armies of the Union]], to develop a code of conduct for the armed forces. The code of conduct, published as General Orders No. 100 on April 24, 1863, signed by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]], later became known as the [[Lieber Code]]&lt;ref name=lieber&gt;Francis Lieber, LL.D. [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lieber.htm Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field]. Originally Issued as General Orders No. 100, Adjutant General's Office, 1863, Washington 1898: [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically authorized the Armies of the United States to plunder and loot the enemy – a mindset that Hitler's armies copied one century later. The Lieber Code said in Article 36: "If such works of art, libraries, collections, or instruments belonging to a hostile nation or government, can be removed without injury, the ruler of the conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed for the benefit of the said nation. The ultimate ownership is to be settled by the ensuing treaty of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Hartigan, Richard Shelly, ed. Lieber's Code and the Law of War. Chicago: Precedent, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Leon. The Law of War: A Documentary History. New York: Random House, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian and American forces relied on similar frameworks when they plundered Germany after the defeat of the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name=ushmm&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Looted Art. http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/bibliography/index.php?content=looted_art&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lieber Code further defined the conditions of looting and the relationship between private plunder and booty and institutionalized looting "All captures and booty belong, according to the modern law of war, primarily to the government of the captor." (Article 45), "Neither officers nor soldiers are allowed to make use of their position or power in the hostile country for private gain, not even for commercial transactions otherwise legitimate." (Article 46) and "... [I]f large sums are found upon the persons of prisoners, or in their possession, they shall be taken from them, and the surplus, after providing for their own support, appropriated for the use of the army, under the direction of the commander, unless otherwise ordered by the government." (Article 72)&lt;ref name=lieber/&gt;

Massive art looting occurred during [[World War II]]; see [[art theft during World War II]].

==Looting of countries==

===Looting of Afghanistan===
Many art pieces and artifacts from Afghanistan were looted during several wars; scores of artworks were smuggled to Britain and sold to wealthy collectors. "There are also fears that the bulk of the collection once in [[Kabul Museum]], ... is now in smugglers' or collectors' hands. The most famous exhibits were the [[Begram ivories]], a series of exquisite Indian panels nearly 2,000 years old, excavated by French archaeologists in the Thirties (1930s)".&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,450009,00.html Looted Afghan art smuggled to London]. [[The Observer]]. March 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2004, much of the missing collection numbering 22,513 items was found safely hidden. Over 200 crates had been moved downtown for storage at the end of the Soviet occupation including the Bactrian gold and Bagram Ivories.&lt;ref&gt;Carlotta Gall. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/18/international/middleeast/18afghan.html Afghan Artifacts, Feared Lost, Are Discovered Safe in Storage]. [[New York Times]]. November 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Some 228 of these treasures, including pieces of Bactrian Gold and many of the Bagram Ivories, were exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., from May 25 to September 7, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/afghanistaninfo.shtm Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul]. Nga.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Looting of Cyprus===
Following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 by [[Turkey]] and the occupation of the northern part of the island, churches belonging to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] have been looted in what is described as “one of the most systematic examples of the looting of art since World War II”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Morris, Chris. “Shame of Cyprus’s Looted Churches”. BBC News. 18 January 2002. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1768274.stm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"&gt;Miller, Judith, &amp; Stephen Kinzer. “Greek Orthodox Church Icons Ravaged in the Turkish Part of Cyprus”.

Most notable was the case of the Kanakaria mosaics, 6th-century AD frescos that were removed from the original church, trafficked to the US and offered for sale to a museum for the sum of US$20,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Litigators of the lost art – court orders return of Byzantine mosaics to their homeland|journal=Saturday Evening Post|date=October 1989|first=Steve|last=Mannheimer|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-7980763.html |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subsequently recovered by the Orthodox Church following a court case in Indianapolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyrprus v.

The northern part of the island is where the church and art looting was concentrated.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel1"&gt;“Cyprus History”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 12 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/cyprus-history/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is rumored that the Turkish-Cypriot leaders did not feel an obligation to preserve the artifacts and monuments in the north because they felt that the Greek-Cypriot government had oppressed them for too long.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;

Archaeological sites, museums, churches, monasteries, castles, libraries, and private art collections have all been affected by the looting of the northern area of Cyprus; icons, frescoes, archaeological artifacts, and cultural heritage have been stripped from areas around the island and have been taken to places all over the world or simply destroyed.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"&gt;Jansen, Michael. “The Pillage by Turkey of the 12,000 year old cultural heritage of Cyprus”.

====Non-Christian places of importance====

Many non-Christian sites have been affected by the looting and destruction of northern Cyprus. During the time of the invasion, work on archaeological sites was halted. While the projects on the Greek-Cypriot southern area were started again after a short period of delay, the projects in the Turkish north were never started again. Many of the houses and workshops associated with archaeological projects in the north were looted, so the work that had been done was lost to the researchers.&lt;ref name="Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976"&gt;Nicolaou, Kyriakos. 1976. “Archaeological News from Cyprus, 1974”. American Journal of Archaeology, 80 (4):361-375.&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas on the island of Cyprus were damaged by bombing and machine gun fire, and because of these issues, the pavement mosaics of the House of Dionysos in Paphos suffered extensive damage. The fighting not only was destroying Byzantine and Christian cultural heritage, but it was even destroying culture that had been in existence for far longer. There have been appeals filed with UNESCO, ICOM, and ICOMOS to help with the preservation of the remaining cultural heritage on the island, and a representative of UNESCO was appointed to help by 1976.&lt;ref name="Nicolaou, Kyriakos 1976"/&gt;

====Looted religious sites and icons====

On the island of Cyprus before the invasion, the majority of the inhabitants were Greek-Cypriots, and for these citizens, the Greek Orthodox Church was and continues today to be central to their identity and faith.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt; In the north, there is a fear that Christianity is dying out because the churches and monasteries have been destroyed, transformed, or are falling into ruin. The northern Turkish inhabitants have transformed some former religious sites into mosques, army barracks, stables, night clubs and hotels, and it has been documented that only 3 churches and 1 monastery are currently in a dignified state out of the 520 churches and monasteries that were in the northern area of the country before the Turkish invasion.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;“Greek Orthodox Church sues Turkey Over Access to Religious Sites in Cyprus”. The Guardian. The Associated Press in Nicosia. 23 November 2009. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/24/greek-orthodox-church-sues-turkey?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"&gt;Magister, Sandro. ”Cyprus: Portrait of a Christianity Obliterated”. Chiesa News. Gruppo Editoriale L’Espresso Spa. 3 September 2006. Web. 9 February 2012. &lt;http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/46544?eng=y&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 55 churches have been converted into mosques, while another 50 churches and monasteries have been converted into other structures to serve the Turkish-Cypriots’.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet2005"/&gt; A spokesman for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus stated that the transformations of buildings happened because the buildings were falling into ruin, and he also stated that it is an Ottoman custom to transform buildings attributed to other religions into mosques; this idea can be linked to other Islamic sites, like the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"/&gt;

Yannis Eliades, the director of the Byzantine Museum of Nicosia, has estimated that 25,000 icons have disappeared since the Turkish military initially invaded the island in 1974, while others estimate that between 15,000 and 20,000 icons are missing, along with dozens of frescoes and mosaics dating between the 6th and 15th centuries, thousands of chalices, wood carvings, crucifixes, and Bibles.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="repubblica2006"/&gt; However, there have been some case in which the Church of Cyprus was able to reclaim icons or mosaics, and this is a great step forward for the reformation of their cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt;

The transformations of religious sites have also spurred lawsuits from the few hundred Greek-Cypriots that are still living in the northern area. The Greek Orthodox Church has taken Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights because they were preventing practicing Christians from worshiping at previously religious, but currently transformed buildings. Even though the buildings have been destroyed or converted, the Greek-Cypriot citizens still want to be able to worship at these places to keep continuity with their faith without regard to the destruction.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt;

====Aydin Dikmen considered a key suspect====

Aydin Dikmen is a 60-year-old man who has been arrested in relation to the looting and selling of looted goods from the island of Cyprus. He had been suspected of being involved in the selling of looted art since 1982, but he kept a low profile and fell off the radar for some time.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; His involvement was cemented when Peg Goldberg was sued by the Church of Cyprus in 1989 because she knew that she bought the mosaics from Dikmen; he claimed that he found the remains in the rubble of a church that had been forgotten and basically destroyed while he was working as an archaeologist in the northern part of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"&gt;Bourloyannis, M. Christiane, and Virginia Morris. 1992. “Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus v. Goldberg &amp; Feldman Fine Arts, Inc”. The American Journal of International Law, 86 (1): 128-133.&lt;/ref&gt; We also have documentation of another transaction where Dikmen worked with art collectors in the United States; Dominique de Menil, of the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, bought two 13th-century frescoes from Dikmen on behalf of the Church of Cyprus in 1983.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

Those two previous cases are only two cases in which Dikmen’s presence has been suggested; he has been implicated in many more transactions, but those accusations have yet to be proven. However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning of another residence of Dikmen’s, the authorities found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; Also in one of the residences, the authorities found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates in the northern part of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus.&lt;ref name="nytimes1998"/&gt;

Since Dikmen’s arrest in 1998, the Antiphonitis frescoes and the Kanakarian mosaics have been returned to Cyprus, and soon the 13th-century frescoes currently housed by the Menil Collection in Houston will be returned to the island, as well.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="menil1"&gt;“The Menil Collection Celebrates Return of Byzantine Frescoes With Public Events Honoring Sacred Works”.

Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.menil.org/documents/MenilCelebratesReturnofByzantineFrescoeswithPublicEventsHonoringSacredWorks.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The search for the looted art of Cyprus continues, and there seems to be more and more evidence of Dikmen’s presence in other transactions of international looted art. Many think that Dikmen is just a middle man who is working on behalf of more knowledgeable and rich patrons, but the mystery is still not solved. Hopefully the truth will be discovered in the future, and these beautiful artifacts, icons, mosaics, and frescoes can be returned to Cyprus to enhance their cultural heritage and identity.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

====Cases of repatriation====

=====The Menil Collection and 13th-century frescoes=====
One case of repatriation for the Church of Cyprus is associated with the Menil Collection, based in Houston, Texas.&lt;ref name="artdaily1"&gt;Hadjicostis, Menalaos. “Cyprus to get back rare 13th-century Orthodox frescoes from United States Museum”.

The original Cypriot chapel in the Ayios Themomianos Church in the northern part of Cyprus was a small limestone structure, with a central dome and pointed barrel vaults; the original was mostly used for prayer because of its small size.&lt;ref&gt;“Byzantine Frescoes: Origins”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/origins/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; When the de Menil collection was granted temporary possession of the frescoes, they constructed a chapel to house the frescoes and keep them safe. This specially built chapel was designed by De Menil’s husband, François de Menil, who studied traditional Byzantine architecture and spatial arrangement from the original chapel at Lysi; the layout and the placement of the mosaics mirrors the arrangement from the original chapel.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel3"&gt;“The Byzantine Fresco Chapel: Architecture”. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/architecture/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the chapel has black walls which are illuminated to create a sense of vastness and infinity; the black walls help to focus the attention of the viewer on the frescoes and create a divine experience for the viewer.&lt;ref name="byzantinefrescochapel3"/&gt;

Icons are important because they depict images of greater significance, and they are used to instruct and inspire worship.&lt;ref&gt;Imprinting the Divine: Byzantine and Russian Icons from Houston’s Menil Collection”.

=====Boy George and the Gold Icon of Christ=====
One Cypriot artifact that has been found was in the home of pop singer Boy George, also known as George O’Dowd.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;“Boy George Returns Christ Icon to Cyprus Church”. BBC News. 19 January 2011. Web. 7 February 2012. &lt; https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12228059&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The artifact, a golden icon of Christ, had been hanging above the singer’s fireplace for 26 years, until the piece was recognized by a patron watching a TV interview of O’Dowd, which was taped in the singer’s living room.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper1"&gt;“Boy George, his Striking Icon and the Cypriot Bishop”.

However, it will not be going back to the original Church in the northern part of Cyprus; it is being held in Brussels, Belgium, and it will return to Cyprus at a later date when The Church of Cyprus has an appropriate space in which it can be stored.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artdaily3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian2"/&gt; This case has contributed to the Church of Cyprus and their efforts to repatriate “stolen spiritual treasures” that have come from their homeland of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=====Peg Goldberg and the Kankarian mosaics=====
This case study outlines the events that occurred in 1989 between Peg Goldberg, a local art dealer in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg gained “ownership” and then tried to sell Cypriot mosaics from the 6th century. These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kankaria in the village of Lythrangomi in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century.&lt;ref name="cyprusnet2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt; These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine’s monastery in Sinai.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt; The Kankarian mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt;

These mosaics first came into the view of the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg approached the Getty Museum to purchase the mosaic pieces. The Getty Museum recognized them as the lost Kankarian mosaics and informed Cyprus that they were in the United States. Shortly afterward, the Church of Cyprus filed a claim at the district court to try to reclaim the mosaics.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; The federal court in Indiana made a verdict in favor of the Church of Cyprus, and the mosaics were returned in 1991 to the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt; The verdict showed that Goldberg could not own the pieces because Dikmen had stolen the mosaics and had no right to pass on the ownership of the stolen mosaics. Goldberg stated that the pieces had been bought “in good faith” from a “Turkish antiquities dealer” who found the mosaics in an abandoned church, but the judge ruled that not looking into the background and workings of the dealer was unacceptable because it was her responsibility to look into the people she was working with.&lt;ref name="europesworld2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; This case called in the multilateral treaty of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which calls for all available parties to help recover and return items that have been requested by the country of origin; using this international decree helped to show the importance of these artifacts which needed to be sent to their home land of Cyprus.&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; People have been happy with this verdict for the Kankarian case because they want others to realize that cultural heritage of the world is not for sale, and hopefully discourage further selling of looted art in the international market.&lt;ref name="nytimes1990"&gt;[[William H. Honan|Honan, William H]]. “Art Dealer Told Again to Return Mosaics”. Arts. The New York Times. 26 Oct 1990. Web. 1 March 2012. &lt; https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/arts/art-dealer-told-again-to-return-mosaics.html?emc=eta1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic pieces that were involved in the Kankarian case have four different religious images. They depict Jesus as a young boy, the archangel Michael, Matthew and James; the final two are images of apostles from the 1st century.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bourloyannis, M. Christiane 1992"/&gt; The mosaics were named after the Church in which they were placed originally around 530.&lt;ref name="nytimes1990"/&gt; These mosaics have fallen into destruction because of the damage that they experienced through the process of removal from the church, shipping around the world, and during the restoration work that Goldberg commissioned. It is unlikely that these mosaics will ever be reinstalled in their original home, even if there are changes in the political situation on Cyprus, because they would most likely not make it through the re-installation process in the state that they are currently in.&lt;ref name="archaeology1998"/&gt;

===Looting of Germany===
After World War II, Germany was looted by Allied and Soviet forces; the systematic pillaging and looting by the Allies (particularly the [[Soviet Union]]) is still causing disputes and conflicts between Germany, Russia and the United States, as many of the objects have never been returned to Germany.

[[Poland]] is also in possession of some collections that Germany evacuated to remote places in Eastern Germany (the [[Recovered Territories]] that are part of Poland since 1945) as well as in [[occupied Poland]]. Among those there is a large collection from Berlin, which in Polish referred to as ''[[Berlinka (art collection)|Berlinka]]''. Another notable collection in Polish possession is [[Hermann Göring]]'s collection of 25 historic airplanes (''Deutsche Luftfahrt Sammlung'') – ironically, it contains two Polish planes captured by Germans during their invasion of Poland (including a [[PZL P-11c]] of [[Army Kraków]]).&lt;ref name="GW2007"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34239,4554829.html Rosjanie oddają skradzione dzieła sztuki], Gazeta Wyborcza, 2007-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; Poland refuses to return those collections to Germany unless Germany returns some of the collections looted in Poland and still in its possession in exchange.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;

Entire libraries and archives with files from all over Europe were looted and their files taken to Russia by the Soviet Trophy Brigades.

The gallery had photographed the picture by [[Alessandro Allori]] (1535–1607) before closing down and, in 1939, putting its collection in secure storage areas, which Soviet troops broke into at the war's end. Wheeler covered the process in ''It's My Story: Looted Art'' for [[BBC Radio 4]], contacting the Commission for Looted Art, the identification of the painting's rightful owner in Germany and the hand-over in Berlin.

The reasons for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] looting of Germany and the subsequent Russian attempts are revealed in an interview that Irina Antonova gave to the German ''[[Die Welt]]'' newspaper; the interview specifically focuses on the Russian notion of looting, using the historical example of Napoleon as a direct reference for the Russian justification of the Plunder of Germany: "Three quarters of all the Italian art in the Louvre came to Paris with Napoleon. We all know this, yet the works remain in the Louvre. I know the place where Veronese's large painting used to hang in the monastery of Vicenza. Now it's in the Louvre where it will stay. It's the same with the Elgin Marbles in London. That's just the way it is."&lt;ref&gt;Uta Baier.

After the U.S. troops entered Baghdad on April 9, 2003, at least 13,000 artifacts were stolen during the looting by Iraqis,&lt;ref name=knickmeyer&gt;Ellen Knickmeyer.

August 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; including many moved from other sites into the National Museum for safekeeping. U.S. troops and tanks were stationed in that area but, concerned with defending themselves from attack and without orders to stop the looting, "watched for several days before moving against the thieves."&lt;ref name=knickmeyer/&gt; Sergeant Jackson of the 1st Marine Battalion explained that "...our orders were to avoid engaging religious Muslims who were unarmed. So when groups of Imams demanded to remove religious items to prevent them from being defiled by the infidels, how were we supposed to know that they were thieves? Our captain didn't want to create an international incident by arresting religious leaders."

''The Boston Globe'' writes: "Armies not of fighters but of looters, capitalizing on a security vacuum after war, have pillaged Babylon." Donny George, the curator of Iraq's National Museum says about the art looting: {{Centered pull quote|"It's the crime of the century because it affects the heritage of all mankind."&lt;ref name=thanassis&gt;Thanassis Cambanis and Charles M. Sennott. Looters Pillage Babylon Leaving Iraqis, Archeologists Devastated. The Boston Globe Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News. April 21, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; }}

George's comments followed widespread reporting that 100 percent of the museum's 170,000 inventoried lots (about 501,000 pieces) had been removed by Iraqi looters. In fact, about 95 percent of the museum's contents never left the museum. According to investigators of the thefts, about two percent of the museum pieces were stored elsewhere for safekeeping. Another two percent were stolen, in an apparent "inside job", just before U.S. troops arrived; about one percent, or about 5,000 items, were taken by outside looters. Most of the looted items were tiny beads and amulets.

The horror of art looting in general is made clear by Hashem Hama Abdoulah, director of the museum of antiquities in Sulaymaniyah, in the Kurdish-controlled zone of northern Iraq. {{Centered pull quote|"When your history is stolen from you, you lose your sense of that history. Not just the Iraqi people, but all of civilization that can trace its roots back to this area."&lt;ref name=thanassis/&gt;}}

Despite public announcements and temporary efforts by the Iraqi and American administrations, the situation in Iraqi Museums and archaeological sites did not improve.

Before he left, he closed and sealed the museum and plugged the doors with concrete.&lt;ref name=knickmeyer/&gt; In an article in ''[[Newsweek]]'', he even said that the stolen items should not be returned to Iraq under the given circumstances: "We believe this is not the right time now to have them back.

===Looting of Italy===
The looting of Italian art was not limited to Napoleon alone; Italian criminals have long been, and remain, extremely active in the field, and Italy's battle to recover the antiquities it says were looted from the country and sold to museums and art collectors worldwide is still ongoing. The Italian government and the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Art Squad]] of the [[Carabinieri]], Italy's national police force, made special efforts to "[crack] the network of looters, smugglers, and dealers supplying American museums," collecting "mountains of evidence—thousands of antiquities, photographs, and documents—seized from looters and dealers in a series of dramatic raids." According to the BBC, Italian authorities have for several years insisted on the return of stolen or looted artworks from wealthy museums and collectors, particularly in America.&lt;ref name=bbcgetty&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/273618.stm Getty Museum returns stolen art]. BBC. February 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has successfully fought numerous lawsuits that have resulted in the repatriation of many items of looted art and antiquities from many famous American institutions, including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], the [[Princeton Museum of Art]], the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], and the private collection of [[Leon Levy]] and his wife, [[Shelby White]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0607/abstracts/raiders.html Raiding the Tomb Raiders]. [[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]. Volume 59 Number 4, July/August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As the result of lawsuits filed by the Italian and Turkish governments, as well as the work of investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] and archaeologist [[Vernon Silver]], both the Metropolitan Museum and the J. Paul Getty Museum have been repeatedly exposed as two of the world's biggest institutional recipients of looted and stolen Mediterranean artefacts, and the museums benefited from the illegal antiquities trade, both through direct acquisition, and via donations and bequests from major private collectors. A significant number of Met and Getty acquisitions over a period of at least 40 years were everntually shown to have been sourced from a major international illegal antiquities trading network that centred on Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]. From the late 1960s, Medici rose to become the central figure in  a large criminal conspiracy, acting as the middleman between gangs of ''tombaroli'' (tomb robbers) - who systematically looted tens of thousands of important artefacts from Italian and other Mediterranean archaeological sites, as well as stealing objects from museums, churches and private collections - and an elite group of American and British dealers who helped Medici to "launder" his contraband and sell it to major buyers like the Met, the Getty and leading American private collectors.

Medici typically paid the ''tombaroli'' small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled them out of Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer [[Robin Symes]], Rome-based American dealer [[Robert E. Hecht]], and Hollywood dealer and producer [[Bruce McNall]]. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the [[Carabinieri]]) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered tens of thousands of looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.

[[File:Euphronios krater side B MET L.2006.10.jpg|right|thumb|[[Euphronios krater]], a 2,500-year-old Greek vase, stolen from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled from Italy, returned to Italy by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006]]

In 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art finally agreed to relinquish ownership of a 2,500-year-old Greek vase known as the [[Euphronios krater]], a [[krater]] painted by [[Euphronios]], after the TPC was able to establish that the object had been looted from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled out of Italy by the Medici gang. The Met also surrendered 15 pieces of Sicilian silver and four ancient vessels in exchange for long-term loans of other antiquities. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the case, "of its kind, perhaps second only to the dispute between Greece and Great Britain over the Elgin marbles," "became emblematic of the ethical questions surrounding the acquisition of ancient art by major museums."&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy and Hugh Eakin.

The Metropolitan Museum has been involved in several other major controversies involving antiquities believed or proven to have been looted or stolen, including:

* the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory, said to have been carved in England, but possibly made in Germany. It was initially offered to the [[British Museum]] in 1961 by its then owner, a shady Yugoslav 'collector' called [[Ante Topić Mimara]], who is now widely believed to have acquired as part of a huge collection of art and antiquities that he stole at the end of WWII from the Central Collecting Point in Munich, the Allied clearinghouse for the repatriation of material looted by the Nazis. The British Museum eventually declined to buy the cross because Topić Mimara would not provide proof that he had full title to the object, but immediately after the British Museum's option expired in 1963, the cross was purchased for the Met by curator [[Thomas Hoving]] for GBP£200,000. The Cross is currently still in the collection of the Met, at its [[Cloisters Museum]] annexe.&lt;ref name="Peter Watson 2007 pp.133-146"&gt;Peter Watson; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'' (Public Affairs, NY), pp.133-146&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, is a fabulous collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE. It formed part of a larger haul of some 450 objects that were looted by local tomb robbers from ancient four royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966-67. The contents of the tombs, including painted pieces of the walls, were stripped and sold (via Swiss and American middlemen) to the Metropolitan Museum between 1966 and 1970 for a total of US$1.5 million, but they were kept hidden in storage for more than 20 years. The Treasure was eventually put on display in 1984 in a major exhibition, where it was seen by Turkish journalist Özgen Acar, who had been investigating the looting of the tombs for many years. Although the Met intentionally mislabeled the objects as part of an “East Greek treasure,” Acar immediately recognised them as the Lydian artefacts, from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government, and in 1986, they officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused, so Turkey began legal action to recover it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 The History Blog: "Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found" (posted 28 November 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-year legal battle which reportedly cost the Turkish government UK£25 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey Constanze Letch, "King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey", ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; the case ended dramatically after the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee revealed that a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects.

In an interview with ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'', a publication of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], investigative journalist [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] wrote in June 2006 that according to the Italian public prosecutor [[Paolo Ferri]], 100,000 tombs have been looted in Italy alone, representing a value of US$500 million. He estimates that the overall monetary value of looted art, including Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Cyprus, West Africa, Central America, Peru, and China, is at least four times the Italian figure.&lt;ref name=archaeologyexposing&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/watson.html Exposing the Culture Thieves].

In 2005 [[Marion True]], former curator of the Getty Museum, and art dealer [[Robert E.

===Looting of South East Asia===

During their occupation of Indochina, the French government removed various statues and other objects from the region. During its existence, the Khmer Empire was regularly raided by its neighbours, which resulted in its cultural heritage being distributed widely across the region.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''Ancient Khmer Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; The major historian of the Khmer Empire, Lawrence Palmer Briggs, regularly mentions these raids—for example, the sack of Angkor in 1430–31 by the Siamese who carried off their loot to [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]],&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p258&lt;/ref&gt; after which "people fled from the 'great and glorious capital' of Khmer civilisation as if it were ridden with plague".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p261&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the cultural heritage of the region was already widely spread by the time the French founded their protectorate in IndoChina in 1864. Briggs describes [[Preah Khan Kompong Svay]] as "shamefully looted" in the late 19th century by [[Louis Delaporte]], "who carried the spoils away to French museums (thus beginning the systematic looting of Cambodian temples for the benefit of public and private collections of Europe and America)".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p 222&lt;/ref&gt; He also describes how French tourists well into the 20th century carried off many statues.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Palmer. ''The Ancient Khmer Empire'', p77&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by the early 20th century it was rare to find Khmer objects in situ{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} and local and foreign collectors, particularly in France, had built up collections of Khmer objects. Many objects from the region were exported to Europe and elsewhere and ended up in museums such as the Guimet.&lt;ref&gt;http://asemus.museum/museum/musee-national-des-arts-asiatiques-guimet/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second world war, whilst France was occupied by Nazi Germany, the Indochina region was controlled variously by the Japanese, locally, and after the war, the French regained control. There followed a period of 35 years of disruption and warfare, including Dien Ben Phu and the Vietnam war. Thereafter Cambodia fell under the control of the notorious Khmer Rouge regime. Some objects left the country during that period, either to save them from destruction or for looting purposes. Reports have suggested that where objects have been moved, local officials and armed forces (both before and after the periods of turmoil) were responsible.&lt;ref&gt;see movie Angkor for Sale directed Adrian Maben 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, a report in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' described art experts' concerns about a "rampant degradation of archeological sites and an accelerating trade in stolen artifacts sweeping Southeast Asia" as a consequence of war in Cambodia and instability in the region.&lt;ref name="Tefft"&gt;Tefft, Sheila. [http://www.csmonitor.com/1992/1015/15121.html "Plundering of Artifacts Sweeps Asia"], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 15 October 1992. Retrieved 26 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Statues were being stripped from [[Angkor Wat]] and other sites by smuggling rings often working in collusion with military and political officials, including a major network in [[Chiang Mai]] run by a former government minister.&lt;ref name="Tefft"/&gt;

The British-born Thai-based collector [[Douglas Latchford]] says that when he and other collectors traversed Cambodia and Thailand in the 1960s, buying and trading Cambodian antiquities, they were not concerned about provenance, but regarded themselves as rescuers of artefacts that otherwise might have been neglected or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Mashberg, Tom, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/arts/design/us-links-collector-to-statue-in-khmer-looting-case.html?_r=0 "Claims of Looting Shadow Expert in Khmer Art"], ''The New York Times'', 12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the objects they purchased were later donated or sold to museums. In the 2000s, evidence that the artefacts had been looted persuaded a number of major museums around the world to return the objects to Cambodia.&lt;ref&gt;"In 2012, Latchford was identified in [US] federal court records as a middleman in the trafficking of looted antiquities from Sotheast Asia. Authorities allege Latchford knowingly purchased two looted Khmer sculptures from “an organized looting network” and conspired with the London auction house Spink to obtain false export permits for them. The case was a civil lawsuit, and Latchford was not charged with a crime. But after a lengthy legal battle, Sotheby’s agreed to return its sculpture to Cambodia. Soon after, the Norton Simon Museum, Christie’s auction house and the Metropolitan Museum of Art all returned sculptures tied to Latchford."

Among the objects sold or donated to major museums by Latchford are a number of rare ancient [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] statues, reportedly looted from the temple site of [[Koh Ker]] in Cambodia, and at least two Indian seated [[Kushan]] Buddhas, looted from the ancient Indian city of [[Mathura]]. One of the seated Buddhas was originally offered—via Manhattan dealer [[Nancy Wiener]]—to Canada's [[Royal Ontario Museum]], but they ultimately declined to buy it, owing to its dubious provenance. In 2000 it was bought by the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but subsequent investigations exposed the seated Buddha as a looted artwork, and it has since been repatriated to India. Other US museums reported to have received looted Asian artefacts from Latchford include the [[Denver Museum of Art]], the [[Kimbell Museum]] in Ft. Worth, Texas, and the [[Norton Simon Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasingaphrodite.com/2013/05/03/breaking-the-met-returns-two-khmer-statues-to-cambodia-citing-clear-evidence-of-looting/ Chasing Aphrodite: "The Met Returns Two Khmer Statues to Cambodia, Citing Clear Evidence Of Looting" (posted 3 May 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013, the Met announced that it would repatriate to Cambodia two ancient Khmer statues, known as "The Kneeling Attendants", which it had acquired from Latchford (in fragments) in 1987 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2013/cambodian-returns "Metropolitan Museum of Art to Return Two Khmer Sculptures to Cambodia"], metmuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the Met stated that the museum had received "dispositive" evidence that the objects had been looted from Koh Ker and illegally exported to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-metropolitan-museum-returns-cambodian-statues-20130503-story.html Felch, Jason, "Metropolitan Museum says it will return Cambodian statues", ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] voluntarily returned to Cambodia a 10th-century sculpture of the Hindu monkey god [[Hanuman]], after a curator from the museum uncovered evidence that it had been looted—the statue's head having appeared on the market in Bangkok in 1968 during the [[Vietnam War]] and its body having appeared on the market in 1972 during the [[Cambodian Civil War]]. The museum's director said, "Our research revealed a very real likelihood that it was removed from a site enormously important to the kingdom of Cambodia during a terrible time and its return was completely consistent with the highest legal and fiduciary standards."&lt;ref&gt;Litt, Steven.

The [[Załuski Library]], the first public library in Poland, was founded by two brothers, [[Józef Andrzej Załuski]], crown referendary and bishop of Kiev, and [[Andrzej Stanisław Załuski]], crown chancellor and bishop of Cracow. The library was considered one of the most important libraries of the world, featuring a collection of about 400,000 printed items, manuscripts, artworks, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens. Located in Warsaw's [[Daniłowiczowski Palace]], it was looted in the aftermath of the [[second Partition of Poland]] and [[Kościuszko Uprising]] in 1794 by [[Russia]]n troops on orders from Russian Tsarina [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]; the stolen artworks were transported to [[St. Petersburg]] and became part of the [[Russian Imperial Library]], which was founded one year later. Although some pieces were returned by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921 and were burned during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] against German forces, other parts of the collection have still not been returned by Russia.

Looting in Mesoamerica has a long tradition and history. Graves are often looted before the archaeologists can reach them, and the artifacts are then sold to wealthy collectors in the United States, Japan, or Europe. Guillermo Cock, a Lima-based archaeologist, says about a recent find of dozens of exquisitely preserved Inca mummies on the outskirts of Peru's capital city, [[Lima]]: "The true problem is the looters," he said. "If we leave the cemetery it is going to be destroyed in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;John Roach.

==Looting by perpetrator==

===Looting by the British Empire===

The transformation of theft and plunder as an incentive for troops to institutionalized, indiscriminate looting following military conflict can be observed in the wake of British conquest in Asia, Africa and India. The looting of artifacts for "both personal and institutional reasons" became "increasingly important in the process of "othering" Oriental and African societies and was exemplified in the professionalism of exploration and the growth of ethnographic departments in museums, the new 'temples of Empire'." Looting, not necessarily of art, became a vital instrument for the projection of power and the British imperial desire to gather and provide information about the "exotic" cultures and primitive tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carrington.

Napoleon's conquests in Europe were followed by a systematic attempt, later more tentatively echoed by Hitler, to take the finest works of art of conquered nations back to the [[Louvre]] in Paris for a grand central museum of all Europe. Napoleon boasted: {{Centered pull quote|We will now have all that is beautiful in Italy except for a few objects in Turin and Naples.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;}}
Many works were returned after his fall, but many others were not, and remain in France. Many works confiscated from religious institutions under the French occupation now form the backbone of national museums: "Napoleon's art-loot depots became the foundation of [[Gallerie dell'Accademia|Venice's Accademia]], Milan's [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera galleries]]. His brother [[Napoleon III of France|Louis]] founded [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum]]; brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] started [[Museo del Prado|Madrid's Prado]]" (for the Spanish royal collection).&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891933-1,00.html Masterpieces of the Louvre]. ''Time'' magazine. June 30, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleonic commander and Marechal [[Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult]] stole in 1810 six large pictures painted by [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] in 1668 for the [[Hospital de la Caridad (Seville)|Hospital de la Caridad]] in [[Seville]]. One painting, ''[[The Return of the Prodigal Son]]'', is now in the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington; a second looted painting, ''[[The Healing of the Paralytic]]'', is in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London; only two of the original paintings have returned to Seville.&lt;ref name=bloombergplease/&gt;

Another French general looted several pictures, including four Claudes and [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'', from the [[Landgrave]] of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] in 1806. The stolen goods were later bought by the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Josephine]] and subsequently by the tsar. Since 1918, when the [[Bolshevik]] government signed a peace treaty with Germany and Austria, have German negotiators demanded the return of the paintings. Russia refused to return the stolen goods; the pictures still remain in the Hermitage.&lt;ref name=bloombergplease/&gt;

===Looting by the Union and Confederate Armies during the American Civil War===

On November 7, 1863, [[Edward D. Townsend]] of the Union army wrote General Order No. 360: “Satisfactory evidence having been produced to the War Department that a bronze equestrian statue, unlawfully taken from a private house in Fredericksburg, at the time of the capture of that place by the Union forces, was the private property of Mr. Douglas Gordon, of that city, it is— .Ordered: That it be restored to Mrs. Annie C. Thomas, the sister of Mr. Gordon, who has made application therefor.”&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Thomas M., and Oliver Diefendorf. ''General Orders of the War Department, Embracing the Years 1861, 1862 &amp; 1863''. Vol. 2. New York, NY: Derby &amp; Miller, 1864, p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Gordon's works of art were recovered through [[Lafayette C. Baker]], chief of the Union secret police.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Lafayette Curry. ''History of the United States Secret Service''. Philadelphia, PA: King &amp; Baird, Printers, 1867, p. 259-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Congress enacted legislation allowing for claims to be filed for property losses on July 4, 1864. Claims were restricted to loyal citizens.

===Looting by Nazi Germany===

Bradley]] and Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], Jr., inspects art treasures hidden in a salt mine in Germany.]]

During World War II, the Nazis set up special departments "for a limited time for the seizure and securing of objects of cultural value",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/12-18-45.htm Letter from Rosenberg to the Reich Commissioner for the East and Reich Commissioner for the Ukraine, April 27, 1942], as cited in: Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 4. Twenty-Second Day. December 18, 1945, Morning Session, Document 153-PS, Exhibit USA-381&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the Occupied Eastern Territories, including the [[Baltic states]], [[Ukraine]], [[Hungary]] and [[Greece]]. The Russian imperial residences around [[St. Petersburg]] were thoroughly looted and deliberately blown up, so that their restoration is still under way. The [[Catherine Palace]] and [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] were reduced to smoldering ruins; among the innumerable trophies was the world-famous [[Amber Room]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bruhn: Das Bernsteinzimmer in Zarskoje Selo bei Sankt-Petersburg, 2nd edition. Berlin, 2004 {{ISBN|978-3-86155-109-6}}. In an updated version also available as bibliographical database [http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/bernzim.htm Das Bernsteinzimmer von Zarskoje Selo]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5msN0LHUv?url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~pbruhn/bernzim.htm |date=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval churches of [[Novgorod]] and [[Pskov]], with their unique 12th-century frescoes, were systematically plundered and reduced to piles of rubble. Major museums around [[Moscow]], including [[Yasnaya Polyana]], [[Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery]], and [[New Jerusalem Monastery|New Jerusalem]], faced a similar fate, with their architectural integrity irrevocably impaired.

The legal framework and the language of the instructions used by Germany resembles the [[Lieber Code]], but in the [[Nuremberg Trial]] proceedings, the victorious Allied armies applied different standards and sentenced the Nazis involved as [[war criminals]]. Article 6 of the [[Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] of Nuremberg, detailing the Jurisdiction and General Principles, declares the "plunder of public or private property" a war crime,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/imtconst.htm#art6 Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 1, Charter of the International Military Tribunal, II. Jurisdiction and General Principles, Article 6]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; while the Lieber Code and the actions of the Allied armies in the aftermath of World War II allowed or tolerated the looting. The main objective of the looting is made clear by Dr. Muhlmann, responsible for the securing of all Polish art treasures: "I confirm that the art treasures ... would not have remained in Poland in case of a German victory, but they would have been used to complement German artistic property."&lt;ref name=nuremberg&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/proc/12-18-45.htm Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Vol. 4. Twenty-Second Day. December 18, 1945, Morning Session]. Yale.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

One inventory of 39 volumes featuring the looted art and antiques, prepared by the Nazis and discussed during the Nuremberg trials, lists "21,903 Works of Art: 5,281 paintings, pastels, water colors, drawings; 684 miniatures, glass and enamel paintings, illuminated books and manuscripts; 583 sculptures, terra cottas, medallions, and plaques; 2,477 articles of furniture of art historical value; 583 textiles (tapestries, rugs, embroideries, Coptic textiles); 5,825 objects of decorative art (porcelains, bronzes, [[faience]], [[Maiolica|majolica]], ceramics, jewelry, coins, art objects with precious stones); 1,286 East Asiatic art works (bronzes, sculpture, [[porcelain]]s, paintings, [[folding screen]]s, weapons); 259 art works of antiquity (sculptures, bronzes, vases, jewelry, bowls, [[engraved gem]]s, [[terracotta]]s)."&lt;ref name=nuremberg/&gt;

When Allied forces bombed Germany's cities and historic institutions, Germany "began storing the artworks in salt mines and caves for protection from Allied bombing raids. These mines and caves offered the appropriate humidity and temperature conditions for artworks."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rothfeld.

Fall 2002, Vol. 34, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this art was recovered by the Allied [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section]] of the [[Office of Military Government, United States]], as detailed in a 1995 [[The Spoils of War (symposium)|conference in New York]] and the published proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Elizabeth.

===Looting by the Soviet Union===

In 1998, and after considerable controversy, Russia passed the [[Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation]], which allowed Russians to keep the illegally stolen art works and museum pieces and to prevent any restitution to their rightful owners in Germany.

===Looting by the Spanish Empire and others===
The [[conquistador]]s looting Latin and South America became one of the most commonly recognized plunders in the world.

Roger Atwood writes in ''Stealing History: Tomb Raiders, Smugglers, and the Looting of the Ancient World'': "Mayan stonework became one of those things that good art museums in America just had to have, and looters in the jungles of southern Mexico and Guatemala worked overtime to meet the demand."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; (See: [[Maya stelae#Looting]])

Looting in Mesoamerica has a long tradition and history, many graves are looted before the archaeologists could reach them, and the artifacts are then sold to wealthy collectors in the United States, Japan or Europe. [[Guillermo Cock]], a Lima-based archaeologist, says about a recent find of dozens of exquisitely preserved Inca mummies on the outskirts of Peru's capital city, [[Lima]]: "The true problem is the looters," he said. "If we leave the cemetery it is going to be destroyed in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

==Case studies==
A large number of institutions and museums have at various times been subject to both moral claims and legal claims concerning the provenance of their holdings subject to occasional review and challenge. One example of such a case study can be provided by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s reputation which has experienced a series of allegations and lawsuits about its status as an occasional institutional buyer of looted and stolen antiquities. Since the 1990s the Met has been the subject of numerous investigative reports and books critical of the Met's ''laissez-faire'' attitude to acquisition.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders&gt;Peter Watson, Cecilia Todeschini (2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jlcPcCuicKQC&amp;q=Morgantina%20Met%20OR%20Metropolitan ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Silver, ''The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt for a Priceless Masterpiece''. Harper Collins Books, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-06-188296-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met has lost several major lawsuits, notably against the governments of Italy and Turkey, who successfully sought the repatriation of hundreds of ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern antiquities, with a total value in the hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;

In the late 1990s, long-running investigations by the [[Carabinieri Art Squad|Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale]] (TPC), the art crimes division of the Italian [[Carabinieri]], accused the Metropolitan Museum of acquiring "black market" antiquities. TPC investigations in Italy revealed that many ancient Mediterranean objects acquired from the 1960s to the 1990s had been purchased, via a complex network of front companies and unscrupulous dealers, from the criminal gang led by Italian art dealer [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]]."&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt; The Met is also one of many institutional buyers known to have acquired looted artifacts from a Thai-based British "collector", [[Douglas Latchford]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chasingaphrodite.com/tag/metropolitan-museum-of-art/ Chasing Aphrodite]. "The Kushan Buddhas: Nancy Wiener, Douglas Latchford and New Questions about Ancient Buddhas" (originally posted 1 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Met announced that it would repatriate to [[Cambodia]] two ancient [[Khmer Republic|Khmer]] statues, known as "The Kneeling Attendants" , which it had acquired from Latchford (in fragments) in 1987 and 1992. A spokesperson for the Met stated that the museum had received "dispositive" evidence that the objects had been looted from Koh Ker and illegally exported to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-metropolitan-museum-returns-cambodian-statues-20130503-story.html Jason Felch, "Metropolitan Museum says it will return Cambodian statues"]. ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ongoing investigations by the Italian police ([[Carabinieri Art Squad|TPC]]), lawsuits brought by the Governments of Italy, Turkey and Cambodia against the Metropolitan Museum of Art contend that the acquisition of the Euphronius krater may have demonstrated a pattern of less than rigorous investigation into the origin and legitimate provenance of highly desirable antiquities for the museum's collections. Examples include, the [[Cloisters Cross]], a large [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cross carved from walrus ivory,&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt; the [[Karun Treasure]], also known as the Lydian Hoard, a collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE, and  part of a larger haul of some 450 objects looted by local tomb robbers from four ancient royal tombs near [[Sardis]], in Turkey in 1966–67.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistoryblog.com/archives/21761 "Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found"]. The History Blog, 28 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After a six-year legal battle that reportedly cost the Turkish government UK£25 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey "King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey"].Constanze Letch, ''The Guardian'', 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the case ended dramatically after it was revealed that the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee described how a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993.&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;

The [[Morgantina treasure]] is a hoard of ornate Hellenistic silverware dated 3rd century BC, valued at perhaps up to US$100 million, acquired by the Met in the early 1980s. It was later shown to have been looted from the [[Morgantina|Morgantina archaeological site]] in Sicily. After a protracted lawsuit, the Met conceded that it was looted, and agreed in 2006 to repatriate it to Sicily, with the Met stating in 2006 that the repatriation "redresses past improprieties in the acquisitions process".&lt;ref name=IllicitTombRaiders /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article, [http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/morgantina-silver/ "Morgantina Silver"], by Suzie Thomas, year 2012 at the website [http://traffickingculture.org/ TraffickingCulture.org], website devoted to illicit trafficking in ancient art objects. The article cites the following press release issued by the Metropolitian Museum on 21 Feb 2006: [http://www.metmuseum.org/press/news/2006/statement-by-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-on-its-agreement-with-italian-ministry-of-culture "Statement by the Metropolitan Museum of Art on its agreement with the Italian Ministry of Culture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">The '''Division of Ecological Restoration''' (DER) is a Division of the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game within the [[Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs|Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]]. DER was created in 2009 with the merger of the Riverways and Wetlands Restoration Programs. DER coordinates ecological restoration to improve ecological condition and to restore important [[ecosystem services]] that improve the quality of life for all Massachusetts citizens.

The Riverways Program ([https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter21a MGL Chapter 21A Section 8]) has been maintained within DER and coordinates outreach and technical assistance to support [[drainage divide|watershed]] conservation and protection.

The Division and partners facilitate capital-based projects including (but not limited to) dam removal and [[culvert]] replacement with the goal of restoring [[aquatic habitat]]s (e.g. salt marshes)
and ecosystems across the state. These projects support commercial and recreational fisheries and provide many other benefits such as reduced flooding, improved water quality, [[carbon sequestration]] and increased public safety.

Ecological restoration is a core component of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts efforts to build habitat resiliency to better allow fish and wildlife to adapt to climate change – including sea level rise, elevated water temperatures, and increased floods and periods of drought.

[[File:Logo Tagline MADFG.jpg|thumbnail|Division of Ecological Restoration seal]]

Tim Purinton currently serves as the Director of the Division of Ecological Restoration.

==Philosophy==
*DER espouses a comprehensive, holistic approach to restoration, that prioritizes ecosystems over habitats.
*DER places an emphasis on restoring ecological processes, rather than species specific habitats, focusing on implementation of restoration actions at a watershed scale.
*DER staff identifies the most detrimental stressors in the larger watershed context and coordinates restoration actions to improve conditions in partnership with local organizations.
*DER bases its programs on engaging and working with stakeholders in the communities to maximize impact and stewardship.

The '''Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut für Menschheitsgeschichte'') performs basic research into [[archaeogenetics]] and [[Evolutionary linguistics|linguistic cultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shh.mpg.de/en|title=Institute Profile|publisher=MPI-SHH|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is one of 80+ research institutes of the [[Max Planck Society]] and is located in [[Jena]], [[Germany]].

The co-directors of the institute are:
* [[Nicole Boivin]] (Department of Archaeology)&lt;ref&gt; see [https://www.shh.mpg.de/archaeology Homepage of the departement of archaeology] &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Russell Gray]] (Department of Linguistic and Cultural Evolution)
* [[Johannes Krause]] (Department of Archeogenetics)

== History == 
=== Max Planck Institute of Economics ===
The predecessor of the present institute was founded in 1993 as the [[Max Planck Institute for Research into Economic Systems]] (''Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung von Wirtschaftssystemen'') and later renamed the [[Max Planck Institute of Economics]] (''Max-Planck-Institut für Ökonomik''). Its initial mission was researching the transition of the former [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] [[socialism|socialist]] economic systems, but it later researched a broad set of problems relating to change in modern economies more generally, including [[evolutionary economics]], [[experimental economics]], and [[entrepreneurial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.econ.mpg.de/english/institute/|title=About the Max Planck Institute of Economics|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was organized into three research units: 
* Evolutionary Economics Group (director: [[Ulrich Witt]]), 
* Strategic Interaction Group (director: [[Werner Güth]]) 
* Entrepreneurship, Growth and Public Policy Group (director: [[David B. Audretsch]]).

===Present-day===

On March 2014, the institute was renamed the Max Planck Institute for History and the Sciences. A few months later, on November 21, 2014, the Institute of Economics was realigned and renamed to the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpg.de/8281472/Institute_in_Jena_realigned|title=Institute in Jena realigned|date=June 26, 2014|accessdate=2015-04-05|publisher=Max Planck Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it took over from the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]] the task of maintaining the [[Glottolog]].

== Location ==
The institute is located on Kahlaische Strasse, about 1 km south-east of the city center.  It is housed in an attractively restored [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] villa, linked by a glass bridge to a much larger modern building, which includes offices and other facilities for each of the research units, each unit having one floor of the main section of the building.  In addition the new buildings include a substantial library, and apartments where visitors to the institute can be accommodated.

F.|title=Perspectives on culture, technology, and communication: The media ecology tradition|year=2006|publisher=NJ: Hampton|location=Gencarelli|pages=201–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecology]] in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Understanding Me:  Lectures and Interviews,'' by Marshall McLuhan, edited by Stephanie McLuhan and David Staines, Foreword by Tom Wolfe.  MIT Press, 2004, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Postman states, "if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'" &lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5-14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== Walter Ong ===
Walter Ong was a scholar with a master’s degree in English who was once a student of McLuhan at the Saint Louis University.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/631683671|title=Echoes and reflections : on media ecology as a field of study|last=Lance,|first=Strate,|date=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|isbn=9781572737259|location=Cresskill, N.J.|oclc=631683671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributions of Ong standardized and gave creditability to the field of Media Ecology as an academic study that’s worth scholarship.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The studies of Ong have contributed greatly towards developing the concept of Media Ecology. Ong has written over 450 publications, many of which focused on the relation between conscious behavior and the evolution of the media, and he received the Media Ecology Association's Walter Benjamin Award for Outstanding Article for his paper, "Digitization Ancient and Modern: Beginnings of Writing and Today's Computers". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/ong-center/walter-ong.php|title=About Walter J. Ong, S.J.|website=www.slu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The medium is the message'===

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eye'': left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* ''Ear:'' right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C.

C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== [[Gezi Park protests|Gezi Protests]]: Turkey  ====
Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

The '''mind–body problem''' is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|title=Rene Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|issn=2161-0002|quote=The real distinction of mind and body based on their completely diverse natures is the root of the famous mind-body problem: how can these two substances with completely different natures causally interact so as to give rise to a human being capable of having voluntary bodily motions and sensations?|last1=Skirry|first1=Justin|accessdate=20 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144904/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|archivedate=19 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1996 |pages=702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind–body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author=Robert M.

A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. [[Monism]] maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.

Each of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are [[substance dualism]], which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and [[property dualism]], which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are [[physicalism]], which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; [[idealism]], which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and [[neutral monism]], which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. [[Psychophysical parallelism]] is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Parallelism, Psychophysical |volume=20 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt; An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French [[structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S.

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE open |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

==Mind–body interaction and mental causation==
Philosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:
{{quote|Mind–body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency. Indeed, mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind–body problem. Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do. If psychological explanation goes, so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility. Clearly, a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation [and] there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind's "causal relevance" to behavior (and to the physical world more generally) can arise.

[René Descartes] set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind–body relation. According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance". Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances. If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they "could" causally interact. [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia]] puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body's being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing's surface.

Contemporary [[neurophilosopher]] Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.&lt;ref name=Northoff&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy of the Brain: The Brain Problem |author=Georg Northoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJq4QDixIg0C&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=1588114171 |year=2004 |edition=Volume 52 of Advances in Consciousness Research |pages=137–139 |quote=The restriction of causality to 'efficient causality' lead to the neglect of 'goal-orientation' since it was no longer necessary within [that] framework. Not considering 'goal-orientation' resulted in the neglect of 'embedment' and the consequential presupposition of 'isolation' with separation between brain, body, and environment. Neglecting 'embedment' lead to the equation of perception/action with sensory impression/movement which could be well accounted for by 'efficient causality'. Accordingly, since dominated by 'efficient causality', qualia and intentionality, as related to perception/action rather than to sensory impression/movement, were excluded from science and consequently regarded [as] purely philosophical problems. Analogous to 'final causes', 'formal causes' were eliminated as well. 'Efficient causality' is not compatible with 'embedded coding' [which] is necessarily tied with 'formal causality' and 'final causality'... Finally, the possibility of mental causation remains incompatible with 'efficient causality'. It can, however, be properly described by 'formal and final causality'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter J. Freeman]], suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of "circular causation" is more relevant than linear causation.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Walter J Freeman |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–5, 88–90 |quote=Walter Freeman, with his usual originality, suggest that we may be looking at the whole thing in completely the wrong way when we ask whether consciousness causes or is caused by neural activity. He suggests that circular causation is a more relevant concept in this regard than linear causation. Consciousness and neural activity are certainly interdependent, but it is impossible in principle to say that either causes the other. Thus the whole concept of consciousness as agent is simply a misreading of the true situation.}} Through my readings in physics and philosophy, I learned the concept of circular causality, which invokes hierarchical interactions of immense numbers of semiautonomous elements such as neurons, which form nonlinear systems. These exchanges lead to the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the pattern of activity of the contributing individuals. Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes. The most subtle shift is the disappearance of agency, which is equivalent to loss of Aristotle's efficient cause. The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language .the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world. The answer I propose is that assignment of cause and effect to one's self and to others having self-awareness is entirely appropriate, but that investing insensate objects with causation is comparable to investing them with teleology and soul.
The further question is: Does it matter whether or not causality is assigned to objects? The answer is "Very much." Several examples are given of scientific errors attributed to thinking in terms of linear causality. The most important, with wide ramifications, is the assumption of universal determinacy, by which the causes of human behavior are limited to environmental and genetic factors, and the causal power of self-determination is excluded from scientific consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:

{{quote|Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind–body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Morsella, E. |editor2=Bargh, J.A. |editor3=Gollwitzer, P.M. |first=Georg |last=Goldenberg |year=2008 |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 7, How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia |series=Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195309980 |lccn=2008004997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Georg Goldenberg|"How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia" in ''Oxford Handbook of Human Action''}}

have focused primarily on the body rather than the mind. In this context, neuronal correlates may be viewed as causing consciousness, where consciousness can be thought of as an undefined property that depends upon this [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Squire |first=Larry R. |authorlink=Larry Squire |title=Fundamental neuroscience |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=2008 |page=1223 |isbn=0-12-374019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it's unknown if discovering and characterizing neural correlates may eventually provide a theory of consciousness that can explain the first-person experience of these "systems", and determine whether other systems of equal complexity lack such features.

The massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts. Nonetheless, it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates, which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject's experience of that conscious state. The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adamantidis A.R. |author2=Zhang F. |author3=Aravanis A.M. |author4=Deisseroth K. |author5=de Lecea L. |year=2007 |title=Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; was achieved by the development of behavioral and organic models that are amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. Non-human analysis such as this, in combination with imaging of the human brain, have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework.

To be conscious ''of'' something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether awake or in [[REM sleep]]. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian rhythm]] but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients with ''impaired states of consciousness'' such as the [[coma|comatose state]], the [[persistent vegetative state]], and the [[minimally conscious state]]. Here, "state" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and [[general anesthesia]], to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schiff |first=Nicholas D. |date=November 2004 |contribution=The neurology of impaired consciousness: Challenges for cognitive neuroscience. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-link=Michael Gazzaniga |edition=3rd |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-07254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==Historical background==
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.

===The Buddha===
{{See also|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism and the body|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of [[Buddhism]], described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Nalakalapiyo Sutta: Sheaves of Reeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=2016-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

Ultimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]] is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512204617/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html |date=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[anatta|anattā]] doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html The Five Aggregates: A Study Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917193707/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Sabbasava Sutta: All the Fermentations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625214552/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.

===Plato===
{{See also|Plato|Theory of forms}}
[[Plato]] (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world "participate in" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the [[theory of forms|abstract reality]] of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[epistemology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle}}
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) ''mind'' is a faculty of the ''soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gendlin|2012b|page=121–122}}&lt;div align=left&gt;432a1-2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;'''Hence''' the soul is '''as''' the hand is; '''for&lt;br&gt;the hand is a tool of tools''', and&lt;br&gt;'''the nous is a form of forms'''&lt;br&gt;(ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ η χεὶρ ὄργανόν&lt;br&gt;ἐστιν ὀργάνων)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else, so far as I know.  The hand is “a tool of tools.” The nous is a “form of forms.” The hand and the soul are unique in this respect.  Let us see further what this means.&lt;br&gt;
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form, but on closer inspection we find that it is not, or at least not the usual kind.  Nous is a maker of forms.  A “form of forms” is like a tool of tools, like a living body’s organ that makes tools. Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes.  The hand is not a made tool (it would have to be made by yet another hand).&lt;br&gt;'''In Greek “tool” and “organ” are the same word.  So we see: ”In the phrase “tool of tools” the first use of the word stands for a living organ, the second for an artificially made tool.''' In II-4 he says “all natural bodies are tools (organs) of the soul’s,” (both as food and as material from which to make tools).  In English we would say that the '''hand is the organ of tools.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/aristotledeanima005947mbp#page/n629/mode/2up p. 542]}}&lt;br&gt; '''431b230&amp;ndash;432a14.''' To sum up: the soul is in a manner the universe of things, which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible: and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object, the intelligible; sense with its object, the sensible. This statement calls for further explanation. Sense and knowledge, whether potential or actual, are distributed over things potential or actual, as the case may be. In the soul, again, the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects. These objects must therefore exist in the soul, not indeed as concrete wholes, form and matter combined, which is impossible: it must be the ''forms'' of things which exist in the soul. Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms, i.e. of intelligible forms, and sense the form of sensibles, precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments, i.e. the instrument by which other instruments are acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the soul, he said:
{{quote|It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.| ''De Anima'' ii 1, 412b6–9|}}

In the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |author=Shields, Christopher |title=Aristotle's Psychology |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

In [[religious philosophy]] of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a [[binary opposition]] of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a "mind-body" split may be found in the ''"[[divinity]] - [[secularity]]"'' dualism of the ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. [[Gnosticism]] is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by [[Judaism]] popular in the first and second century AD.  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into  [[Galen]]'s ''"tripartite soul"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Researchgate:Galen and the tripartite soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led into both the Christian sentiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Early Christian writings:Galen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in the later [[Augustinian theodicy]] and [[Avicenna]]’s  [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy]].

===Thomas Aquinas===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Like [[Aristotle]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one.  However, (referring to "mind" as "the soul") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul "this particular thing".  Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of [[physicalist]] or [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain ''via'' the [[pineal gland]]:
{{quote|My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Treatise of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Treatise of Man''}}{{quote|[The] mechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland's being moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause, it drives the surrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain, which direct them through the nerves to the muscles; and in this way the gland makes the spirits move the limbs.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst1&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Passions of the Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Passions of the Soul''}}

His posited relation between mind and body is called [[Cartesian dualism]] or [[substance dualism]]. He held that ''mind'' was distinct from ''matter'', but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.

===Kant===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1724–1804) beyond ''mind'' and ''matter'' there exists a world of ''a priori'' forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.
{{quote|...whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent world does not come located in a spatial or a temporal matrix,...The mind has two pure forms of intuition built into it to allow it to... organize this 'manifold of raw intuition'.&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andrew Brook|Brook, Andrew]] |title=Kant's View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta (ed.)|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/kant-mind/ |date=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Andrew Brook]] |''Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self: Transcendental aesthetic''}}
Kant views the mind–body interaction as taking place through forces that may be of different kinds for mind and body.&lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric Watkins |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIIsaGoHshoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108 |chapter=Causality in context |title=Kant and the Metaphysics of Causality |isbn=0521543614 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huxley===
{{Main|Thomas Huxley}}
For [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called [[Epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]].
{{quote|On the epiphenomenalist view, mental events play no causal role. Huxley, who held the view, compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes nothing to the work of a locomotive.&lt;ref name=Robinson2&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, William, |title=Epiphenomenalism |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/epiphenomenalism/|date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William Robinson|''Epiphenomenalism''}}

===Whitehead===
{{Main|Alfred North Whitehead}}
[[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] advocated a sophisticated form of [[panpsychism]] that has been called by [[David Ray Griffin]] ''[[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727230542/http://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics |date=2017-07-27 }}'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Éditions Chromatika, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-930517-08-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popper===
{{Main|Karl Popper}}
For [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (1902–1994) there are ''three'' aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as [[mathematics]]. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be [[radio]], an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]]) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.
{{quote|The body–mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions is the only one that deserves to be taken seriously [namely]: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that ''act'' upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 ''acts'' upon his brain and thus upon World 1. This, then, is the thesis of body–mind interaction.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;|Karl Popper|''Notes of a realist on the body–mind problem''}}

===Searle===
{{Main|John Searle}}
For [[John Rogers Searle|Searle]] (b. 1932) the mind–body problem is a [[false dichotomy]]; that is, mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain.  
{{quote|According to Searle then, there is no more a mind–body problem than there is a macro–micro economics problem. They are different levels of description of the same set of phenomena. [...] But Searle is careful to maintain that the mental – the domain of qualitative experience and understanding – is autonomous and has no counterpart on the microlevel; any redescription of these macroscopic features amounts to a kind of evisceration, ...&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;

In [[database theory]] and [[database|systems]], a '''monotonic query''' is one that does not lose any tuples it previously made output, with the addition of new tuples in the database. Formally, a query ''q'' over a schema ''R'' is monotonic if and only if for every two instances ''I'', ''J'' of ''R'', &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq J \Rightarrow q(I) \subseteq q(J)&lt;/math&gt; (''q'' must be a [[monotonic function]]).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abiteboul|first=Serge|title=Foundations Of Databases|year=1994|publisher=Addison-Wesley|author2=Richard Hull |author3=Victor Vianu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a monotonic query is a [[Relational algebra#Selection (σ)|select]]-[[Relational algebra#Projection|project]]-[[Relational algebra#Natural join|join]] query containing only conditions of equality (also known as [[Conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]]). Examples of non-monotonic queries are aggregation queries, or queries with set difference.

Identifying whether a query is monotonic can be crucial for query optimization, especially in view maintenance and data stream management. Since the answer set for a monotonic query can only grow as more tuples are added to the database, query processing may be optimized by executing only the new portions of the database and adding the new results to the existing answer set.

== Applications ==

=== Unnesting Queries ===
Monotonic queries are important in the topic of unnesting SQL queries.  If a query is monotonic, it implies that a nested query can actually be unnested.

=== Data streams ===

A data stream is a real-time, continuous, ordered (implicitly by arrival time or explicitly by timestamp) sequence of items.
The number of items is considered to be infinite and therefore cannot feasibly be stored in its entirety. Queries over data streams are often called ''continuous'' or ''long-running'' queries, and are mostly run over a limited window of tuples in the stream. To evaluate a continuous query, one can simply reevaluate the query over newly arrived tuples, and append the new tuples to the existing result set. More formally, let ''A(Q, t)'' be the answer set of a continuous query ''Q'' at time t, τ be the current time, and 0 the start time. Then, if Q is monotonic, its result set at time τ is

:&lt;math&gt; A(Q, \tau) =\bigcup_{t = 1}^{\tau} (A(Q,t) - A(Q, t-1)) \cup A(Q,0) &lt;/math&gt;

In contrast, non-montonic queries have the following answer semantics:

:&lt;math&gt; A(Q, \tau) =\bigcup_{t = 0}^{\tau} A(Q,t)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''National Institute for Health and Welfare''' (THL, {{lang-fi|Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos}}, {{lang-sv|Institutet för hälsa och välfärd}}) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] research and development institute operating under the [[Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stm.fi/en/frontpage Ministry of Social Affairs and Health]&lt;/ref&gt; THL was formed on 1 January 2009, with the merger of the [[National Public Health Institute of Finland]] (KTL) and the {{ill|National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health|fi|Stakes}}.&lt;ref name=THL_act&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi Act on the National Institute for Health and Welfare 668/2008]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the biggest expert organisation under the ministry and its most important source of consultation regarding scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name=THL&gt;[http://www.thl.fi/en THL home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of THL==

THL's scope of activity includes both public health and social welfare. The Institute aims at identifying synergy opportunities not only in the collaboration between social welfare and health care, but also in applying research and the knowledge generated with this research.

THL's field of activity includes:&lt;ref name=THL_act/&gt;&lt;ref name=THL/&gt;
* promoting the welfare and health of the population
* preventing diseases and social problems
* developing social and health care activities and services

THL's main office is located in [[Helsinki]]. The Institute also has satellite offices in [[Jyväskylä]], [[Kuopio]], [[Oulu]], [[Tampere]], [[Turku]] and [[Vaasa]]. THL has a total staff of about 1300. THL's annual budget is about 100 million euros, of which about one third comes through funding sources other than the State budget. In addition, the following State institutions are subordinate to THL: state mental hospitals (in Kuopio and Vaasa), and state residential schools.

==Organisation==

Professor [[Juhani Eskola]] is the Director General of THL. The Assistant Directors General, heading the four divisions are: Marina Erhola (Health and Social Services), Terhi Kilpi (Health Protection), Marja Vaarama (Welfare and Health Policies), and Erkki Vartiainen (Welfare and Health Promotion).

==Functions==

THL functions as a governmental research and development institute which has official functions based in law.&lt;ref name=THL_act/&gt;&lt;ref name=THL/&gt; Research and development are usually intertwined. Own research generates new knowledge, but also makes it easier to absorb innovations from international science networks, and the institute then applies it for new development. On the other hand, it monitors the welfare and health of the population, as well as factors causing problems, and develops and promotes measures to improve the situation. This work often leads to new research demands. Thus the aim is high-quality research maintaining close contacts to international research networks, but keeping in mind the practical applications.&lt;ref name=THL/&gt;

THL comprises 14 departments belonging to four divisions. Most of the expenses are covered by the Government through state budget, but about a third of activities are paid from other sources, mainly competed research funding. Important sources are the Academy of Finland, Tekes – the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation, Framework Programs of the European Union, National Institutes of Health (USA), and ministries through their own budgets. Total budget for 2010 was about €94 million, 68% from the State budget, 27% from outside funding sources, and 5% from chargeable services.&lt;ref name=THLPP&gt;[http://www.thl.fi/thl-client/pdfs/e54b4390-3210-48e0-88a1-bded8f37d5cc THL]&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessors of THL have been responsible for vaccinations in Finland for almost a century (see [[National Public Health Institute of Finland]]). THL is active in research on vaccines, and also gives recommendations to the ministry to acquire vaccines for the public vaccination programs, monitors adverse events of vaccines, maintains certain statistics and so on. THL also does contract work for pharmaceutical and food industries. A partial source of income is clinical vaccine trials, including funds from the vaccine manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline. The legality of THL's close ties with vaccine manufactures was questioned by some parents and NGOs after unexpected side effects of H1N1 "swine flue" vaccines in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/ties_between_big_pharma_and_thl_draw_complaints_2147563.html YLE News 17 November 2010: Ties Between Big Pharma and THL Draw Complaints]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was investigated by the Justice Chancellor of Finland, and no wrongdoings were found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Health+officials+exonerated+over+swine+flu+vaccine+acquisition/1135268580641 Helsingin Sanomat, August 15, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Government and funding agencies have encouraged increased collaboration with companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aka.fi/Tiedostot/Tiedostot/Asiakirjat/INDICA_verkkosivut.pdf Working group appointed by the Academy of Finland, 2005: Long-term and dynamic partnerships.

[[File:Naval Architecture Course of Study.png|alt=Curriculum of Naval Architecture |thumb|256x256px|General Course of Study leading to Naval Architecture degree]]
'''Naval architecture''', or '''naval engineering''', along with [[automotive engineering]] and [[aerospace engineering]], is an [[engineering]] discipline branch of [[vehicle engineering]], incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering as applied to the [[engineering design process]], [[shipbuilding]], maintenance, and operation of [[watercraft|marine vessels]] and structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rina.org.uk/careers_in_naval_architecture.html RINA – Careers in Naval Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biran, Adrian; (2003). Ship hydrostatics and stability (1st Ed.) – [[Butterworth-Heinemann]]. {{ISBN|0-7506-4988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, [[Shipbuilding|construction]], [[Sea trial|trials]], operation and maintenance, launching and [[dry-docking]] are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being [[Ship#Repair and conversion|modified]] (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or [[ship repair|repair]]). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet [[statutory]] and non-statutory requirements.

==Main subjects==
The word "vessel" includes every description of [[watercraft]], including non-displacement craft, [[Ground effect vehicle|WIG craft]] and [[seaplane]]s, used or capable of being used as a means of [[Water transport|transportation on water]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention On The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], 1972,As Amended; [[International Maritime Organization]]; {{ISBN|92-801-4167-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal elements of naval architecture are:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis V, Edward (Ed.); (June 1989). Principles of Naval Architecture (2nd Rev.) Vol. 1 – [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]]. {{ISBN|0-939773-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrostatics===
[[Image:Lines plan en.svg|thumb|right|200px|Body plan of a ship showing the hull form]]
[[Hydrostatics]] concerns the conditions to which the vessel is subjected while at rest in water and to its ability to remain afloat. This involves computing [[buoyancy]], [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], and other hydrostatic properties such as [[Sailing ballast|trim]] (the measure of the longitudinal inclination of the vessel) and [[Ship stability|stability]] (the ability of a vessel to restore itself to an upright position after being inclined by wind, sea, or loading conditions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usna.edu/NAOE/academics/en342.php www.usna.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrodynamics===
[[Hydrodynamics]] concerns the flow of water around the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and [[stern]], and over bodies such as [[Boat Propeller|propeller]] blades or [[rudder]], or through thruster tunnels. 
[[Ship resistance and propulsion|Resistance]] – resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull. Powering calculation is done based on this.
[[Marine propulsion|Propulsion]] – to move the vessel through water using [[propellers]], thrusters, [[Pump-jet|water jets]], [[sail]]s etc. Engine types are mainly [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]]. Some vessels are electrically powered using [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear]] or [[solar energy]].
[[Ship motions]] – involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind.
Controllability (maneuvering) – involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel.

=== Flotation and stability ===
While atop a liquid surface a floating body has 6 degrees of freedom in its movements, these are categorized in either rotation or translation.
* Fore and aft translation is termed surge.
* Transverse translation is termed sway.
* Vertical translation is termed heave.
* Rotation about a transverse axis is termed trim or pitch.
* Rotation about a fore and aft axis is termed heel or roll.
* Rotation about a vertical axis is termed yaw.

Longitudinal stability for longitudinal inclinations, the stability depends upon the distance between the center of gravity and the longitudinal meta-center. In other words, the basis in which the ship maintains its center of gravity is its distance set equally apart from both the aft and forward section of the ship.

While a body floats on a liquid surface it still encounters the force of gravity pushing down on it. In order to stay afloat and avoid sinking there is an opposed force acting against the body known as the hydrostatic pressures. The forces acting on the body must be of the same magnitude and same line of motion in order to maintain the body at equilibrium. This description of equilibrium is only present when a freely floating body is in still water, when other conditions are present the magnitude of which these forces shifts drastically creating the swaying motion of the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Naval Architecture|last=Tupper|first=Eric|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the body, in other words, the mass of the body is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the body. This adds an upward force to the body by the amount of surface area times the area displaced in order to create an equilibrium between the surface of the body and the surface of the water.

The stability of a ship under most conditions is able to overcome any form or restriction or resistance encountered in rough seas; however, ships have undesirable roll characteristics when the balance of oscillations in roll is two times that of oscillations in heave, thus causing the ship to capsize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neves|first=M. A. S.|date=2016|title=Dynamic stability of ships in regular and irregular seas - An Overview|url=|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=120|pages=362–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oil tanker deck.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deck of an oil tanker, looking aft]]

===Structures===
[[Structural engineering|Structures]] involves selection of material of construction, [[structural analysis]] of global and local strength of the vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during [[Seakeeping|motions in seaway]]. Depending on the type of ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it. Some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship''',''' deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships such as the [[SS Great Eastern]], but later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them as the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arrangements===
Arrangements involves [[concept design]], layout and access, [[fire protection]], allocation of spaces, [[ergonomics]] and [[Tonnage|capacity]].

===Construction===
[[Shipbuilding|Construction]] depends on the material used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]], marking, [[Machining|cutting]] and [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] as per the [[structural design]] drawings or models, followed by erection and [[Ship launching|launching]]. [[Adhesive bonding|Other joining techniques]] are used for other materials like [[fibre reinforced plastic]] and [[glass-reinforced plastic]].The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When the strength of the structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered in the way that the ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prabowo|first=A. R.|date=2017|title=Effects of the rebounding of a striking ship on structural crashworthiness during ship-ship collision|url=|journal=Thin-Walled Structures|volume=115|pages=225–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and craft==
Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science.  The suitability of a vessel's shape was judged by looking at a half-model of a vessel or a prototype.  Ungainly shapes or abrupt transitions were frowned on as being flawed.  This included rigging, deck arrangements, and even fixtures.  Subjective descriptors such as ungainly, full, and fine were used as a substitute for the [[Hull (watercraft)|more precise terms]] used today.  A vessel was, and still is described as having a ‘fair’ shape.  The term ‘fair’ is meant to denote not only a smooth transition from fore to aft but also a shape that was ‘right.’  Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.

Modern low-cost digital [[computers]] and dedicated [[software]], combined with extensive research to correlate full-scale, [[towing tank]] and computational data, have enabled naval architects to more accurately predict the performance of a marine vehicle. These tools are used for [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|static stability]] (intact and damaged), dynamic stability, resistance, powering, hull development, [[structural analysis]], green water modelling, and slamming analysis. Data are regularly shared in international conferences sponsored by [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects|RINA]], [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers|Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)]] and others. [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] is being applied to predict the response of a floating body in a random sea.

==The naval architect==
[[File:Naval Architect at Work.JPG|thumb|Naval architect at work]]
Due to the complexity associated with operating in a marine environment, naval architecture is a co-operative effort between groups of technically skilled individuals who are specialists in particular fields, often coordinated by a lead naval architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html American Society of Naval Engineers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226035256/http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}. Naval engineering brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; This inherent complexity also means that the analytical tools available are much less evolved than those for designing aircraft, cars and even spacecraft.  This is due primarily to the paucity of data on the environment the marine vehicle is required to work in and the complexity of the interaction of waves and wind on a marine structure.

A naval architect is an [[engineer]] who is responsible for the design, construction, and/or repair of ships, boats, other marine vessels, and offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:

:* [[Merchant ship]]s – [[oil tanker]]s, [[LNG carrier|gas tankers]], [[cargo ship]]s, [[bulk carrier]]s, [[container ships]]
:* [[Ferry|Passenger/vehicle ferries]], [[cruise ship]]s
:* [[Warship]]s – [[frigate]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[aircraft carrier]]s, amphibious ships
:* [[Submarine]]s and underwater vehicles
:* [[Icebreaker]]s
:* [[High speed craft]] – [[hovercraft]], [[catamaran|multi-hull ships]], [[hydrofoil]] craft
:* Workboats – [[barge]]s, [[fishing boat]]s, [[anchor handling tug supply vessel]]s, [[platform supply vessel]]s, [[tug boat]]s, pilot vessels, rescue craft
:* [[Yacht]]s, power boats, and other recreational watercraft
:* [[Offshore platform]]s and [[Subsea#Oil and gas|subsea]] developments
[[File:Model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker, Florida .jpg|thumb|1/100 scale model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker. Florida]]
Some of these vessels are amongst the largest (such as [[supertankers]]), most complex (such as [[Aircraft carriers]]), and highly valued movable structures produced by mankind. They are typically the most efficient method of transporting the world's raw materials and products. Modern engineering on this scale is essentially a team activity conducted by specialists in their respective fields and disciplines. 
Naval architects integrate these activities. This demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability to bring together the often-conflicting demands of the various design constraints to produce a product which is fit for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Family Standard for Professional Work in the Engineering and Architecture Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, pp. 43–45 |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512122916/https://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this leadership role, a naval architect also has a specialist function in ensuring that a safe, economic, environmentally sound and [[seaworthy]] design is produced. To undertake all these tasks, a naval architect must have an understanding of many branches of engineering and must be in the forefront of high technology areas. He or she must be able to effectively utilize the services provided by scientists, lawyers, accountants, and business people of many kinds.

Naval architects typically work for [[shipyard]]s, ship owners, design firms and consultancies, equipment manufacturers, [[Classification society|Classification societies]], regulatory bodies ([[Admiralty law]]), [[Navy|navies]], and governments.

'''Optical lift''' is an [[optics|optical]] analogue of [[aerodynamic lift]], in which a [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] refractive object with differently shaped top and bottom surfaces experiences a stable transverse lift force when placed in a uniform stream of [[light]].&lt;ref name='Nature Photonics'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Stable optical lift | journal = Nature Photonics | volume = 5 | pages = 48 | date = 5 December 2010 | first = Grover A. | last = Swartzlander Jr | author2 = Timothy J.

== Discovery ==
[[File:Force components of optical lift, generated model.jpg|thumb|Optical lift is a component of force imparted from uniform light.]] [[File:First CP1 fabricated flying carpets.jpg|thumb|First CP1 fabricated flying carpets]] The ability of light to apply pressure to objects is known as [[radiation pressure]], which was first postulated in 1619 and proven in 1900.  This is the principle behind the [[solar sail]], which uses light [[radiation pressure]] to move through [[outer space|space]].  A 2010 study by physicist Grover Swartzlander and colleagues of the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] in Rochester, New York shows light is also capable of creating the more complex force of "[[lift (force)|lift]]", which is the force generated by [[airfoil]]s that make an airplane rise upwards as it travels forward. This study was published on December 2010 in ''[[Nature Photonics]]'' journal.  Swartzlander predicted, observed and experimentally verified at a micrometer-scale that when applying a beam of [[laser]] light to a semi-cylindrical refractive rod, it automatically torques into a stable [[angle of attack]], and then exhibits uniform [[Motion (physics)|motion]].&lt;ref name='Nature Photonics'/&gt;

The experiment began as [[computer model]]s that suggested when light is incident on a tiny object shaped like a [[wing]], a stable lift force is applied to the particle. Then the researchers decided to do physical experiments in the laboratory, and they created tiny, transparent, micrometer-sized rods that were flat on one side and rounded on the other, rather like airplane wings. They immersed the lightfoils in water and bombarded them with 130&amp;nbsp;mW [[infrared]] laser light from underneath the chamber. [[Radiation pressure]] pushes the particles along the direction of propagation, this is called the [[optical tweezers|scatter force]], but the excitement came when the particles were forced to the side in a direction perpendicular to the direction of propagating light.  The transverse force on the particles is the lift force.  The researchers discovered not only that the rods experienced stable lift, but that, depending on refractive index, the rod could have up to two stable angles of attack it rotated to when exposed to the laser light. Symmetrical spheres tested did not exhibit this same lift effect.&lt;ref name='Physorg'&gt;{{cite news | first = Lin | last = Edwards | title = Optical lifting demonstrated for the first time | date = 7 December 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-optical-video.html | work = Physorg | accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In optical lift, created by a "lightfoil", the lift is created within the transparent object as light shines through it and is [[refraction|refracted]] by its inner surfaces. In the lightfoil rods a greater proportion of light leaves in a direction perpendicular to the beam and this side therefore experiences a larger radiation pressure and hence, lift.&lt;ref name='Physorg'/&gt;

== Potential uses ==
[[File:Diagram of flying carpets on solar sail.jpg|thumb|Using optical lift to steer solar sails]] The 2010 discovery of stable optical lift is considered by some physicists to be "most surprising".&lt;ref name='BBC'/&gt; Unlike [[optical tweezers]], an intensity gradient is not required to achieve a transverse force. Many rods may therefore be lifted simultaneously in a single quasi-uniform beam of light. Swartzlander and his team propose using optical lift to power micromachines, transport microscopic particles in a liquid, or to help on self-alignment and steering of [[solar sails]],&lt;ref name='BBC'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason | last = Palmer | title = 'Lightfoil' idea shows light can provide lift | date = 8 December 2010 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11927793 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[spacecraft propulsion]] for interstellar space travel. Solar sails are generally designed to harness light to "push" a spacecraft, whereas Swartzlander designed their lightfoil to lift in a perpendicular direction; this is where the idea of being able to steer a future solar sail spacecraft may be applied.&lt;ref name='Kaku'&gt;{{cite news | first = Michio | last = Kaku | title = Optical Lift May Allow Us to Steer Solar Sail Spacecrafts and Nano Devices | date = 7 December 2010 | url = http://bigthink.com/ideas/25305 | work = Big Think | accessdate = 2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swartzlander said the next step would be to test lightfoils in air and experiment with a variety of materials with different refractive properties, and with incoherent light.&lt;ref name='Physorg'/&gt;

The '''Pietroasele Treasure''' (or the '''Petrossa Treasure''') found in [[Pietroasele, Buzău]], [[Romania]], in 1837, is a late fourth-century [[Goths|Gothic]] treasure that included some twenty-two objects of gold, among the most famous examples of the polychrome style of [[Migration Period art]]. Of the twenty-two pieces, only twelve have survived, conserved at the [[National Museum of Romanian History]], in [[Bucharest]]: a large eagle-headed [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] and three smaller ones encrusted with semi-precious stones; a [[patera]], or round sacrificial dish,  modelled with [[Orphic]] figures &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Joseph.

When [[Alexandru Odobescu]] published his book on the treasure,&lt;ref&gt;Odobescu, Alexandru, ''Le Trésor de Petrossa'', [[Paris]], 1889-1900.&lt;/ref&gt; he considered that such magnificent work could only have belonged to [[Athanaric]] (died 381), leader of the [[Thervings]], a Gothic people. Modern archaeologists cannot connect the hoard with such a glamorous name.

The treasure was shipped to [[Russia]] in December 1916, as [[German Empire|German]] armies advanced through Romania in [[World War I]], and was not returned until 1956.

An atomic analysis of the Pietroasele gold hoard has concluded that from the point of view of Ir/Au, Cu/Au and Ag/Au concentrations the three styles are clustered. At least from the iridium concentration data, the assumption of a Dacian provenance of the hoard raw material is highly improbable as also the hypothesis that Roman imperial gold coins were used for manufacturing Pietroasa artifacts is not in accordance with the elemental concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, 240 (1999) 897 NUCLEAR ANALYSES OF THE PIETROASA GOLD HOARD, Viorel Cojocaru, Cãlin Besliu and Cristina Anton Manea&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19963">'''Pollution prevention (P2)''' is a strategy for reducing the amount of waste created and released into the environment, particularly by industrial facilities, agriculture, or consumers. Many large corporations view P2 as a method of improving the efficiency and profitability of production processes by [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]] and technology advancements.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-05-01|title=Cleaner production and profitability: analysis of 134 industrial pollution prevention (P2) project reports |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652604000071 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=13 |issue=6|pages=593–605|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2003.12.025|issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative bodies have enacted P2 measures, such as the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]] and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Harry |last2=Harten |first2=Teresa |last3=Springer |first3=Johnny|last4=Randall|first4=Paul|last5=Curran|first5=Mary Ann|last6=Stone|first6=Kenneth|date=1992|title=Industrial Pollution Prevention!

== Background ==
[[File:Los Angeles Pollution.jpg|thumb|303x303px|The pollution in Los Angeles is very evident, prompting calls for pollution prevention strategies.]]

=== Significance ===
Pollution prevention is any action (large or small) that reduces the amount of contaminants released into the environment. By implementing P2 processes, fewer hazards will be posed to both public health and natural well being. Thus, P2 is a key method to preserving [[natural resource]]s. It can also have significant financial benefits in large scale processes.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/p2/learn-about-pollution-prevention |title=Learn About Pollution Prevention |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long run, by implementing suggested P2 processes, large corporations may realize great benefits. If companies produce less waste, they do not have to worry about proper disposal. Thus, P2 is also a proactive measure to reduce costs of waste disposal and elimination.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== Sources ===
[[File:Port Auckland (373471767).jpg|thumb|Ships in port often have engines idling for days, releasing copious amounts of pollutants.]]
[[Port|Shipping ports]] are a significant source of pollution due to the heavy cargo traffic that these areas receive. The impact of these ships is quite widespread, affecting coastal communities and ecosystems across the globe. Most major shipping ports are located near environmentally sensitive [[Estuary|estuaries]]. These areas are particularly impacted by high levels of [[diesel exhaust]], [[Particulates|particulate matter]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[ozone]], and [[sulfur oxide]]s. The solution for reducing port-related pollution is multi-fold, encompassing attainable alternatives and long-term reduction goals. Examples of simple steps include a restriction on engine idling for ships in the port and the use of cleaner grade diesel fuels. Some more expensive measures can be taken to mitigate the pollution of ships. Replacing older model ships with ships containing new engines allows the ships to meet modern emission standards. Exhaust systems can also be retrofitted in order to reduce exhaust emissions. Looking ahead into the future, there are a few technologies being developed. For example, plugging ships into “shore-side” power sources may eliminate the need for idling engines. Additionally, various sources of alternative fuel are being developed, the most significant of which is a [[fuel cell]] unit.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2004-10-01 |title=Pollution prevention at ports: clearing the air |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195925504000745 |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |volume=24 |issue=7-8 |pages=749–774 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2004.06.005 |issn=0195-9255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to increased trade, the emissions from ships are expected to become the second largest source of diesel particulate matter by 2020. One approach to reduction as set forth by the International Forum on Globalization (IFG) is to increase the amount of local trading, thereby reducing the number of miles that ships have to travel. Another approach regards the strategic placement of ports close to land transportation infrastructure (i.e. roads and railroads). Again, this reduces the number of miles that vehicles have to travel between the initial and final destinations. Railroads that reach all the way to ports are a significant way to produce less toxic pollutants, as this eliminates the need for less-efficient trucks to transport the goods from the coastal port to the inland railroad infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

=== Health Hazards ===
There are many health hazards associated with pollution that P2 strategies aim to mitigate. Long-term exposure to certain pollutants can cause cancer, heart disease, asthma, birth defects, and premature death.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Additionally, excessive pollution to water sources can be detrimental to the [[biodiversity]] present in different areas around the globe.

== U.S. Legislation ==
=== Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 ===
In order to enforce some of the notions of P2, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Pollution Prevention Act of 1990]]. Congress declared that pollution should be prevented and reduced wherever possible; in addition, any waste that must be released into the environment must be done in a responsible, environmentally-conscious manner. The law requires the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to:
* create effective policies
* establish a standard form of measurement of P2
* establish a network and advisory board among EPA offices to coordinate the prevention initiatives and data collection
* create a training program to be distributed to EPA offices
* identify aspects of policies that can be presented to and enforced by Congress
* create a model of source reduction that can be used to teach interested industries of P2 opportunities
* integrate a reward program to encourage companies to comply with regulations.

In order to enforce the points outlined in the Act, EPA is directed to present a report to Congress biennially. Another aspect of the report required that companies fill out a toxic chemical release form allowing EPA to collect information on the levels of pollution released into the environment.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== Clean Air Act ===
The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]] provided many P2 strategies, including governmental intervention, research and development programs, guidelines for efficient technologies, reduction of vehicle emissions, and a suggested Congressional status report.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

=== 2010-2014 Pollution Prevention Program Strategic Plan ===
The EPA ''2010-2014 Pollution Prevention Program Strategic Plan'' introduced a number of ways to reduce harmful industrial outputs (i.e. [[greenhouse gas]]es, hazardous materials) while conserving natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/p2/pollution-prevention-law-and-policies |title=Pollution Prevention Law and Policies |publisher=EPA |access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production techniques==
As an environmental management strategy, P2 shares many attributes with [[cleaner production]], a term used more commonly outside the [[United States]]. Pollution prevention encompasses more specialized sub-disciplines including [[green chemistry]] and [[Sustainable design|green design]] (also known as environmentally conscious design).

== Pollution Prevention in Industrial Processes ==
[[File:Truck load of ponderosa pine, Edward Hines Lumber Co, operations in Malheur National Forest, Grant County, Oregon, July 1942.jpg|thumb|Lumber is an example of a raw material that can be saved through implementation of pollution prevention processes.]]
The possibilities of P2 strategies are still being implemented at the corporate level, but benefits are already being realized by many companies. Recently, the view of P2 in industrial businesses has shifted from one of necessity to one of strategic advantage. If companies invest in P2 methods early in their development, they realize greater gains not too far down the road.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; Additionally, if companies do not produce waste, they do not have to worry about properly disposing of it. Thus, P2 is a proactive measure taken to reduce costs in the long run that would have been dedicated to disposal and elimination of waste.&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

There are two main ways to reduce waste through P2: waste reduction and technology improvements. Waste reduction at the source implies the same amount of input raw materials with less waste and more output of the product. Technology improvements imply changes to the production process that reduce the amount of output waste, such as an improved [[recycling]] process. Companies are moving past simply complying with the minimum environmental requirements, and they are taking a more strategic, forward-thinking stance on tackling the issue. However, the advancements in technology are still limited, implying that P2 techniques are still in the early stages of formation. The most profitable strategy is “in-process recycling.” Though it is not the most efficient form of “reduction at the source,” recycling is very profitable due to its ease of process. By engaging in recycling practices, industries not only cut down on the amount of material discarded as environmentally-hazardous waste, but they also increase profitability by reducing the amount of [[raw material]] purchased. The most widespread strategy is “reduction at the source,” which is the idea that byproducts of production can be reduced through efficient and careful use of natural resources. This method reduces the amount of dangerous pollutants present in waste before the waste is released. In turn, this creates a safer environment free of hazardous waste. This idea ties strongly into the benefits to corporations of investing in newer, more efficient technology.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Pollution Prevention Strategies ==

=== P2 Task Force ===
In order to reduce costs of P2 techniques, many officials are turning to pollution elimination strategies, thereby eliminating any need for end-of-pipe solutions. A task force was created by the EPA in order to directly target reduction strategies. The P2 program task force has 5 main goals:

# create feasible P2 objectives and corresponding time frames
# provide training to the individuals involved in the effort
# oversee the program's main tasks and measure progress
# evaluate the progress of the effort
# maintain the program's goals long term&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2008-01-15 |title=Sustainable development of process facilities: State-of-the-art review of pollution prevention frameworks |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940701237X |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=4–20 |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2007.08.062 |issn=0304-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary Approach ===
Voluntary approaches to P2 are on the rise. Governmental organization often collaborate with businesses and regulatory agencies to create a structure of guidelines. There are four types of voluntary approach programs: public voluntary programs, negotiated agreements, unilateral commitments, and private agreements. Public voluntary agreements are the least restrictive. Environmental authorities collaborate and create specific guidelines. Companies are then invited to follow these procedures on a strictly voluntary basis. Negotiated agreements are created through collaboration between public authorities and industry authorities. The agreement establishes bargains that are beneficial to the industry. Unilateral commitments are established by industry authorities alone, and the guidelines they set are [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulated]]. Private agreements are established between “polluters” and other affected parties. The regulations set forth create a compromise regarding a variety of pollution regulation strategies. The United States mainly follows the end-of-pipe prevention strategy. However, US President [[Richard Nixon]] created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970, and one of its principal missions was to regulate pollution. EPA’s implementation of policies is almost entirely voluntary.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2011-03-01 |title=A review of international practice in the design of voluntary Pollution Prevention Programs |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652610001150 |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=542–551 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.03.015 |issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few keys to a successful voluntary approach. First, the program needs a dependable source of funding (from the government, usually). The program also needs a dynamic relationship with the targeted industries. This creates a base of trust between all involved in the agreement. In terms of regulation, the program should be monitored by a reliable source. In order to assure that the program will establish itself long term, there should be visible benefits to the participants and obvious results to the greater community. The long-term establishment of the program also comes from setting attainable goals to measure progress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Governmental Approach ===
EPA has published waste minimization guidelines that comprise 5 major steps:
# organizing the primary task force
# assessing the current pollution situation
# evaluating the feasibility of different program options
# reporting and planning the preparations based upon the analysis
# implementing the program.

This framework mainly benefits smaller facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Waste Reduction Approach ===
The Waste Reduction Algorithm (WRA) is used to quantitatively describe the benefits of different P2 strategies based on each unique facility. The WRA tracks pollutants through the entire production process in order to obtain accurate measurements.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Industrial Efforts ===
By maximizing P2 opportunities, some companies choose to redesign their entire industrial process. Managers focus more on what enters and moves through the entire process, instead of only focusing on the output. Overall, the P2 strategies that financially benefit companies are the most likely to be implemented. However, since P2 has only recently been realized as a cost benefit, many corporations have not adopted significant measures to realize the potential gain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lober |first=Douglas J. |date=1998 |title=Pollution prevention as corporate entrepreneurship |url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09534819810369554 |journal=Journal of Organizational Change Management |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=26–37 |doi=10.1108/09534819810369554 |issn=0953-4814|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential Benefits ====
Pollution prevention can also be viewed as a form of environmental entrepreneurship, as companies are increasingly concerned with the cost benefits of reducing the amount of waste created. For example, [[3M]] has accrued a savings of over $750 million since 1973 due to their implementation of P2 incentives. If implemented correctly, P2 strategies can result in an increase in yield, a commonly sought after result of industrial processes. Pollution prevention can also reduce the cost of waste removal because of the reduces amount of waste to remove. By preventing the amount of pollution released, companies can avoid some of the liability costs imposed when large amounts of pollution are released and contaminate the land on which the facility is located.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Individual Efforts ===
[[File:Senate Energy-efficient Lighting (28475055803).jpg|thumb|Installing energy efficient lighting and appliances are a relatively cheap way to reduce pollution on a smaller scale.]]
According to EPA, there are some everyday steps that can be taken to prevent pollution:

* Use paper in limited quantities, and print double-sided. Also, look for paper that has been made with recycled materials.
* When shopping, buy in bulk in order to reduce the amount of packaging required to package the goods. Look for products made with recycled materials. Bring reusable bags in which to carry purchased goods in order to reduce the number of disposed paper/plastic bags.
* Use water sparingly by installing water-efficient shower heads and faucets, and install [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient appliances]]. Make sure that sinks and hoses are not dripping. Do not excessively water plants.
* Use transportation efficiently, and utilize mass transportation when possible. Recycling used motor oil is also a way to eliminate the disposal of a hazardous material.
* Eating locally produced foods reduces the amount of fuel required for the food's transportation.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt;

Additional examples of P2 include using energy efficient machinery, developing clean-burning fuel, reducing the amount of chemicals released into water sources, creating a production process that results in a reduced amount of waste, and utilizing water conservation techniques.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

{{Certainty}}
The '''problem of induction''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] question of whether [[inductive reasoning]] leads to [[knowledge]] understood in the [[Justified true belief|classic philosophical sense]],&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, John, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#CanIndJus "Can induction be justified?"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the apparent lack of justification for:

# Generalizing about the properties of a class of objects based on some number of observations of particular instances of that class (e.g., the inference that "all swans we have seen are white, and, therefore, all swans are white", before the discovery of [[black swan]]s) or
# Presupposing that a sequence of events in the future will occur as it always has in the past (e.g., that the [[laws of physics]] will hold as they have always been observed to hold). Hume called this the principle of [[uniformitarianism|uniformity of nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |title=''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/9662/pg9662.txt |work=Gutenberg Press }}#9662: Most recently updated in 16 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem calls into question all [[empirical]] claims made in everyday life or through the [[scientific method]], and, for that reason, the philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] said that "induction is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy." Although the problem arguably dates back to the [[Pyrrhonism]] of [[ancient philosophy]], as well as the [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], [[David Hume]] popularized it in the mid-18th century.

== Formulation of the problem ==
[[File:Buck Creek IN - sunrise.jpg|thumb|Usually inferred from repeated observations: ''"The sun always rises in the east"''.]]
[[File:Vainaja kannethaan.jpg|thumb|Usually not inferred from repeated observations: ''"If someone dies, it's never me"''.]]
In [[inductive reasoning]], one makes a series of observations and [[inference|infers]] a new claim based on them. For instance, from a series of observations that a woman walks her dog by the market at 8am on Monday, it seems valid to infer that next Monday she will do the same, or that, in general, the woman walks her dog by the market every Monday. That next Monday the woman walks by the market merely adds to the series of observations, it does not prove she will walk by the market every Monday. First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, [[David Hume]] would even argue that we cannot claim it is "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.

Second, the observations themselves do not establish the validity of inductive reasoning, except inductively. [[Bertrand Russell]] illustrated this point in ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'':

{{Cquote
| quote = Domestic animals expect food when they see the person who usually feeds them. We know that all these rather crude expectations of uniformity are liable to be misleading. The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have been useful to the chicken.
| 2 = 
}}

In several publications it is presented as a story about a turkey, fed every morning without fail, who following the laws of induction concludes this will continue, but then his throat is cut on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;This story is found in Alan Chalmers, ''What is this thing Called Science'', Open University Press, Milton Keynes, 1982, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient and early modern origins===
[[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonian]] skeptic [[Sextus Empiricus]] first questioned the validity of inductive reasoning, positing that a universal rule could not be established from an incomplete set of particular instances. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite.}}

The focus upon the gap between the premises and conclusion present in the above passage appears different from Hume's focus upon the [[circular reasoning]] of induction. However, Weintraub claims in [[The Philosophical Quarterly]]&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub, R. (1995). What was Hume's Contribution to the Problem of Induction? The Philosophical Quarterly 45(181):460-470&lt;/ref&gt; that although Sextus's approach to the problem appears different, Hume's approach was actually an application of another argument raised by Sextus:&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'', trans. Robert Gregg Bury (Loeb ed.) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is truthworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''ad infinitum''.}}

Although the [[regress argument|criterion argument]] applies to both deduction and induction, Weintraub believes that Sextus's argument "is precisely the strategy Hume invokes against induction: it cannot be justified, because the purported justification, being inductive, is circular." She concludes that "Hume's most important legacy is the supposition that the justification of induction is not analogous to that of deduction." She ends with a discussion of Hume's implicit sanction of the validity of deduction, which Hume describes as intuitive in a manner analogous to modern [[foundationalism]].

The [[Cārvāka|Carvaka]], a materialist and skeptic school of Indian philosophy, used the problem of induction to point out the flaws in using inference as a way to gain valid knowledge. They held that since inference needed an invariable connection between the middle term and the predicate, and further, that since there was no way to establish this invariable connection, that the efficacy of inference as a means of valid knowledge could never be stated.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy Vol I, pg 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Dasgupta - A history of Indian philosophy, Vol III. pg 533&lt;/ref&gt;

The 9th century Indian skeptic, [[Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa|Jayarasi Bhatta]], also made an attack on inference, along with all means of knowledge, and showed by a type of reductio argument that there was no way to conclude universal relations from the observation of particular instances.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Balcerowicz, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jayaraasi/ "Jayarāśi"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franco, Eli, 1987, Perception, Knowledge and Disbelief: A Study of Jayarāśi's Scepticism&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval writers such as [[al-Ghazali]] and [[William of Ockham]] connected the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, J. (2001), ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 232-3, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duns Scotus]] however argued that inductive inference from a finite number of particulars to a universal generalization was justified by "a proposition reposing in the soul, 'Whatever occurs in a great many instances by a cause that is not free, is the natural effect of that cause.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;''Duns Scotus: Philosophical Writings'', trans. A. Wolter (Edinburgh:, 1962), 109-10; Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 17th-century [[Jesuits]] argued that although God could create the end of the world at any moment, it was necessarily a rare event and hence our confidence that it would not happen very soon was largely justified.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, ''Science of Conjecture'', 223-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== David Hume &lt;!--'Hume's scepticism about induction' and 'Hume's skepticism about induction' redirect here--&gt;===
Few philosophers are as associated with induction as [[David Hume]]. He described the problem in ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'', §4, based on his [[epistemology|epistemological]] framework. Here, "reason" refers to [[deductive reasoning]] and "induction" refers to [[inductive reasoning]].

First, Hume ponders the discovery of [[causality|causal relations]], which form the basis for what he refers to as "matters of fact". He argues that causal relations are found not by reason, but by induction. This is because for any cause, multiple effects are conceivable, and the actual effect cannot be determined by reasoning about the cause; instead, one must observe occurrences of the causal relation to discover that it holds. For example, when one thinks of "a billiard ball moving in a straight line toward another",&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; one can conceive that the first ball bounces back with the second ball remaining at rest, the first ball stops and the second ball moves, or the first ball jumps over the second, etc. There is no reason to conclude any of these possibilities over the others. Only through previous observation can it be predicted, inductively, what will actually happen with the balls. In general, it is not necessary that causal relation in the future resemble causal relations in the past, as it is always conceivable otherwise; for Hume, this is because the negation of the claim does not lead to a contradiction.

Next, Hume ponders the justification of induction. If all matters of fact are based on causal relations, and all causal relations are found by induction, then induction must be shown to be valid somehow. He uses the fact that induction assumes a valid connection between the proposition "I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect" and the proposition "I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects".&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; One connects these two propositions not by reason, but by induction. This claim is supported by the same reasoning as that for causal relations above, and by the observation that even rationally inexperienced people can infer, for example, that touching fire causes pain. Hume challenges other philosophers to come up with a (deductive) reason for the connection. If a deductive justification for induction cannot be provided, then it appears that induction is based on an inductive assumption about the connection, which would be [[begging the question]]. Induction, itself, cannot validly explain the connection.

In this way, the problem of induction is not only concerned with the uncertainty of conclusions derived by induction, but doubts the very principle through which those uncertain conclusions are derived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#JusInd The Problem of Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nelson Goodman's new riddle of induction===
{{main|New riddle of induction}}
[[Nelson Goodman]]'s ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'' presented a different description of the problem of induction in the chapter entitled "The New Riddle of Induction". Goodman proposed the new [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] "[[Grue and Bleen|grue]]". Something is grue if and only if it has been (or will be, according to a scientific, general hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson. ''Fact, Fiction, and Forecast'' (Fourth Edition). Harvard University Press, 1983, p.74, "will each confirm the general hypothesis that all emeralds are grue"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.mit.edu/~tchow/grue.html Goodman’s original definition of grue]&lt;/ref&gt;) observed to be green before a certain time ''t'', or blue if observed after that time. The "new" problem of induction is, since all emeralds we have ever seen are both green and grue, why do we suppose that after time ''t'' we will find green but not grue emeralds? The problem here raised is that two different inductions will be true and false under the same conditions. In other words:

– Given the observations of a lot of green emeralds, someone using a common language will inductively infer that all emeralds are green (therefore, he will believe that any emerald he will ever find will be green, even after time ''t'').

– Given the same set of observations of green emeralds, someone using the predicate "grue" will inductively infer that all emeralds, which will be observed after ''t'', will be blue, despite the fact that he observed only green emeralds so far.

Goodman, however, points out that the predicate "grue" only appears more complex than the predicate "green" because we have defined grue in terms of blue and green. If we had always been brought up to think in terms of "grue" and "bleen" (where bleen is blue before time ''t'', or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider "green" to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are "entrenched" in our language.

[[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] offers a practical solution to this problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[Nicholas Rescher]]|title=Essays in Honor of [[Carl G. Hempel]]| publisher=D. Reidel |location=Dordrecht |author=Willard Van Orman Quine |contribution=Natural Kinds |year=1970 |pages=41–56 |contribution-url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/quine_nk.pdf|display-editors=etal}} Reprinted in: Quine (1969), ''Ontological Relativity and Other Essays'', Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; by making the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim that only predicates that identify a "[[natural kind]]" (i.e. a real property of real things) can be legitimately used in a scientific hypothesis. [[Roy Bhaskar|R. Bhaskar]] also offers a practical solution to the problem. He argues that the problem of induction only arises if we deny the  possibility  of  a  reason for the predicate,  located  in  the  enduring  nature  of  something.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Realist Theory of Science|last=Bhaskar|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-45494-0|location=New York|pages=215–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, we know that all emeralds are green, not because we have only ever seen green emeralds, but because the chemical make-up of emeralds insists that they must be green. If we were to change that structure, they would not be green. For instance, emeralds are a kind of green [[beryl]], made green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium. Without these trace elements, the gems would be colourless.

==Notable interpretations==

===Hume===
{{See also|David Hume#Induction_and_causation|l1=David Hume on the problem of induction}}
Although induction is not made by reason, Hume observes that we nonetheless perform it and improve from it. He proposes a descriptive explanation for the nature of induction in §5 of the ''Enquiry'', titled "Skeptical solution of these doubts". It is by custom or habit that one draws the inductive connection described above, and "without the influence of custom we would be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses."&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of custom is belief, which is instinctual and much stronger than imagination alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry'', §5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Stove and Donald Williams===
[[David Stove]]'s argument for induction, based on the [[statistical syllogism]], was presented in the ''Rationality of Induction'' and was developed from an argument put forward by one of Stove's heroes, the late [[Donald Cary Williams]] (formerly Professor at Harvard) in his book ''The Ground of Induction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Donald Cary Williams | title=The Ground of Induction | location=New York | publisher=Russell and Russell | year=1947 }}, {{cite web |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ |title=Donald Cary Williams |date=2015 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=2017-03-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Stove argued that it is a statistical truth that the great majority of the possible subsets of specified size (as long as this size is not too small) are similar to the larger population to which they belong. For example, the majority of the subsets which contain 3000 ravens which you can form from the raven population are similar to the population itself (and this applies no matter how large the raven population is, as long as it is not infinite). Consequently, Stove argued that if you find yourself with such a subset then the chances are that this subset is one of the ones that are similar to the population, and so you are justified in concluding that it is likely that this subset "matches" the population reasonably closely. The situation would be analogous to drawing a ball out of a barrel of balls, 99% of which are red. In such a case you have a 99% chance of drawing a red ball. Similarly, when getting a sample of ravens the probability is very high that the sample is one of the matching or "representative" ones. So as long as you have no reason to think that your sample is an unrepresentative one, you are justified in thinking that probably (although not certainly) that it is.&lt;ref&gt;D. Stove, ''The Rationality of Induction'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1986, ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biting the Bullett: Keith Campbell and Claudio Costa===
An intuitive answer to Hume would be to say that a world inacessible to any inductive procedure would simply not be conceivable. This intuition was taking into account by [[Keith Campbell (philosopher)|Keith Campbell]] by considering that to be built a concept must be reapplied, what demands a certain continuity in its object of application and consequently some openness to induction &lt;ref&gt;"One form of Skepticism about Induction", in Richard Swinburne (ed.) ''The Justification of the Induction''. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;. Recently, [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] has noted that a future can only be a future of its own past if it holds some identity with it. Moreover, the nearer a future is to the point of junction with its past, the greater are the similarities tendentially involved. Consequently - ''contra'' Hume - some form of principle of homogeneity (causal or structural) between future and past must be warranted, what would make some inductive procedure always possible.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa: ''Philosophical Semantics: Reintegrating Theoretical Philosophy'', Appendix to Ch. V, CSP, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Karl Popper===
[[Karl Popper]], a [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], sought to solve the problem of induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Popper, the problem of induction as usually conceived is asking the wrong question: it is asking how to justify theories given they cannot be justified by induction. Popper argued that justification is not needed at all, and seeking justification "begs for an authoritarian answer". Instead, Popper said, what should be done is to look to find and correct errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-06-131376-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Popper regarded theories that have survived criticism as better corroborated in proportion to the amount and stringency of the criticism, but, in sharp contrast to the inductivist theories of knowledge, emphatically as less likely to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}}''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', section 43&lt;/ref&gt; Popper held that seeking for theories with a high probability of being true was a false goal that is in conflict with the search for knowledge. Science should seek for theories that are most probably false on the one hand (which is the same as saying that they are highly falsifiable and so there are lots of ways that they could turn out to be wrong), but still all actual attempts to falsify them have failed so far (that they are highly corroborated).

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] criticizes Popper on the grounds that predictions need to be made both for practical purposes and in order to test theories. That means Popperians need to make a selection from the number of unfalsified theories available to them, which is generally more than one. Popperians would wish to choose well-corroborated theories, in their sense of corroboration, but face a dilemma: either they are making the essentially inductive claim that a theory's having survived criticism in the past means it will be a reliable predictor in the future; or Popperian corroboration is no indicator of predictive power at all, so  there is no rational motivation for their preferred selection principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Foundations of Scientific Inference
| author = [[Wesley C. Salmon]]
| year = 1967
| pages = 26
| accessdate = 27 December 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] has criticized this kind of criticism by Salmon and others because it makes inductivist assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=David |title=Critical rationalism: A restatement and defense |date=1994 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper does not say that corroboration is an indicator of predictive power. The predictive power{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} is in the theory itself, not in its corroboration. The rational motivation for choosing a well-corroborated theory is that it is simply easier to falsify: Well-corroborated means that at least one kind of experiment (already conducted at least once) could have falsified (but did not actually falsify) the one theory, while the same kind of experiment, regardless of its outcome, could not have falsified the other. So it is rational to choose the well-corroborated theory: It may not be more likely to be true, but if it is actually false, it is easier to get rid of when confronted with the conflicting evidence that will eventually turn up. Accordingly, it is wrong to consider corroboration as a reason, a [[justificationism|justification]] for believing in a theory or as an argument in favor of a theory to convince someone who objects to it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bullemore, [https://www.academia.edu/4154895/Some_Remarks_on_the_Pragmatic_Problem_of_Induction "Some Remarks on the Pragmatic Problem of Induction"], Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Primary and secondary cotton roots.jpg|thumb|right|Primary and secondary roots in a cotton plant]]

'''Root pressure''' is the transverse osmotic pressure within the cells of a root system that causes sap to rise through a plant stem to the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Structure and Function of Roots: Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Structure and Function of Roots, June 20–26, 1993 |volume= 58 |editor1= F. Baluska|editor2=Milada Ciamporová|editor3=Otília Gasparíková|editor4=Peter W. Barlow |edition= illustrated |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year= 2013 |isbn= 9789401731010 |page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root pressure occurs in the [[xylem]] of some [[vascular plant]]s when the soil moisture level is high either at night or when [[transpiration]] is low during the day. When transpiration is high, xylem sap is usually under tension, rather than under pressure, due to [[transpirational pull]]. At night in some plants, root pressure causes [[guttation]] or exudation of drops of xylem sap from the tips or edges of leaves. Root pressure is studied by removing the shoot of a plant near the soil level. Xylem sap will exude from the cut [[Plant stem|stem]] for hours or days due to root pressure. If a pressure gauge is attached to the cut stem, the root pressure can be measured.

Root pressure is caused by active distribution of mineral nutrient ions into the [[root]] xylem. Without transpiration to carry the ions up the stem, they accumulate in the root xylem and lower the [[water potential]]. Water then diffuses from the soil into the root xylem due to [[osmosis]]. Root pressure is caused by this accumulation of water in the xylem pushing on the rigid cells. Root pressure provides a force, which pushes water up the stem, but it is not enough to account for the movement of water to leaves at the top of the tallest [[tree]]s. The maximum root pressure measured in some plants can raise water only to 6.87 meters, and the tallest trees are over 100 meters tall.

==Role of endodermis==
The [[endodermis]] in the root is important in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] and the [[pericycle]]. These cells allow water movement until it reaches the [[Casparian strip]], made of [[suberin]], a waterproof substance. The Casparian strip prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the [[apoplast pathway]]. Ions outside the endodermis must be [[active transport|actively transported]] across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via [[plasmodesmata]] or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The Casparian strip substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.

==Importance==
Root pressure can transport water and dissolved mineral nutrients from roots through the xylem to the tops of relatively short plants when transpiration is low or zero. The maximum root pressure measured is about 0.6 [[Pascal (unit)|megapascals]] but some species never generate any root pressure. The main contributor to the movement of water and mineral nutrients upward in vascular plants is considered to be the [[transpirational pull]]. However, sunflower plants grown in 100% relative humidity grew normally and accumulated the same amount of mineral nutrients as plants in normal humidity, which had a transpiration rate 10 to 15 times the plants in 100% humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tanner|first1=W.|last2=Beevers|first2=H.|title=Transpiration, a prerequisite for long-distance transport of minerals in plants?|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=31 July 2001|volume=98|issue=16|pages=9443–9447|doi=10.1073/pnas.161279898|pmid=11481499|pmc=55440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, transpiration may not be as important in upward mineral nutrient transport in relatively short plants as often assumed.

Xylem vessels sometimes empty over winter. Root pressure may be important in refilling the xylem vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sperry|first1=J. S.|last2=Holbrook|first2=N. M.|last3=Zimmermann|first3=M. H.|last4=Tyree|first4=M. T.|title=Spring Filling of Xylem Vessels in Wild Grapevine|journal=Plant Physiology|date=February 1987|volume=83|issue=2|pages=414–417|doi=10.1104/pp.83.2.414|pmc=1056371}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some species vessels refill without root pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tibbetts|first1=T. J.|last2=Ewers|first2=F. W.|title=Root pressure and specific conductivity in temperate lianas: exotic Celastrus orbiculatus (Celastraceae) vs. native Vitis riparia (Vitaceae).|journal=American Journal of Botany|date=September 2000|volume=87|issue=9|pages=1272–1278|pmid=10991898|doi=10.2307/2656720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Root pressure is often high in some deciduous trees before they leaf out. Transpiration is minimal without leaves, and organic solutes are being mobilized so decrease the xylem water potential. [[Sugar maple]] accumulates high concentrations of sugars in its xylem early in the spring, which is the source of maple sugar. Some trees "bleed" xylem sap profusely when their stems are pruned in late winter or early spring, e.g. [[maple]] and [[elm]]. Such bleeding is similar to root pressure only sugars, rather than ions, may lower the xylem water potential. In the unique case of maple trees, sap bleeding is caused by changes in stem pressure and not root pressure [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/efans/ygnews/2009/04/the_mystery_of_maple_sap_flow.html].

It is very likely that all grasses produce root pressure. In bamboos, root pressure is correlated with maximum height of a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Kun-Fang|last2=Yang|first2=Shi-Jian|last3=Zhang|first3=Yong-Jiang|last4=Brodribb|first4=T.J.|title=Maximum height of grasses is determined by roots|journal=Ecology Letters|date=July 2012|volume=15|issue=7|pages=666-672|pmid=22489611|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Schmidt Ocean Institute''' is a non-profit [[private foundation]] focused on [[oceanography]], founded in March 2009 by [[Eric Schmidt]] and [[Wendy Schmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Schmidt Family Foundation and Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 |url = http://theschmidt.org/site/grants/media/pdf/2010_audited_financial_statement.pdf | publisher = Schmidt Family Foundation website | accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAG"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/life-after-google-eric-schmidts-60-million-ocean-adventure-2011-2?op=1 |title = LIFE AFTER GOOGLE: Eric Schmidt's $60 Million Ocean Adventure, |author = TheoDP |date = 15 Feb 2011 |work = Businessinsider.com. |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute’s goal is to advance ocean exploration, discovery, and knowledge using technological advances, data-rich observation and analysis, and open sharing of information.

The Schmidt Ocean Institute, which was previously known as the Schmidt Research Vessel Institute, has been awarded grants from the [[Schmidt Family Foundation]] for the purpose of owning and operating scientific [[research vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Schmidt Family Foundation 2009 IRS Form 990-PF |url = http://theschmidt.org/site/grants/media/pdf/2009_TSF_Foundation_990_PF.pdf  |publisher = Schmidt Family Foundation website | accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research vessels==

The Schmidt Ocean Institute has operated two research vessels, RV ''Lone Ranger'' and RV ''Falkor''.

''Lone Ranger'', a 255-foot former ocean tug, was donated to the Institute by [[Peter B. Lewis]] in 2009 and was operated by the Institute in various Atlantic Ocean research cruises.&lt;ref name="LAG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute website |title = Sargasso Sea research expedition equipment |url = http://www.mbari.org/expeditions/Sargasso/equip.htm |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lone Ranger'' was decommissioned from the Schmidt Ocean Institute scientific fleet in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Previous Ship, Lone Ranger |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/65 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lone Ranger's'' successor is RV ''Falkor'', a 272-foot former German fisheries protection vessel purchased from the German government in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Field Trials 2012 |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/713 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009 and 2012, ''Falkor'' underwent an extensive refit at the Peters Schiffbau shipyard in Germany to convert it into a globally capable oceanographic research vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Specifications |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/47 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = R/V Falkor Refit |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/80 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Germany: Peters Schiffbau Shipyard Completes RV FALKOR's Refit Project |url = http://shipbuildingtribune.com/2012/04/23/germany-peters-schiffbau-shipyard-completes-rv-falkors-refit-project/ |date = 23 April 2012 |work = Shipbuildingtribune.com |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refit cost $60 million, and in addition to its own equipment, ''Falkor'' will at times also carry equipment from other oceanographic organizations, such as the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]’s [[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus underwater vehicle]], for exploring the [[Mariana Trench]].&lt;ref name="Witze"&gt;{{cite news |title = Private research ship makes waves |url=http://www.nature.com/news/private-research-ship-makes-waves-1.12680 |author = Alexandra Witze |date = 27 March 2013 |work = Nature |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research proposals for time aboard ''Falkor'' are peer reviewed by independent scientists. Program managers favor [[open data]] projects, but data sharing is not a requirement. If a project is accepted, the ship time is free to the researchers, but they must find additional funding for their salaries and post-cruise science.&lt;ref name="Witze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pushboat"&gt;{{cite news |title = Push the boat out |url=http://www.nature.com/news/push-the-boat-out-1.12669 |date = 27 March 2013 |work = Nature |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Falkor'' is intended to be a long-term global resource, integrating the latest technology into ocean exploration. Schmidt Ocean Institute program managers have encouraged scientists from around the world to apply for ship time; although the first cruises scheduled will be led by US and Canadian researchers, researchers from 23 countries applied in the most recent round of research proposals.&lt;ref name="Witze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pushboat" /&gt;

==Activities and expeditions==

The Schmidt Ocean Institute has undertaken multiple research projects in collaboration with organizations including the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]], the [[Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping|Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping Joint Hydrographic Center]], [[IFREMER]], the Center for Environmental Visualization, the Marine Science and Technology Foundation, and various universities and oceanographic research institutions.

Schmidt Ocean Institute researchers and research vessels have studied remote [[coral reef]] conditions at the [[Kiritimati|Kiritimati atoll]], [[deep-water coral]] habitats using [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]], Atlantic marine pollutants and [[biofuel]] candidates in the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] and [[Sargasso Sea]], and the long-term effects of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Projects |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/science |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Expeditions |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/expeditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a team aboard RV ''Falkor'' started conducting a multibeam mapping survey of the Campeche Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico, which may provide insight into geological records for the [[Chicxulub crater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = Schmidt Ocean Institute website |title = Imaging the K-T Boundary |url = http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/1453 |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During field trials in July 2012 of the multibeam [[echo sounding]] equipment on RV ''Falkor'', the team aboard discovered the wreck of lost polar expedition ship ''[[Terra Nova (ship)|Terra Nova]]'' off the southern coast of Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Scott's wrecked ship Terra Nova found off Greenland |url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19288188 |author = Paul Rincon |date = 16 August 2012 |work = BBC News. |accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">'''''Sheilaism''''' is a shorthand term for an individual's system of religious belief which co-opts strands of multiple religions chosen by the individual usually without much theological consideration. The term derives from a woman named Sheila Larson, who is quoted by [[Robert N. Bellah]] et al. in their book ''Habits of the Heart'' as following her own "little voice" in a faith she calls "Sheilaism".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}}

==History==
In chapter 9 of their 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'', [[Robert N. Bellah]], Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, [[Ann Swidler]], and Steven M. Tipton discuss how religion in America has moved from being highly public and unified, as it was in [[colonial New England]], to extremely private and diverse. To demonstrate the shift, they quote a young nurse, to whom they gave the name Sheila Larson:
{{quote|I believe in God. I'm not a religious fanatic. I can't remember the last time I went to church. My faith has carried me a long way. It's Sheilaism. Just my own little voice&amp;nbsp;... It's just try to love yourself and be gentle with yourself. You know, I guess, take care of each other. I think He would want us to take care of each other.}}

Bellah et al. suggest that Sheilaism creates the logical possibility "of over 220 million American religions, one for each of us," and they see Sheilaism as "a perfectly natural expression of current American religious life".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}} Oddrun M.&amp;nbsp;H. Bråten wrote:
{{quote|Radically individualistic religion like "Sheilaism" may seem very different from, for example, fundamentalist religion, which is also characteristic of our time, but they both emphasise personal religious experience (spirituality). "Sheilaism" is rooted in an attempt to transform external authority to internal meaning. Some may prefer to choose a religion of external authority (Bellah 1985: 235) for this purpose. That religion in principle is a choice, is a result of the religious freedom gained in the western world through [[secularization]]: a central trait of western modernity ([[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor]] 2004: 185, Taylor 2007, see also chapter 2).{{sfn|Bråten|2013|p=171}}}}

The coinage quickly became a touchstone for [[sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]] who repeatedly reference it.{{sfn|Wood|2009|p=241}} One sociologist summed it up as "spiritual [[bricolage]]".{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} Sheilaism even has worked its way into more mainstream culture.

The columnist Don Kahle concluded that Sheila "has a code of ethics, but it's no longer connected to a sacred text or an observing deity. It's personal&amp;nbsp;– and unpublished. Sheila abides by Sheilaism. Sheilaism is good for Sheila, but it doesn't build community. Nobody but Sheila knows what are the codes of Sheilaism. Often Sheila doesn't know herself until something 'doesn't feel right'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahle |first=Don |date=26 October 2007 |title=Will Downtown Progress Be Thwarted? Blame Sheila |url=http://www.dksez.com/if-downtown-plan-gets-thwarted-blame-sheila/ |newspaper=The Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |page=A13 |issn=0739-8557 |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Bellah et al. saw Sheilaism as a form of self-absorption that caused a disaffiliation with communities. Their perspective was very much in line with the prevailing view of sociologists since the 1960s who saw such highly individualized religious experience as proof of a larger decline in the importance of religion in the United States as a whole.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} In later comments, Bellah summed up the problem with Sheilaism: "she has made the inner trip and hasn't come back out again, so to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bellah |first=Robert |year=1986 |title=Habits of the Heart: Implications for Religion |url=http://www.robertbellah.com/lectures_5.htm |type=lecture |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural critic [[Hal Niedzviecki]] juxtaposes Sheilaism with Judyism, the joke religion created by comedian [[Judy Tenuta]]. Whereas Tenuta is poking fun at the idea of an individualist religion, even titling a book ''The Power of Judyism'', Niedzviecki laments the fact that Sheilaists take the idea seriously. "Sheilaism permeates our individualistic conformity and continues to demand that our institutions dramatically change to accept us as we want to be."{{sfn|Niedzviecki|2006|p=49}}

Recent scholarship has re-evaluated Sheilaism, noting that even those who claim a particular organized denomination and regularly attend church often have highly individualized perceptions of their faith.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=500}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3895">'''Ship launching airbags''' are specialized air bags that are used for [[Ceremonial ship launching|launching]] marine vessels. This method of launching ships is called [[Airbag launching|airbag launching]]. These air bags are made of synthetic-tire-cord reinforcement layers and rubber layers,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ISO14409-Ships and marine technology of Ship launching air bags&lt;/ref&gt; and are also known as marine airbags. They were invented in 1980.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The first known use of marine airbags occurred on January 20, 1981 with the launch of a [[tank barge]] from the [[Xiao Qinghe]] [[shipyard]]. From then on, more and more shipyards, especially in [[China]] and [[Southeast Asia]], began to use air bags to launch small and medium-sized vessels.

In recent years, higher strength materials have been used in air bag production, allowing them to have much more bearing capacity. Hence, they have begun to be used at the launchings of larger vessels. In October 2011, the successful launch of one vessel with a [[deadweight tonnage]] (DWT) of 75000 tonnes set a world record for ship launches utilizing air bags.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The following year, on June 6, 2012, the ship "He Ming" ([[IMO number]] 9657105), with a DWT of 73541 tonnes, total length of 224.8m, breadth of 34m, and depth of 18.5m, also launched successfully using air bags&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He Ming |url=https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:649866/mmsi:414124000/imo:9657105/vessel:HE_MING |website=MarineTraffic |accessdate=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Air bag structure ==

[[File:Airbag structure.pdf|centre|frameless|606x606px]]

Marine air bags consist of three parts:
# '''Air bag body''': the main, cylindrical part of the air bag after being fully inflated with compressed air,
# '''Air bag heads''': conical parts connecting the body and the mouths of the air bag, and
# '''Air bag mouths''': either metal valves mounted on both ends of the air bag for inflating with air or a valve on one end and a metal lug on the other end used to haul the air bag.

== Air bag size and model ==

=== Size ===
The diameter of an air bag varies; sizes include 0.8 m, 1.0 m, 1.2 m, 1.5 m, 1.8 m, etc.

The length of an air bag is specified by the customer when it is manufactured.

=== Model ===
Air bags are commonly divided into three to six tire-cord reinforcement layers. There can be more layers, though there are normally less than ten.

=== Air bag bearing capacity ===
The '''maximum load carrying capacity''' of an air bag, which is the maximum load under which it will suffer no permanent deformation or damage, can be found as follows:
[[File:An air bag being compressed.jpg|border|left]]

'''Let:'''

&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be the original diameter of the air bag

&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the height of the compressed air bag

&lt;math&gt;W_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be the width of the air bag contacting the ship bottom

&lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; be the internal pressure of the air bag

&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be the effective length of the air bag

Given these variables,
&lt;math&gt;\text{bearing capacity} = P_{1} \times W_{1} \times L&lt;/math&gt;

=== Air bag materials ===
Ship launching air bags are constructed of synthetic-tire-cord layers; inner and outer rubber layers are sometimes added. All materials used are [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]].

Air tightness test: Without carrying any load, fill the air bag till the internal pressure of the air bag reaches rated working pressure. After 1 hour. The pressure loss should be less than 5 % of initial pressure.

Bursting test： Fill the air bag with water until the air bag bursts. The water pressure at the time of bursting shall be no less than three times of rated working pressure&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==Types of stellar collisions and mergers==

===Type Ia supernova===
White dwarfs are the remnants of low-mass stars and, if they form a binary system with another star, they can cause large stellar explosions known as [[type Ia supernova]]. The normal route by which this happens involves a white dwarf drawing material off a [[main sequence]] or [[red giant]] star to form an [[accretion disc]]. However, a much rarer brand of type Ia supernova occurs when two white dwarfs orbit each other closely.&lt;ref name = "González Hernández"&gt;{{cite journal | last = González Hernández | first = J. I. |author2=Ruiz-Lapuente, P. |author3=Tabernero, H. M. |author4=Montes, D. |author5=Canal, R. |author6=Méndez, J. |author7= Bedin, L.

When they finally merge, if their combined mass approaches or exceeds the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], [[carbon-burning process|carbon fusion]] is ignited, raising the temperature. Since a white dwarf consists of [[degenerate matter]], there is no safe equilibrium between [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal pressure]] and the weight of overlying layers of the star. Because of this, [[thermal runaway|runaway fusion reactions]] rapidly heat up the interior of the combined star and spread, causing a [[supernova explosion]].&lt;ref name = "González Hernández"/&gt; In a matter of seconds, all of the white dwarf's mass is thrown into space.&lt;ref name=TXT&gt;Freedman, Roger A., Robert M. Geller, William J. Kaufmann III(2009). ''The Universe 9th Edition'',p.543-545. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York. {{ISBN|1-4292-3153-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutron star mergers===
{{Main|Neutron star merger}}
Neutron star mergers occur in a fashion similar to the rare brand of [[type Ia supernova]]e resulting from merging white dwarfs. When two [[neutron star]]s orbit each other closely, they spiral inward as time passes due to gravitational radiation. When they meet, their merger leads to the formation of either a heavier neutron star or a black hole, depending on whether the mass of the remnant exceeds the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]]. This creates a magnetic field that is trillions of times stronger than that of Earth, in a matter of one or two milliseconds. Astronomers believe that this type of event is what creates [[Gamma-ray burst#Short gamma-ray bursts|short gamma-ray bursts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/500535a|pmid=23985867|title=Astrophysics: Radioactive glow as a smoking gun|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7464|pages=535–6|year=2013|last1=Rosswog|first1=Stephan|bibcode=2013Natur.500..535R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kilonova|kilonovae]].&lt;ref name=Metzger2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzger, B.

===Thorne–Żytkow objects===
{{main article|Thorne–Żytkow object}}
If a neutron star collides with [[red giant]] of sufficiently low mass and density, both can survive in the form of a peculiar hybrid known as Thorne–Żytkow object, with a neutron star surrounded by a red giant.

=== Binary star mergers ===
{{Main|KIC 9832227}}
About half of all the stars in the sky are part of binary systems, with two stars orbiting each other.  Some binary stars orbit each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere, giving the system a peanut shape.  While most contact binary stars are stable, a few have become unstable and have merged in the past for reasons not well understood (see relevant section below).

==Formation of planets==
When two low-mass stars in a binary system merge this creates an &lt;!-- EXCRETION DISK IS NOT A TYPO PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE--&gt;[[excretion disk]]&lt;!-- EXCRETION DISK IS NOT A TYPO--&gt; from which new planets can form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1102.3336|last1= Martin|first1= E.

==Discovery==
While the concept of stellar collision has been around for several generations of astronomers, only the development of new technology has made it possible for it to be more objectively studied. For example, in 1764, a cluster of stars known as [[Messier 30]] was discovered by astronomer [[Charles Messier]]. In the twentieth century, astronomers concluded that the cluster was approximately 13 billion years old.&lt;ref name= VAMP&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Stellar+collisions+and+vampirism+give+blue+straggler+stars+a+%22cosmic...-a0215188997 "Stellar Collisions and vampirism give blue stragglers stars a 'cosmic facelift'"], [[Asian News International]], 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] resolved the individual stars of Messier 30. With this new technology, astronomers discovered that some stars, known as “[[blue straggler]]s”, appeared younger than other stars in the cluster.&lt;ref name=VAMP/&gt; Astronomers then hypothesized that stars may have “collided”, or “merged”, giving them more fuel so they continued fusion while fellow stars around them started going out.&lt;ref name=VAMP/&gt;

==Stellar collisions and the Solar System==
While stellar collisions may occur very frequently in certain parts of the galaxy, the likelihood of a collision involving the [[Sun]] is very small. A probability calculation predicts the rate of stellar collisions involving the Sun is 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; years.&lt;ref name='DAB'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/stellar_collisions_000601.html | title = Researchers Claim First Proof That Stars Collide | accessdate = 15 January 2014 | last = Lucentini | first = Jack | date = 1 June 2000 | website = [[Space.com]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040419035725/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/stellar_collisions_000601.html | archivedate = 19 April 2004|quote="By one calculation, the sun is likely to have one crash per 10,000 trillion, trillion years (that’s 28 zeros), and it will burn out on its own accord much sooner than that."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For comparison, the age of the universe is of the order 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years. The likelihood of close encounters with the Sun is also small. The rate is estimated by the formula:
:''N'' ~ 4.2 · ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Myr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
where ''N'' is the number of encounters per million years that come within a radius ''D'' of the Sun in [[parsec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Perturbation of the Oort Cloud by Close Stellar Approaches | display-authors=1 | date=24 August 1998 | last1=Garcia-Sanchez | first1=J. | last2=Weissman | first2=P.

P. | title=Asteroid and Comet Dynamics | location=Tatrauska Lomnica, Slovak Republic | hdl=2014/19368}}&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, the mean radius of the Earth's orbit, 1 [[astronomical unit|AU]], is {{nowrap|4.82 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; parsecs}}.

Our star will likely not be directly affected by such an event, but the Earth may be easily affected by a nearby collision. Astronomers say that if a stellar collision happens within 100 light years of the Earth, the resulting gamma-ray burst could possibly destroy all life on Earth.&lt;ref name=DAB/&gt; This is still very unlikely though because there are no stellar clusters this close to the Solar System.

==KIC 9832227 and binary star mergers==
[[KIC 9832227]] is an example of an eclipsing [[contact binary]] star system.  It is mainly composed of two stars orbiting each other so closely that they share the same atmosphere, giving the system a peanut shape.  While astronomers have found hundreds of such contact binaries, KIC 9832227 is unusual in that it is unstable.  The merger of the cores of the two stars is predicted to be observed in 2022, exploding in the form of a [[luminous red nova]] in [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last=Kinemuchi |first=Karen |date=1 October 2013 |title=To Pulsate or to Eclipse?

In [[astronomy]], '''stellar kinematics''' is the [[Observational astronomy|observational]] study or measurement of the [[kinematics]] or motions of [[star]]s through space. The subject of stellar kinematics encompasses the measurement of stellar [[Velocity|velocities]] in the [[Milky Way]] and its [[Satellite galaxies of the Milky Way|satellites]] as well as the measurement of the internal kinematics of more distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. Measurement of the kinematics of stars in different subcomponents of the Milky Way including the [[thin disk]], the [[thick disk]], the [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], and the [[stellar halo]] provides important information about the formation and evolutionary history of our Galaxy. Kinematic measurements can also identify exotic phenomena such as hypervelocity stars escaping from the Milky Way, which are interpreted as the result of gravitational encounters of [[binary star]]s with the [[Sagittarius A*|supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center]].

Stellar kinematics is related to but distinct from the subject of [[stellar dynamics]], which involves the theoretical study or modeling of the motions of stars under the influence of [[gravity]]. Stellar-dynamical models of systems such as galaxies or star clusters are often compared with or tested against stellar-kinematic data to study their evolutionary history and mass distributions, and to detect the presence of [[dark matter]] or [[supermassive black hole]]s through their gravitational influence on stellar orbits.

==Space velocity==
[[File:Proper motion.JPG|thumb|250px|Relation between proper motion and velocity components of an object. At emission, the object was at distance ''d'' from the Sun, and moved at angular rate ''μ'' radian/s, that is, ''μ = v&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; / d'' with ''v&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' = the component of velocity transverse to line of sight from the Sun. (The diagram illustrates an angle ''μ'' swept out in unit time at tangential velocity ''v&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''.)]]
The component of stellar motion toward or away from the Sun, known as [[radial velocity]], can be measured from the spectrum shift caused by the [[Doppler effect]]. The transverse, or [[proper motion]] must be found by taking a series of positional determinations against more distant objects. Once the distance to a star is determined through [[astrometric]] means such as [[parallax]], the space velocity can be computed.&lt;ref name=atoe05&gt;{{cite web

The latter is typically taken as a position at the Sun's present location that is following a circular orbit around the [[Galactic Center]] at the mean velocity of those nearby stars with low velocity dispersion.&lt;ref name=araa29&gt;{{cite journal

== Information Obtained from Stellar Kinematic Measurements ==
Stellar kinematics yields important [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] information about stars, and the galaxies in which they reside. Stellar kinematics data combined with astrophysical modeling produces important information about the galactic system as a whole. Measured stellar velocities in the innermost regions of galaxies including the Milky Way have provided evidence that many galaxies host [[supermassive black hole]]s at their center. In farther out regions of galaxies such as within the galactic halo, velocity measurements of [[Globular cluster|globular]] clusters orbiting in these halo regions of galaxies provides evidence for [[dark matter]]. Both of these cases derive from the key fact that stellar kinematics can be related to the overall [[Gravitational potential|potential]] in which the stars are bound. This means that if accurate stellar kinematics measurements are made for a star or group of stars orbiting in a certain region of a galaxy, the gravitational potential and mass distribution can be inferred given that the gravitational potential in which the star is bound produces its orbit and serves as the impetus for its stellar motion. Examples of using stellar kinematics measurements combined with modeling to construct an astrophysical system are:

* '''Rotation of the Milky Way's Disc''' From the [[proper motion]]s and [[radial velocities]] of stars within the Milky way disc one can show that there is differential rotation. When combining these measurements of stars' proper motions and their radial velocities, along with careful modeling, it is possible to obtain a picture of the rotation of the Milky Way [[Disc galaxy|disc]]. The local character of galactic rotation in the solar neighborhood is encapsulated in the [[Oort constants]].
* '''Structural Components of The Milky Way''' Using stellar kinematics, astronomers construct models which seek to explain the overall galactic structure in terms of distinct kinematic populations of stars. This is possible because these distinct populations are often located in specific regions of galaxies. For example, within the [[Milky Way]], there are three primary components, each with its own distinct stellar kinematics: the [[Galactic Disc|disc]], [[Milky Way halo|halo]] and [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge or bar]]. These kinematic groups are closely related to the stellar populations in the Milky Way, forming a strong correlation between the motion and chemical composition, thus indicating different formation mechanisms. For the Milky Way, the speed of disk stars is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V} = 220 ~ \mathrm{km} ~ \mathrm{ s} ^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and an RMS velocity relative to this speed of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V_{RMS}} = 50 ~ \mathrm{km} ~ \mathrm{ s} ^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. For bulge population stars, the velocities are randomly oriented with a larger relative RMS velocity of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V_{RMS}} = 150 ~ \mathrm{km} ~ \mathrm{s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and no net circular velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Galactic Dynamics |last=Binney |last2=Tremaine |first=James |first2=Scott |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=9780691130279 |pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galactic stellar halo consists of stars with orbits that extend to the outer regions of the galaxy. Some of these stars will continually orbit far from the galactic center, while others are on trajectories which bring them to various distances from the galactic center. These stars have little to no average rotation. Many stars in this group belong to globular clusters which formed long ago and thus have a distinct formation history, which can be inferred from their kinematics and poor metallicities. The halo may be further subdivided into an inner and outer halo, with the inner halo having a net prograde motion with respect to the Milky Way and the outer a net [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Carollo |first=Daniela |display-authors=etal |date=2007 |title=Two Stellar Components in the Halo of the Milky Way |journal=Nature |volume=450 |issue=7172 |pages=1020–1025 |arxiv=0706.3005|bibcode=2007Natur.450.1020C |doi=10.1038/nature06460 |pmid=18075581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''External Galaxies''' Spectroscopic observations of external galaxies make it possible to characterize the bulk motions of the stars they contain. While these stellar populations in external galaxies are generally not resolved to the level where one can track the motion of individual stars (except for the very nearest galaxies) measurements of the kinematics of the integrated stellar population along the line of sight provides information including the mean velocity and the [[velocity dispersion]] which can then be used to infer the distribution of mass within the galaxy. Measurement of the mean velocity as a function of position gives information on the galaxy's rotation, with distinct regions of the galaxy that are [[redshift]]ed / [[blueshift]]ed in relation to the galaxy's [[Recessional velocity|systemic velocity]].
* '''Mass distributions''' Through measurement of the kinematics of tracer objects such as globular clusters and the orbits of nearby [[Satellite galaxy|satellite dwarf galaxies]], we can determine the mass distribution of the Milky Way or other galaxies. This is accomplished by combining kinematic measurements with dynamical modeling.

== Recent advancements due to ''Gaia''==
In 2018 the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|''Gaia'']] data release 2 has yielded an unprecedented number of high quality stellar kinematic measurements as well as [[stellar parallax]] measurements which will greatly increase our understanding of the structure of the Milky Way. The Gaia data has also made it possible to determine the proper motions of many objects whose proper motions were previously unknown, including the absolute proper motions of 75 [[globular cluster]]s orbiting at distances as far as 21 [[Parsec|kpc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=1609.04172|last1=Schoenrich|first1=R.|title=Gaia Data Release 1.

== Stellar kinematic types ==
Stars within galaxies may be classified based on their kinematics. For example, the stars in the Milky Way can be subdivided into two general populations, based on their [[metallicity]], or proportion of elements with atomic numbers higher than helium. Among nearby stars, it has been found that population I stars with higher metallicity are generally located in the stellar disk while older population II stars are in random orbits with little net rotation.&lt;ref name="pasp69_406"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Hugh M. |date=1957 |title=The Kinematics and Evolution of Population I Stars |bibcode=1957PASP...69...54J |doi=10.1086/127012 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=69 |issue=406 |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="pasp69_406"/&gt; Comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has also led to the identification of [[stellar association]]s. These are most likely groups of stars that share a common point of origin in giant molecular clouds.&lt;ref name=AS1998/&gt;

There are many additional ways to classify stars based on their measured velocity components, and this provides detailed information about the nature of the star's formation time, its present location, and the general structure of the galaxy. As a star moves in a galaxy, the smoothed out gravitational potential of all the other stars and other mass within the galaxy plays a dominant role in determining the stellar motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Galaxies in the Universe|last=Sparke |last2=Gallagher |first=L.S. |first2=J.S. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0521671866 |location=United States |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stellar kinematics can provide insights into the location of where the star formed within the galaxy. Measurements of an individual star's kinematics can identify stars that are peculiar outliers such as a high-velocity star moving much faster than its nearby neighbors.

=== High-velocity stars ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[High-velocity star]]" --&gt;

Depending on the definition, a high-[[velocity]] star is a star moving faster than 65&amp;nbsp;km/s to 100&amp;nbsp;km/s relative to the average motion of the stars in the Sun's neighborhood. The velocity is also sometimes defined as [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] relative to the surrounding interstellar medium. The three types of high-velocity stars are: runaway stars, halo stars and hypervelocity stars. High-velocity stars were studied by Jan Oort, who used their kinematic data to predict that high-velocity stars have very little tangential velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Galactic Astronomy |last=Binney |last2=Merrifield |first=James |first2=Michael |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0691004020 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Runaway stars===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Runaway star]]" --&gt;
[[File:Hs-2009-03-a-web print.jpg|thumb|Four runaway stars plowing through regions of dense interstellar gas and creating bright bow waves and trailing tails of glowing gas. The stars in these NASA Hubble Space Telescope images are among 14 young runaway stars spotted by the Advanced Camera for Surveys between October 2005 and July 2006]]
A runaway star is one that is moving through space with an abnormally high [[velocity]] relative to the surrounding [[interstellar medium]]. The [[proper motion]] of a runaway star often points exactly away from a [[stellar association]], of which the star was formerly a member, before it was hurled out.

Mechanisms that may give rise to a runaway star include:

* Gravitational interactions between stars in a [[stellar system]] can result in large accelerations of one or more of the involved stars. In some cases, stars may even be ejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oh|first=Seungkyung|last2=Kroupa|first2=Pavel|last3=Pflamm-Altenburg|first3=Jan|date=2015|title=Dependency of Dynamical Ejections of O Stars on the Masses of Very Young Star Clusters|url=http://stacks.iop.org/0004-637X/805/i=2/a=92|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=805|issue=2|page=92|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/805/2/92|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1503.08827|bibcode=2015ApJ...805...92O}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in seemingly stable star systems of only three stars, as described in studies of the [[three-body problem]] in gravitational theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gvaramadze|first=Vasilii V.|last2=Gualandris|first2=Alessia|date=2010-09-30|title=Very massive runaway stars from three-body encounters|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/410/1/304/1033482|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=410|issue=1|pages=304–312|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.17446.x|issn=0035-8711|arxiv=1007.5057|bibcode=2011MNRAS.410..304G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A collision or close encounter between [[stellar system]]s, including galaxies, may result in the disruption of both systems, with some of the stars being accelerated to high velocities, or even ejected. A large-scale example is the gravitational interaction between the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy and the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boubert|first=D.|last2=Erkal|first2=D.|last3=Evans|first3=N.

* A [[supernova]] explosion in a [[multiple star]] system can accelerate both the supernova remnant and/or remaining stars to high velocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blaauw |first=A. |year=1961 |title=On the origin of the O- and B-type stars with high velocities (the run-away stars), and some related problems |journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands |volume=15 |page=265 |bibcode=1961BAN....15..265B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tauris |first=T.M. |last2=Takens |first2=R.J. |year=1998 |title=Runaway velocities of stellar components originating from disrupted binaries via asymmetric supernova explosions |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=330 |pages=1047–1059 |bibcode=1998A&amp;A...330.1047T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple mechanisms may accelerate the same runaway star. For example, a massive star that was originally ejected due to gravitational interactions with its stellar neighbors may itself go [[supernova]], producing a remnant with a velocity modulated by the supernova kick. If this supernova occurs in the very nearby vicinity of other stars, it is possible that it may produce more runaways in the process.

An example of a related set of runaway stars is the case of [[AE Aurigae]], [[53 Arietis]] and [[Mu Columbae]], all of which are moving away from each other at velocities of over 100&amp;nbsp;km/s (for comparison, the [[Sun]] moves through the Milky Way at about 20&amp;nbsp;km/s faster than the local average). Tracing their motions back, their paths intersect near to the [[Orion Nebula]] about 2 million years ago. [[Barnard's Loop]] is believed to be the remnant of the supernova that launched the other stars.

Another example is the X-ray object [[Vela X-1]], where photodigital techniques reveal the presence of a typical supersonic [[Bow shocks in astrophysics|bow shock hyperbola]].

===Halo stars===
{{See also|Galactic halo}}
Halo stars are very old stars that do not share the motion of the Sun or most other stars in the solar neighbourhood which are in similar circular orbits around the center of the Milky Way. Rather, they travel in elliptical orbits, which often take them well outside the plane of the Milky Way. Although their orbital velocities in the Milky Way may be no faster than the Sun's, their different paths result in the high relative velocities.

Typical examples are the halo stars passing through the disk of the Milky Way at steep angles. One of the nearest 45 stars, called [[Kapteyn's Star]], is an example of the high-velocity stars that lie near the Sun. Its observed radial velocity is -245&amp;nbsp;km/s, and the components of its space velocity are ''U''&amp;nbsp;= 19&amp;nbsp;km/s, ''V''&amp;nbsp;= -288&amp;nbsp;km/s, and ''W''&amp;nbsp;= -52&amp;nbsp;km/s.

===Hypervelocity stars===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Hypervelocity star]]" --&gt;

Hypervelocity stars (designated as '''HVS''' or '''HV''' in stellar catalogues) are stars with velocities that deviate substantially from the normal velocity of stars in a galaxy. Such stars may have velocities so great that they exceed the [[escape velocity]] of the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work= Space Daily
 |url= http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Two_Exiled_Stars_Are_Leaving_Our_Galaxy_Forever.html
 |title= Two Exiled Stars Are Leaving Our Galaxy Forever
 |date= Jan 27, 2006 |accessdate= 2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Milky Way, stars usually have velocities on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;km/s, whereas hypervelocity stars, have velocities on the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;km/s. These fast moving stars are more numerous near the center of the Milky Way, which is also where most are thought to be produced. One of the fastest known stars in our Galaxy is the O-class sub-dwarf [[US 708]], moving away from the Milky Way with a total velocity of around 1200 km/s.

The existence of HVSs was first predicted by [[Jack G. Hills]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of 1 September 2017, there have been roughly 20 observed hypervelocity stars.

====Origin of hypervelocity stars====
HVSs are believed to predominately originate by close encounters of [[binary star]]s with the [[supermassive black hole]] in the center of the [[Milky Way]]. One of the two partners is gravitationally captured by the [[black hole]] (in the sense of entering orbit around it), while the other escapes with high velocity, becoming an HVS.  Such maneuvers are analogous to the capture and ejection of [[interstellar object]]s by a star.

Supernova-induced HVSs may also be possible, although they are presumably rare. In this scenario, a HVS is ejected from a close binary system as a result of the companion star undergoing a supernova explosion. Ejection velocities up to 770&amp;nbsp;km/s, as measured from the galactic rest frame, are possible for late-type B-stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tauris |first=Thomas M. |year=2015 |title=Maximum speed of hypervelocity stars ejected from binaries |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |department=Letters |volume=448 |issue=1 |pages=L6–L10 |doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slu189 |bibcode=2015MNRAS.448L...6T|arxiv=1412.0657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism can explain the origin of HVSs which are ejected from the galactic disk.

Known HVSs are [[Main sequence|main-sequence]] stars with masses a few times that of the Sun. HVSs with smaller masses are also expected and G/K-dwarf HVS candidates have been found.

HVSs that have come into the Milky Way came from the dwarf galaxy Large Magellanic Cloud. When the dwarf galaxy made its closest approach to the center of the Milky Way, it underwent intense gravitational tugs. These tugs boosted the energy of some of its stars so much that they broke free of the dwarf galaxy entirely and were thrown into space, due to the [[slingshot]]-like effect of the boost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14934-milky-ways-fastest-stars-may-be-immigrants.html

Some [[neutron star]]s are inferred to be traveling with similar speeds. This could be related to HVSs and the HVS ejection mechanism. Neutron stars are the remnants of [[supernova]] explosions, and their extreme speeds are very likely the result of an asymmetric supernova explosion or the loss of their near partner during the supernova explosions that forms them. The neutron star [[RX J0822-4300]], which was measured to move at a record speed of over 1,500&amp;nbsp;km/s (0.5% of the [[speed of light]]) in 2007 by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], is thought to have been produced the first way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Some kind of supernovas are expected to happen if a white dwarf collides with its nearby partner and consumes the outer matter of this partner. The white dwarf and its nearby partner have very high orbital velocities at this time. The huge mass lost of the white dwarf during the supernova causes the nearby partner to leave at its previous huge orbital speed of several hundred kilometers per second as a hypervelocity star. The supernova remnant of the exploding white dwarf leaves because of its own high orbital speed as a new fast-traveling neutron star. This seems to be the most likely origin of most HVSs and fast-traveling neutron stars.

Groups of young stars that escape a cluster, or are no longer bound to each other, form stellar associations. As these stars age and disperse, their association is no longer readily apparent and they become moving groups of stars.

Astronomers are able to determine if stars are members of a kinematic group because they share the same age, [[metallicity]], and kinematics ([[radial velocity]] and [[proper motion]]). As the stars in a moving group formed in proximity and at nearly the same time from the same gas cloud, although later disrupted by tidal forces, they share similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Stellar associations===
{{merge from|Stellar association|date=November 2017|section=true|discuss=Talk:Stellar association#Merged}}
A stellar association is a very loose [[star cluster]], whose stars share a common origin, but have become gravitationally unbound and are still moving together through space. Associations are primarily identified by their common movement vectors and ages. Identification by chemical composition is also used to factor in association memberships.

Stellar associations were first discovered by the [[Armenia]]n astronomer [[Viktor Ambartsumian]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=baas29 /&gt; The conventional name for an association uses the names or abbreviations of the [[constellation]] (or constellations) in which they are located; the association type, and, sometimes, a numerical identifier.

====Types====
[[File:Infrared VISTA view of a nearby star formation in Monoceros.jpg|thumb|Infrared [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]] view of a stellar nursery in [[Monoceros]].]]

Viktor Ambartsumian first categorized stellar associations into two groups, OB and T, based on the properties of their stars.&lt;ref name=baas29&gt;{{cite journal

 | bibcode=1997BAAS...29.1466I }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third category, R, was later suggested by [[Sidney van den Bergh]] for associations that illuminate [[reflection nebula]]e.&lt;ref name="ra1"&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi=10.1086/111734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OB, T, and R associations form a continuum of young stellar groupings. But it is currently uncertain whether they are an evolutionary sequence, or represent some other factor at work.&lt;ref name="Mon R2" /&gt; Some groups also display properties of both OB and T associations, so the categorization is not always clear-cut.

==== OB associations ====

[[Image:Carina Nebula.jpg|thumb|[[Carina OB1]], a large OB association.]]

Young associations will contain 10 to 100 massive stars of [[Stellar classification|spectral class]] [[O-type star|O]] and [[Stellar classification|B]], and are known as ''OB associations''. In addition, these associations also contain hundreds or thousands of low- and intermediate-mass stars. Association members are believed to form within the same small volume inside a giant [[molecular cloud]]. Once the surrounding dust and gas is blown away, the remaining stars become unbound and begin to drift apart.&lt;ref name="GAIA"&gt;{{cite web
 | date =2000-04-06

 | accessdate = 2013-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the majority of all stars in the Milky Way were formed in OB associations.&lt;ref name="GAIA" /&gt; [[O-type star|O-class stars]] are short-lived, and will expire as [[supernova]]e after roughly one million years. As a result, OB associations are generally only a few million years in age or less. The O-B stars in the association will have burned all their fuel within ten million years. (Compare this to the current age of the [[Sun]] at about five billion years.)

The [[Hipparcos]] satellite provided measurements that located a dozen OB associations within 650 [[parsec]]s of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

OB associations have also been found in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] and the [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. These associations can be quite sparse, spanning 1,500 light-years in diameter.&lt;ref name=AS1998&gt;{{cite journal

==== T associations ====
Young stellar groups can contain a number of infant [[T Tauri star]]s that are still in the process of entering the [[main sequence]]. These sparse populations of up to a thousand T Tauri stars are known as ''T associations''. The nearest example is the [[Taurus-Auriga T association]] (Tau-Aur T association), located at a distance of 140 [[parsec]]s from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | url=http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/publikationen/pap1997/1997021/1997021.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of T associations include the [[R Corona Australis T association]], the [[Lupus T association]], the [[Chamaeleon T association]] and the [[Velorum T association]]. T associations are often found in the vicinity of the molecular cloud from which they formed. Some, but not all, include O-B class stars. Group members have the same age and origin, the same chemical composition, and the same amplitude and direction in their vector of velocity.

==== R associations ====
Associations of stars that illuminate reflection [[nebula]]e are called ''R associations'', a name suggested by Sidney van den Bergh after he discovered that the stars in these nebulae had a non-uniform distribution.&lt;ref name="ra1" /&gt; These young stellar groupings contain main sequence stars that are not sufficiently massive to disperse the interstellar clouds in which they formed.&lt;ref name="Mon R2"&gt;{{cite journal

 | doi=10.1086/111771 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an R association is [[Monoceros R2]], located 830 ± 50 [[parsec]]s from the Sun.&lt;ref name="Mon R2" /&gt;

===Moving groups===
If the remnants of a stellar association drift through the Milky Way as a somewhat coherent assemblage, then they are termed a '''moving group''' or '''kinematic group'''. Moving groups can be old, such as the [[HR 1614]] moving group at two billion years, or young, such as the [[AB Doradus moving group#Age|AB Dor Moving Group]] at only 120 million years.

Moving groups were studied intensely by [[Olin Eggen]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eggen |first=O.J. |chapter=Moving Groups of Stars |title=Observational aspects of galactic structure: lecture notes reported by participants |editor1=Adriaan Blaauw |last-author-amp=yes |editor2=Maarten Schmidt |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |page=111 |year=1965 |bibcode=1965gast.book..111E}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of the nearest young moving groups has been compiled by López-Santiago ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Santiago/&gt; The closest is the [[Ursa Major Moving Group]] which includes all of the stars in the [[Big Dipper|Plough/Big Dipper]] [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] except for [[Alpha Ursae Majoris|α Ursae Majoris]] and [[Eta Ursae Majoris|η Ursae Majoris]]. This is sufficiently close that the [[Sun]] lies in its outer fringes, without being part of the group. Hence, although members are concentrated at [[declination]]s near 60° N, some outliers are as far away across the sky as [[Triangulum Australe]] at 70° S.

===Stellar streams===
{{See also|List of stellar streams}}
A '''stellar stream''' is an association of [[star]]s orbiting a [[galaxy]] that was once a [[globular cluster]] or [[dwarf galaxy]] that has now been torn apart and stretched out along its orbit by tidal forces.

[[File:-BLMcareers (21678771368) crop.jpg|thumb|alt= A woman holding a notebook crouches next to a theodolite on a tripod. The instrument is set up on a bank in a forest.|A surveyor using a [[total station]]]]
'''Surveying''' or '''land surveying''' is the technique, profession, and science of determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles between them. A land surveying professional is called a '''land surveyor'''. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for [[ownership]], locations, such as building corners or the surface location of subsurface features, or other purposes required by government or civil law, such as property sales.

Surveyors work with elements of [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[regression analysis]], [[physics]], engineering, [[metrology]], [[programming language]]s, and the law. They use equipment, such as [[total station]]s, robotic total stations, [[theodolites]], GPS receivers, [[retroreflector]]s, [[3D scanner]]s, radios, handheld tablets, digital levels, subsurface locators, drones, [[Geographic information system|GIS]], and surveying software.

Surveying has been an element in the development of the human environment since the beginning of recorded history. The planning and execution of most forms of construction require it. It is also used in transport, communications, mapping, and the definition of legal boundaries for land ownership. It is an important tool for research in many other scientific disciplines.

==Definition==
The [[International Federation of Surveyors]] defines the function of surveying as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Definition |url=http://www.fig.net/about/general/definition/index.asp |website=''fig.net'' |access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A surveyor is a professional person with the academic qualifications and technical expertise to conduct one, or more, of the following activities;
* to determine, measure and represent land, three-dimensional objects, point-fields and trajectories;
* to assemble and interpret land and geographically related information,
* to use that information for the planning and efficient administration of the land, the sea and any structures thereon; and,
* to conduct research into the above practices and to develop them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Ancient surveying===
[[File:Cc&amp;j-fig23--plumb rule.png|upright=0.4|thumb|alt=refer to caption |A plumb rule from the book Cassells' Carpentry and Joinery]]
Surveying has occurred since humans built the first large structures. In [[ancient Egypt]], a [[rope stretcher]] would use simple geometry to re-establish boundaries after the annual floods of the [[Nile River]]. The almost perfect squareness and north-south orientation of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], built c. 2700 BC, affirm the Egyptians' command of surveying. The ''[[Groma surveying|Groma]]'' instrument originated in [[Mesopotamia]] (early 1st millennium BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=International Symposium on History of Machines and Mechanisms: Proceedings of HMM 2008|author=Hong-Sen Yan &amp; Marco Ceccarelli|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2009|isbn=1-4020-9484-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prehistoric monument at [[Stonehenge]] (c. 2500 BC) was set out by prehistoric surveyors using peg and rope geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008) {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician [[Liu Hui]] described ways of measuring distant objects in his work ''[[Haidao Suanjing]]'' or ''The Sea Island Mathematical Manual'', published in 263 AD.

The Romans recognized land surveying as a profession. They established the basic measurements under which the Roman Empire was divided, such as a tax register of conquered lands (300 AD).&lt;ref name="Lewis2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=M. J. T.|title=Surveying Instruments of Greece and Rome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Izau5_ihmsC|accessdate=30 August 2012|date=23 April 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521792974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman surveyors were known as ''[[Gromatici]]''.

In medieval Europe, [[beating the bounds]] maintained the boundaries of a village or parish. This was the practice of gathering a group of residents and walking around the parish or village to establish a communal memory of the boundaries. Young boys were included to ensure the memory lasted as long as possible.

In England, [[William the Conqueror]] commissioned the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086. It recorded the names of all the land owners, the area of land they owned, the quality of the land, and specific information of the area's content and inhabitants. It did not include maps showing exact locations.

===Modern surveying===
[[File:Table of Surveying, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Printed image of surveying equipment. | Table of Surveying, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Abel Foullon described a [[plane table]] in 1551, but it is thought that the instrument was in use earlier as his description is of a developed instrument.

[[Gunter's chain]] was introduced in 1620 by English mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]]. It enabled plots of land to be accurately surveyed and plotted for legal and commercial purposes.

[[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]] described a [[Theodolite]] that measured horizontal angles in his book ''A geometric practice named Pantometria'' (1571). Joshua Habermel ([[Erasmus Habermehl]]) created a theodolite with a compass and tripod in 1576. Johnathon Sission was the first to incorporate a telescope on a theodolite in 1725.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, Gerard L'E. ''Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments'', Sotheby Publications, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85667-170-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, modern techniques and instruments for surveying began to be used. [[Jesse Ramsden]] introduced the first precision [[theodolite]] in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring [[angle]]s in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his [[Ramsden theodolite|great theodolite]] using an accurate [[dividing engine]] of his own design. Ramsden's theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument's accuracy. [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] invented an instrument that used a [[telescope]] with an installed [[crosshair]] as a target device, in 1640. [[James Watt]] developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the [[parallactic angle]] from which the distance to a point could be deduced.

Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius]] (a.k.a. Snel van Royen) introduced the modern systematic use of [[Triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]]. In 1615 he surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Breda]], approximately 72 miles (116,1 kilometres). He underestimated this distance by 3.5%. The survey was a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all. Snell showed how planar formulae could be corrected to allow for the curvature of the earth. He also showed how to [[resection (orientation)|resection]], or calculate, the position of a point inside a triangle using the angles cast between the vertices at the unknown point. These could be measured more accurately than bearings of the vertices, which depended on a compass. His work established the idea of surveying a primary network of control points, and locating subsidiary points inside the primary network later. Between 1733 and 1740, [[Jacques Cassini]] and his son [[César-François Cassini de Thury|César]] undertook the first triangulation of France. They included a re-surveying of the [[meridian arc]], leading to the publication in 1745 of the first map of France constructed on rigorous principles. By this time, triangulation methods were by then well established for local map-making.

It was only towards the end of the 18th century that detailed triangulation network surveys mapped whole countries. In 1784, a team from General [[William Roy]]'s [[Ordnance Survey]] of Great Britain began the [[Principal Triangulation of Britain]]. The first Ramsden theodolite was built for this survey. The survey was finally completed in 1853. The [[Great Trigonometric Survey]] of India began in 1801. The Indian survey had an enormous scientific impact. It was responsible for one of the first accurate measurements of a section of an arc of longitude, and for measurements of the geodesic anomaly. It named and mapped [[Mount Everest]] and the other Himalayan peaks. Surveying became a professional occupation in high demand at the turn of the 19th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The profession developed more accurate instruments to aid its work. Industrial infrastructure projects used surveyors to lay out [[canal]]s, roads and rail.

In the US, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] created the [[Public Land Survey System]]. It formed the basis for dividing the western territories into sections to allow the sale of land. The PLSS divided states into township grids which were further divided into sections and fractions of sections.

[[Napoleon]] Bonaparte founded [[continental Europe]]'s first [[cadastre]] in 1808. This gathered data on the number of parcels of land, their value, land usage, and names. This system soon spread around Europe.

[[Robert Torrens]] introduced the [[Torrens system]] in South Australia in 1858. Torrens intended to simplify land transactions and provide reliable titles via a centralized register of land. The Torrens system was adopted in several other nations of the English-speaking world.
Surveying became increasingly important with the arrival of railroads in the 1800s. Surveying was necessary so that railroads could plan technologically and financially viable routes.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the century surveyors had improved the older chains and ropes, but still faced the problem of accurate measurement of long distances. [[Trevor Wadley|Dr Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] developed the [[Tellurometer]] during the 1950s. It measures long distances using two microwave transmitter/receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sturman|first1=Brian|last2=Wright|first2=Alan|title=The History of the Tellurometer|url=http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf|publisher=International Federation of Surveyors|accessdate=20 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the late 1950s Geodimeter introduced [[electronic distance measurement]] (EDM) equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cheves |first1=Marc |title=Geodimeter-The First Name in EDM |url=http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |accessdate=20 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225310/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=394 |archivedate=10 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EDM units use a multi frequency phase shift of light waves to find a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahun|first1=Jerry|title=Electronic Distance Measurement|url=http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|website=''Jerrymahun.com''|accessdate=20 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729013241/http://jerrymahun.com/library/Distance/a.htm|archivedate=29 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments saved the need for days or weeks of chain measurement by measuring between points kilometers apart in one go.

Advances in electronics allowed miniaturization of EDM. In the 1970s the first instruments combining angle and distance measurement appeared, becoming known as [[total station]]s. Manufacturers added more equipment by degrees, bringing improvements in accuracy and speed of measurement. Major advances include tilt compensators, data recorders, and on-board calculation programs.

The first satellite positioning system was the [[US Navy]] [[Transit (satellite)|TRANSIT system]]. The first successful launch took place in 1960. The system's main purpose was to provide position information to [[Polaris missile]] submarines. Surveyors found they could use field receivers to determine the location of a point. Sparse satellite cover and large equipment made observations laborious, and inaccurate. The main use was establishing benchmarks in remote locations.

The US Air Force launched the first prototype satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in 1978. GPS used a larger constellation of satellites and improved signal transmission to provide more accuracy. Early GPS observations required several hours of observations by a static receiver to reach survey accuracy requirements. Recent improvements to both satellites and receivers allow [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) surveying. RTK surveys get high-accuracy measurements by using a fixed base station and a second roving antenna. The position of the roving antenna can be tracked.

===21st century===
The [[theodolite]], [[total station]], and [[Real Time Kinematic|RTK]] [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] survey remain the primary methods in use.

Remote sensing and satellite imagery continue to improve and become cheaper, allowing more commonplace use. Prominent new technologies include three-dimensional (3D) scanning and use of [[lidar]] for topographical surveys. [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] technology along with [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] image processing is also appearing.

The main surveying instruments in use around the world are the [[theodolite]], [[Tape measure|measuring tape]], [[total station]], [[3D scanner]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]/[[GNSS]], [[dumpy level|level]] and [[Philadelphia rod|rod]]. Most instruments screw onto a [[Tripod (surveying)|tripod]] when in use. Tape measures are often used for measurement of smaller distances. 3D scanners and various forms of aerial imagery are also used.

The theodolite is an instrument for the measurement of angles. It uses two separate ''circles'', ''protractors'' or ''alidades'' to measure angles in the horizontal and the vertical plane. A telescope mounted on trunnions is aligned vertically with the target object. The whole upper section rotates for horizontal alignment. The vertical circle measures the angle that the telescope makes against the vertical, known as the zenith angle. The horizontal circle uses an upper and lower plate. When beginning the survey, the surveyor points the instrument in a known direction (bearing), and clamps the lower plate in place. The instrument can then rotate to measure the bearing to other objects. If no bearing is known or direct angle measurement is wanted, the instrument can be set to zero during the initial sight. It will then read the angle between the initial object, the theodolite itself, and the item that the telescope aligns with.

The [[gyrotheodolite]] is a form of theodolite that uses a gyroscope to orient itself in the absence of reference marks. It is used in underground applications.

The [[total station]] is a development of the theodolite with an electronic distance measurement device (EDM). A total station can be used for leveling when set to the horizontal plane. Since their introduction, total stations have shifted from optical-mechanical to fully electronic devices.{{citation needed|date = December 2013}}

Modern top-of-the-line total stations no longer need a reflector or prism to return the light pulses used for distance measurements. They are fully robotic, and can even e-mail point data to a remote computer and connect to [[satellite positioning system]]s, such as [[Global Positioning System]]. [[Real Time Kinematic]] GPS systems have increased the speed of surveying, but they are still only horizontally accurate to about 20&amp;nbsp;mm and vertically to 30–40&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fbiZz-37XIYC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=RTK+GPS+accuracy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=pZ3H0k-hm1&amp;sig=Ml6Pyrt-tQzIaByRhOnzE_h_gcI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result National Cooperative Highway Research Program: ''Collecting, Processing and Integrating GPS data into GIS'', p. 40.

GPS surveying differs from other GPS uses in the equipment and methods used. Static GPS uses two receivers placed in position for a considerable length of time. The long span of time lets the receiver compare measurements as the satellites orbit. The changes as the satellites orbit also provide the measurement network with well conditioned geometry. This produces an accurate [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] that can be over 20&amp;nbsp;km long. RTK surveying uses one static antenna and one roving antenna. The static antenna tracks changes in the satellite positions and atmospheric conditions. The surveyor uses the roving antenna to measure the points needed for the survey. The two antennas use a radio link that allows the static antenna to send corrections to the roving antenna. The roving antenna then applies those corrections to the GPS signals it is receiving to calculate its own position. RTK surveying covers smaller distances than static methods. This is because divergent conditions further away from the base reduce accuracy.

Surveying instruments have characteristics that make them suitable for certain uses. Theodolites and levels are often used by constructors rather than surveyors in first world countries. The constructor can perform simple survey tasks using a relatively cheap instrument. Total stations are workhorses for many professional surveyors because they are versatile and reliable in all conditions. The productivity improvements from a GPS on large scale surveys makes them popular for major infrastructure or data gathering projects. One-person robotic-guided total stations allow surveyors to measure without extra workers to aim the telescope or record data. A fast but expensive way to measure large areas is with a helicopter, using a GPS to record the location of the helicopter and a laser scanner to measure the ground. To increase precision, surveyors place [[beacons]] on the ground (about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} apart). This method reaches precisions between 5–40&amp;nbsp;cm (depending on flight height).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf Toni Schenk, Suyoung Seo, Beata Csatho: ''Accuracy Study of Airborne Laser Scanning Data with Photogrammetry'', p. 118] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325194334/http://www.isprs.org/commission3/annapolis/pdf/Schenk.pdf |date=25 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveyors use ancillary equipment such as tripods and instrument stands; staves and beacons used for sighting purposes; [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]]; vegetation clearing equipment; digging implements for finding survey markers buried over time; hammers for placements of markers in various surfaces and structures; and portable radios for communication over long lines of sight.

===Software===
Land surveyors, construction professionals and civil engineers using [[total station]], [[GPS]], [[3D scanner]]s and other collector data use Land Surveying Software to increase efficiency, accuracy and productivity. Land Surveying Software is a staple of contemporary land surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/4843/|title=View DigitalGlobe Imagery Solutions @ Geospatial Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveying techniques==
[[File:Brunton.JPG|thumb|alt= A compass with extra sights for measuring bearings. |A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], still used commonly today by geographers, geologists and surveyors for field-based measurements]]

Surveyors determine the position of objects by measuring angles and distances. The factors that can affect the accuracy of their observations are also measured. They then use this data to create vectors, bearings, coordinates, elevations, areas, volumes, plans and maps. Measurements are often split into horizontal and vertical components to simplify calculation.
GPS and astronomic measurements also need measurement of a time component.

===Distance measurement===
[[File:Field-Map birdie.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt= A Woman with a backpack holding a laser rangefinder, a handheld GPS and a Tablet computer. |Example of modern equipment for surveying ([[Field-Map]] technology): [[GPS]], [[laser rangefinder]] and field computer allows surveying as well as [[cartography]] (creation of map in real-time) and field data collection.]]
Before EDM devices, [[distance]]s were measured using a variety of means. These included chains with links of a known length such as a [[Gunter's chain]], or measuring tapes made of steel or [[invar]]. To measure horizontal distances, these chains or tapes were pulled taut to reduce sagging and slack. The distance had to be adjusted for heat expansion. Attempts to hold the measuring instrument level would also be made. When measuring up a slope, the surveyor might have to "break" (break chain) the measurement- use an increment less than the total length of the chain. [[Surveyor's wheel|Perambulators]], or measuring wheels, were used to measure longer distances but not to a high level of accuracy. [[Tacheometry]] is the science of measuring distances by measuring the angle between two ends of an object with a known size. It was sometimes used before to the invention of EDM where rough ground made chain measurement impractical.

===Angle measurement===
Historically, horizontal angles were measured by using a [[compass]] to provide a magnetic bearing or azimuth. Later, more precise scribed discs improved angular resolution. Mounting telescopes with [[reticle]]s atop the disc allowed more precise sighting (see [[theodolite]]). Levels and calibrated circles allowed measurement of vertical angles. [[Vernier scale|Vernier]]s allowed measurement to a fraction of a degree, such as with a turn-of-the-century [[Transit (surveying)|transit]].

The plane table provided a graphical method of recording and measuring angles, which reduced the amount of mathematics required. In 1829 [[Francis Ronalds]] invented a [[Reflecting instrument#Surveying sector|reflecting instrument]] for recording angles graphically by modifying the [[Octant (instrument)|octant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By observing the bearing from every vertex in a figure, a surveyor can measure around the figure. The final observation will be between the two points first observed, except with a 180° difference. This is called a ''close''. If the first and last bearings are different, this shows the error in the survey, called the ''angular misclose''. The surveyor can use this information to prove that the work meets the expected standards.

===Levelling===
{{main article|Levelling}}
[[File:Tide station leveling.jpg|thumbnail|alt= A woman setting up an optical level on a tripod. |Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services staff member conducts tide station leveling in support of the US Army Corp of Engineers in Richmond, Maine.]]

The simplest method for measuring height is with an [[altimeter]]&amp;nbsp;using air pressure to find height. When more precise measurements are needed, means like precise levels (also known as differential leveling) are used. When precise leveling, a series of measurements between two points are taken using an instrument and a measuring rod. Differences in height between the measurements are added and subtracted in a series to get the net difference in elevation between the two endpoints. With the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), elevation can be measured with satellite receivers. Usually GPS is somewhat less accurate than traditional precise leveling, but may be similar over long distances.

When using an optical level, the endpoint may be out of the effective range of the instrument. There may be obstructions or large changes of elevation between the endpoints. In these situations, extra setups are needed. ''Turning'' is a term used when referring to moving the level to take an elevation shot from a different location. To "turn" the level, one must first take a reading and record the elevation of the point the rod is located on. While the rod is being kept in exactly the same location, the level is moved to a new location where the rod is still visible. A reading is taken from the new location of the level and the height difference is used to find the new elevation of the level gun. This is repeated until the series of measurements is completed. The level must be horizontal to get a valid measurement. Because of this, if the horizontal crosshair of the instrument is lower than the base of the rod, the surveyor will not be able to sight the rod and get a reading. The rod can usually be raised up to 25 feet high, allowing the level to be set much higher than the base of the rod.

===Determining position===
The primary way of determining one's position on the earth's surface when no known positions are nearby is by astronomic observations. Observations to the sun, moon and stars could all be made using navigational techniques. Once the instrument's position and bearing to a star is determined, the bearing can be transferred to a reference point on the earth. The point can then be used as a base for further observations. Survey-accurate astronomic positions were difficult to observe and calculate and so tended to be a base off which many other measurements were made. Since the advent of the GPS system, astronomic observations are rare as GPS allows adequate positions to be determined over most of the surface of the earth.

===Reference networks===
{{main article|Geodetic network}}
[[File:Traversing and Offsetting DP 79152.png|thumb|alt= A diagram of survey markers running along a shoreline. |A survey using traverse and offset measurements to record the location of the shoreline shown in blue. Black dashed lines are traverse measurements between reference points (black circles). The red lines are offsets measured at right angles to the traverse lines.]]

Few survey positions are derived from first principles. Instead, most surveys points are measured relative to previous measured points. This forms a reference or ''control'' network where each point can be used by a surveyor to determine their own position when beginning a new survey.

Survey points are usually marked on the earth's surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to [[Trig beacon|large beacons]] that can be seen from long distances. The surveyors can set up their instruments on this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.

''[[Triangulation]]'' is a method of horizontal location favoured in the days before EDM and GPS measurement. It can determine distances, elevations and directions between distant objects. Since the early days of surveying, this was the primary method of determining accurate positions of objects for [[topographic]] maps of large areas. A surveyor first needs to know the horizontal distance between two of the objects, known as the [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]]. Then the heights, distances and angular position of other objects can be derived, as long as they are visible from one of the original objects. High-accuracy transits or theodolites were used, and angle measurements repeated for increased accuracy. See also [[Triangulation in three dimensions]].

''Offsetting'' is an alternate method of determining position of objects, and was often used to measure imprecise features such as riverbanks. The surveyor would mark and measure two known positions on the ground roughly parallel to the feature, and mark out a baseline between them. At regular intervals, a distance was measured at right angles from the first line to the feature. The measurements could then be plotted on a plan or map, and the points at the ends of the offset lines could be joined to show the feature.

[[Traverse (surveying)|''Traversing'']] is a common method of surveying smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old reference mark or known position and places a network of reference marks covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the reference marks, and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior reference marks so the surveyor can check their measurements.

====Datum and coordinate systems====
Many surveys do not calculate positions on the surface of the earth, but instead measure the relative positions of objects. However, often the surveyed items need to be compared to outside data, such as boundary lines or previous survey's objects. The oldest way of describing a position is via latitude and longitude, and often a height above sea level. As the surveying profession grew it created Cartesian coordinate systems to simplify the mathematics for surveys over small parts of the earth. The simplest coordinate systems assume that the earth is flat and measure from an arbitrary point, known as a 'datum' (singular form of data). The coordinate system allows easy calculation of the distances and direction between objects over small areas. Large areas distort due to the earth's curvature. North is often defined as true north at the datum.

For larger regions, it is necessary to model the shape of the earth using an ellipsoid or a geoid. Many countries have created coordinate-grids customized to lessen error in their area of the earth.

===Errors and accuracy===

A basic tenet of surveying is that no measurement is perfect, and that there will always be a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahmen|first1=Heribert|last2=Faig|first2=Wolfgang|title=Surveying|date=1988|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=3-11-008303-5|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AFNBqbiLzoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=surveying&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_jHnU6G6J87zoASz84CwBg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=surveying&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classes of survey errors:
*''Gross errors or blunders:'' Errors made by the surveyor during the survey. Upsetting the instrument, misaiming a target, or writing down a wrong measurement are all gross errors. A large gross error may reduce the accuracy to an unacceptable level. Therefore, surveyors use redundant measurements and independent checks to detect these errors early in the survey.
*''Systematic:'' Errors that follow a consistent pattern. Examples include effects of temperature on a chain or EDM measurement, or a poorly adjusted spirit-level causing a tilted instrument or target pole. Systematic errors that have known effects can be compensated or corrected.
*''Random:'' Random errors are small unavoidable fluctuations. They are caused by imperfections in measuring equipment, eyesight, and conditions. They can be minimized by redundancy of measurement and avoiding unstable conditions. Random errors tend to cancel each other out, but checks must be made to ensure they are not propagating from one measurement to the next.

Surveyors avoid these errors by calibrating their equipment, using consistent methods, and by good design of their reference network. Repeated measurements can be averaged and any outlier measurements discarded. Independent checks like measuring a point from two or more locations or using two different methods are used. Errors can be detected by comparing the results of the two measurements.

Once the surveyor has calculated the level of the errors in his or her work, it is [[adjustment of observations|adjusted]]. This is the process of distributing the error between all measurements. Each observation is weighted according to how much of the total error it is likely to have caused and part of that error is allocated to it in a proportional way. The most common methods of adjustment are the [[Nathaniel Bowditch|Bowditch]] method, also known as the compass rule, and the [[least squares|principle of least squares]] method.

The surveyor must be able to distinguish between [[accuracy and precision]]. In the United States, surveyors and civil engineers use units of feet wherein a survey foot breaks down into 10ths and 100ths. Many deed descriptions containing distances are often expressed using these units (125.25&amp;nbsp;ft). On the subject of accuracy, surveyors are often held to a standard of one one-hundredth of a foot; about 1/8&amp;nbsp;inch. Calculation and mapping tolerances are much smaller wherein achieving near-perfect closures are desired. Though tolerances will vary from project to project, in the field and day to day usage beyond a 100th of a foot is often impractical.

==Types of surveys==
{{see also|Survey (disambiguation)|Survey (disambiguation)#Earth sciences}}

Local organisations or regulatory bodies class specializations of surveying in different ways. Broad groups are:
* ''As-built survey'': a survey that documents the location of recently constructed elements of a construction project. As-built surveys are done for record, completion evaluation and payment purposes. An as-built survey is also known as a 'works as executed survey'. As built surveys are often presented in red or redline and laid over existing plans for comparison with design information.
* ''[[Cadastral surveying|Cadastral or boundary surveying]]'': a survey that establishes or re-establishes boundaries of a parcel using a [[Land description|legal description]]. It involves the setting or restoration of monuments or markers at the corners or along the lines of the parcel. These take the form of iron [[rod (shaft)|rods]], [[Pipe (material)|pipes]], or concrete monuments in the ground, or [[Nail (fastener)|nails]] set in concrete or asphalt. The ''ALTA/ACSM'' Land Title Survey is a standard proposed by the [[American Land Title Association]] and the [[American Congress on Surveying and Mapping]]. It incorporates elements of the boundary survey, mortgage survey, and topographic survey.
* ''Control surveying'': Control surveys establish reference points to use as starting positions for future surveys. Most other forms of surveying will contain elements of control surveying.
* ''[[Construction surveying]]
* ''[[Deformation Monitoring|Deformation survey]]:'' a survey to determine if a structure or object is changing shape or moving. First the positions of points on an object are found. A period of time is allowed to pass and the positions are then re-measured and calculated. Then a comparison between the two sets of positions is made.
* ''[[Dimensional control survey]]:'' This is a type of survey conducted in or on a non-level surface. Common in the oil and gas industry to replace old or damaged pipes on a like-for-like basis, the advantage of dimensional control survey is that the instrument used to conduct the survey does not need to be level. This is useful in the off-shore industry, as not all platforms are fixed and are thus subject to movement.
* ''Engineering surveying'': topographic, layout, and as-built surveys associated with engineering design. They often need geodetic computations beyond normal civil engineering practice.
* ''Foundation survey'': a survey done to collect the positional data on a foundation that has been poured and is cured. This is done to ensure that the foundation was constructed in the location, and at the elevation, authorized in the ''plot plan'', ''site plan'', or ''subdivision plan''.
* ''[[Hydrographic survey]]'': a survey conducted with the purpose of mapping the shoreline and bed of a body of water. Used for navigation, engineering, or resource management purposes.
* ''[[Leveling]]'': either finds the elevation of a given point or establish a point at a given elevation.
* ''[[National Flood Insurance Program#Removal from NFIP|LOMA survey]]'': Survey to change base flood line, removing property from a [[Special Flood Hazard Area|SFHA]] special flood hazard area.
* ''Measured survey'' : a building survey to produce plans of the building. such a survey may be conducted before renovation works, for commercial purpose, or at end of the construction process.
* ''[[Mine survey|Mining surveying]]'': Mining surveying includes directing the digging of mine shafts and galleries and the calculation of volume of rock. It uses specialised techniques due to the restraints to survey geometry such as vertical shafts and narrow passages.
* ''Mortgage survey:''  A ''mortgage survey'' or ''physical survey'' is a simple survey that delineates land boundaries and building locations. It checks for ''[[Structural encroachment|encroachment]]'', building setback restrictions and shows nearby flood zones. In many places a mortgage survey is a precondition for a mortgage loan.
* ''[[Photogrammetry|Photographic control survey]]'': A survey that creates reference marks visible from the air to allow [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] to be [[Orthophoto|rectified]].
* ''Stakeout, layout or setout'': an element of many other surveys where the calculated or proposed position of an object is marked on the ground. This can be temporary or permanent. This is an important component of engineering and cadastral surveying.
* ''Structural survey'': a detailed inspection to report upon the physical condition and structural stability of a building or structure. It highlights any work needed to maintain it in good repair.
* ''Subdivision'': A boundary survey that splits a property into two or more smaller properties.
* ''Topographic survey'': a survey that measures the elevation of points on a particular piece of land, and presents them as [[contour line]]s on a plot.

===Plane and geodetic surveying===
Based on the considerations and true shape of the earth, surveying is broadly classified into two types.

''Plane surveying'' assumes the earth is flat. Curvature and spheroidal shape of the earth is neglected. In this type of surveying all triangles formed by joining survey lines are considered as plane triangles. It is employed for small survey works where errors due to the earth's shape are too small to matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''geodetic surveying'' the curvature of the earth is taken into account while calculating reduced levels, angles, bearings and distances. This type of surveying is usually employed for large survey works. Survey works up to 100 square miles (260 square kilometers ) are treated as plane and beyond that are treated as geodetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fIvvAwAAQBAJ | title=Surveying and Levelling | accessdate=28 July 2016 | author=N N Basak | pages=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In geodetic surveying necessary corrections are applied to reduced levels, bearings and other observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Surveying.html?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying by BC Punmia | access-date=9 December 2014 | author=BC Punmia | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic principles of surveying have changed little over the ages, but the tools used by surveyors have evolved. Engineering, especially civil engineering, often needs surveyors.

Surveyors help determine the placement of roads, railways, reservoirs, dams, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[retaining wall]]s, bridges, and buildings. They establish the boundaries of legal descriptions and political divisions. They also provide advice and data for ''[[Geographic information system|geographical information system]]s'' (GIS) that record land features and boundaries.

Surveyors must have a thorough knowledge of [[algebra]], basic [[calculus]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]]. They must also know the laws that deal with surveys, [[real property]], and contracts.

Most jurisdictions recognize three different levels of qualification:

* ''Survey assistants'' or ''chainmen'' are usually unskilled workers who help the surveyor. They place target reflectors, find old reference marks, and mark points on the ground. The term 'chainman' derives from past use of [[measuring chain]]s. An assistant would move the far end of the chain under the surveyor's direction.

* ''Survey technicians''  often operate survey instruments, run surveys in the field, do survey calculations, or draft plans. A technician usually has no legal authority and cannot certify his work. Not all technicians are qualified, but qualifications at the certificate or diploma level are available.

* ''Licensed, registered, or chartered surveyors'' usually hold a degree or higher qualification. They are often required to pass further exams to join a professional association or to gain certifying status. Surveyors are responsible for planning and management of surveys. They have to ensure that their surveys, or surveys performed under their supervision, meet the legal standards. Many [[Principal (commercial law)|principals of surveying firms]] hold this status.

=== Licensing ===
Licensing requirements vary with jurisdiction, and are commonly consistent within national borders. Prospective surveyors usually have to receive a degree in surveying, followed by a detailed examination of their knowledge of surveying law and principles specific to the region they wish to practice in, and undergo a period of on-the-job training or portfolio building before they are awarded a license to practise. Licensed surveyors usually receive a [[post nominal letters|post nominal]], which varies depending on where they qualified. The system has replaced older apprenticeship systems.

A licensed land surveyor is generally required to sign and seal all plans. The state dictates the format, showing their name and registration number.

In many jurisdictions, surveyors must mark their registration number on [[survey monument]]s when setting boundary corners. Monuments take the form of capped iron rods, concrete monuments, or nails with washers.

===Surveying institutions===
[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|alt= Uniformed group poses with theodolites, level staves and octant. |Surveying students with their professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century]]

Most countries' governments regulate at least some forms of surveying. Their survey agencies establish regulations and standards. Standards control accuracy, surveying credentials, monumentation of boundaries and maintenance of [[geodetic network]]s. Many nations devolve this authority to regional entities or states/provinces. Cadastral surveys tend to be the most regulated because of the permanence of the work. Lot boundaries established by cadastral surveys may stand for hundreds of years without modification.

Most jurisdictions also have a form of professional institution representing local surveyors. These institutes often endorse or license potential surveyors, as well as set and enforce ethical standards. The largest institution is the [[International Federation of Surveyors]] (Abbreviated FIG, for {{lang-fr|link=no|Fédération Internationale des Géomètres}}). They represent the survey industry worldwide.

===Building surveying===
{{Main article|Building surveying#Profession}}

Most English-speaking countries consider building surveying a distinct profession. They have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. Building surveyors focus on investigating the condition of buildings as well as legal compliance work.

===Cadastral surveying===
{{main article|Cadastral surveying}}One of the primary roles of the land surveyor is to determine the boundary of real property on the ground. The surveyor must determine where the adjoining landowners wish to put the boundary. The boundary is established in legal documents and plans prepared by attorneys, engineers, and land surveyors. The surveyor then puts monuments on the corners of the new boundary. They might also find or resurvey the corners of the property monumented by prior surveys.

'''Cadastral land surveyors''' are licensed by governments.
The cadastral survey branch of the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) conducts most cadastral surveys in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Rectangular Survey System by C. Albert White, 1983, Pub: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management : For sale by Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O.,&lt;/ref&gt; They consult with [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]], [[National Park Service]], [[US Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], [[US Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]], [[US Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation]], and others. The BLM used to be known as the [[General Land Office]] (GLO).

In states organized per the [[Public Land Survey System]] (PLSS), surveyors must carry out BLM cadastral surveys under that system.

Cadastral surveyors often have to work around changes to the earth that obliterate or damage boundary monuments. When this happens, they must consider evidence that is not recorded on the title deed. This is known as extrinsic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, D., &amp; Hermansen, K. (1995). Use of extrinsic evidence to aid interpretation of deeds. Journal of Surveying Engineering, (121), 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noteworthy surveyors ===
Three of the four U.S. Presidents on [[Mount Rushmore]] were land surveyors. [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Abraham Lincoln]] [[Surveying in early America|surveyed]] colonial or frontier territories prior to serving office.

[[David T. Abercrombie]] practiced land surveying before starting an [[outfitter]] store of [[excursion]] goods. The business would later turn into [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] lifestyle clothing store.

[[Percy Fawcett|Percy Harrison Fawcett]] is a British surveyor that explored the jungles of South America attempting to find the [[Lost City of Z]]. His biography and expeditions were recounted in the book [[The Lost City of Z (book)|''The Lost City of Z'']] and were later adapted on [[The Lost City of Z (film)|film screen]].

[[Inō Tadataka]] produced the first map of Japan using modern surveying techniques starting in 1800, at the age of 55.

'''Training Analysis''' (sometimes called '''Training Needs Analysis''' (TNA)) is the process of identifying the gap in employee training and related training needs.

== Introduction ==
Training Need Analysis(TNA) is the process of identifying the gap between employee training and needs of training. Training needs analysis is the first stage in the training process and involves a procedure to determine whether training will indeed address the problem which has been identified. Training can be described as “the acquisition of skills, concepts or attitudes that result in improved performance within the job environment”. Training needs analysis looks at each aspect of an operational domain so that the initial skills, concepts and attitudes of the human elements of a system can be effectively identified and appropriate training can be specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirjournal.com/guides/how-to-conduct-a-training-needs-analysis/|title=How to Conduct a Training Needs Analysis|publisher=Directory Journal|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training needs analysis is most often used as part of the system development process. Due to the close tie between the design of the system and the training required, in most cases it runs alongside the development to capture the training requirements.

==Design Integrated Training Analysis==
Tools and methods for an integrated approach, [[Design Integrated Training Analysis]], have been proposed and developed. The trade-offs between design and training are both assessed in light of the understanding of the operational tasks. This approach also uses information on recorded critical incidents to review proposed training and to provide traceability between hazards and training. This single, integrated approach to human factors and training needs analysis has been successfully used on a number of defence projects.

==Training Analysis Process==
Over the last 20 years the critical nature of the [[man-in-the-loop]] has changed from simply manual dexterity and procedural operation to a state in which their decision making, cognitive abilities, [[data assimilation]], communication skills, and attitude are all crucial. In addition the job structure of the personnel operationally involved with modern systems has diversified in direct proportion to the complexity of the technology.   This has fueled the need for a formal approach.

The task of training can be broken down into a number of discrete components, each addressing a different part of the overall learning process. This breakdown is as follows:-
* Psycho-motor Skills
* Procedural Skills
* Knowledge Transfer
* Communication Skills
* Colossal Thinking
* Attitude Learning
* Performance Training
* Physiological Stresses

The role of training analysis is to build a formal bridge between the available design data and the training media and training objectives, in order to facilitate the [[transfer of training]] elements into the operational environment.

For complex multi-user system a user-to-task map is often constructed to present the relationship between the tasks and the identified team structure and also to identify new groups of users that would need to have an understanding of the system. The training gap is assessed by a comparison between the goals and tasks undertaken by the individuals and the existing training.

There is a wide variety of training media that can be used, ranging from traditional lecture-based teaching to sophisticated simulators. Different media will be more or less appropriate for different activities. It is necessary to determine the most suitable and cost-effective training media for the different areas.

There have been many different approaches defined, however, the system approach to training has been the most successful.

Training Needs Analysis (TNA) is defined as the “Identification of training requirements and the most cost effective means of meeting those requirements”.

A TNA should always be performed where a major new development in policy, equipment acquisition or procedures is deemed to have potential impact upon the current training regime.

TST has considerable experience of successfully employing the accepted techniques applied to the development of training systems, including the [[Systems Approach to Training]] (SAT) in both the defence and civilian domains using customer specific standards such as JSP 822 where required.

Carrying out all TNA activates in accordance with SAT principles ensures rigorous visibility in each design stage with clear audit trails from the initial Scoping Study through to the recommended solution.

== Benefits ==
* Speed up the transition of adopting change
* Reduce the risk and impact on the business and ensure that your people are not only prepared for the change but fully equipped
* Help the trainee to achieve his goals and dreams in life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">{{Semiotics}}
'''Urban semiotics''' is the study of meaning in urban form as generated by signs, symbols, and their social connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Keller, Suzanne |title=Review |journal=Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 17, No. 3. (May, 1988), pp. 346-348 |jstor=2069642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most urban semiotic theory is based on [[social semiotics]], which considers social connotations, including meanings related to ideology and power structures, in addition to denotative meanings of signs.  As such, urban semiotics focuses on material objects of the built environment, such as streets, squares, parks, and buildings, but also unbuilt cultural products such as building codes, planning documents, unbuilt designs, real estate advertising, and popular discourse about the city,&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.5&lt;/ref&gt; such as architectural criticism and real estate blogs.

Theorists who take a social semiotic approach to urban semiotics define their discipline in opposition to the methods of [[behavioral geography]], beginning with the work of [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] in ''The Image of the City'', which they criticize for being limited by its exclusive focus on the denotative level of communication (recognition of spatial elements, such as paths, as conceptual objects), ignoring the connotative meanings associated with urban forms; instead, urban semioticians argue that urban structures often become recognizable because they have symbolic meaning beyond their functional meanings.  The social semiotic approach to urban semiotics also grew out of a critique of architectural semiotics, which was perceived to be overly attached to linguistic models of semiosis and thus unable to adequately consider the social connotations of signs.&lt;ref&gt;Gottdiener and Lagopoulos, 1986. p.6-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists have used semiotic models in empirical studies of the construction of meaning in urban environments.  Raymond Ledrut has used questionnaires and interviews about viewers' responses to sets of photographs in order to examine the role of class in shaping mental models of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ledrut, Raymond.  “The Images of the City,” in ''The City and the Sign: An Introduction to Urban Semiotics'', Gottdienier, M., and Lagopoulos, Alexandros, eds.  New York: Columbia University Press, 1986.  p.219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Martin Krampen]] conducted studies of photograph recognition in order to discover the level of facade detail required to identify building types, and to examine the role of socioeconomic status in shaping preference for building styles.&lt;ref&gt;Krampen, M.

'''Urbana University''', a branch campus of [[Franklin University]], is a [[Private university|private]] university specializing in [[liberal arts]] education. Urbana is located in [[Urbana, Ohio]], in [[Champaign County, Ohio|Champaign County]], approximately one hour west of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and one hour northeast of [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].

== History ==
Urbana University was founded in 1850 by followers of the 18th century [[Sweden|Swedish]] philosopher and scientist, [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. The university was the second institution of higher learning in Ohio to admit women; the first was [[Oberlin College]]. The groundwork for the founding of the university was in part laid by John Chapman, better known as [[Johnny Appleseed]], who became the inspiration for the [[Johnny Appleseed Museum]] founded for his extraordinary history. While more famous for spreading [[apple]] seeds throughout the East, Chapman was also a [[Swedenborgian]] [[missionary]] and helped spread this faith among the early settlers around Urbana.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|work=Urbana University|url=http://www.urbana.edu/admissions/about-us/history.html|title=History of Urbana University|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapman encouraged his friend and fellow Swedenborgian, [[John Hough James]], to donate the land on which Urbana University was built.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; To this day, the University maintains an informal relationship with the [[Swedenborgian Church of North America|Swedenborgian General Convention of the Church of the New Jerusalem in the United States of America]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The university is also home to the Johnny Appleseed Educational Center &amp; Museum to honor John Chapman.&lt;ref name="Johnny Appleseed Educational Center &amp; Museum"&gt;{{cite web|work=Johnny Appleseed Educational Center and Museum|url=http://www.urbana.edu/resources/community/johnny-appleseed.html|title=National Apple Museum|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes for elementary and secondary students under the name Urbana Seminary began in the fall of 1850 in a rented room in a building in downtown [[Urbana, Ohio|Urbana]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; College level classes were first held in the fall of 1854, following the construction of Bailey Hall, the first building on the campus.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Less than 10 years after the college opened it suspended operations from 1861-1866 during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The college experienced a number of changes in the early 20th century when the college's curriculum was shortened to a two-year [[junior college]] format in 1907.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The school later shut down the primary school in 1911; and the [[secondary school]] was closed in 1928.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Urbana operated as a two-year college until 1968, when it returned curriculum to a four-year format.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1975, Urbana was granted full membership in the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1985, the institution changed its name from Urbana College to '''Urbana University'''.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Today, in addition to being a traditional [[liberal arts college]], Urbana University's School of Adult and Graduate Education offers associate degree and Bachelor of Science degree completion programs in Business Management, Education, Criminal Justice Leadership, Human Services Leadership, and many more. In addition to these programs, Master's programs are available in Business Administration, Education, Nursing, and Criminal Justice. Classes meet on the Urbana University main campus, and at several off-campus locations throughout Western [[Ohio]]. These locations are in [[Bellefontaine, Ohio|Bellefontaine]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Kettering, Ohio|Kettering]], [[Marysville, Ohio|Marysville]], [[Piqua, Ohio|Piqua]], and [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]].&lt;ref name="offcampus"&gt;{{citation |work=Urbana University|title=Off Campus Site Locations&lt;!--|accessdate=October 23, 2011--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the university was purchased by [[Franklin University]] after undergoing significant budget shortfalls.&lt;ref name=Dispatch&gt;{{cite web|last1=Binkley|first1=Collin|title=Franklin University buys financially troubled Urbana University|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2014/04/29/Franklin_U_buys_Urbana_U.html|website=Columbus Dispatch|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the agreement, Urbana would retain its name, and act as a physical campus for both Urbana and Franklin students.&lt;ref name=Dispatch/&gt; On August 1, 2017, Franklin University received approval for its change of status application by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) to bring Urbana University under Franklin’s accreditation as a “branch campus.”

[[File:Bailey and Barclay Halls, Urbana University.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Bailey and Barclay Halls|Bailey and Barclay Halls are two of the oldest buildings on the Urbana University campus.]]

The {{convert|128|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} main campus is located on the southwest side of Urbana in west central Ohio. Its buildings range from historic 19th-century buildings styled in traditional architecture to modern structures. Bailey Hall, Oak Hall, and Barclay Hall are the three oldest buildings on the campus. All three are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has undergone various changes in the early 21st century with the construction of Sycamore Hall in 2004, the Urbana University Stadium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Motz Group|url=http://www.themotzgroup.com/article/new-field-stadium-for-urbana-university|title=New Field Stadium for Urbana University|accessdate=October 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330062134/http://www.themotzgroup.com/article/new-field-stadium-for-urbana-university|archive-date=2012-03-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Student Center in 2006, and McConnell Hall in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Urbana University|url=http://www.urbana.edu/index.php/current_students/residence_life/residence_halls/|title=Residence Halls|accessdate=October 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501173501/http://www.urbana.edu/index.php/current_students/residence_life/residence_halls/|archive-date=2011-05-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==
Urbana University offers 28 undergraduate majors and Graduate programs in Nursing (MSN), Education (MEd), Business Administration (MBA), Criminal Justice Administration (MA), and a Post-Baccalaureate in Teacher Licensure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Urbana University|url=http://www.urbana.edu/index.php/academics/|title=Academics|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Athletics ==
[[File:UrbanaKnights.png|thumb|Official athletics logo.]]
Urbana's athletic teams are known as the Blue Knights, the colors are blue and white. The school sponsors 21 intercollegiate teams. The university is a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) at the [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] level. Urbana was an [[NCAA Division II independent schools|independent member]] of Division II, after completing the transition from the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and member of the [[American Mideast Conference]] (AMC) to NCAA in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|publisher=Urbana Daily Citizen|url=http://www.urbanacitizen.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&amp;SubSectionID=8&amp;ArticleID=154360|title=NCAA grants Urbana University full membership|date=July 9, 2010 |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Great Lakes Valley Conference]] (GLVC) accepted Urbana as associate member of the GLVC in football only starting with the 2012 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Billing|first=Greg|publisher=[[Dayton Daily News]]|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/dayton-sports/central-state-urbana-football-join-glvc-971310.html|title=Central State, Urbana football join GLVC|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the university and five other schools, many also transitioning to the NCAA from NAIA, announced their intentions to form the [[Great Midwest Athletic Conference]] (G-MAC) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jablonski|first=David|work=[[Springfield News-Sun]]|url=http://www.springfieldnewssun.com/springfield-oh-sports/urbana-cedarville-join-great-midwest-athletic-conference-1270633.html|title=Urbana, Cedarville join Great Midwest Athletic Conference|date=October 17, 2011|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The G-MAC ultimately launched a year earlier than planned, in 2012, with Urbana as a member. The school will spend only one season in the G-MAC; on August 20, 2012, Urbana was unveiled as a charter member of the [[Mountain East Conference]] (MEC), a new Division II conference set to launch for the 2013–14 school year.&lt;ref name=Rine&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-register.net/page/content.detail/id/573196/Cards--Toppers-Set-To-Jump-Into-New-League.html?nav=523 |title=Cards, Toppers Set To Jump into New League |first=Shawn |last=Rine |newspaper=[[The Intelligencer &amp; Wheeling News Register]] |location=Wheeling, WV |date=August 20, 2012 |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MEC is mostly made up of schools leaving the [[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]], but also includes another Ohio school in [[Notre Dame College]].&lt;ref name=Rine/&gt;

=== Student Organizations ===

Urbana University has several recognized student organizations including leadership groups such as Student Government Association, Campus Activities Board, and Student Athlete Advisory Committee. There are organizations with special interest topics around politics, disc golf, and cancer awareness; and there are academic groups for history students and students interested in social sciences.

=== Residence Life ===

There are six residence halls on campus (South, East, Francis E. Hazard, McConnell, Sycamore, Ross, and Hickory Halls). Urbana's residence halls emphasize civic responsibility, mutual respect, mature interpersonal relationships, multicultural understanding, and community engagement. Students living on campus forge friendships that last a lifetime while learning about different cultures, backgrounds and ideas, gaining an understanding of being part of a community, and developing their leadership skills. Residential living provides students with life skills which are transferable to careers and other aspects of independent living after graduation. Advice and guidance are available from trained upperclass student resident assistants and undergraduate hall directors. Resident assistants live on each floor of each residence hall and serve as a resource for students dealing with any type of issue. The University's Student Conduct programs were recognized as Ohio's most innovative Student Affairs program in 2014 by the Ohio College Personnel Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio College Personnel Association - Awards |url=http://myocpa.org/index.php/awards |accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2996">[[File:Western palearctic.png|thumb|Boundaries in ''Birds of the Western Palearctic'']]

The '''Western Palaearctic''' or '''Western Palearctic''' is part of the [[Palaearctic ecozone]], one of the eight [[ecozone]]s dividing the Earth's surface. Because of its size, the Palaearctic is often divided for convenience into two, with Europe, North Africa, northern and central parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and part of temperate Asia, roughly to the [[Ural Mountains]] forming the western zone, and the rest of temperate Asia becoming the Eastern Palaearctic. Its exact boundaries differ depending on the authority in question, but the  ''Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa: The Birds of the Western Palearctic)'' (''BWP'') definition is widely  used, and is followed by the most popular Western Palearctic checklist, that of the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC). The Western Palearctic ecozone includes mostly [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] and [[temperate]] climate ecoregions.&lt;ref name=BWP&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Snow |editor-first=David |editor2=Perrins, Christopher M | title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 019854099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palaearctic region has been recognised as a natural zoogeographic region since [[Philip Sclater|Sclater]] proposed it in 1858. The oceans to the north and west, and the [[Sahara]] to the south are obvious natural boundaries with other ecozones, but the eastern boundary is more arbitrary, since it merges into another part of the same ecozone, and the mountain ranges used as markers are less effective [[biogeography|biogeographic]] separators.&lt;ref name= jas&gt;{{cite journal | last= Masseti | first= Marco |author2=Bruner, Emiliano  | year=2009 |title=  The primates of the western Palaearctic: a biogeographical, historical, and archaeozoological review | journal= [[Journal of Anthropological Sciences]] | volume= 87 |language = | issue =  | pages= 33–91 | url =http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/2009%20vol87/PDF/On-Line_bassa/JASs2009_03_Masseti.pdf |format = | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate differences across the Western Palearctic region can cause behavioral differences within the same species across geographical distance, such as in the sociality of behavior for bees of the species ''[[Lasioglossum malachurum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evidence for geographic variation in colony social organization in an obligately social sweat bee, Lasioglossum malachurum Kirby (Hymenoptera; Halictidae)|url = http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/z00-064|journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology|pages = 1259–1266|volume = 78|issue = 7|doi = 10.1139/z00-064|first = Miriam H|last = Richards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9764">A '''word sort''' is a developmental word study activity espoused by the ''Words Their Way'' curriculum as written by Donald R. Bear, [[Marcia A. Invernizzi|Marcia Invernizzi]], Shane Templeton, and Francine Johnston. The activity focuses students' attention on critical features of words, namely sound, pattern, and meaning.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, D., Invernizzi, M., Templeton, S., Johnston, F. ''Words Their Way: Word Study For Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling Instruction''. 4th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Recent descriptions of comprehensive vocabulary programs identify fostering word consciousness (getting students really interested in and excited about words) as a crucial component of effective programs.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;Graves, M.F., &amp; Watts-Taffe, S. (2008, November). For the Love of Words: Fostering Word Consciousness in Young Readers. The Reading Teacher, 62(3), 185–193&lt;/ref&gt;  Word sorts are a method to foster word consciousness.

== Role of Word Sorts ==
The process of sorting words into various categories is the heart of word study. By categorizing different words by certain elements, young children make sense of words and patterns within words. Word sorts combine both [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning]] and [[Student-centred learning|teacher-directed instruction]].&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt;

Students receive a stack of cards containing either pictures or words that have several types of contrasting sounds, patterns, or meanings. Each student must then figure out the patterns that exist within the stack, and sort the cards accordingly. By doing this, students construct their own knowledge of words, creating a lasting understanding of how language works. This process contrasts greatly to the simple memorization related to traditional [[spelling test]]s.

The more students understand about the structure of words - their spelling or orthography - the more efficient and fluent their reading will be.  Word sorts place instructional emphasis on the exploration of patterns that can be detected in the sound, structure, and meaning features of words.  Thus, word sorts contribute to orthographic or spelling knowledge, the engine that drives efficient reading as well as efficient writing.&lt;ref name="Templeton and Morris"&gt;Templeton, S, &amp; Morris, D (1999, January). Questions teachers ask about spelling. Reading Research Quarterly, 34(1), 102-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of Sorts ==
There are three different types of word sorts: sound sorts, picture sorts, and word sorts.

=== Sound Sorts ===
Sound sorts can take on many forms in a primary classroom and this is essential because sound is the first layer of English [[orthography]].&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; Sound study can be introduced at a very early stage and develop with a child’s individual ability. Sorting pictures or oral vocabulary is a manipulation of sounds, and this manipulation increases awareness. A simple introductory sort is by initial sound and this can develop to ending sound, vowel sounds, and word families sorts. The root of importance is student motivation and involvement in the sort. By “setting the scene with sounds,"&lt;ref name= "Moni"&gt;Moni, K. (2005). 20 Ways to Use Phonics Activities to Motivate Learners with Difficulties. Intervention in School and Clinic, 41(1) 42-5.&lt;/ref&gt; sorts may include concrete materials and pictures linked to learner interest. [[Phonemic awareness]], not phonics, is the understanding that our spoken sounds work together to make words. This is a very early understanding that can be developed in a variety of ways. Comparing sounds is the easiest task for developing phonemic awareness.&lt;ref name= "Holten"&gt;Holten, A. (2004). Children are best taught how to read by learning the sounds of letters. South Bend Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound sorts can be introduced very early on and develop strategically throughout primary learning.

An ability to sort sounds is essential for early reading because sound manipulation is a stepping stone to word study and decoding ability. For some students a direct instructional approach is not necessary in the development of sound study and sorting. Other children who have had less exposure or lack the understanding of sounds and their manipulability may need further instruction to develop their ability. Teachers have a responsibility to students they serve to identify their needs and implement instructional strategies to scaffold students’ understandings of sounds.

Intervention strategies may be necessary in remediating students who cannot correctly identify sounds in isolation on a given opportunity.&lt;ref name= "Joseph"&gt;Joseph, L. (2002). Facilitating Word Recognition and Spelling Using Word Boxes and Word Sort Phonic Procedures. The School Psychology Review, 31(1), 122-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Programs like [[Reading Recovery]] have contemporary phonemic techniques embedded in the program. Also, books and poems may specifically focus on word families and similar sound patterns for children to identify and understand in context.&lt;ref name= "Glazer"&gt;Glazer, S. (2005). To Phonic or Not to Phonic? Teaching Pre-K-8, 36(3), 71+.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound sorts can be integrated through programs, or very inexpensively through teacher-created materials. For example, students can sort pictures by beginning sound, rhyme, or ending sound. Students do not need to have strong phonics skills in order to engage in sound sorts. This can be a beginning phonemic awareness activity because students need only to identify the sound in order to complete the sort. Letter knowledge is not required, and phonemic development can mature as students do acquire more print knowledge.

=== Picture Sorts ===
Picture sorts are one component of word study and are used to help beginning readers develop Concept of Word, phonological awareness, and phonics.&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;Morris, D. (2005). The Howard Street tutoring manual: Teaching at-risk readers in the primary grades (2nd Ed). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Picture sorts most often begin with focusing on initial sound (single consonant, digraphs, or blends). By using picture sorts teachers are able to help students who do not have extensive reading vocabularies focus on isolated sounds (Initial, final, or medial) within a spoken word.&lt;ref name="Bear" /&gt; These sorts are often a child’s first introduction to word study and are most commonly used with students whose developmental skills are at the emergent, letter name-alphabetic, or early within word Spelling Stages.&lt;ref name="Bear &amp; Templeton"&gt;Bear, D. R., Templeton, S. (1998). Explorations in developmental spelling: Foundations for learning and teaching phonics, spelling, and vocabulary. The Reading Teacher, 52(3), 222-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word Sorts ===
Word sort activities involve students comparing, contrasting, and classifying words - considering words from a variety of perspectives.&lt;ref name="Templeton and Morris"/&gt; Bear et al. emphasized the importance of comparing those words that do fit into a particular category with those that don't.  This type of engagement with words will for most students lead to the abstraction of spelling patterns and the sounds to which they correspond.&lt;ref name="Bear"/&gt;

Word sorts can be teacher directed (closed) or student directed (open).  For example, students in the with-in-word pattern phase of word knowledge could sort words according to a vowel pattern; in such sorts there is always a miscellaneous category for words that do not follow the target categories.&lt;ref name="Templeton and Morris"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! cat !! make !! car !! miscellaneous
|-
| mad || race || star || fall
|-
| flat || game || hard || ball
|-
| cap || place || mark || x
|-
| grab || plate || park || x
|-
|}    

Game-like formats such as board games and card games can also be effective if they focus on words that reflect spelling patterns.  Word-building activities also facilitate abstraction of pattern: word wheels, flip charts, making words.  Spelling or word study notebooks may be used to record, collect, and organize information about words and spelling patterns learned from the word sort.&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;Cunningham, P. (1995).  Phonics They Use. (2nd ed.) New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Word Sorts ===
To complement the many 'hands on' activities students use for sorting words, digitized word sorts provide an efficient way for teachers to deliver spelling pattern differentiation.  A variety of these are ready-made, including [http://www.wordsortwizard.com wordsortwizard.com].

== Adjusting Word Sort Instruction for Students with Learning Problems ==

Research has shown that students who experience significant difficulty with spelling follow the same developmental course as other students, but do so at a slower pace.  In such cases, it is critical to provide word sort words at the appropriate developmental level, regardless of the students' age and grade.  Once the appropriate spelling instructional level is established - be it alphabetic, within-word pattern, or syllable juncture - instruction can be adapted by focusing on fewer words at a time, teaching spelling patterns in an explicit manner, and providing for copious amounts of practice and review.&lt;ref name="Worthy and Invernizzi"&gt;Worthy, M.J. Invernizzi, M. (1990). Spelling errors of normal and disabled students on achievement levels one through four: Instructional implications.  Annals of Dyslexia, 40, 138-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yale-NUS College''' is a [[liberal arts college]] in [[Singapore]]. Established in 2011 as a collaboration between [[Yale University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]], it is the first liberal arts college in Singapore and one of the few in Asia. Yale-NUS is the first institution outside [[New Haven, Connecticut]], that Yale University has developed in its 300-year history, making Yale the first American [[Ivy League]] school to establish a college bearing its name in Asia.

Yale-NUS is predominantly a four-year, fully residential undergraduate institution. The first class, the class of 2017, consisted of 157 students entering in 2013. Over several years, the college intends to increase its student body to 1,000 students and its teaching faculty to about 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS Faculty|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/faculty/|website=Yale-NUS College|publisher=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students select their majors (currently there are 14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/majors/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the end of their second year, after going through two years of the Yale-NUS Common Curriculum, which is "built from scratch by the inaugural faculty, draws on the strengths of established liberal arts traditions, while introducing our students to the diverse intellectual traditions and cultures of Asia and the world". Students graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours or a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours from Yale-NUS College, awarded by NUS.

The College's first graduating class (Class of 2017 – excluding those who are still completing their concurrent degree programmes, amongst others), comprises 119 students. 103 graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and 16 with a Bachelor of Science with Honours. The top five majors of choice amongst the students were Arts and Humanities; Philosophy, Politics and Economics; Environmental Studies; Psychology; and Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences. As of Sept. 29 2017, over 90% of the students had secured jobs or university places to pursue graduate studies. Students who received job offers are working in sectors such science &amp; research (12%), consulting (14%), as well as the public sector (17%). Others industries include education and engineering, finance, technology and start-ups, communications, and consumer and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hua|first1=Rachel|title=Yale-NUS Graduates Secure Job and Graduate School Opportunities|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/viii-10/news/yale-nus-graduates-secure-job-graduate-school-opportunities/|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60% of students at Yale-NUS are Singaporeans and 40% are international students. Yale-NUS College receives more than 8,000 applications annually and the admit rate is typically 3% to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Yale-NUS Welcomes Class of 2021, with 7% acceptance rate|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vii-1/news/yale-nus-welcomes-class-2021-acceptance-rate/|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]], Yale-NUS is the only other college in Singapore to follow a holistic admissions process similar to that followed by Yale and other American universities. Like both Yale and NUS, Yale-NUS follows a [[need-blind]] admission policy and offers financial aid on a full-need basis. Yale-NUS also distributes scholarships to some admitted students based on academic merit.&lt;ref name="http://yale-nus.edu.sg"&gt;http://yale-nus.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Under the presidency of [[Rick Levin|Richard Levin]], Yale University began developing a "internationalization" strategy that included expanding financial resources for international students and study abroad programs, founding the [[Yale World Fellows]] and the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]], and joining the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/The%20Internationalization%20of%20Yale%20-%20The%20Emerging%20Framework%20.pdf |last1=Levin |first1=Richard C. |last2=Lorimer |first2=Linda K. |title=The Internationalization of Yale: 2005-2008 |date=December 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrators at Yale began considering international campus expansion in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Daniel |title=Levin Forges New Ties in Middle East |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/09/22/levin-forges-new-ties-in-middle-east/ |date=22 September 2006 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially approached the [[United Arab Emirates]] about establishing an arts institute on Abu Dhabi's [[Saadiyat Island]], developed in collaboration with the university's arts professional schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ouroussoff |first=Nicolai |title=A Vision in the Desert |date=1 February 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/arts/design/04ouro.html |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Day Lassila |first=Kathrin |title=Worldly Ambitions |date=May 2007 |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2007_05/q_a.html |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyd |first=Rachel |title=Arts institute plans intensify |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=13 September 2007 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/09/13/arts-institute-plans-intensify/ |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Yale indicated that it was not willing to offer Yale degree programs at the proposed institute, the project was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Thomas |last2=Wessel |first2=Nora |title=Yale drops plans for Abu Dhabi |date=11 April 2008 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/11/yale-drops-plans-for-abu-dhabi/ |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/12/education/12yale.html |title=Yale Moves Away From Plans for Link With Abu Dhabi |date=12 April 2008 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NUS, University Cultural Centre 3, Nov 06.JPG|thumb|right|National University of Singapore]]

Levin and National University of Singapore President [[Tan Chorh Chuan]] discussed the concept of a joint liberal arts college at the 2009 [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland,&lt;ref name="CHE2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-in-a-Name-For-Yale-in/131794/ |last=Fischer |first=Karin |title=What's in a Name? For Yale in Singapore, A Whole Lot |date=6 May 2012 |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eighteen months later, Levin and Yale Provost [[Peter Salovey]] circulated to the Yale faculty a prospectus for a liberal arts college in Singapore. Among the given reasons for the initiative were "develop[ing] a novel curriculum spanning Western and Asian cultures" and better preparing students for "an interconnected, interdependent global environment".&lt;ref name="YNCP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Rick |last2=Salovey |first2=Peter |title=Prospectus for a liberal arts college in Singapore |date=12 September 2010 |url=http://communications.yale.edu/sites/default/files/YNC-Prospectus-2010-09.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212093625/http://communications.yale.edu/sites/default/files/YNC-Prospectus-2010-09.pdf |archivedate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=unfit |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caplan-Bricker |first=Nora |title=Yale, Singapore plan new liberal arts college |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=13 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS College was officially launched in April 2011. In July 2012, the College held its ground-breaking ceremony;&lt;ref name="ao1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Edvantage/Story/A1Story20120706-357731.html |title=Yale-NUS College holds groundbreaking ceremony |publisher=News.asiaone.com |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; it enrolled its first class of students in 2013.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/milestones/|website=Yale–NUS College|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS inaugurated its campus on October 12, 2015. The event was attended by Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Acting Education Minister (Higher Education) Ong Ye Kung and the presidents of Yale and the National University of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Le Vi|title=PM Lee: Yale-NUS Must Be More Than Carbon Copy of Yale - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/pm-lee-yale-nus-must-be-more-than-carbon-copy-of-yale/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College held its inaugural graduation ceremony on May 29, 2017. The certificates were presented by Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam, President of the Republic of Singapore, and Richard Levin, former President of Yale and Chief Executive of Coursera, was the guest speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Yale-NUS's Inaugural Class Graduation|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/graduation-issue-i/news/yale-nuss-inaugural-class-graduation/|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=The Octant|agency=The Octant|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guest speaker for 2018's graduation ceremony will be Professor Kishore Mahbubani, Senior Advisor (University &amp; Global Relations) and Professor in Practice of Policy at the National University of Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://graduation.yale-nus.edu.sg/graduation-speaker/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=graduation.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2012, Yale-NUS published its policy on academic freedom and non-discrimination, which states that “the College upholds the principles of academic freedom and open inquiry, essential core values in higher education of the highest calibre. Faculty and students in the College will be free to conduct scholarship and research and publish the results, and to teach in the classroom and express themselves on campus, bearing in mind the need to act in accordance with accepted scholarly and professional standards and the regulations of the College.” The College is also “committed to basing judgments concerning the admission, education, and employment of individuals upon their qualifications and abilities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/policies-and-procedures/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
Yale-NUS has a no-loan policy and provides need-blind admission to local and international students. The admission timeline is similar to that of colleges and universities in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://admissions.yale-nus.edu.sg/afford/|title=Afford - Yale-NUS College|work=Yale-NUS College|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Yale-NUS hopes to grow its class size to 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2016|7|reason=Hopes from 2013 should have changed by now.}} &lt;!--Neither point is fully correct at the present time.

The College employs a holistic approach in evaluating applicants: while academic achievement as reflected in examinations grades is a primary consideration, interviews, recommendations, essays and extracurricular accomplishments are also given significant weight in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College welcomes inaugural class exceeding 150 students|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-inaugural-class-exceeding-150-students/|website=Yale-NUS College|publisher=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inaugural class (Class of 2017)===
In all, Yale-NUS attracted more than 11,400 applications from over 130 countries.&lt;ref name="yale-nus.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/ |title=Yale-NUS College |publisher=Yale-nus.edu.sg |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance rate of the inaugural class was under 4%.&lt;ref name="yale-nus.edu.sg"/&gt; making the admission process comparable in selectivity to both [[Yale University]] and the most competitive faculties of [[National University of Singapore]], and making it one of the most selective colleges in the world, as compared to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (5.9%), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (5.1%) and  [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (6.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hernandezcollegeconsulting.com/ivy-league-admission-statistics-overall-2018/ |title=College Admission Statistics &amp;#124; Top Tier Admissions |publisher=Hernandezcollegeconsulting.com |date=2015-05-01 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a press-release by the Yale-NUS College Administration, the overall yield rate was 52%&lt;ref name="yale-nus.edu.sg"/&gt; comparable to top liberal arts colleges in the US such as [[Amherst College|Amherst]] (41%), [[Williams College|Williams]] (45%), and [[Bowdoin College|Bowdoin]] (48%), as well as not far off from Ivy League schools and top universities like [[Brown University|Brown]] (58%), [[Cornell University|Cornell]] (52%), [[Columbia University|Columbia]] (61%), [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (81%), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (76%) and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] (65%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2015/01/21/national-universities-where-the-most-accepted-students-enroll |title=National Universities Where the Most Accepted Students Enroll |publisher=US News |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2012, the College began accepting application for the Batch of 2017 from Singapore and the rest of the world. The admissions staff began a series of international recruitment events, spanning North America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Students were allowed to apply through the [[Common Application]], Yale-NUS portal and those who chose to apply to [[Yale College]] also had the option to share their application with Yale-NUS.

===Class profiles===
Of the 157 students admitted to the class of 2017 (starting in 2013), 87 were female while 70 were male. The median SAT Score was 1440 (on the 1600 scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/06/17/yale-nus-releases-inaugural-class-figures/|title=Yale-NUS releases inaugural class figures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 75th percentile for Critical Reading (CR) is 760/800 and the 75th percentile for Math is 780/800.

26 nationalities from six continents were represented in the first batch. 62% were Singaporean, while the rest were internationals, giving Yale-NUS one of largest international student populations in terms of percentage of total students. Thirty-two of the students were from [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], while another 11 were from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and [[South America]]. More than 10% of the student body came from [[North America]] with 13 students from the [[United States]] and 4 from [[Canada]].

The Class of 2018 comprised 177 students from 35 countries. They came from 95 schools on six different continents. By nationality, Singaporeans comprise the majority in this intake, with a percentage similar to last year's inaugural class. For international students, the next biggest groups are 10% from the [[United States]], 3% from [[India]], and 3% from [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College welcomes more than 170 new students to the Class of 2018|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-more-than-170-new-students-to-the-class-of-2018/|website=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Class of 2019 comprised 198 students from 25 countries. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students in this year's intake, similar to the previous two cohorts. The College's international students came from 25 countries, including for the first time, students from [[El Salvador]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Tunisia]]. The nationalities in the Class of 2019 that are most frequently represented are the [[United States]], [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College Welcomes Over 190 Students To The Class of 2019|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|website=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Class of 2020 comprised more than 200 students from 40 countries, the highest diversity of student nationalities in a single intake. In 2016, the Yale-NUS student body comprises more than 700 students from 53 countries across 6 continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College community officially welcomes new class with First Year Assembly 2016|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/5-august-2016-yale-nus-college-community-officially-welcomes-new-class-first-year-assembly-2016/|website=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed class profile for the Class of 2020 has not been released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Su|first1=Jasmine|title=Why hasn’t Yale-NUS Released the Admissions Statistics for the Class of 2020?|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-11/news/admissions-statistics-yale-nus/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the admissions rate of 5% was eventually revealed to the Yale Daily News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivastava|first1=Ishaan|title=Yale-NUS posts 5 percent admit rate|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/04/20/yale-nus-posts-5-percent-admit-rate/|accessdate=7 May 2017|publisher=Yale Daily News|date=20 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Class of 2021 comprised 248 students from 45 countries, its largest intake to date. Singaporeans continued to make up the largest pool of students hailing from 28 schools across Singapore. The College sees the strongest international representation from India, United States, China and South Korea. For the first time, students from Uzbekistan and Paraguay are also represented, amongst others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Acceptance rates have varied between 3 and 7% across the first six batches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=Dave|title=Yale-NUS Welcomes Class of 2021, with 7% acceptance rate|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vii-1/news/yale-nus-welcomes-class-2021-acceptance-rate/|accessdate=19 September 2017|work=The Octant|issue=Volume 7 Issue 1|publisher=The Octant|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The founding instruction committee decided to implement a common curriculum, a set of interlinked courses for all students. Similar to the core curricula at [[Columbia University]] and [[University of Chicago]], students will a number of set courses in their first year of study. The common curriculum is reviewed every four years. Following its inaugural review, the common curriculum was reduced to 10 courses, with the removal of a science course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Common Curriculum reduced to 10 courses, following first review - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-13/news/common-curriculum-reduced-to-10-courses-following-first-review/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yale-NUS common curriculum is a set of interconnected courses designed to provide all students with a shared, intensive exploration of themes and topics ranging across all the academic disciplines, from science to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/singapores-first-liberal-arts-college-outlines-innovative-common-curriculum/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, titled "In Defense of a Liberal Education," Fareed Zakaria describes the Yale-NUS Curriculum Report as the 21st century version of the Yale Report of 1828, which set the agenda for the classical curriculum of the 19th century, and the Harvard Red Book of 1945, which set a similar agenda for the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.libertyproject.com/freedom/why-american-colleges-need-global-common-curriculu/|title=Why American colleges need a global common curriculum in the 21st century|work=The Liberty Project|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majors===

Students choose their majors at the end of their second year. Currently, there are 14 major fields of study. 31% of the courses are part of the common curriculum, 34% are required by the major, and 35% are electives and prerequisites for the major.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/student-experience/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minors===

Students can declare their minors after the end of their second year. Currently there are 13 minor fields of study. The fields correspond to Yale-NUS's existing majors, with the exception of PPE and DDP Law. However, the college recently approved two new interdisciplinary minors: Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Justin|title=Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies Approved as Yale-NUS’s First Interdisciplinary Minors|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vi-8/news/global-antiquity-chinese-studies-approved-yale-nus-first-interdisciplinary-minor/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|issue=Volume VI Issue 8|publisher=The Octant|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42% of the inaugural two batches have declared minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=42% of Yale-NUS Upperclass Students Declare Minor|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/yale-nus-students-declare-minor/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint and associated programs==
Yale-NUS and Faculty of Law, NUS jointly offer a Double Degree program in Law and Liberal Arts for those seeking a broad liberal arts education in addition to their professional training in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/double-degree-with-law/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS offers three Concurrent Degree Programs:

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. A five-year program designed for students who want to pursue careers in an environmental field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-yfes/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. A five-year program designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education followed by careers in the field of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-lkyspp/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Yale School of Public Health. A five-year program designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education and a career in the field of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-yale-school-of-public-health/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS plans to introduce a fourth Concurrent Degree Programme with the NUS School of Computing, in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ho|first1=Dion|title=Yale-NUS Concurrent Degree Programme with NUS School of Computing - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/yale-nus-concurrent-degree-programme-nus-school-computing/|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Students will receive special consideration to be admitted in the Silver Scholars Program of the Yale School of Management. The program provides the unique opportunity to enter the Yale MBA program immediately after undergraduate study to move more quickly toward career goals. Duke-NUS, Singapore's first US-style graduate-entry medical school, has also expressed interest in admitting Yale-NUS graduates for their  Doctor of Medicine (MD), PhD and MD/PhD degree programs.&lt;ref name="duke-nus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/index.php/learning/md-phd-md-phd-programs-at-duke-nus-graduate-medical-school.html |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601222220/http://yale-nus.edu.sg/index.php/learning/md-phd-md-phd-programs-at-duke-nus-graduate-medical-school.html |title=MD, PhD, MD/PhD Programs at Duke-NUS Medical School| archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiential learning ==
The Yale-NUS Centre for International and Professional Experience integrates traditionally separate and often silo-ed components of experience based learning (such as study abroad, summer sessions, internships, career services, leadership and service programming, research attachments) under one roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cipe.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=cipe.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Week 7 program takes place in the seventh week of the first semester of the first year – a time when all freshers are enrolled in the same common curriculum courses. During Week 7, all first-year students participate in a faculty-generated initiative that brings student learning out into the world and connects to both faculty interests and themes of the common curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-insight-designing-experiential-learning-yale-nus-college|title=World insight: designing experiential learning at Yale-NUS College|date=2016-07-24|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Yale-NUS, a term-time study abroad experience is the norm. Some 75 to 80 per cent of students spend a semester elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-insight-building-study-abroad-programme-works|title=World insight: building a study abroad programme that works|date=2016-12-27|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus life==

===Residential colleges===
[[File:Yale-NUS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Yale-NUS College's central courtyard]]
Yale-NUS's student life is modelled on the [[residential colleges of Yale University|residential colleges of Yale]]. There are three residential colleges named Saga, Elm and Cendana, although there are plans to build a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marie Lee|first1=Regina|title=Yale-NUS to Open a Fourth Residential College in Four Years - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-3/features/yale-nus-to-open-a-fourth-residential-college-in-four-years/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each has its own dining hall, courtyard, student suites, sky-gardens, faculty residences, study-spaces, intramural teams, and butteries, informal student-run eateries that are a Yale tradition. Students live in suites of six single rooms. These small-scale communities are arranged vertically in residential towers, which contain both student suites and faculty apartments. Floors are grouped into neighborhoods, each with its own skygarden, a landscaped outdoor space for high-rise buildings that was pioneered in Singapore.

The residential community includes a rector (equivalent to the position of a college master at Yale), a vice rector, faculty fellows, advisors, rector's aides, and distinguished visiting fellows. Students will expand their social and leadership skills while enjoying the support of "nested academic communities."

[[File:Yale-NUS 2.jpg|thumb|left|A courtyard at Yale-NUS]]

Kyle Farley, formerly Dean of Jonathan Edwards College at Yale, served as the first Dean of Students of the college. Brian McAdoo, a geologist and expert in environment studies, formerly of [[Vassar College]], served as the inaugural Rector and is currently rector of Elm college, while Eduardo Lage-Otero, formerly of Trinity College, was named inaugural Vice-Rector and later served as Vice-Rector of Saga College.

There is currently no Dean of Students.

As the first freshmen transitioned into the collegiate living experience, they were originally aided by Dean's Fellows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/21-july-2017-deans-fellows-guides-and-mentors-for-yale-nus-students/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of recent college graduates picked from various higher educational backgrounds, including Amherst, Carleton, Princeton, Reed, Mt. Holyoke, Yale, and NUS. As of 2017, the Dean's Fellow role has shifted, with residential functions now primarily being performed by upper-class students.

===Student organisations===

In 2017, Yale-NUS had 54 student organisations recognised by the Dean of Students Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg/student-activities/student-orgs-directory/|website=studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college has a number of student newspapers, magazines and journals. Publications include ''The Octant'', Yale-NUS's most established publication, ''The Mocktant'', its satirical counterpart, ''Tònes'', a multilingual magazine, and the Yale-NUS Society for Academic Research, which publishes academic journals. While not a recognised student organisation, ''The Fox and Hedgehog'', a current and global affairs review, was founded by Yale-NUS students.

==Campus==
[[Image:Yale-NUS 3.jpg|thumb|A view of the three residential colleges.]]
The Yale-NUS campus is adjacent to NUS University Town&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Town|url=https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/University+Town/@1.3060434,103.7707735,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1af575f7ff17:0x1056d4b4bd4641c8!8m2!3d1.306038!4d103.7729622?hl=en|website=Google Maps|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the College moved to this permanent campus in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/milestones/ |website=Yale–NUS College|accessdate=July 25, 2016 |title=Milestones}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a central campus green flanked by academic and administrative buildings. The campus was designed by architectural firms Pelli Clark Pelli and Forum Architects (a Singaporean architecture studio), who state that "its architectural style blends the collegiate traditions of Yale with the Southeast Asian cultures through its modernist style ornamented by metalwork patterns inspired by southeast Asian textiles." Unlike the neighbouring University Town, Yale-NUS's campus is built on a grid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chia|first1=David|title=Detailing the Distinct Architecture of Yale-NUS - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-10/arts/detailing-the-distinct-architecture-of-yale-nus/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus was designed to achieve the highest rating under the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark, Singapore's benchmark for sustainable design. In addition to visible sustainable design strategies such as the biofiltration pond and the frequent use of natural ventilation, the campus integrates advanced building systems for energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/singapore/yale-nus-college|title=Yale-NUS College - Singapore Education Building - e-architect|date=9 February 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS's campus was awarded the Green Mark Platinum Award from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-wins-bca-green-mark-platinum-award/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Architecture Award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isabel Ee|first1=Clare|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/26-july-2016-yale-nus-college-receives-prestigious-international-architecture-award-2016/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni==

Upon graduation, Yale-NUS alumni will be receive alumni membership of National University of Singapore and will be international affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni (AYA), although not membership to the Yale Club of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xie|first1=Yihao|title=Yale-NUS Alumni to be International Affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-9/news/breaking-yale-nus-alumni-to-be-international-affiliates-in-the-association-of-yale-alumni/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS has its own Alumni Affairs Council and is working to establish a Yale-NUS Club of Singapore.

Since graduating its first class in June 2017, Yale-NUS alumni have won several post-graduate awards, including its first Rhodes Scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/yale-nus-graduate-awarded-prestigious-rhodes-scholarship|title=Yale-NUS graduate awarded prestigious Rhodes Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schwarzman Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/scholar/mollie-saltskog/|title=Schwarzman Scholars Class of 2018 Profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also achieved an employment rate of 93.3%, with a median monthly salary of SGD3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/ix-6/uncategorized/graduation-statistics-first-cohort-yale-nus-graduates/|title=Graduation statistics from the first cohort of Yale-NUS graduates|last=Ho|first=Dion|date=15 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Mascot ==
Yale-NUS launched the College Mascot in 2017. The Yale-NUS College Mascot - 'Halcyon' -  emerged as a representation of the blue-eared kingfisher species found in rarity in Singapore. The orange-and-blue mascot, colours of Yale-NUS, found ready acceptance as it also encapsulates the core identity of a young academic institution in quick and confident ascension, ready to take on the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignbriefasia.com/2017/03/yale-nus-and-hakuhodo-singapor.html|title=Yale-NUS and Hakuhodo Singapore team up to create the college kingfisher mascot|work=Campaign Brief Asia|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mascot was ratified by the student body on April 7, 2016 after three rounds of voting. Since ratification, the Yale-NUS Student Government held focus group discussions to gather feedback on the mascot design and name. The name Halcyon emerged from one of these student focus group discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vi-2/news/yale-nus-unveils-official-college-mascot/|title=Yale-NUS Unveils Official College Mascot|date=2017-02-02|work=The Octant|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Observers in the [[New York Times]] and the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] see Yale's move as part of a larger movement of the globalization of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/nyregion/14yale.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa W. | last=Foderaro | title=Yale Plans to Create a College in Singapore | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Karin |url=http://chronicle.com/article/YaleNational-U-of/132563/ |title=Yale and National U. of Singapore Hammer Out New College's Curriculum |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale faced criticism for its involvement in Singapore because of the government's restrictions on freedom of assembly and ban on homosexual activity.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karin |last=Fischer |title=With Opening Near, Yale Defends Singapore Venture |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 August 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/world/asia/27iht-educlede27.html|quote="...few have provoked the heated criticism that Yale has regarding its decision to be involved in a country where not only is freedom of assembly and association restricted, but homosexual activity is banned."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], a CNN host and fellow of the [[Yale Corporation]] at the time, supported the venture, saying that "Singapore has a great deal to learn from America, and NUS has a great deal to learn from Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/03/zakaria-a-global-education-for-a-global-age/ |last=Zakaria |first=Fareed |title=A global education for a global age |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Koh]], former Singaporean Ambassador to the [[United Nations]], called it a "timely and visionary initiative" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/ips/docs/pub/pa_tk_ST_Yale-NUS%20a%20timely%20visionary%20initiative_150412.pdf |title=Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy |publisher=Spp.nus.edu.sg |date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty expressed themselves in the pages of [[Yale Daily News]]. [[Seyla Benhabib]], a [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] at Yale, calling it a "naïve missionary sentiment," asked, "Do we need to go to Singapore to advance interdisciplinarity and a revival of the liberal arts?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/04/benhabib-whats-stake-yale-nus/ |last=Benhabib |first=Seyla |title=What's at stake at Yale-NUS |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817103617/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/04/benhabib-whats-stake-yale-nus/ |archivedate=17 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairs of the faculty search committee responded, "the new college will require faculty to rethink their pedagogical assumptions and to consider such innovations as integrated and interactive approaches to science; writing across the curriculum; computation, computer simulations and interpretation of large data sets; and the honing of quantitative, communication and other skills."&lt;ref name="bdl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/feb/29/bailyn-davis-and-lewis-rethinking-liberal-arts/?print |last1=Bailyn |first1=Charles |last2=Davis |first2=Deborah |last3=Lewis |first3=Pericles |title=Rethinking liberal arts education |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Bloch]], a [[Sterling Professor|Sterling Professor of French]], said that "As a nexus between India, China and the West, Singapore’s location favors an important conceptual realignment of the humanities that will be a long time coming to the home campus in New Haven — that is, a synthesis of the ways that ideas and creative works of East and West intersect historically as well as conceptually with each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/19/bloch-why-i-yale-nus/ |last=Bloch |first=Howard |title=Why I like Yale-NUS |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of professors critical of the project characterize the endeavor of "globalizing" a "specious one," saying that the graduates "will have to be conformist, dissent-averse managers and executives who serve the global profit motive."&lt;ref name="bmyjr"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/21/letters-32112/ |last1=Miller |first1=Christopher |last2=Bers |first2=Victor |last3=Campbell |first3=Jill |last4=Rogers |first4=John |last5=Yiengpruksawan |first5=Mimi |title=LETTERS: 3.21.12 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210072143/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/21/letters-32112/ |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Chun, the master of [[Berkeley College (Yale University)|Berkeley College]] and educated in South Korea, disagreed, asking "Will Yale-NUS be denied to numerous students around the world like me who lack the hyper-talent or mega-resources needed to study abroad at a place like Yale?"&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/05/chun-globalizing-the-academic-1-percent/ |last=Chun |first=Marvin |title= Globalizing the academic 1 percent |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are concerned that Yale-NUS would dilute the Yale name. For [[Michael J. Fischer|Michael Fischer]], professor of computer science, since Yale-NUS will not grant Yale degrees, the value of a Yale degree becomes diminished, and that the joint governing board does not "make Yale-NUS a part of Yale any more than does Levin's service on the board of directors for American Express make American Express a part of Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/23/fischer-yale-nus-is-not-yale/ |last=Fischer |first=Michael |title=Yale-NUS is not Yale |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haun Saussy]] stated says that "It’s in the spirit of the motto "Lux et veritas" — my light is not diminished when my neighbor lights his candle at mine, and a truth becomes more powerful, not less, when it is shared." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/sep/14/saussy-when-elihu-meets-confucius/ |last=Saussy |first=Haun |title=When Elihu meets Confucius |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2012, the Yale College faculty passed a resolution stating, "We urge Yale-NUS to respect, protect and further principles of non-discrimination for all, including sexual minorities and migrant workers; and to uphold civil liberty and political freedom on campus and in the broader society".&lt;ref name="YDN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/06/faculty-approve-yale-nus-resolution |last1=Gideon |first1=Gavan |last2=Woodford |first2=Antonia |title=Faculty approve Yale-NUS resolution |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, prompted by a ''Wall Street Journal'' report that students would not be allowed to stage protests or form political parties, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that it disapproved such restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303933704577530524046581142 |last=Mahtani |first=Shibani |title=Yale-Singapore Venture to Forbid Political Protest - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/19/singapore-yale-curtail-rights-new-campus |title=Singapore: Yale to Curtail Rights on New Campus &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Riady]], an Associate Professor of Law at the Pelita Harapan University in Indonesia, defended the venture, stating that "Singapore and Asia are in the middle of great transitions, and Yale has an opportunity to shape that process and put its stamp on a rising continent.

In 2015, Yale-NUS became the first higher education institution in Singapore to offer gender neutral housing to students. The move was in response to a push by the inaugural Yale-NUS Student Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Open Housing|url=http://studentgov.commons.yale-nus.edu.sg/portfolio-item/open-housing/|website=Yale-NUS Student Government|accessdate=7 May 2017|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, executed by government representatives David Chappell, Jay Lusk, and Ami Firdaus Bin Mohamed Ali, used a mixture of survey data, student testimonies and statements from student organisations to advocate for the policy change.

The College received increased media scrutiny in response to student calls for the resignation of Chan Heng Chee, a Yale-NUS Governing Board Member and Singapore's Ambassador-at-Large. Chan defended Section 377A of the Singaporean Penal Code, a law forbidding sodomy, at the United Nations Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review in Geneva in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xu|first1=Qi|title=Yale-NUS admin speech sparks debate|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/02/05/yale-nus-admin-speech-sparks-debate/|accessdate=8 May 2017|publisher=Yale Daily News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, The Octant published an op-ed by Nik Carverhill that called on Chan to either take a stand against Section 377A or relinquish her seat on the governing board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carverhill|first1=Nik|title=On the Yale-NUS Governing Board, Tolerance is Not Enough|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/opinion/on-the-yale-nus-governing-board-tolerance-is-not-enough/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article received coverage in the Singaporean press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heng|first1=Janice|title=Yale-NUS rejects call on envoy to quit post|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/yale-nus-rejects-call-on-envoy-to-quit-post|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Straits Times|publisher=The Straits Times|date=7 February 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Jeanette|title=Some Yale-NUS students want Ambassador-at-Large Chan Heng Chee removed from the school’s board {{!}} Mothership.SG|url=http://mothership.sg/2016/02/some-yale-nus-students-want-ambassador-at-large-chan-heng-chee-removed-from-the-schools-board/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=mothership.sg|publisher=mothership.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Chan attended a closed door dialogue in March, hosted by the Yale-NUS Student Government and The G Spot, a gender and sexuality alliance on campus, to discuss Singapore's approach to human-rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamarudin|first1=Diyanah|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/5-july-2016-daryl-yang-class-2018-engaging-dialogue-key-diversity/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 87% of students surveyed by The Octant said that  they did not think Chan should resign, although 62% of respondents supported the dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Spandana|title=Students Reject Call for Ambassador Chan Heng Chee’s resignation: Survey - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-15/news/students-reject-call-for-ambassador-chan-heng-chees-resignation/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan remains a member of the Yale-NUS governing board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/the-governing-board/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports in the [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Singapore-Meets-the-Ivy/141461/ Chronicle of Higher Education], [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/yale-nus-college-extends-reach-liberal-arts-forbidden-fruits Times Higher Education], [http://www.barrons.com/articles/yale-goes-to-asia-1425704378?tesla=y Barron’s Magazine] and [http://harvardmagazine.com/2017/07/an-educated-core Harvard Magazine] on the new college, which started classes in August 2013, noted that lively discussions take place on campus. Barron's Magazine's article “Yale goes to Asia” highlighted how education experts such as Ben Nelson, CEO of the Minerva Project, particularly likes Yale-NUS’ emphasis on seminars and its requirement that all students in their first two years take pretty much the same core curriculum, including philosophy and political thought, literature and humanities, and modern social thought. In an article for The Atlantic, Michael Roth, President of Wesleyan University and author of ''Beyond the University: Why Liberal Education Matters'' write about how he was impressed by Yale-NUS’ decision to decline to institutionalize faculty within departments representing the academic disciplines. This has led to a re-conceptualization of majors as complements to a core curriculum, and, in turn, to the welcoming of faculty with diverse skill sets over those tethered to divisive academic specializations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/american-liberal-education-happens-better-in-singapore/410869/?single_page=true&amp;print|title=The Ironic Birth of Liberal-Arts Education in Asia|last=Roth|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978–1984, Blum served as [[Israel Ambassador to the United Nations]].

==Biography==
Yehuda Z. Blum was born in [[Bratislava]], [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1931, and observed his [[Bar mitzvah|bar-mitzvah]] in the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] concentration camp. He immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Blum1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yehuda Zvi Blum|title=For Zion's sake|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlCHQ6LU988C&amp;pg=PA252|accessdate=24 December 2010|date=30 November 1987|publisher=Associated University Presse|isbn=978-0-8453-4809-3|pages=252–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum earned his law degree from the [[University of London]].

==Law career==
Blum joined the faculty of [[Hebrew University]] in 1965 and until retiring in 2001 occupied the [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] Chair in [[International Law]] there.  He has served as a senior research scholar at the [[University of Michigan]], and visiting professor in the law schools of the [[University of Texas]], [[New York University]], [[Tulane University]], the [[USC Gould School of Law]], and others. In 1968 he served as a [[UNESCO]] Fellow at the [[University of Sydney]] in [[Australia]]. He has written several books and published many scholarly articles on international legal problems in law journals in English, Hebrew and German. He is currently the law editor of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Hebraica]].''

==Diplomatic career==
In 1968, Blum worked for the [[United Nations]] Office of Legal Counsel. He was a member of Israeli delegation to 3rd UN Conference on the [[Law of the Sea]] in 1973. In 1976 he was part of the Israeli delegation to the 31st session of [[UN General Assembly]]. He served as Ambassador and [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations]] for six years, from 1978 to 1984.

He was a member of the Israeli negotiating team that drafted the peace treaty with Egypt ([[Camp David Accords]]) in 1978,  the [[Blair House]] negotiations in March 1979 and the Israeli legal team at the Taba arbitration talks between Israel and [[Egypt]] between 1986 and 1988.&lt;ref name="HU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.huji.ac.il/eng/segel.asp?staff_id=62&amp;cat=545 |title=Faculty of Law website |accessdate=2010-12-23 |publisher=Hebrew University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Ambassador to the United Nations, Blum was often critical of it, saying that the UN "fans the flames of the Middle East conflict."  ''The New York Times'' quoted him as saying that "The essence of the [[Arab-Israeli conflict|Middle East conflict]] has always been and remains the persistent enmity of [[Arab states]] towards the Jewish national renaissance."&lt;ref name="NYT-Fans"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/world/israeli-says-un-fans-the-flames-of-middle-east-conflict.html |title=Israeli says UN fans the flames of Middle East conflict |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=New York Times |author=Richard Bernstein |date=October 1983}} "For decades now, Arab leaders have obstinately maintained that the whole region from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Persian Gulf]] must be exclusively Arab, he said."&lt;/ref&gt;
As UN envoy, he made headlines for "scolding" a group of 133 American Jewish law students protesting Israel's invasion of [[Lebanon]]  and protesting [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlements]] in [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].  He questioned the factual, as well as the moral position, of the students' view, saying that they "have not given the slightest indication of their willingness to bear any personal consequences of their patronizing and fortuitous advice."  &lt;ref name="NYT-students"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/world/israeli-envoy-at-un-scolds-133-us-jewish-law-students.html |title=Israeli envoy at UN Scolds 133 Jewish Law Students |accessdate=2010-12-24 |publisher=New York Times |date=May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
