      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">'''200 Central Park South''' is a Modern-style building on the south side of [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], at the corner of [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|7th Avenue]] and [[Central Park South]] ([[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]]). It is most notable for its curving facade, banded by balconies. Its exterior is beige brick and glass.&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt; It is across from a major pedestrian and vehicle entrance into Central Park, known as the "Merchant's Gate".&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt; This full service building was built post-war in 1963 by [[Bernard Spitzer]] and [[Melvin Lipman]]. It was designed by Wechsler &amp; Schimenti.&lt;ref name=horsley&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Carter B. Horsley]] |title=The Midtown Book: 200 Central Park South}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building is highly recognizable in New York City photographs, most notably for its curved facade. The building is lined with terraces that taper in, then curve, and taper out as they wrap around the two faces of the building. 

Morris Lapidus's Fontainebleau Hotel (1954)

"The curved base of this 35-story modernist residential tower, built 1963, allows more apartments to have park views."&lt;ref name=songlines&gt;[http://www.nysonglines.com/59st.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building’s design was explained by [[Robert A. M. Stern]], Thomas Mellins and David Fishman in their book, ''New York 1960, [[Architecture]] and [[Urbanism]] Between the Second World War and the Bicentennial,'' as "a kind of aggressive, self-referential [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] that had hitherto been largely absent from Manhattan."&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt;

As of 2016 it is a full-service residential [[Cooperative apartment|co-op apartment building]]. This Midtown West building currently has 309 apartments spanning 34 floors. Amenities for its residents include a roof deck, elevator operators, maid service, valet, garage, and concierge.&lt;ref name=streeteasy&gt;[http://streeteasy.com/nyc/building/200-central-park-south-new_york], with photo showing Central Park-facing facade&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it is rated as the #2 co-op building in Midtown, and #13 in Manhattan, according to .&lt;ref name=cityrealty&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/midtown-west/200-central-park-south/5625 |title=200 Central Park South}}, with photo centered on the curve, showing both flanks&lt;/ref&gt;

An interesting fact is that most passersby think it is a 21-story building, and are unaware of its tower, setback, which brings it up 14 more floors.&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt;

[[File:505 Park Avenue.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Aramco Building]], built in 1949, also on 59th Street, at Park Avenue, has a curved corner, but is not tapered that]]
Spitzer reportedly got the idea for the famous curve from the curve drawn by a pencil thrown in frustration. Its tapered balconies have been said to give it a [[Barcelona]] feel.&lt;ref name=gray&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[New York Times]] |title=Central Park South, the view that sneaked up on the city |author=Christopher Gray |date=August 15, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/realestate/central-park-south-the-view-that-sneaked-up-on-the-city.html?_r=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was built in 1963, not 1965, according to some websites.&lt;ref name=streeteasy/&gt;&lt;ref name=cityrealty/&gt;&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt;

Horsley asserts it resembles the [[Fontainebleau Hotel]] (1954), in Miami, designed by [[Morris Lapidus]].&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt;

Residents have included:
*[[Raquel Welch]]&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;
*[[Dino De Laurentiis]]&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;
*[[Al Roker]]&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;
*[[Doris Roberts]]&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;
*[[Bernard Spitzer]]&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;
*[[Elizabeth Ray]]&lt;ref name=songlines/&gt;

Across Seventh Avenue is the [[New York Athletic Club]].&lt;ref name=horsley/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2946">A ''99-year lease'' was, under historic [[common law]], the longest possible term of a [[lease]] of [[real property]].  It is no longer the law in most common law [[jurisdiction]]s today, yet 99-year leases continue to be common as a matter of business practice and [[conventional wisdom]].

==The law==
Under the traditional [[Law of the United States|American common law]] doctrine, the 99-year term was not literal, but merely an arbitrary time span beyond the life expectancy of any possible [[lessee]] or [[Lease|lessor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/wiki/99_Year_Lease.asp Mortgage News Daily web site article on a 99-year lease].  Accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams, ''Why are leases made for 99-year terms?'', 22 July 1977, found at [http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_138.html The Straight Dope article on 99-year lease]. Accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Blackstone]] states that a lease was formerly limited to 40 years, although much longer leases (for 300 years, or 1000 years) were in use by the time of [[Edward III]].&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone (1753), ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Book 2, Chapter IX "Of estates less than freehold"&lt;/ref&gt; The 40-year limit was based on the unreliable text "[[The Mirror of Justices]]" (book 2, chapter 27).

In the law of several US states, a 99-year lease will always be the longest possible contract for realty by [[statute]], but many have enacted shorter terms and some allow infinite terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jk9.com/99_lease.htm Law Office of James Kaklamanos web site page on 99-year lease].  Accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the influence of the ideas of [[Henry George]] at the time the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT) was established in the early 20th century, all land in the ACT is held under 99-year leases, the first of which will expire in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Gordon |title=Can people own land in the ACT? |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/curious-canberra/2016-07-04/can-people-own-land-in-the-act/7550166 |accessdate=2018-07-24 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2016-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 99-year lease concept has been more common under the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[regime]]s when it comes to [[Concession (territory)|concessions of territory]]: most concessions last for 99 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

'''Alan Gertner''' (born 1984) is a Canadian businessman. He is the co-founder and CEO of [[Tokyo Smoke]], a Canadian lifestyle brand that focuses on coffee, clothing and legal [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Gertner who also co-founded Hiku, a Canadian company, is a former Google executive&lt;ref name="denvpost-01"/&gt;  known for his pioneering work in the Canadian [[cannabis industry]].&lt;ref name="torontosun-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calgaherald-01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ie-01"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[Irish Independent]] |title= Joint ventures take off with legal cannabis, but risks remain  |url=  https://www.independent.ie/business/world/joint-ventures-take-off-with-legal-cannabis-but-risks-remain-36389053.html   |date= December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertner was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] and raised in the [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]] neighbourhood by his parents. His father Lorne Gertner is a lifelong entrepreneur who managed a women's apparel manufacturer [[Mister Leonard]].  Gertner received a degree in management and business administration from the [[University of Western Ontario]] [[Ivey Business School]].

== Career ==
From 2009 to 2014, Gertner held several executive positions at [[Google]]'s [[Mountain View, California]] and Google Asia [[Singapore]] offices. During this tenure, he was a founding member of Google's first Global Business Strategy team in Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.traveltrends.biz/ttn555-alan-gertner-industry-head-travel-google-southeast-asia/ |work=  |publisher= Travel Trends  |title= Alan Gertner, Industry Head – Travel, Google Southeast Asia |date=16 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the company sent him to [[Ghana]] to help build an infrastructure for [[high-speed Internet]]. During this project, and while on his way to a "[[West African Vodun|voodoo]]" ceremony in rural Ghana, Gertner had a life-changing conversation with a tour guide who told him: "You either work on something you love, or work because it supports the people you love."&lt;ref name="torontosun-01"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[Toronto Sun]]  |title=  Smoke, pray, love |url=  http://torontosun.com/2016/11/13/smoke-pray-love/wcm/ab315aca-ada0-4a6e-a2e3-cfd78e446fa2   |date= November 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="civil-01"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.civilized.life/articles/alan-gertner-tokyo-smoke/ |work=  |publisher= Civilized  |title= Why Alan Gertner Left A Great Job At Google To Start Tokyo Smoke In Toronto   |date= May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This encounter was a defining moment in his career that made him quit his job at Google,&lt;ref name="globemail-02"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]]  |title= "Why I quit my dream job at Google to launch a marijuana business" |url=  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/startups/why-i-quit-my-dream-job-at-google-to-launch-a-marijuana-business/article28668428/   |date= February 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; take a break and later start Tokyo Smoke in partnership with his father.&lt;ref name="denvpost-01"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= [[The Denver Post#The Cannabist|The Cannabist]] |title= These 10 influencers used to work at Bose, Apple, GoPro, Google and Aveda.

'''Aniceto Lacson y Ledesma''' (April 17, 1857 in [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]], [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]] – February 3, 1931 in [[Talisay City, Negros Occidental|Talisay]], [[Negros Occidental]], Philippines) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[revolutionary]] general, sugar baron, and  businessman.&lt;ref name=Foreman&gt;Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}}  He is notable for leading the [[Negros Revolution]] along with [[Juan Araneta]], and for being the President of the short-lived [[Republic of Negros]].

==Early life==
Lacson was the fifth son of seven children of Lucio Petronila Lacson and Clara Ledesma of Iloilo who migrated to [[Negros (island)|Negros]] when he was still young. His early education began under private tutelage in Molo, Iloilo. He later studied commerce at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal de Manila]], where his classmates included future general and comrade [[Juan Araneta]], [[José Rizal]], and other [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] who later figured in the [[Philippine Revolution]].

While a student in [[Manila]], he had the opportunity to meet the founder of the [[Katipunan]], [[Andrés Bonifacio]], with whom he had a secret [[Blood Compact|blood compact]]. He was the only Negrense who had this honor and consequently became a member of the revolutionary society.

==Family==
[[File:Alacsonwife.jpg|thumb|Rosario Araneta, first wife of Aniceto Lacson]]
Aniceto first married Rosario Araneta, a direct descendant of the [[Kabungsuan]] royal family of [[Mindanao]], daughter of Patricio Cabunsol Araneta and Leoncia Araneta, with whom he sired eleven children. They were: 
# Jesusa, the eldest, married Jose Maria Arroyo y Pidal, her second cousin. Jesusa and Jose are the grandparents of Atty. [[Jose Miguel Arroyo]],husband of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]];

Aniceto Miguel Distajo Lacson, Jacinto Distajo Lacson, and Ma. Asuncion Distajo Lacson who died at age 50 on Nov. 2, 2014.

# Consuelo, married Sebastian Corro.

==Properties==
When his father became bedridden, Lacson took charge of all the work in the [[hacienda]]s and did much to improve the properties. As a result, through his efforts his father became one of the richest men in Negros and the Philippines. When the time came to divide his father’s properties his other brothers chose the best haciendas. He, for his part, chose the uncultivated ones. Thus, he received more land from his father than his brothers. Through hard work, he improved all the land and turned it into one of the best producing haciendas in [[Negros Island|Negros]].

In the later 19th century, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] businessman by the name of Luchinger decided to sell his vast properties in Matabang, Talisay, which he earlier purchased from [[Nicholas Loney]], the biggest sugar cane producer in Negros at that time. It was offered to Aniceto Lacson, but he did not have enough ready cash. Luchinger was willing to sell it on installment but Aniceto’s father Lucio refused as the venture appeared risky. Aniceto negotiated with Luchinger to agree to sell it to him without guarantor. Knowing that Aniceto was hardworking, honest and followed through with his business commitments, Luchinger agreed.

His home in Talisay City, Negros Occidental is owned by his descendants the Claparols family.

==The Republic of Negros==
The Spanish Governor of Negros Island, Isidro Castro, surrendered to forces under Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta at Bacolod on 6 Nov. 1898.&lt;ref name=Foreman/&gt;{{rp|476}}  The Cantonal Republic of Negros was established with Aniceto Lacson as its President from November 27, 1898 until March 4, 1899 when the Negros revolutionaries surrendered to the [[United States of America|United States]] General [[James Francis Smith]]. The government lasted for three months and four days.

'''Asa Griggs Candler''' (December 30, 1851 – March 12, 1929) was an American business tycoon who owned the [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola Company]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  He also served as the 41st [[List of mayors of Atlanta|Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia]] from 1916 to 1919. Candler Field, the site of the present-day [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]], was named after him, as is [[Candler Park]] in Atlanta.

==  Biography  ==
Candler was born on December 30, 1851 in [[Villa Rica, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; His father was [[Samuel Charles Candler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bonner |first=James C. |year= |title=Georgia's Last Frontier: The Development of Caroll County |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiQQLTdjPv0C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Samuel+C.+Candler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ekxRDQsmq8&amp;sig=40C3YuOHEAfQt5Mgea8g6s1ezvE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kVtyUsfxGoOL0AWwsICoCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Samuel%20C.%20Candler&amp;f=false |accessdate=October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906 he completed Atlanta's then-tallest building, the [[Candler Building (Atlanta)|Candler Building]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-633 |title=Asa Candler (1851-1929) |accessdate=2009-01-16 |last=Kemp |first=Kathryn W. |date=2002-09-03 |work=New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgia Humanities Council |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113222959/http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-633 |archivedate=2007-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose intricately detailed 17 stories  still stands at Peachtree and Auburn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/atlanta/can.htm Candler Building&amp;mdash;Atlanta: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912 the [[Candler Building (New York)|Candler Building]] in [[New York (city)|New York]] opened.

Candler was elected mayor of Atlanta in 1916 (taking office in 1917) and ended his day-to-day management of the Coca-Cola Company. As mayor he balanced the city budget and coordinated rebuilding efforts after the [[Great Atlanta fire of 1917]] destroyed 1,500 homes. In 1919 he gave most of the stock in [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to his children, who later sold it to a group of investors led by [[Ernest Woodruff]]. In 1922 he donated over {{convert|50|acre|m2}} of his [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]] holdings to the City of Atlanta for what became [[Candler Park]].

Asa Candler suffered a [[stroke]] in 1926 and died on March 12, 1929 at [[Wesley Memorial Hospital]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=A.G.

==Legacy==
The [[Candler Field Museum]] in [[Williamson, Georgia]], has been established to commemorate the original "Candler Field" Atlanta airport.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peachstateaero.com/museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Candler Building" on the northeast corner of East Pratt Street and Market Place in eastern downtown [[Baltimore]], still retains his name. The brick industrial styled building faces the waterfront of the "Basin" (later the famed "[[Inner Harbor]]"), of the [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]] on the Northwest Branch of the [[Patapsco River]]. Used as a regional headquarters for the [[Coca-Cola|Coca-Cola Bottling Company]], the structure was known for having brass door knobs engraved with "CC" for the company.  Between the late 1930s and 1960, the building served as the national headquarters of the new [[Social Security Administration]], authorized under the "[[Social Security Act]]" of 1935, under the "[[New Deal]]" programs of the administration of 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

In 1960, the SSA moved to larger suburban campus in western [[Baltimore County]] at [[Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland|Woodlawn]], off the then under-construction "[[Baltimore Beltway]]" of [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Interstate 695]].

By the 2000s as the old waterfront area and municipal piers area were being redeveloped from commercial and industrial uses, the Candler Building was renovated for offices and some apartments/condos, with the nearby "[[Power Plant Live!]]" development of the [[Cordish Company|David Cordish Company]] (of famed national commercial developer [[David S. Cordish]]), from the old massive streetcar coal-burning power-generating plant from 1900, across the street, into an entertainment and retail destination and district, where the former old Centre Market (also known as "Marsh Market" for the ancient colonial Harrison's Marsh on the site), with its three neighboring buildings for wholesale fish, produce, and dry goods, the oldest of the city's eleven municipal market houses, since the 1760s.

Asa Candler was also a philanthropist, endowing numerous schools and universities as well as the [[Candler Hospital (Savannah)|Candler Hospital]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]].

==Mansions==
[[Callan Castle (Atlanta)|Callan Castle]], the Candler home in [[Inman Park]], built from 1902 to 1904, still stands as a private home.

His later mansion at 1500 Ponce de Leon Avenue, [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]], built in 1916 eventually became [[John Chrysostom]] [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnmelkite.org/candler.html |title=Candler Mansion |accessdate=2009-01-16 |publisher=St. John's Chrysostom Melkite Church |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114112615/http://www.stjohnmelkite.org/candler.html |archivedate=2007-11-14 |quote=Before all of this present and holy utilization of thi place, this [...] mansion [...] was formerly the home of Asa Candler }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
* Asa's eldest son, [[Charles Howard Candler]] (1878–1957), was chairman of the board of trustees of [[Emory University]]. His family estate was [[Callanwolde]] on [[Briarcliff Road]] in [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]], now a fine arts center.
* The second son, [[Asa G. Candler, Jr.]] (1880–1953), eccentric, alcoholic, and depressed, became a real-estate developer, opening the [[Briarcliff Hotel]]. His [[Briarcliff (mansion)|Briarcliff mansion and estate]]—also on Briarcliff Road in Druid Hills—was turned into an alcohol rehab center, then a psychiatric hospital, and is now Emory's Briarcliff campus. Asa Jr.'s menagerie of animals enabled a major expansion of [[Zoo Atlanta]] in the 1930s.
* Only daughter Lucy (1882–1962) became [[Lucy Beall Candler Owens Heinz Leide]]. Her husband, banker and [[Kiwanis]] president Henry Heinz was shot by a burglar in their mansion, [[Rainbow Terrace]], in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sXRZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v0gNAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lucy%20heinz%20candler&amp;pg=5171%2C2334872 "Husband of Coca Cola Heiress is Slain by Burglar", ''Paineseville Telegraph'', September 29, 1943]&lt;/ref&gt; though rumours persisted that a relative murdered him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bSAChoqpnHUC&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;ots=JuQfiWckab&amp;dq=lucy%20candler%20owens%20heinz&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q=lucy%20candler%20owens%20heinz&amp;f=false Mark Pendergrast, ''For God, country and Coca-Cola'', p.133]&lt;/ref&gt; She later married cellist and conductor [[Enrico Leide]], who founded a forerunner of the present [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]].
* Third son, Walter T. Candler (1885–1967), was a businessman, philanthropist, and horse sportsman. His [[Lullwater House]] is now the residence of the Emory President, a park, and land used for the [[Veterans Administration]] complex in Druid Hills. Walter T. Candler's daughter was Mary "Mo" Candler Edmonson. Walter T. Candler is survived by his granddaughter, (Mary Edmonson's daughter), Laura Edmonson Childers (1945–present), her son David Franklin Childers III (1969–present), and David Childers' children: David "Davis" Franklin Childers IV (February 22, 2001 – present) and Caroline Hayden Lund Shikarpuri (April 16, 1998 – present), (formerly Caroline Hayden Childers). Caroline Hayden Lund Shikarpuri is married to Ryan Ravinder Lund Shikarpuri (March 22, 1996 – present), son of Shan Shikarpuri &amp; Associates founder Roshan Lal Shikarpuri. Caroline and Davis are the grandchildren of Laura Childers, the great grandchildren of Mary Candler Edmonson, the great-great grandchildren of Walter T. Candler and the great-great-great grandchildren of Asa Griggs Candler.
* Youngest son, William Candler (1890 - 1936), was the local financier of the [[Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments]].

A '''business necessity''' is a legitimate [[business]] purpose that justifies an employment decision as effective and needed to optimally achieve the organization’s goals and ensure that operations run safely and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, W. F., &amp; Aguinis, H. (2010). Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management,  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often presented as a defense of an employment decision that is questioned because it was found to cause [[disparate impact]].

'''''Citizen Kane''''' is a 1941 American [[mystery film|mystery]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] by [[Orson Welles]], its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star. The picture was Welles's [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. Nominated for [[14th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] in nine categories, it won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film ever made]], ''Citizen Kane'' was voted as such in five consecutive [[British Film Institute]] ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls of critics, and it topped the [[American Film Institute]]'s  [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies]] list in 1998, as well as its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|2007 update]]. ''Citizen Kane'' is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, editing and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.

The [[film à clef|quasi-biographical film]] examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnates [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]], Chicago tycoons [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]], and aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the story is told through the research of a [[newsreel]] reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud".

After the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] successes of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]] and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast "[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]" on ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Unusually for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'']], collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.

While a critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as [[André Bazin]] and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.

In a mansion in [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]], a vast palatial estate in [[Florida]], the elderly [[Charles Foster Kane]] is on his deathbed. Holding a [[snow globe]], he utters a word, "Rosebud", and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A [[newsreel]] obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of "Rosebud".

Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach Susan Alexander Kane, now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.

In 1871, after a gold mine is discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he would be properly educated. It is also implied that Kane's father could be violent towards his son and that is another reason she wants to send him away. While Thatcher and Charles' parents discuss arrangements inside, the young Kane plays happily with a sled in the snow outside his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. Furious at the prospect of exile from his own family to live with a man he does not know, the boy strikes Thatcher with his sled and attempts to run away.

Years later, after gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the ''New York Inquirer'' and starts publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.

Back in the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the ''Inquirer''{{'}}s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the [[Spanish–American War]] and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.

Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a [[retirement home]]. Leland recalls how Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates more and more over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for [[Governor of New York]]. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the [[Political scandal|public scandal]] ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating [[opera]]tic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition.

Back in the present, Susan now consents to an interview with Thompson and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan leaves him, Kane begins violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says, "Rosebud".

Back at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain an enigma. As the film ends, the camera reveals that "Rosebud" is the trade name of the [[sled]] on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace.

[[File:Orson Welles Billboard.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Welles's 1938 radio broadcast of "[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]" caught the attention of [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]]]
Hollywood had shown interest in Welles as early as 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnston |first=Alva |last2=Smith |first2=Fred |date=February 3, 1940 |title=How to Raise a Child (part 3)  |url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/wp-content/flbk/How_to_Raise_a_Child_part_iii/#/1/ |journal=[[The Saturday Evening Post]] |pages=27, 28, 40, 45 |doi= |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}} He turned down three scripts sent to him by [[Warner Bros.]] In 1937, he declined offers from [[David O. Selznick]], who asked him to head his film company's story department, and [[William Wyler]], who wanted him for a supporting role in ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]''. "Although the possibility of making huge amounts of money in Hollywood greatly attracted him," wrote biographer Frank Brady, "he was still totally, hopelessly, insanely in love with the theater, and it is there that he had every intention of remaining to make his mark."&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Frank |authorlink=Frank Brady (writer) |title=Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York |date=1989 |isbn=0-385-26759-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|118–119, 130}}

Following "[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]" broadcast of his CBS radio series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was lured to Hollywood with a remarkable contract.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carringer |first=Robert L. |title=The Making of Citizen Kane |publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1985 |isbn=978-0-520-20567-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} [[RKO Pictures]] studio head [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George J. Schaefer]] wanted to work with Welles after the notorious broadcast, believing that Welles had a gift for attracting mass attention.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|170}} RKO was also uncharacteristically profitable and was entering into a series of independent production contracts that would add more artistically prestigious films to its roster.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} Throughout the spring and early summer of 1939, Schaefer constantly tried to lure the reluctant Welles to Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leaming |first=Barbara |title=Orson Welles, A Biography |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=New York |date=1985 |isbn=978-0-618-15446-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Welles was in financial trouble after failure of his plays ''[[Chimes at Midnight#Five Kings (1939)|Five Kings]]'' and ''[[The Green Goddess (play)|The Green Goddess]]''. At first he simply wanted to spend three months in Hollywood and earn enough money to pay his debts and fund his next theatrical season.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Welles first arrived on July 20, 1939&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|168|December 2014}} and on his first tour, he called the movie studio "the greatest electric train set a boy ever had".&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|174}}

Welles signed his contract with RKO on August 21. This legendary contract stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both project's stories&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|169|December 2014}} and so long as the budget did not exceed $500,000.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} RKO executives would not be allowed to see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|169|December 2014}} Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the [[final cut privilege|right of final cut]]. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|170|December 2014}} Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: "The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was going to pull off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself."&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}}

[[File:Orson-Home-1939.jpg|thumb|left|Orson Welles at his Hollywood home in 1939, during the long months it took to launch his first film project]]
Welles spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get his first project going, without success. "They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there," wrote ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|15}} It was agreed that Welles would film ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', previously adapted for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', which would be presented entirely through a [[Point of view shot|first-person camera]]. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera—unheard of at the time—the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget.{{efn|"I did a very elaborate production for [''Heart of Darkness''], such as I've never done again—never could," Welles said. "I shot my bolt on preproduction on that picture. We designed every camera setup and everything else—did enormous research in aboriginal, Stone Age cultures in order to reproduce what the story called for. I'm sorry not to have got the chance to do it."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|31}}}}{{efn|Welles later used the subjective camera in ''The Magnificent Ambersons'', in a sequence that was later all but eliminated because it did not work in that picture. "''Heart of Darkness'' is one of the few stories that it's very well adapted to, because it relies so heavily on narration," Welles said. "The camera was going to be Marlow&amp;nbsp;... He's in the pilot house and he can see himself reflected in the glass through which you see the jungle. So it isn't that business of a hand-held camera mooching around pretending to walk like a man."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|31}}}}&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|30–31}} Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; as war loomed, revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|215–216}}

He then started work on the idea that became ''Citizen Kane''. Knowing the script would take time to prepare, Welles suggested to RKO that while that was being done—"so the year wouldn't be lost"—he make a humorous political thriller. Welles proposed ''The Smiler with a Knife'', from a novel by [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|33–34}} When that project stalled in December 1939, Welles began brainstorming other story ideas with screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], who had been writing Mercury radio scripts. "Arguing, inventing, discarding, these two powerful, headstrong, dazzlingly articulate personalities thrashed toward ''Kane''", wrote biographer [[Richard Meryman]].&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|245–246}}

One of the long-standing controversies about ''Citizen Kane'' has been the authorship of the screenplay.&lt;ref name=Meryman&gt;{{cite book |last=Meryman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Meryman |title=Mank: The Wit, World and Life of Herman Mankiewicz |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]], Inc. |location=New York |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-688-03356-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|237}} Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for Welles's CBS Radio series, ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|16}} Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]], whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|231}}

In February 1940 Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of [[John Houseman]], Welles's former partner in the [[Mercury Theatre]]. Welles later explained, "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welles |first1=Orson |authorlink1=Orson Welles |last2=Bogdanovich |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Bogdanovich |last3=Rosenbaum |first3=Jonathan |authorlink3=Jonathan Rosenbaum |title=[[This is Orson Welles]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers |location=New York |date=1992 |isbn=0-06-016616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|54}} Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|54}}

The terms of the contract stated that Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work, as he was hired as a [[script doctor]].&lt;ref name="Callow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Callow |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Callow |title=Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu |publisher=[[Viking]] |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-670-86722-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|487}} Before he signed the contract Mankiewicz was particularly advised by his agents that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the "author and creator".&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|236–237}} As the film neared release, however, Mankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film—including threats to place full-page ads in trade papers and to get his friend [[Ben Hecht]] to write an exposé for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|204}}

''Citizen Kane'' was a rare film in that its principal roles were played by actors new to motion pictures.

"He trained us for films at the same time that he was training himself," recalled Agnes Moorehead. "Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors.

In the end of July, RKO approved the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming "tests" for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had been so good that there was no need to re-shoot them. The first official scene to be shot was the breakfast montage sequence between Kane and his first wife Emily. To strategically save money and appease the RKO executives who opposed him, Welles rehearsed scenes extensively before actually shooting and filmed very few takes of each shot set-up.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|193|December 2014}} Welles never shot [[master shot]]s for any scene after Toland told him that Ford never shot them.&lt;ref name="Lunches"/&gt;{{Rp|169}} To appease the increasingly curious press, Welles threw a cocktail party for selected reporters, promising that they could watch a scene being filmed. When the journalists arrived Welles told them they had "just finished" shooting for the day but still had the party.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|193|December 2014}} Welles told the press that he was ahead of schedule (without factoring in the month of "test shooting"), thus discrediting claims that after a year in Hollywood without making a film he was a failure in the film industry.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|194|December 2014}}

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Collins.jpg|thumb|right|Welles fell ten feet while shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at the departing Boss Jim W. Gettys; his injuries required him to direct from a wheelchair for two weeks.]]
Welles usually worked 16 to 18 hours a day on the film. He often began work at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's shooting with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|194|December 2014}} The injury required him to direct the film from a wheelchair for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|194–195|December 2014}} He eventually wore a steel brace to resume performing on camera; it is visible in the low-angle scene between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election.{{efn|"It took nerve to shoot from down there, with that steel brace right in front of the camera, but I thought rightly that at that point they'd be looking at Leland and not at me."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}}}}&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|61}} For the final scene, a stage at the Selznick studio was equipped with a working furnace, and multiple takes were required to show the sled being put into the fire and the word "Rosebud" consumed. Paul Stewart recalled that on the ninth take the Culver City Fire Department arrived in full gear because the furnace had grown so hot the flue caught fire. "Orson was delighted with the commotion", he said.&lt;ref name="Directors in Action"/&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}

When "Rosebud" was burned, Welles choreographed the scene while he had composer [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s cue playing on the set.&lt;ref name="alexross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Alex |date=June 27, 2005 |title=Sound and Vision: Glass's 'Koyaanisqatsi' and the art of film scoring |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/06/27/050627crmu_music |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the executives would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|195|December 2014}}

[[Principal photography|Principal shooting]] wrapped October 24. Welles then took several weeks off of the film for a lecture tour, during which he also scouted additional locations with Toland and Ferguson. Filming resumed November 15&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|87}} with some re-shoots. Toland had to leave due to a commitment to shoot Howard Hughes' ''[[The Outlaw]]'', but Toland's camera crew continued working on the film and Toland was replaced by RKO cinematographer [[Harry J. Wild]]. The final day of shooting on November 30 was Kane's death scene.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles boasted that he only went 21 days over his official shooting schedule, without factoring in the month of "camera tests."&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|195|December 2014}} According to RKO records, the film cost $839,727.

===Post-production===
''Citizen Kane'' was edited by [[Robert Wise]] and assistant editor [[Mark Robson]].&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the "camera tests" and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles "had an older editor assigned to him for those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." Wise and Robson began editing the film while it was still shooting and said that they "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out."&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1210}} Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|109}} The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]].&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film "in camera" by leaving few options of how it could be put together.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|110}} Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct "timing" and "rhythm" for the [[whip pan]]s and overlapping dialogue.&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; The ''News on the March'' sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|110}} They used [[stock footage]] from [[Pathé News]] and the General Film Library.&lt;ref name="AFIcat"/&gt;

During post-production Welles and special effects artist [[Linwood G. Dunn]] experimented with an [[optical printer]] to improve certain scenes that Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage.&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times until he was satisfied.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|109}}

Welles hired Bernard Herrmann to compose the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in as few as two or three weeks after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had sufficient time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.&lt;ref name="NYT Herrmann"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herrmann |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Herrmann |title=Score for a Film |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trailer===
{{Main|Citizen Kane trailer}}

Written and directed by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the [[theatrical trailer]] for ''Citizen Kane'' differs from other trailers in that it did not feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, [[tongue-in-cheek]], [[mockumentary|pseudo-documentary]] piece on the film's production.&lt;ref name="Lunches"/&gt;{{Rp|230}} Filmed at the same time as ''Citizen Kane'' itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|360}} The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of [[Everett Sloane]] appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.&lt;ref name="Aus DVD trailer"&gt;{{cite AV media|title= Citizen Kane (Theatrical Trailer)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]]|date=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was almost unprecedented for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while ''Citizen Kane'' is frequently cited as a groundbreaking, influential film, [[Simon Callow]] argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has "great playful charm&amp;nbsp;... it is a miniature [[documentary]], almost an introduction to the cinema&amp;nbsp;... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: Without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [sic] minutes' duration."&lt;ref name="Callow"/&gt;{{Rp|558–9}}

==Style==
Film scholars and historians view ''Citizen Kane'' as Welles's attempt to create a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of it and combining them into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started working on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful."&lt;ref name="Estrin"/&gt;{{Rp|80}}

[[David Bordwell]] wrote that "The best way to understand ''Citizen Kane'' is to stop worshiping it as a triumph of technique." Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, and that many of these stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''. But Bordwell asserts that the film did put them all together for the first time and perfected the medium in one single film.&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1171}} In a 1948 interview, [[D. W. Griffith]] said, "I loved ''Citizen Kane'' and particularly loved the ideas he took from me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=Ezra |title=Flash-Back to Griffith |publisher=''PM'' |date=May 19, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against the film's cinematic innovations were made as early as 1946 when French historian [[Georges Sadoul]] wrote, "The film is an encyclopedia of old techniques." He pointed out such examples as compositions that used both the foreground and the background in the films of [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], special effects used in the films of [[Georges Méliès]], shots of the ceiling in [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' and newsreel montages in the films of [[Dziga Vertov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sadoul |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Sadoul |title=Le Cinéma: Hypertrophie ducerveau ̄ Review of ''Citizen Kane'' |publisher=[[Les Lettres Françaises]], number 115 |location=Paris, France |date=July 5, 1946 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French film critic André Bazin defended the film, writing: "In this respect, the accusation of plagiarism could very well be extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide." Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since ''Citizen Kane'' used more sophisticated lenses,&lt;ref name=BazinatWork&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bazin |first1=André |last2=Cardullo |first2=Bert (editor) |authorlink1=André Bazin |title=Bazin at Work: Major Essays &amp; Reviews From the Forties &amp; Fifties |publisher=Rutledge |location=New York &amp; London |date=1997 |isbn= 978-0-415-90018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|232}} but acknowledged that it had similarities to such previous works as ''[[49th Parallel (film)|The 49th Parallel]]'' and ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Bazin stated that "even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in ''Citizen Kane'', one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their ''meaning''."&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|233}} Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believed that the film's use of special effects contradicted some of Bazin's theories.&lt;ref name="Minding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |last2=Thompson |first2=Kristin |title=Minding Movies.

===Storytelling techniques===
''Citizen Kane'' eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the [[unreliable narrator]] in literature.&lt;ref name="watched"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fabe |first=Marilyn |title=Closely Watched Films: an introduction to the art of narrative film technique |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-23891-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|83}} Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|81}} Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gianos |first=Phillip |title=Politics and politicians in American film |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-275-96766-6 |pages=170–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|82–84}}

The technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films—most notably in ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933)&lt;ref name="Robbin Coons"&gt;{{cite news |last=Coons |first=Robbin |date=May 1, 1941 |title=Hollywood Sights and Sounds |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19410501&amp;id=yOIcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3353,2902994 |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |location=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but no film was as immersed in this technique as ''Citizen Kane''. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.&lt;ref name="politics"/&gt;

At that time films typically had an "omniscient perspective", which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the "illusion that we are looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze, Hollywood movies give us a feeling of power." The film begins in this fashion up until the ''News on the March'' sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|81}} The ''News on the March'' sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) at the beginning of the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what "Rosebud" means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what "Rosebud" is.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|82–83}}

The most innovative technical aspect of ''Citizen Kane'' is the extended use of [[deep focus]].&lt;ref name="Ogle"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ogle |first1=Patrick L. |last2=Nichols |first2=Bill |authorlink2=Bill Nichols |title=Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States |publisher=[[University of California]] Press |date=1985 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. Cinematographer Toland did this through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Toland described the achievement, made possible by the sensitivity of modern speed film, in an article for ''[[Theatre Arts (magazine)|Theatre Arts]]'' magazine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New developments in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced stage of the game but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed "Pan-focus", as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in ''Citizen Kane''. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.&lt;ref name="Wellesnet Toland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 |last=Toland |first=Gregg |authorlink=Gregg Toland |title=The Motion Picture Cameraman |publisher=''Theatre Arts'', Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource |date=September 1941 |accessdate=September 21, 2013 |pages=646–654}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way [[low-angle shot]]s were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Breaking with studio convention, every set was built with a ceiling&lt;ref name="Wellesnet Toland"/&gt;—many constructed of fabric that ingeniously concealed microphones.&lt;ref name="Ebert Viewer's Companion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/a-viewers-companion-to-citizen-kane |title=A Viewer's Companion to Citizen Kane |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=January 1, 2004 |website=Roger Ebert's Journal |accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles felt that the camera should show what the eyes see, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend there was no ceiling—"a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there," he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}}

Welles credited Toland on the same [[title card]] as himself and said "It's impossible to say how much I owe to Gregg. He was superb."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|59}}{{efn|Speaking of the credit given Toland, Welles said, "Nobody in those days—only the stars, the director, and the producer—got separate cards.

===Sound===
''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s sound was recorded by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer [[James G. Stewart]],&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} both of whom had worked in radio.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|102}} Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles "deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it."&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; Although the film is known for its complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|102}}

Welles used techniques from radio like overlapping dialogue. The scene in which characters sing "Oh, Mr. Kane" was especially complicated and required mixing several soundtracks together.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|104}} He also used different "sound perspectives" to create the illusion of distances,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|101}} such as in scenes at Xanadu where characters speak to each other at far distances.&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; Welles experimented with sound in post-production, creating audio montages,&lt;ref name="Schatz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schatz |first1=Thomas |last2=Harpole |first2=Charles (editor) |title=History of the American Cinema, volume 6: Boom and bust, the American cinema in the 1940s |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London |date=1997 |isbn=0-520-22130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|94}} and chose to create all of the sound effects for the film instead of using RKO's library of sound effects.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|100}}

Welles used an aural technique from radio called the "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex [[film editing|montage]] sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into a young man in just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |title=A History of Narrative Film |publisher=[[W.

Film critic and director [[François Truffaut]] wrote that "Before ''Kane'', nobody in Hollywood knew how to set music properly in movies. ''Kane'' was the first, in fact the only, great film that uses radio techniques.&amp;nbsp;...

The make-up for ''Citizen Kane'' was created and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior member of the RKO make-up department.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, escaping persecution.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Dick  |authorlink=Dick Smith (make-up artist) |date=October–November 1999 |title=Citizen Seiderman |url=http://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=211197&amp;p=18# |journal=Make-Up Artist Magazine | issue=21 |pages=18–25 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|18}} As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]],&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;{{Rp|157}} where his father was a wigmaker and make-up artist.&lt;ref name="Gambill"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gambill |first=Norman |date=November–December 1978 |title=Making Up Kane |journal=[[Film Comment]] |volume= 14| issue = 6 |pages=42–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|42}} In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|18}} He worked on [[Max Reinhardt]]'s 1924 production of ''[[The Miracle (play)|The Miracle]]'' and with the [[Yiddish Art Theatre]],&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;{{Rp|157}} and he studied the human figure at the [[Art Students League of New York]].&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|42}} After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by [[Max Factor, Sr.|Max Factor]] and then by RKO.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}}

"Apprentices were not supposed to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present," wrote make-up artist [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]], who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. "During his years at RKO I suspect these rules were probably overlooked often."&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} By 1940 Seiderman's uncredited film work included ''[[Winterset (film)|Winterset]]'', ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1940 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' and ''[[Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)|Abe Lincoln in Illinois]]''.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}} "Seiderman had gained a reputation as one of the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood," wrote biographer Frank Brady.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|253}}

On an early tour of RKO, Welles met Seiderman in the small make-up lab he created for himself in an unused dressing room.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} "Welles fastened on to him at once," wrote biographer Charles Higham. "With his great knowledge of makeup—indeed, his obsession with it, for he hated his flat nose—Welles was fascinated&amp;nbsp;... Seiderman had an intimate knowledge of anatomy and the process of aging and was acquainted with every line, wrinkle and accretion of fat in aging men and women. Impatient with most makeup methods of his era, he used casts of his subjects in order to develop makeup methods that ensured complete naturalness of expression—a naturalness unrivaled in Hollywood."&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;{{Rp|157}}

"When ''Kane'' came out in script form, Orson told all of us about the picture and said that the most important aspect was the makeup," Seiderman recalled. "I felt that I was being given an assignment that was unique—so I worked accordingly. And there was a lot of work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman developed a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster cast of the face of each of the actors who aged, except Joseph Cotten who was unavailable at that time. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

"My sculptural techniques for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, onto the surface of each bust," Seiderman told visual arts historian Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect he cast the clay pieces in a soft plastic material&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}} that he formulated himself.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|20}} These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46–47}}

Before the actors went before the cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied directly to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}} The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound;&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|43}} Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, "I am acting the part of a nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." Seiderman replied, "You'd be surprised at what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?"&lt;ref name=Cotten&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotten |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Cotten |title=Vanity Will Get You Somewhere |publisher=[[Mercury House (publishers)|Mercury House]] |location=San Francisco, CA |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-916515-17-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|43}}

The red ground resulted in a warmth of tone that was picked up by the sensitive [[panchromatic film]]. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless translucent talcum.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|42–43}} Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|42, 47}}

Welles was just as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|69}} Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest incarnation of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} "In the film and production photographs, you can see that Kane had a belly that overhung," Seiderman said. "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman worked with Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a flexible skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When he found the wigs too full he untied one hair at a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|43, 47}}

Seiderman made [[scleral lens]]es for Welles, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris and Everett Sloane, to dull the brightness of their young eyes. The lenses took a long time to fit properly, and Seiderman began work on them before devising any of the other makeup. "I painted them to age in phases, ending with the blood vessels and the ''Aurora Senilis'' of old age."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|47}}{{efn|Seiderman's work with contact lenses in films led to a medical formula for soft [[contact lenses]] that he developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maurice Seiderman, 82, Inventor and Hollywood Makeup Artist |publisher=''The New York Times'' |location=New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/obituaries/maurice-seiderman-82-inventor-and-hollywood-makeup-artist.html |date=July 22, 1989 |accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Cotten was the only principal for whom I had not made any sculptural casts, wigs or lenses," Seiderman said. When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|47–48}} and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.&lt;ref name=Cotten/&gt;{{Rp|44–45}}

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|right|Kane ages convincingly in the breakfast montage, make-up artist Maurice Seiderman's tour de force.]]
Seiderman's tour de force, the breakfast montage, was shot all in one day. "Twelve years, two years shot at each scene," he said. "Please realize, by the way, that a two-year jump in age is a bit harder to accomplish visually than one of 20 years."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|47}}

As they did with art direction, the major studios gave screen credit for make-up to only the department head. When RKO make-up department head [[Mel Berns]] refused to share credit with Seiderman, who was only an apprentice, Welles told Berns that there would be no make-up credit. Welles signed a large advertisement in the Los Angeles newspaper:&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO GETS SCREEN CREDIT FOR "CITIZEN KANE"&lt;br&gt;AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO DON'T&lt;br&gt;TO ALL THE ACTORS, THE CREW, THE OFFICE, THE MUSICIANS, EVERYBODY&lt;br&gt;AND PARTICULARLY TO MAURICE SEIDERMAN, THE BEST MAKE-UP MAN IN THE WORLD&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|20}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"To put this event in context, remember that I was a very low man," Seiderman recalled. "I wasn't even called a make-up man. I had started their laboratory and developed their plastic appliances for make-up. But my salary was $25 a week. And I had no union card."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}}

Seiderman told Gambill that after ''Citizen Kane'' was released, Welles was invited to a White House dinner where [[Frances Perkins]] was among the guests. Welles told her about the Russian immigrant who did the make-up for his film but could not join the union. Seiderman said the head of the union received a call from the Labor Department the next day, and in November 1941 he was a full union member.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}}{{efn|After becoming head of the RKO make-up department, Seiderman left in 1946 to help recreate faces for disfigured U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Bob |date=January 31, 1946 |title=Hollywood News |newspaper=[[Laredo Morning Times|The Laredo Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sets===
Although credited as an assistant, the film's art direction was done by [[Perry Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|37}} In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a [[periscope]] in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design was an integral part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|42}}

In the original script the Great Hall at Xanadu was modeled after the Great Hall in Hearst Castle and its design included a mixture of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|50–51}} "The Hearstian element is brought out in the almost perverse juxtaposition of incongruous architectural styles and motifs," wrote Carringer.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|54}} Before RKO cut the film's budget, Ferguson's designs were more elaborate and resembled the production designs of early [[Cecil B. DeMille]] films and ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|55}} The budget cuts reduced Ferguson's budget by 33 percent and his work cost $58,775 total,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|65}} which was below average at that time.&lt;ref name="Schatz"/&gt;{{Rp|93}} To save costs Ferguson and Welles re-wrote scenes in Xanadu's living room and transported them to the Great Hall. A large staircase from another film was found and used at no additional cost.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|56–57}} When asked about the limited budget, Ferguson said "Very often—as in that much-discussed 'Xanadu' set in ''Citizen Kane''—we can make a foreground piece, a background piece, and imaginative lighting suggest a great deal more on the screen than actually exists on the stage."&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|65–66}} According to the film's official budget there were 81 sets built, but Ferguson said there were between 106 and 116.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|64}}

Still photographs of [[Oheka Castle]] in [[Huntington, New York]], were used in the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oheka.com/film-photo-shoots.htm |title=Oheka Castle&amp;nbsp;– Film, Television and Photography Productions |publisher=Oheka.com |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/06/nyregion/c-corrections-910389.html |title=Corrections |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=April 6, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek]] to [[Gothic art|German Gothic]].&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|61}} The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of [[muslin]] fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|64–65}} Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|65}}

===Special effects===
The film's special effects were supervised by RKO department head [[Vernon L. Walker]].&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene in which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera [[Crane shot|craning]] upwards over the performance scene, then a [[wipe (transition)|curtain wipe]] to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=François |last2=Naremore |first2=James (Editor) |title=Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK and New York |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&amp;pg=PA173 |isbn=978-0-19-515891-5 |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shots included [[Rear projection effect|rear screen projection]] in the background, such as Thompson's interview of Leland and some of the ocean backgrounds at Xanadu.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|88}} Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used rear screen projection to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography.&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|74}} A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the [[Close-up#Types of close-up|extreme close-up]] shots such as Kane's lips when he says "Rosebud" and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|88}}

Optical effects artist Dunn claimed that "up to 80 percent of some reels was optically printed." These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jewell |first=Richard B. |title=The Golden Age of Cinema. Hollywood 1929–1945 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |date=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-6373-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|110}} The optical printer improved some of the deep focus shots.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|92}} One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive [[graininess]], such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|94}} Toland said that he disliked the results of the optical printer,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|92}} but acknowledged that "RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production—a by no means inconsiderable assignment—with ability and fine understanding."&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|74–75}}

Any time deep focus was impossible—as in the scene in which Kane finishes a negative review of Susan's opera while at the same time firing the person who began writing the review—an [[optical printer]] was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|92}} However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of [[in-camera effect]]s, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|82}}

===Music===
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Showgirls.jpg|thumb|right|Incidental music includes the publisher's theme, "Oh, Mr. Kane", a tune by [[Pepe Guízar]] with special lyrics by Herman Ruby.]]
The [[Film score|film's music]] was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref name="stephensmith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Steven C. |title=A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, California |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-520-22939-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|72}} Herrmann had composed for Welles for his Mercury Theatre radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|63}} Because it was Herrmann's first motion picture score, RKO wanted to pay him only a small fee, but Welles insisted he be paid at the same rate as [[Max Steiner]].&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|72}}

The score established Herrmann as an important new composer of film soundtracks&lt;ref name="americancomposers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_herrmann.htm |title=American Composers Orchestra&amp;nbsp;– David Raksin remembers his colleagues |publisher=Americancomposers.org |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|77–78}} The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/CitizenKanefilmscore.htm |title=70th anniversary of Citizen Kane and Bernard Herrmann's film score |accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/citi4.html |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Citizen Kane, page 4 |publisher=filmsite.org |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring [[leitmotiv]] played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of [[alto flute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmscorerundowns.net/herrmann/citizenkane.pdf |last=Wrobel |first=Bill |title=Herrmann's "Citizen Kane" |format=PDF |date=November 4, 2001  | accessdate=July 31, 2013|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a [[Mary Garden]] vehicle, an aria from ''[[Salammbô]]''.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|57}} "Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown," Herrmann said.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|79}} Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera,&lt;ref name="NYT Herrmann"/&gt; Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|79–80}} Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore.&lt;ref name="americancomposers"/&gt; Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on [[Jean Racine]]'s ''[[Athalie]]'' and ''[[Phedre]]'',&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|460–461}} although some confusion remains since [[Lucille Fletcher]] remembered preparing the lyrics.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|80}} Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera ''[[Wuthering Heights (Herrmann)|Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|11}}

Music enthusiasts consider the scene in which Susan Alexander Kane attempts to sing the famous cavatina "Una voce poco fa" from ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]] with vocal coach Signor Matiste as especially memorable for depicting the horrors of learning music through mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concertonet.com/scripts/review.php?ID_review=2748 |last=Kirshnit |first=Frederick L. |title=Champagne and Pomade |publisher=ConcertoNet.com |location=Paris, France |date=December 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Herrmann said, "I was fortunate to start my career with a film like ''Citizen Kane'', it's been a downhill run ever since!" Welles loved Herrmann's score and told director [[Henry Jaglom]] that it was 50 percent responsible for the film's artistic success.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|84}}

Some incidental music came from other sources. Welles heard the tune used for the publisher's theme, "Oh, Mr. Kane", in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|57}} Called "A Poco No", the song was written by [[Pepe Guízar]] and special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby.&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folk.uib.no/smkgg/midi/soundtrackweb/herrmann/db/cuesheets/film_citizenkane.html |title=Cue Sheet: Citizen Kane |date=April 22, 1941 |publisher=The Bernard Herrmann Society |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a Mizz", a 1939 jazz song by [[Charlie Barnet]] and Haven Johnson, bookends Thompson's second interview of Susan Alexander Kane.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|108}}&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cues"/&gt; "I kind of based the whole scene around that song," Welles said. "The music is by [[Nat King Cole|Nat Cole]]—it's his trio."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|56}} Later—beginning with the lyrics, "It can't be love"—"In a Mizz" is performed at the Everglades picnic, framing the fight in the tent between Susan and Kane.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|108}} Musicians including bandleader [[Cee Pee Johnson]] (drums), Alton Redd (vocals), Raymond Tate (trumpet), [[Buddy Collette]] (alto sax) and [[Buddy Banks (saxophonist)|Buddy Banks]] (tenor sax) are featured.&lt;ref name="Meeker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.jots.200014490/default.html |title=Jazz on the Screen: A jazz and blues filmography by David Meeker |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the music used in the newsreel came from the RKO music library, edited at Welles's request by the newsreel department to achieve what Herrmann called "their own crazy way of cutting". The ''News on the March'' theme that accompanies the newsreel titles is "Belgian March" by [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]], from the film ''[[Nurse Edith Cavell]]''. Other examples are an excerpt from [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s score for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (the exploration of Xanadu), [[Roy Webb]]'s theme for the film ''[[Reno (1939 film)|Reno]]'' (the growth of Kane's empire), and bits of Webb's score for ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (introducing Walter Parks Thatcher).&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|79}}&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cues"/&gt;

===Editing===
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Warrick-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|right|Orson Welles and Ruth Warrick in the breakfast montage]]
One of the editing techniques used in ''Citizen Kane'' was the use of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Costanzo Cahir |first=Linda |title=Literature into film: theory and practical approaches |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7864-2597-6 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene "was stolen from ''[[The Long Christmas Dinner]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]]&amp;nbsp;... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|51|date=June 2012}} The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|90–91}}

Welles was influenced by the editing theories of [[Sergei Eisenstein]] by using jarring cuts that caused "sudden graphic or associative contrasts", such as the cut from Kane's deathbed to the beginning of the ''News on the March'' sequence and a sudden shot of a shrieking bird at the beginning of Raymond's flashback.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|88–89}} Although the film typically favors mise-en-scène over montage, the scene in which Kane goes to Susan Alexander's apartment after first meeting her is the only one that is primarily cut as close-ups with shots and counter shots between Kane and Susan.&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|68}} Fabe says that "by using a standard Hollywood technique sparingly, [Welles] revitalizes its psychological expressiveness."&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|88}}

===Political themes===
In her 1992 monograph for the [[British Film Institute]], critic Laura Mulvey explored the anti-fascist themes of ''Citizen Kane''. The ''News on the March'' newsreel presents Kane keeping company with Hitler and other dictators while he smugly assures the public there will be no war.&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |date=2006 |title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career |url= |location=Lexington, Kentucky |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |isbn=0-8131-2410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Mulvey wrote that the film reflects "the battle between intervention and isolationism" then being waged in the United States; the film was released six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, while President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was laboring to win public opinion for entering World War II. "Not only was the war in Europe the burning public issue of the time," Mulvey wrote, "it was of passionate personal importance to Orson Welles&amp;nbsp;... In the rhetoric of ''Citizen Kane'', the destiny of isolationism is realised in metaphor: in Kane's own fate, dying wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history."&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|15}}

Journalist [[Ignacio Ramonet]] has cited the film as an early example of [[mass media]] [[Crowd manipulation|manipulation]] of [[public opinion]] and the power that [[media conglomerate]]s have on influencing the democratic process. Ramonet believes that this early example of a media mogul influencing politics is outdated and that "today Citizen Kane would be a dwarf. He owned a few papers in one country. The forces that dominate today have integrated image with text and sound and the world is their market.

==Reception==
===Pre-release controversy===
To ensure that Hearst's life's influence on ''Citizen Kane'' was a secret, Welles limited access to [[dailies]] and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in ''Stage'' magazine compared the film's narrative to ''[[Faust]]'' and made no mention of Hearst.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111}}

The film was scheduled to premiere at RKO's flagship theater [[Radio City Music Hall]] on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}} Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} for such magazines as ''Life'', ''Look'' and ''Redbook''. Gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] (and Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers Louella Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a "vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man" and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}} ''Friday'' magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was so nice to him and that she should "wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss." Welles immediately denied making the statement and the editor of ''Friday'' admitted that it might be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}}

[[File:Louella-Parsons-1937.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Film columnist and Hearst employee [[Louella Parsons]] was humiliated by ''Citizen Kane'' and made numerous threats to prevent the film's release.]]
Shortly after ''Friday''{{'}}s article, Hearst sent Parsons an angry letter complaining that he had learned about ''Citizen Kane'' from Hopper and not her. The incident made a fool of Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film.&lt;ref name="Directors in Action"/&gt;{{Rp|11}} Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released ''Kane''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they not screen it.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} The next day, the front page headline in ''Daily Variety'' read, "HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS."&lt;ref name="dailyvariety"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hearst Bans RKO From Papers |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' |date=January 10, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst began this ban by suppressing promotion of RKO's ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'',&lt;ref name="Schatz"/&gt;{{Rp|94}} but in two weeks the ban was lifted for everything except ''Kane.''&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}}

When Schaefer did not submit to Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats on behalf of Hearst to expose the private lives of people throughout the entire film industry.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} Welles was threatened with an exposé about his romance with the married actress [[Dolores del Rio]], who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|207|December 2014}} In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst.

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve ''Kane''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|209|December 2014}} Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by [[Nicholas Schenck]], head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s parent company, with an offer on the behalf of [[Louis B.

Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|112|date=April 2012}} There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|112–113|date=April 2012}} Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|113|date=April 2012}}

===Hearst's response===
Hearing about ''Citizen Kane'' enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists [[libel]] Welles.&lt;ref name="thomson2001"/&gt; Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.&lt;ref name="thomson2001"/&gt; A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1 million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A ''Hollywood Review'' headline read, "Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture". The ''Motion Picture Herald'' reported about the screening and Hearst's intention to sue RKO. ''Time'' magazine wrote that "The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people who have seen the film at private screenings, ''Citizen Kane'' is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry." A second press screening occurred in April.&lt;ref name="Schatz"/&gt;{{Rp|94}}

When Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire.&lt;ref name="Street, Sarah 1996"&gt;{{cite news |last=Street |first=Sarah |title=Citizen Kane |publisher=''History Today'' |date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscar-nominated documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' lays the blame for the film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.&lt;ref name="Nasaw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasaw |first=David |authorlink=David Nasaw |title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston,MA |date=2000 |isbn=0-395-82759-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|572–573|date=April 2012}}

Hearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film. Welles said that while he was on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not to go back to his hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. "But that wasn't Hearst," Welles said, "that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|85–86}}

In March 1941 Welles directed a Broadway version of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Native Son]]'' (and, for luck, used a "Rosebud" sled as a prop). ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' received positive reviews, but Hearst-owned papers used the opportunity to attack Welles as a communist.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|213|December 2014}} The Hearst papers vociferously attacked Welles after his April 1941 radio play, "His Honor, the Mayor",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/otr_freecompany |title=His Honor, the Mayor |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced for The Free Company radio series on CBS.&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Bret  |authorlink=Bret Wood |title=Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |date=1990 |isbn=0-313-26538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113}}&lt;ref name="Wellesnet His Honor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=186 |title=Orson Welles defends American civil liberties in His Honor the Mayor |publisher=Wellesnet.com |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welles described his chance encounter with Hearst in an elevator at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] on the night ''Citizen Kane'' opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would like to come to the opening. Hearst did not respond. "As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled Welles. "And Kane would have you know. That was his style—just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|49–50}}

In 1945 Hearst journalist Robert Shaw wrote that the film got "a full tide of insensate fury" from Hearst papers, "then it ebbed suddenly. With one brain cell working, the chief realized that such hysterical barking by the trained seals would attract too much attention to the picture. But to this day the name of Orson Welles is on the official son-of-a-bitch list of every Hearst newspaper."&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Jerry |title=The Complete History of American Film Criticism |publisher=Santa Monica Press LLC |location=Santa Monica, CA |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-59580-049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|102}}

Despite Hearst's attempts to destroy the film, since 1941 references to his life and career have usually included a reference to ''Citizen Kane'', such as the headline 'Son of Citizen Kane Dies' for the obituary of Hearst's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |title=Raising 'Kane' With Hearst : An 'American Experience' Recounts the Attempts of the Publishing Magnate to Quash a Film Masterpiece |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |location=Los Angeles, CA |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-28/news/tv-29475_1_citizen-kane |date=January 28, 1996 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Hearst estate agreed to screen the film at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, breaking Hearst's ban on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chawkins |first=Steve |title=Family 'Citizen Kane' gets inside the castle |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |location=Los Angeles, CA |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/23/local/la-me-citizen-kane-20120123 |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
[[Radio City Music Hall]]'s management refused to screen ''Citizen Kane'' for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that ''[[The American Weekly]]'' would run a defamatory story on the grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|115|date=April 2012}} Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|216|December 2014}} In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit if they did not release the film.

Schaefer managed to book a few theaters willing to show the film.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't do things by halves.&amp;nbsp;... Upon the screen he discovered an area large enough for his expansive whims to have free play.

It was widely believed the film would win most of its Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz. ''Variety'' reported that block voting by screen extras deprived ''Citizen Kane'' of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|117}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=March 4, 1942 |title=Extras Scuttled Welles |url=https://archive.org/stream/variety145-1942-03#page/n3/mode/1up |magazine=Variety |location= |publisher= |access-date=February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Citizen Kane'' was the only film made under Welles's original contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|223}} Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse. In July 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/jack-moss-the-man-who-ruined-welles/ |title=Jack Moss: The Man Who Ruined Welles? |last=Wilson |first=Jeff  |date=November 29, 2006 |website=Wellesnet |publisher= |access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/orson-welless-the-magnificent-ambersons-turns-70-triumph-or-tragedy/ |title=The Memos—Orson Welles' ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' turns 70: Triumph or Tragedy? |last=French |first=Lawrence  |date=March 2, 2012 |website=Wellesnet |access-date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles reluctantly signed a new and less favorable deal with RKO&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|223}} under which he produced and directed ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942), produced ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey into Fear]]'' (1943), and began ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'', a film he agreed to do without payment.

===Release in Europe===
During [[World War II]], ''Citizen Kane'' was not seen in most European countries.

[[André Bazin]], a little-known film critic working for Sartre's ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', was asked to give an [[Impromptu speaking|impromptu speech]] about the film after a screening at the Colisée Theatre in the autumn of 1946&lt;ref name=Truffaut/&gt;{{Rp|36}} and changed the opinion of much of the audience. This speech led to Bazin's 1947 article "The Technique of Citizen Kane",&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|125}} which directly influenced public opinion about the film.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|124}} Carringer wrote that Bazin was "the one who did the most to enhance the film's reputation."&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|118}}{{efn|Bordwell has hypothesized that Bazin was influenced by publicity about the film's innovations that were published in France during its first release. These included interviews by Welles and the publication of Toland's article "The Motion Picture Cameraman" in the January 1947 issue of ''La Revue du Cinéma''. Bordwell believes that Bazin was aware of the legend of film's innovations before having seen it.&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|72–73}}}} Both Bazin's critique of the film and his theories about cinema itself centered around his strong belief in [[mise en scène]]. These theories were diametrically opposed to both the popular [[Soviet montage theory]]&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|xiii}} and the politically [[Marxist]] and anti-Hollywood beliefs of most French film critics at that time.&lt;ref name=Truffaut/&gt;{{Rp|36}} Bazin believed that a film should depict reality without the filmmaker imposing their "will" on the spectator, which the Soviet theory supported.&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|xiii}} Bazin wrote that ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s mise en scène created a "new conception of filmmaking"&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|233}} and that the freedom given to the audience from the deep focus shots was innovative by changing the entire concept of the cinematic image.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|128}} Bazin wrote extensively about the mise en scène in the scene where Susan Alexander attempts suicide, which was one long take while other films would have used four or five shots in the scene.&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|234}} Bazin wrote that the film's mise en scène "forces the spectator to participate in the meaning of the film"  and creates "a psychological realism which brings the spectator back to the real conditions of perception."&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|72}}

In his 1950 essay "The Evolution of the Language of Cinema", Bazin placed ''Citizen Kane'' center stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.&lt;ref name=WIC&gt;{{cite book |last=Bazin |first=André |author-link=André Bazin |translator-last=Gray |translator-first=Hugh |orig-year=1950 |chapter=The Evolution of the Language of Cinema |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1#page/n32/mode/1up |title=What is Cinema? |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |publication-date=1967 |pages=23–40 |isbn=978-0-520-24227-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|37}} One of the first critics to defend motion pictures as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film as an example of cinema as an art form&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|129}} and wrote that "Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have."&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|236}} Bazin also compared the film to [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Paisà]]'' for having "the same aesthetic concept of realism"&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|117–118}} and to the films of [[William Wyler]] shot by Toland (such as ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' and ''The Best Years of Our Lives''), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called "a dialectical step forward in film language."&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|71}}

Bazin's praise of the film went beyond film theory and reflected his own philosophy towards life itself.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|125}} His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|128}} Bazin believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning. It portrayed the world as ambiguous and full of contradictions, whereas films up until then simply portrayed people's actions and motivations.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|130}} Bazin's biographer [[Dudley Andrew]] wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world of ''Citizen Kane'', that mysterious, dark, and infinitely deep world of space and memory where voices trail off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|129}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bazin went on to co-found ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', whose contributors (including future film directors François Truffaut and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]) also praised the film.&lt;ref name=WIC/&gt;{{Rp|37}} The popularity of Truffaut's [[auteur theory]] helped the film's and Welles's reputation.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |authorlink1=David Bordwell |last2=Thompson |first2=Kristin |authorlink2=Kristin Thompson |title=Film History: An Introduction |publisher=McGraw-Hill inc. |location=New York |date=1994 |isbn=978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|263}}

===Re-evaluation===
By 1942 ''Citizen Kane'' had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, ''The Film Till Now'', dismissed ''Citizen Kane'' as "...&amp;nbsp;tinpot if not crackpot [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]."&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|117–118|date=April 2012}}

In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year ''Citizen Kane'' started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played ''[[King Lear]]''; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote "Citizen Kane: The American Baroque" for ''[[Film Culture]]'', and described it as "the great American film" and "the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since ''[[Birth of a Nation]]''."&lt;ref name="Sarris"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarris |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sarris |title=Citizen Kane: The American Baroque |publisher=''[[Film Culture]]'', number 9 |year=1956 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|119}}

During [[Expo 58]], a poll of over 100 film historians named ''Kane'' one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news |last1=Newman |first1=Kim |authorlink1=Kim Newman |last2=Freer |first2=Ian |authorlink2=Ian Freer |last3=Fraser |first3=Rob |title=Citizen Kane |publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' |date=July 2003 |accessdate= |pages=146–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|152}}

In the decades since, its critical status as [[films that have been considered the greatest ever|the greatest film ever made]] has grown, with numerous essays and books on it including Peter Cowie's ''The Cinema of Orson Welles'', Ronald Gottesman's ''Focus on Citizen Kane'', a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, "Raising Kane", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|120|date=April 2012}} Despite its criticism of Welles, it further popularized the notion of ''Citizen Kane'' as the great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|119|date=April 2012}} David Thomson said that the film 'grows with every year as America comes to resemble it."&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1172}}

The cinematography influenced [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Cinematographer [[Arthur Edeson]] used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that ''Citizen Kane'' did. Edeson and Toland are often credited together for revolutionizing cinematography in 1941.&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt;{{Rp|48–50}} Toland's cinematography influenced his own work on ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''. Other films influenced include ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'', ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' and ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|85–86}} Cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]] said that his use of deep focus was influenced by "the camera work of Gregg Toland in ''Citizen Kane''" and not by traditional Japanese art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Buruma |first=Ian |title=The Beauty in Her Sacrifice |publisher=The New York Review of Books |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/may/06/mizoguchi-beauty-sacrifice/ |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its cinematography, lighting, and flashback structure influenced such [[film noir]]s of the 1940s and 1950s as ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', ''[[Keeper of the Flame (film)|Keeper of the Flame]]'', ''[[Caught (1949 film)|Caught]]'', ''[[The Great Man]]''&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;{{Rp|425}} and ''[[This Gun for Hire]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|85–86}} David Bordwell and [[Kristin Thompson]] have written that "For over a decade thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements." However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and [[Cinéma vérité]] movements favored "flatter, more shallow images with softer focus" and ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|798}} Its use of long takes influenced films such as ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'', and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced ''[[Gun Crazy]]'',&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|389–390}} ''[[The Whip Hand]]'', ''[[The Devil's General]]'' and ''[[Justice Is Done]]''.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|414}} The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced ''[[La commare secca]]''&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|533}} and ''[[Man of Marble]]''.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|747}}

The film's structure influenced the biographical films ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and ''[[Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters]]''—which begin with the subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]''.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;{{Rp|154}} Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to ''Mr. Arkadin'', as well as the theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with ''Citizen Kane'' and including ''The Magnificent Ambersons'', ''Mr. Arkadin'' and ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |title=Movies as Politics |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1997 |isbn=978-0-520-20615-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113–116, 300–302}}

[[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon]]'' is often compared to the film due to both having complicated plot structures told by multiple characters in the film. Welles said his initial idea for the film was "Basically, the idea ''Rashomon'' used later on,"&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|53}} however Kurosawa had not yet seen the film before making ''Rashomon'' in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richie |first=Donald |title=The Films of Akira Kurosawa |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-520-22037-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|78}} [[Nigel Andrews]] has compared the film's complex plot structure to ''Rashomon'', ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''. Andrews also compares Charles Foster Kane to [[Michael Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather (film series)|The Godfather]]'', [[Jake LaMotta]] in ''[[Raging Bull]]'' and Daniel Plainview in ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' for their portrayals of "haunted megalomaniac[s], presiding over the shards of [their] own [lives]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Nigel |authorlink=Nigel Andrews |title=The Mark of Kane.

The composited camera negative of ''Citizen Kane'' was destroyed in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s.

In 1955, RKO sold the American television rights to its film library, including ''Citizen Kane'', to [[C&amp;C Group|C&amp;C Television Corp.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boddy |first=William |title=Fifties Television: The Industry and Its Critics |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |location=Champaign, Illinois |date=1993 |accessdate=November 29, 2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWjhCESKy4AC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;q=c%26c%20%2B%20rko%20%2B%201955 |isbn=978-0-252-06299-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, television rights to the pre-1956 RKO library were acquired by [[United Artists]].

In 1976, when home video was in its infancy, entrepreneur [[Snuff Garrett]] bought cassette rights to the RKO library for what [[United Press International]] termed "a pittance." In 1978 The Nostalgia Merchant released the film through [[Media Home Entertainment]]. By 1980 the 800-title library of The Nostalgia Merchant was earning $2.3 million a year. "Nobody wanted cassettes four years ago," Garrett told UPI. "It wasn't the first time people called me crazy.

In 1984, [[The Criterion Collection]] released the film as its [[List of Criterion Collection Laserdisc releases|first]] [[LaserDisc]]. It was made from a fine grain master positive provided by the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/840-citizen-kane |last=Smith |first=Roger P. |title=From the Current&amp;nbsp;– ''Citizen Kane'' |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When told about the then-new concept of having an [[audio commentary]] on the disc, Welles was skeptical but said "theoretically, that's good for teaching movies, so long as they don't talk nonsense."&lt;ref name="Lunches"/&gt;{{Rp|283}} In 1992 Criterion released a new 50th Anniversary Edition LaserDisc.

In 2001, Warner Home Video released a 60th Anniversary Collectors Edition [[DVD]]. The two-disc DVD included feature-length commentaries by [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Peter Bogdanovich]], as well as a second DVD with the feature length documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' (1999). It was simultaneously released on VHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/citizen-kane/oclc/48011082 |title=Citizen Kane (VHS tape, 2001)  |publisher=WorldCat |accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD was criticized for being "''too'' bright, ''too clean''; the dirt and grime had been cleared away, but so had a good deal of the texture, the depth, and the sense of film grain."&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2011/09/buy_the_citizen_kane_bluray.html |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |title=Buy the Citizen Kane Blu-ray |publisher=slate.com |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Welles's daughter Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, claiming the Welles estate is the legal [[copyright]] holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed to proceed with the lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/31/business/fi-kane31 |title=Welles' daughter could get profit from 'Kane' |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition added a third DVD with ''[[RKO 281]]'' (1999), an award winning [[Television film|TV movie]] about the making of the film. Its packaging extras included a hardcover book and a folio containing mini reproductions of the original souvenir program, lobby cards, and  production memos and correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/50668/citizen-kane/ |last=McQuain |first=Christopher |title=Citizen Kane (Blu-ray) |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer for the US releases were scanned as [[4K resolution]] from three different 35mm prints and rectified the quality issues of the 2001 DVD.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; The rest of the world continued to receive home video releasees based on the older transfer.

===Colorization controversy===
In the 1980s, ''Citizen Kane'' became a catalyst in the controversy over the [[film colorization|colorization]] of [[black-and-white]] films. One proponent of film colorization was [[Ted Turner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/movies/council-opposes-coloring-old-films.html |last=Molotsky |first=Irwin |title=Council Opposes Coloring Old Films |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=November 4, 1986 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TBS acquires rights to RKO film and television library |publisher=''[[Business Wire]]'' |date=December 9, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that ''Citizen Kane'' would not be colorized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Toole |first=Lawrence |title=No computer coloring for 'Kane' |publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' |date=December 18, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in July 1988 Turner said, "''Citizen Kane?'' I'm thinking of colorizing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bawden |first=James |title=Colorful Turner sees ''Citizen Kane'' in a different light |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=July 28, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him "don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |title=Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize 'Citizen Kane' |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=January 30, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1989, Turner Entertainment President Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that "could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |last=Antczyk |first=John |title=We'll Never Know If Rosebud Was Red |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer added that Welles's contract was "quite unusual" and "other contracts we have checked out are not like this at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turner won't colorize 'Kane' |publisher=''[[United Press International]]'' |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had only colorized the final [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reel]] of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage was included in the BBC ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary ''The Complete Citizen Kane''.{{efn| The colorized ''Citizen Kane'' footage appears at approximately 1:17:00.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/the-complete-citizen-kane-is-now-online/ |title=The Complete Citizen Kane' documentary is now online |publisher=Wellesnet |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colorization controversy was a factor in the passage of the [[National Film Preservation Act]] in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year. [[ABC News]] anchor [[Peter Jennings]] reported that "one major reason for doing this is to require people like the broadcaster Ted Turner, who's been adding color to some movies and re-editing others for television, to put notices on those versions saying that the movies have been altered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jennings |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jennings |title=[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]] |publisher=''[[ABC News]]'' Transcripts, ''[[American Broadcasting Company]]'' |date=September 19, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Copy testing''' is a specialized field of [[marketing research]] that determines an advertisement’s effectiveness based on consumer responses, feedback, and behavior. Also known as pre-testing, it might address all media channels including television, print, radio, outdoor signage, [[internet]], and [[social media]].

'''Automated Copy Testing''' is a specialized type of [[digital marketing]] specifically related to digital advertising. This involves using software to deploy copy variations of digital advertisements to a live environment and collecting data from real users. These automated copy tests will generally use a [[Z-test]] to determine the [[statistical significance]] of results. If a specific ad variation out performs the baseline in the copy test, to a desired level of statistical significance, this new copy variation should be used by the marketer.

==Features==
In 1982, a consortium of 21 leading [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]] — including [[N. W. Ayer &amp; Son|N. W. Ayer]], [[D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles|D’Arcy]], [[Grey Global Group|Grey]], [[McCann Erickson]], [[DDB Worldwide#Needham Harper &amp; Steers|Needham Harper &amp; Steers]], [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], [[J. Walter Thompson]], and [[Young &amp; Rubicam]] — released a public document laying out the PACT (Positioning Advertising Copy Testing) Principles that constitute a good copy testing system. PACT states a good copy testing system must meet the following criteria:
#Provides measurements which are relevant to the objectives of the advertising.
#Requires agreement about how the results will be used in advance of each specific test.
#Provides multiple measurements, because single measurements are generally inadequate to assess the performance of an advertisement.
#Based on a model of human response to communications – the reception of a stimulus, the comprehension of the stimulus, and the response to the stimulus.
#Allows for consideration of whether the advertising stimulus should be exposed more than once.
#Recognizes that the more finished a piece of copy is, the more soundly it can be evaluated and requires, as a minimum, that alternative executions be tested in the same degree of finish.
#Provides controls to avoid the biasing effects of the exposure context.
#Takes into account basic considerations of sample definition.
#Demonstrates reliability and validity.

==Types of copy testing measurements==

===Recall===
The predominant copy testing measure of the 1950s and 1960s, Burke's Day-After Recall (DAR) was interpreted to measure an ad’s ability to “break through” into the mind of the consumer and register a message from the brand in long-term memory (Honomichl). Once this measure was adopted by Procter and Gamble, it became a research staple (Honomichl).

In the 70s, 80s, and 90s, validation efforts found no link between recall scores and actual sales (Adams &amp; Blair; Blair; Blair &amp; Kuse; Blair &amp; Rabuck; Jones; Jones &amp; Blair; MASB; Mondello; Stewart). For example, Procter and Gamble reviewed 10 year’s worth of split-cable tests (100 total) and found no significant relationship between recall scores and sales (Young, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–30). In addition, Wharton University’s Leonard Lodish conducted an even more extensive review of test market results and also failed to find a relationship between recall and sales (Lodish pp.&amp;nbsp;125–139).

The 1970s also saw a re-examination of the “breakthrough” measure. As a result, an important distinction was made between the attention-getting power of the creative execution and how well “branded” the ad was. Thus, the separate measures of [[Attention (advertising)|attention]] and [[brand]]ing were born (Young, p.&amp;nbsp;12).

===Persuasion===
In the 1970s and 1980s, after DAR was determined to be a poor predictor of sales, the research industry began to depend on a measure of persuasion as an accurate predictor of sales. This shift was led, in part, by researcher Horace Schwerin who pointed out, “the obvious truth is that a claim can be well remembered but completely unimportant to the prospective buyer of the product – the solution the marketer offers is addressed to the wrong need” (Honomichl). As with DAR, it was Procter and Gamble’s acceptance of the ARS Persuasion measure (also known as '''[[brand preference]]''') that made it an industry standard. Recall scores were still provided in copy testing reports with the understanding that persuasion was the measure that mattered (Honomichl).

Harold Ross of Mapes &amp; Ross found that persuasion was a better predictor of sales than recall (Ross), and the predictive validity of ARS Persuasion to sales has been reported in several refereed publications (Adams &amp; Blair; Jones &amp; Blair; MASB; Mondello  ).

===Diagnostic===
The main purpose of diagnostic measures is optimization. Understanding diagnostic measures can help advertisers identify creative opportunities to improve executions (Young, p.&amp;nbsp;7).

===Non-Verbal===
Non-verbal measures were developed in response to the belief that much of a commercial’s effects – e.g. the emotional impact – may be difficult for respondents to put into words or scale on verbal rating statements. In fact, many believe the commercial’s effects may be operating below the level of consciousness (Young, p.&amp;nbsp;7). According to researcher Chuck Young, “There is something in the lovely sounds of our favorite music that we cannot verbalize – and it moves us in ways we cannot express” (Young, p.&amp;nbsp;22).

In the 1970s, researchers sought to measure these non-verbal measures biologically by tracking brain wave activities as respondents watched commercials (Krugman). Others experimented with galvanic skin response, voice pitch analysis, and eye-tracking (Young, p.&amp;nbsp;22). These efforts were not popularly adopted, in part because of the limitations of the technology as well as the poor cost-effectiveness of what was widely perceived as academic, not actionable research.

In the early 1980s the shift in analytical perspective from thinking of a commercial as the fundamental unit of measurement to be rated in its entirety, to thinking of it as a structured flow of experience, gave rise to experimentation with moment-by-moment systems. The most popular of these was the dial-a-meter response which required respondents to turn a meter, in degrees, toward one end of a scale or another to reflect their opinion of what was on screen at that moment.

More recently, research companies have started to use psychological tests, such as the [[Stroop effect]], to measure the emotional impact of copy. These techniques exploit the notion that viewers do not know why they react to a product, image, or ad in a certain way (or that they reacted at all) because such reactions occur outside of awareness, through changes in networks of thoughts, ideas, and images.

==Copy testing in political elections==
Copy testing is utilized in an array of fields ranging from commercial development to presidential elections.  In 2007, CNN employed this form of market testing throughout the primary and general election.  Professor [http://ritakirk.com Rita Kirk] and Dan Schill from Southern Methodist University worked with CNN to gauge voters reaction to debates between presidential hopefuls.  (http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/06/14/dial.testing/index.html)

'''Darmin Nasution''' (born December 21, 1948) is an [[Indonesian people|Indonesian]] economist and the current Indonesian [[Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (Indonesia)|Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs]]. He was previously Governor of [[Bank Indonesia|Bank of Indonesia]], serving the role from 2010 to 2013 during [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]]'s administration.

Before taking up various positions within the Indonesian government, Nasution was a faculty member at the [[University of Indonesia]] School of Economics, where he was Deputy Chair of the ''Lembaga Penyelidikan Ekonomi dan Masyarakat'' (LPEM, or Institute for Economic and Social Research) from 1987, and Head of the LPEM from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpem.org/?page_id=4513 LPEM Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Nasution was born on December 21, 1948 in Pasar Maga, [[North Sumatra]] to a [[Batak]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.kontan.co.id/news/wuih-kekayaan-darmin-nasution-rp-11-miliar-lebih-1|title=Wuih, Kekayaan Darmin Nasution Rp 11 Miliar Lebih|website=kontan.co.id|access-date=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with Bachelor's degree in Economics from the [[University of Indonesia]], in 1976, and received his [[Master's degree|Master's]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctorate]] degrees in the same major from the [[University of Paris]], [[France]] in 1986.

== Ministry of Finance ==
Nasution served as Director General of for Financial Institutions in the [[Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Finance]] from 2000-2005.  He was subsequently appointed chairman of Indonesia's Capital Market and Financial Institution Supervisory Agency in 2006&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2005/03/30/darmin-nasution-new-bapepam-chief.html Darmin Nasution new Bapepam chief'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later transferred to the post of Director General of Taxation in the Ministry of Finance.

== Bank Indonesia ==
In July 2009 Nasution was appointed Senior Deputy Governor of [[Bank Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Presidential Decree No.57/P 2009, dated 17 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sworn into office on 27 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/28/darmin-acting-governor-bi.html Darmin acting governor of BI'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasution immediately became acting governor of Bank Indonesia because the previous governor, [[Boediono]], had resigned several months earlier in May to run for election as Vice President of Indonesia as team mate of President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].&lt;ref&gt;In relation to the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 38/P, 2009, on 19 May 2009 regarding the resignation of [[Boediono]] as governor of Bank Indonesia, as well as legislated by Act No. 23, 1999, concerning Bank Indonesia and amended by Act No. 6, 2009, the senior deputy governor, Darmin Nasution, took on the position of acting governor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasution was subsequently appointed as Governor of Bank Indonesia on September 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;In accordance with Presidential Decree No.95 / P of 2010 dated August 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; after parliamentary hearings to consider his nomination as governor.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/23/darmin-finally-named-bi-governor.html Darmin finally named BI governor'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as governor when [[Agus Martowardojo]] was appointed in May 2013.

== Coordinating Economics Minister ==
On August 12, 2015, in a cabinet reshuffle by President [[Joko Widodo]], Nasution was appointed as the Coordinating Minister of Economics, replacing [[Sofyan Djalil]] in the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia’s President Widodo reshuffles cabinet to boost slowing economy|date=12 August 2015|first1= |last1= |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18258">'''Domestic liability dollarization (DLD)''' refers to the denomination of banking system deposits and lending in a currency other than that of the country in which they are held. DLD does not refer exclusively to denomination in US dollars, as DLD encompasses accounts denominated in internationally traded "hard" currencies such as the British pound sterling, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen, and the Euro (and some of its predecessors, particularly the Deutschmark).

==Measurement==
In developed countries, DLD is defined as [[Bank for International Settlements]] reporting banks' local asset positions in foreign currency as a share of [[GDP]]. In [[emerging markets|emerging-market]] economies (EMs), a proxy measure of DLD is constructed by summing dollar deposits and bank foreign borrowing as a share of [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jinteco.2005.06.008| title = Relative price volatility under Sudden Stops: The relevance of balance sheet effects| year = 2006| last1 = Calvo | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Izquierdo | first2 = A. | last3 = Loo-Kung | first3 = R. | journal = Journal of International Economics| volume = 69| pages = 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proxy is based on the assumption that banks match their assets and liabilities by currency type and transfer exchange rate risk to debtors.&lt;ref&gt;IDB ([[Inter-American Development Bank]]) [http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=617000]. 2004. ''Unlocking Credit: The Quest for Deep and Stable Bank Lending''. 2005 Economic and Social Progress Report. Washington, DC, United States: Johns Hopkins University Press and Inter-American Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; In other settings, DLD is defined as the share of foreign currency deposits over total deposits.&lt;ref name="imf.org"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9396.2010.00890.x| title = Exchange Rate Policy and Liability Dollarization: What do the Data Reveal about Causality?| year = 2010| last1 = Berkmen | first1 = S. P. | last2 = Cavallo | first2 = E. | journal = Review of International Economics| volume = 18| issue = 5| pages = 781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants==
A variety of causes have been proposed for DLD, some more widely accepted than others.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0327.2006.00154.x| title = Financial dollarization: Evaluating the consequences| year = 2006| last1 = Yeyati | first1 = E. L. | journal = Economic Policy| volume = 21| issue = 45| pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes often cited in the early literature on DLD, especially in Latin America, include high fiscal deficits, loose monetary policy and a history of [[inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;Izquierdo, A. [http://www.iadb.org/research/pub_desc.cfm?language=English&amp;ID_SEC=3&amp;PUB_ID=P-447]"Dollarization and Crises: Ways In and Out: De-dollarization Strategies and Domestic Currency Debt Markets in Emerging Economies." Presentation at Annual Meetings of the Board of Governors of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]]. Okinawa, Japan, April 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In an economic environment characterized by these features, the domestic currency (often generically referred to as the peso) serves neither as a reliable medium of exchange nor a predictable store of value. The modern approach to DLD, however, emphasizes that DLD, as typically measured based on interest rate-bearing deposit dollarization, is largely a portfolio choice phenomenon related less with inflation levels than with the distribution of inflation (more precisely, of real return differentials), and relates the outcome to the volatility of inflation and the real exchange rate (and, in turn, the exchange rate policy).&lt;ref&gt;See i) {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0022-1996(02)00017-X| title = Financial dollarization| year = 2003| last1 = Ize | first1 = A. | last2 = Yeyati | first2 = E. L. | journal = Journal of International Economics| volume = 59| issue = 2| pages = 323}}; and ii) {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jinteco.2005.05.008| title = Currency mismatches and monetary policy: A tale of two equilibria| year = 2006| last1 = Chang | first1 = R. | last2 = Velasco | first2 = A. S. | journal = Journal of International Economics| volume = 69| pages = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the strong intuitive appeal of this idea, there is comparatively little empirical work on this issue. Among the work that has been done, however, Berkmen and Cavallo (2007) &lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; do not find evidence that more active intervention in foreign exchange markets (i.e., more fixing) leads to higher liability dollarization.

Others have argued that a closely managed exchange rate is an effect rather than a cause of DLD, a claim empirically supported in Berkmen and Cavallo (2007).&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; It has additionally been proposed that DLD reflects a lack of faith in the domestic currency and ultimately in the quality of government, and that countries whose governments rank higher on various indices of quality experience lower levels of DLD than their more poorly performing counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jimonfin.2008.11.004| title = Dollarization, exchange rate regimes and government quality| year = 2009| last1 = Honig | first1 = A. | journal = Journal of International Money and Finance| volume = 28| issue = 2| pages = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Researchers have attributed a variety of both positive and negative effects to DLD. The benefits are largely found at the household and firm levels in the short to medium term. These benefits include insurance against [[inflation]] and currency devaluation, as well as permitting long-term lending and borrowing through the use of a relatively stable currency.

In contrast, the real or potential costs of DLD exist largely at the systemic level and over the long term. When DLD is widespread, economic actors are often required to experience a currency mismatch between domestically denominated income and dollar-denominated liabilities, which represent the only available means of long-term borrowing. Currency mismatches are a particular danger for firms and sectors in non-tradable goods and services. Countries with high levels of DLD, moreover, are often afflicted as well with "[[Original Sin (economics)|Original Sin]]," a country's inability to borrow in its own currency. While the resulting vulnerability may not be apparent in normal times, it can be revealed during turbulent times, even in the absence of a major crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Calvo |first=G. A. |date=February 2007 |title=Monetary Policy Challenges in Emerging Markets: Sudden Stop, Liability Dollarization, and Lender of Last Resort |work=NBER Working Paper No. 12788 |doi=10.3386/w12788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In economies with fixed or heavily managed exchange rate regimes, for instance, an abrupt change in regime can reveal the exposure of actors who have not hedged for exchange rate risk. Internal as well as external shocks to the [[real exchange rate]] and/or real effective rate can produce similarly disruptive balance sheet effects, with economy-wide implications for liquidity. These problems can become particularly acute in an economy without an effective [[lender of last resort]] and/or one that issues only domestically denominated debt. Extensive DLD additionally impedes adjustment by means of the real exchange rate and increases the likelihood and severity of a [[Sudden stop (economics)|sudden stop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Calvo |first=G. A. |first2=A. |last2=Izquierdo |first3=L-F. |last3=Mejía |date=May 2008 |title=Systemic Sudden Stops: The Relevance of Balance-Sheet Effects and Financial Integration |work=NBER Working Paper No. 14026 |location=Cambridge, United States |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |doi=10.3386/w14026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "[[fear of floating]]" (that is not allowing the exchange rate to adjust in the face of external shocks, see: [[floating exchange rate]]) may be a consequence of DLD, as countries with unofficially dollarized economies may find a freely moving exchange rate to be too costly. Berkmen and Cavallo tested the causality between DLD and fear of floating empirically; their findings support the "fear of floating" argument. Countries with high liability dollarization (external, public, or financial) tend to stabilize their exchange rate.&lt;ref name="imf.org"/&gt; This finding is robust to various proxies for exchange rate management. For the reverse causality, on the other hand, the authors do not find evidence that more active intervention in foreign exchange markets (i.e., more fixing) leads to higher liability dollarization.

Over time, economies with high levels of DLD can display the following problems: i) an unstable demand for money; ii) a high propensity to experience banking crises following a depreciation of the local currency; and iii) slow and volatile output growth without a significant increase in domestic financial system depth.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;

==Policy measures==
Policy interventions to reduce DLD have taken a variety of recommended and actual forms and have met with varying degrees of success. It is generally agreed that controlling [[inflation]] is necessary, as the uncertainties brought about by [[inflation]] represent perhaps the greatest single determinant of DLD. Yet reducing [[inflation]] alone is generally not considered sufficient to achieve de-dollarization, as economies with high levels of DLD may exhibit [[hysteresis (economics)|hysteresis]] once actors adjust their expectations and behaviors to transactions denominated in foreign currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uribe |first=M. |year=1997 |title=Hysteresis in a Simple Model of Currency Substitution |journal=[[Journal of Monetary Economics]] |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=185–202 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3932(97)00038-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, low volatility of [[inflation]] relative to the volatility of RER depreciation may be needed to lead to de-dollarization. To date, only two countries, Israel in the 1980s and 1990s and Poland in the 1990s, have managed to engage in successful de-dollarization without extensive negative consequences;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reinhart |first=C. M. |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Rogoff |first3=M. A. |last3=Savastano |date=October 2003 |title=Addicted to Dollars |work=NBER Working Paper No. 10015 |location=Cambridge, United States |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |doi=10.3386/w10015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both countries managed this transition through combining disinflation with a strong exchange rate anchor. Moreover, in addition to a one-year mandatory hold on dollar deposits, Israel undertook a series of "patches" including the following: i) [[Consumer Price Index|CPI]]-indexed deposits; ii) requirements that banks undertake active hedging of currency risk for non-tradable activities; iii) active development of financial derivatives markets; and iv) efforts to deepen local currency bond markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Galindo |first=A. |first2=L. |last2=Leiderman |date=May 2005 |title=Living with Dollarization and the Route to Dedollarization |work=IDB Working Paper No. 437 |location=Washington, DC, United States |publisher=Inter-American-Development Bank |ssrn=1818726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's disinflationary efforts, moreover, coincided with a very high real exchange rate. Under less favorable circumstances, or in the absence of policies designed to facilitate adjustment, forced de-dollarization has provoked extensive capital flight and/or steep declines in financial intermediation.

==Prospects==
In recent years there has been a revival of interest in lending in domestic currency, especially in Latin America, and there is evidence that public debt has in fact become less dollarized.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, E.A. [http://www.iadb.org/research/pub_desc.cfm?pub_id=IDB-PB-109] 2010. "Debt Management in Latin America: How Safe Is the New Debt Composition? IDB Policy Brief #109. Washington, DC, United States: [[Inter-American Development Bank]].&lt;/ref&gt; This revival may represent an attempt to "lean against the wind" in the face of expectations of currency appreciation as well as a response to the collapse of Argentina's Convertibility regime, which illustrated the macroeconomic risks of extensive DLD.

A second potential channel of de-dollarization is the increasing use of domestic currency lending to the private sector as well as to sovereigns and subnational governments by international financial institutions, particularly the [[Inter-American Development Bank]]. In addition to hedging those institutions' currency risk, multilateral lending in domestic currency offers a potential solution to a first mover problem and a signal to other economic actors.

'''Downtown Berkeley''' is the [[central business district]] of the city of [[Berkeley, California]], United States, around the intersection of [[Shattuck Avenue]] and Center Street, and extending north to Hearst Avenue, south to Dwight Way, west to Martin Luther King Jr. Way, and east to Oxford Street.  Downtown is the mass transit hub of Berkeley, with several [[AC Transit]] and [[Bear Transit|UC Berkeley]] bus lines converging on the city's busiest [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station, as well as the location of Berkeley's [[civic center]], [[Berkeley High School (California)|high school]], and [[Berkeley City College]].

==History==
[[File:Berkeley California1994.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Addison Street, between Oxford Street and Shattuck Avenue, in 1994. The historic [[Studio Building (Berkeley, California)|Studio Building]] is the second building on the right.]]
The area was formerly a settlement site of the Huichin/Chochen band of the [[Ohlone]] indigenous people. Artifacts were found in the 1950s during the digging of a basement on Kittredge Street. The site was probably associated with the proximity of [[Strawberry Creek]] which ran along what is today's Allston Way. During the days when the land was part of the vast [[Rancho San Antonio (Peralta)|Rancho San Antonio]], a ford existed across Strawberry Creek beneath a clump of oak trees at approximately the intersection of Shattuck Avenue and Allston Way. The road or trail which crossed here connected the ranch houses of two of the Peralta brothers, [[José Domingo Peralta|Domingo]] and Vicente.

Following the [[Mexican–American War]], four Americans laid claim to four equal strips of land in what is now downtown Berkeley, bounded on the north by what is today the alignment of Addison Street, and on the south, by Dwight Way. Among these claimants was [[Francis K. Shattuck]]. Shattuck's portion lay west of what is now Shattuck Avenue. He built a house here at the site of what is today the [[Hotel Shattuck Plaza]]. The county road going to Oakland along his property was informally called "Shattuck's road", but the planners of the [[College of California]] dubbed the street "Guyot" on their plat map. That name never caught on and the street name was upgraded to "Shattuck Avenue". In the 1890s, Strawberry Creek was [[culvert]]ed through the downtown section, the oak trees were removed, and Shattuck and University Avenues were improved. Nonetheless, the area developed slowly until about the time of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], after which it developed rapidly.

The [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] constructed its [[Berkeley Branch Railroad]] line connecting the area to the [[Oakland Pier]] and the [[Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental rail line]] in 1876, two years before the people living near the [[University of California]] and in [[Ocean View, Berkeley, California|Ocean View]] incorporated Berkeley. The end of the line at University Avenue was initially called the "Terminus" until the line was extended north, after which time it was called [[Berkeley station (Southern Pacific Railroad)|Berkeley Station]]. In the early years, downtown Berkeley was synonymous with "Berkeley Station", referring to the area around the railroad depot. The railroad served both passengers and freight at Berkeley Station. A telegraph office and [[Wells Fargo]] office were situated across the street from the depot.

The [[Key System]] opened up its electric train service to San Francisco from Downtown Berkeley in 1903. The Southern Pacific responded by electrifying and extending its lines in Berkeley in 1911 ([[East Bay Electric Lines]]) and moved its downtown freight operations just south of downtown to Ward Street and Shattuck. In 1941, however, SP ended its electric commuter train service. From then until April 1958, downtown Berkeley's commuter train service was solely in the hands of the Key System. Buses replaced the trains from 1958 to the present. In 1973, BART opened its own [[Downtown Berkeley Station|Berkeley station]] at Center Street and Shattuck, once again providing electric train service to San Francisco and elsewhere in the Bay Area.

For several years after the Key System's F train stopped running on Shattuck, its tracks (originally, the old SP tracks) remained in the pavement of Shattuck Avenue. Parking islands were created along the centerline of Shattuck overlapping the northbound tracks. In the early 1960s, a series of fountains were constructed which replaced some of these parking islands, extending from Center to Haste. The fountains quickly became the favorite targets of vandals who regularly put bubble bath in them. They were soon removed, just before Shattuck Avenue was torn up for the BART subway construction.

In early 2007 the Marine Recruiting Center for the northern [[Bay Area]] relocated from [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] to downtown Berkeley in order to be closer to the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="DC Protests Follow"&gt;{{cite web

==Commercial issues==
[[Image:Berkeleynight.jpg|thumb|300px|right|University Avenue at night.]]
Berkeley's downtown section has been the principal commercial center of Berkeley since the railroad station was built.  However, it has had to compete with the secondary commercial sections which emerged starting as early as the 19th century.  Three of these in the past were [[West Berkeley, Berkeley, California|West Berkeley]] (Ocean View), North Berkeley (Berryman's) and the [[Telegraph Avenue|Telegraph]] area immediately south of the University of California campus.  Others which came a bit later were the [[Elmwood, Berkeley, California|Elmwood]] area along College near Ashby, [[San Pablo Avenue]], [[South Berkeley, Berkeley, California|South Berkeley]] (formerly the [[Lorin District]]) and [[Thousand Oaks, Berkeley, California|Thousand Oaks]] along [[Solano Avenue]].

Starting in the 1970s it also had to compete with the emergence of major shopping centers and malls outside of Berkeley, especially [[El Cerrito Plaza (Shopping Center)|El Cerrito Plaza]], [[Hilltop Mall]], and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]].  These resulted in the loss of several formerly prominent downtown businesses, including two large department stores; Hink's, whose building was converted to a movie theater and several smaller stores, and [[J. C. Penney]].  Contributing factors which continue to date are high commercial rents, a shortage of street parking and convenient garages, and higher consumer prices than those offered elsewhere.  The latter has been a problem since the earliest days as there has always been a tendency to view the University population as a captive consumer base.  The city has created an official [[arts district]] along Addison Street and passed laws restricting business hours in other neighborhoods in an attempt to increase night time activity downtown.  To address the parking situation, the city is planning to install a system of digital signs to direct drivers to available parking spaces downtown.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20071018/ai_n21065758]

{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=March 2013}}

Today, Berkeley's downtown is highly eclectic, with numerous small businesses.  Currently, the Berkeley City Council passed a new downtown area plan in an attempt to make the Downtown more sustainable and concentrate future development in the downtown area in conjunction with the announced plan of the University to build a hotel, conference center, and museum along Center Street. In 2009 local petition gatherers gained enough signatures to obstruct implementation of the plan, angering many residents of Berkeley, including the coalition of the Sierra Club, the Greenbelt Alliance, [[Berkeley Food and Housing Project|Berkeley Food &amp; Housing Project]] and TransForm. The opponents argue that the new development calls for buildings that are too tall and have housing that is too expensive. Supporters of the downtown plan counter that the plan requires 20% affordable housing units and a denser downtown reduces carbon emissions.

In recent years, Shattuck Avenue has seen the opening of a number of new high-profile restaurants, such as [[Revival Bar and Kitchen]].

==Government==
Downtown Berkeley is a part of Berkeley's District 4 and is represented by Kate Harrison. It is considered a left-leaning neighborhood in civic politics.

'''Downtown Vancouver''' is the southeastern portion of the [[Burrard Peninsula|peninsula]] in the north-central part of the [[City of Vancouver]]. It is the main [[city centre]] and [[central business district]] of the city, [[Metro Vancouver]], and the [[Lower Mainland]] regions. 

==Geography==
[[File:Downtownvancouverviewfromstanleypark.JPG|thumb|left|Downtown Vancouver is bounded by [[Burrard Inlet]] to the north.]]
The downtown area is generally considered to be bounded by [[Burrard Inlet]] to the north, [[Stanley Park]] and the [[West End, Vancouver|West End]] to the west, [[False Creek]] to the south, and the [[Downtown Eastside]] to the east. Most sources include the full downtown peninsula (adding the West End neighbourhood and Stanley Park) as downtown Vancouver, but the City of Vancouver defines them as separate neighbourhoods.

Besides the readily identifiable office towers of the [[Financial District, Vancouver|financial and central business districts]], Downtown Vancouver also includes residential neighbourhoods in the form of high-rise apartment and condominiums, in [[Yaletown]] and [[Coal Harbour]]. Other downtown neighbourhoods include the [[Granville Mall (Vancouver)|Granville Mall]] and [[Granville Entertainment District|Entertainment District]], Downtown's South, [[Gastown]], [[Japantown (Vancouver)#New Japantown|Japantown]], and [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]].

==Architecture==
{{See also|Architecture of Vancouver}}
The downtown area includes most of the remaining historic buildings and many of the larger notable buildings in the region.

===Sports===
There are two major sporting facilities in the downtown core, [[Rogers Arena]] (formerly GM Place) and [[BC Place Stadium]]. The [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Vancouver Canucks]] play at Rogers Arena, while the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[BC Lions]] and the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]]'s [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC (MLS)|Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] use the neighbouring BC Place Stadium. SkyTrain Stadium-Chinatown station provides easy rapid transit access to the district.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Vancouver}}
[[File:Burrard Bridge and False Creek Vancouver.jpg|left|thumb|[[Burrard Street Bridge]] is a major bridge and access point to Downtown.]]
The presence of water on three sides limits access to downtown Vancouver. There are four major bridges: the [[Lions Gate Bridge]], connecting to the [[North Shore (Greater Vancouver)|North Shore]] municipalities and the [[British Columbia Highway 1|Trans Canada Highway]], the [[Burrard Street Bridge]], [[Cambie Street Bridge]], and [[Granville Street Bridge]] provides access to the commercial and residential areas south of False Creek.

The historic [[Waterfront station (Vancouver)|Waterfront station]] is the principal transit hub for the downtown core. There are six [[rapid transit|subway]] stations located in downtown Vancouver running on two [[Vancouver SkyTrain|SkyTrain]] lines: the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] and [[Canada Line]]. The Expo Line travels from Waterfront station at the foot of the central harbor and through [[Dunsmuir Tunnel]] to the east. The Canada Line travels from Waterfront station and tunnels south under [[Granville Street]] and [[Davie Street]], linking downtown to central [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]] and [[Vancouver International Airport]]. [[SeaBus]] is a passenger-only ferry that connects from Waterfront station to the North Shore in 10–12 minutes. The [[West Coast Express]] commuter rail system travels from Waterfront station to the eastern suburbs and exurbs. Terminals are also available near Waterfront station for float planes and helicopters.
[[File:Canadian Pacific railway station 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Waterfront station (Vancouver)|Waterfront station]] is a major [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]] public transportation hub in Downtown Vancouver.]]
Most north-south Vancouver bus routes serve Downtown Vancouver, in addition to suburban routes from the North Shore and [[Burnaby]]. The [[bus rapid transit]] line [[98 B-Line]] had eight stops in the downtown core, primarily along [[Seymour Street]] and [[Burrard Street]]. This service was replaced on August 17, 2009 by SkyTrain's Canada Line. The [[95 B-Line]] started service in December 2016 in conjunction with the opening of the [[Evergreen Extension]], connecting downtown to [[Simon Fraser University]] along [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings Street]].

There are two private passenger water taxi operators ([[False Creek Ferries]] and [[The Aquabus]]), providing service between several downtown neighbourhoods, [[False Creek]], and [[Granville Island]].

The city is planning to extend the [[Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway|downtown streetcar]] from its current route of [[Granville Island]] to the Main Street SkyTrain station, with future plans extending it to Chinatown and then to [[Stanley Park]].

'''Downtown [[Winnipeg]]''' is an area of the city located near the confluence of the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] rivers. It is the oldest urban area in Winnipeg, and is home to the city's commercial core, city hall, the seat of Manitoba's provincial government, and a number of major attractions and institutions.

The City of Winnipeg's official downtown boundaries are: the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline on the north, Gomez Street and the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] on the east, and the [[Assiniboine River]] on the south. The western boundaries are downtown are irregular, following along a number of different streets, back lanes, and across properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/interhom/CityHall/OurWinnipeg/map/map.asp |title=Map for OurWinnipeg Adopted by City Council |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Generally speaking, the western boundaries are rarely further west of Balmoral and Isabel Streets. In 2016, ''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' produced a map that generalize Winnipeg's downtown boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/six-maps-put-canadas-downtown-cores-context |title=Six maps that put Canada's downtown cores in context |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbourhoods in the downtown area include the [[Exchange District]], [[Central Park (Winnipeg)|Central Park]], [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]], and [[Chinatown, Winnipeg|Chinatown]]. The downtown area is roughly three square kilometres. Winnipeg Square, [[Bell MTS Place]], [[Portage Place]], and the flagship store of [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|the Bay]] are all located on the downtown section of [[Portage Avenue]]. On Main Street are Winnipeg's City Hall, [[Union Station (Winnipeg)|Union Station]], and the [[Manitoba Centennial Centre]], which includes the [[Manitoba Museum]], the [[Planetarium]], the Centennial Concert Hall and the [[Winnipeg Railway Museum]]. Although over 60,000 people work downtown, only 13,470 people actually live in the Downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residential Development Strategy |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/ppd/planning/Planning_downtown/PDF/Residential%20Development%20Strategy.pdf?DocId=11218&amp;SectionId=298498&amp;InitUrl=/CLKDMIS/Documents/c/2011/m11218/ddhrm%2007%2004%20no.%2002.pdf |publisher=''The City of Winnipeg'' |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several residential projects under construction on Waterfront Drive and in the Exchange District, and the residential population of the area is projected to increase substantially in the next few years.

==Neighbourhoods==

The ''Downtown Winnipeg Zoning By-Law'' defines the boundaries of the Downtown planning area, and several sectors within it. The downtown census area is slightly smaller, omitting a three-block extension at the north edge. There is also a significantly larger Downtown community area, used for Community Social Data Strategy for Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/census/2001/includes/Geographies.stm#CommunityAreas |title=(UD) : 2001 Census |publisher=Winnipeg.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipeg.ca/census/2006/Community%20Area/] 2006 Census data&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''family business''' is a [[commercial organization]] in which decision-making is influenced by multiple generations of a family — related by blood or marriage or adoption — who has both the ability to influence the vision of the business and the willingness to use this ability to pursue distinctive goals.&lt;ref name="JSBM"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Massis |first=Alfredo |author2=Josip Kotlar |author3=Jess H. Chua |author4=James J. Chrisman|date=2014 |title=Ability and Willingness as Sufficiency Conditions for Family-Oriented Particularistic Behavior: Implications for Theory and Empirical Studies |ssrn= |journal=Journal of Small Business Management |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=344–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Family Business Studies: An Annotated Bibliography|year=2012|publisher= Edward Elgar |location= Cheltenham Glos, UK |author=Alfredo De Massis|author2=Pramodita Sharma |author3=Jess H. Chua |author4=James J. Chrisman }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are closely identified with the firm through leadership or ownership. Owner-manager entrepreneurial firms are not considered to be family businesses because they lack the multi-generational dimension and family influence that create the unique dynamics and relationships of family businesses.

==Conceptual overview==
Family business is the oldest and most common model of economic organization. The vast majority of businesses throughout the world—from corner shops to multinational publicly listed organizations with hundreds of thousands of employees—can be considered family businesses.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlock|first=Randel S |author2=Manfred Kets de Vries |author3=Elizabeth Florent-Treacy|title=Family Business|journal=International Encyclopedia of Organizational Studies|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on research of the [[Forbes 400]] richest Americans, 44% of the Forbes 400 member fortunes were derived by being a member of or in association with a family business.&lt;ref&gt;Alderson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic prevalence and importance of this kind of business are often underestimated. Throughout most of the 20th century, academics and economists were intrigued by a newer, “improved” model: large publicly traded companies run in an apparently rational, bureaucratic manner by well trained “organization men.” Entrepreneurial and family firms, with their specific management models and complicated psychological processes, often fell short by comparison.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;

Privately owned or family-controlled enterprises are not always easy to study. In many cases, they are not subject to financial reporting requirements, and little information is made public about financial performance. Ownership may be distributed through trusts or holding companies, and family members themselves may not be fully informed about the ownership structure of their enterprise. However, as the 21st-century global economic model replaces the old industrial model, government policy makers, economists, and academics turn to entrepreneurial and family enterprises as a prime source of wealth creation and employment.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;

In some countries, many of the largest publicly listed firms are family-owned. A firm is said to be family-owned if a person is the controlling shareholder; that is, a person (rather than a state, corporation, management trust, or mutual fund) can garner enough shares to assure at least 20% of the voting rights and the highest percentage of voting rights in comparison to other shareholders.&lt;ref name="JIM1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chakrabarty |first=S |date=2009 |title=The Influence of National Culture and Institutional Voids on Family Ownership of Large Firms: A Country Level Empirical Study |ssrn=1151025 |journal=Journal of International Management |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Some of the world's largest family-run businesses are [[Walmart]] (United States), [[Samsung Group]] (Korea) and [[Tata Group]] (India).

The "Global Family Business Index"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familybusinessindex.com|title=HSG / Global Family Business Index|website=www.familybusinessindex.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprises the largest 500 family firms around the globe. In this index—published for a first time in 2015 by Center for Family Business [[University of St. Gallen]] and [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]]—for a privately held firm, a firm is classified as a family firm in case a family controls more than 50% of the voting rights. For a publicly listed firm, a firm is classified as a family firm in case the family holds at least 32% of the voting rights.

Family owned businesses account for over 30% of companies with sales over $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Kachaner |first1=Nicolas |last2=Stalk Jr. |first2=George |last3=Bloch |first3=Alain |date=November 2012 |title=What You Can Learn from Family Business |url=http://hbr.org/2012/11/what-you-can-learn-from-family-business/ar/1 |magazine=Harvard Business Review |access-date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a family business, two or more members within the management team are drawn from the owning family. Family businesses can have owners who are not family members. Family businesses may also be managed by individuals who are not members of the family. However, family members are often involved in the operations of their family business in some capacity and, in smaller companies, usually one or more family members are the senior officers and managers. In India, many businesses that are now [[Public company|public companies]] were once family businesses.

Family participation as managers and/or owners of a business can strengthen the company because family members are often loyal and dedicated to the family enterprise. However, family participation as managers and/or owners of a business can present unique problems because the dynamics of the family system and the dynamics of the business systems are often not in balance.

The interests of a family member may not be aligned with the interest of the business. For example, if a family member wants to be president but is not as competent as a non-family member, the personal interest of the family member and the well being of the business may be in conflict.

The interests of the entire family may not be balanced with the interests of their business. For example, if a family needs its business to distribute funds for living expenses and retirement but the business requires those to stay competitive, the interests of the entire family and the business are not aligned.&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, Jacoline (2008). Money Magnet: Attract Investors to Your Business: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-470-15575-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the interest of one family member may not be aligned with another family member. For example, a family member who is an owner may want to sell the business to maximize their return, but a family member who is an owner and also a manager may want to keep the company because it represents their career and they want their children to have the opportunity to work in the company.

==The three circles model==
The challenge for business families is that family, ownership and business roles involve different and sometimes conflicting values, goals, and actions. For example, family members put a high priority on emotional capital—the family success that unites them through consecutive generations. Executives in the business are concerned about strategy and social capital—the reputation of their firm in the marketplace. Owners are interested in financial capital—performance in terms of wealth creation.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;

A three-circles model is often used to show the three principal roles in a family-owned or -controlled organization: Family, Ownership and Management. This model shows how the roles may overlap.

Everyone in the family (in all generations) obviously belongs to the Family circle, but some family members will never own shares in the family business, or ever work there. A family member is concerned with social capital (reputation within the community), dividends, and family unity.

The Ownership circle may include family members, investors and/or employee-owners. An owner is concerned with financial capital (business performance and dividends).
The Management circle typically includes non-family members who are employed by the family business. Family members may also be employees. An employee is concerned with social capital (reputation), emotional capital (career opportunities, bonuses and fair performance measures).

A few people—for example, the founder or a senior family member—may hold all three roles: family member, owner and employee. These individuals are intensely connected to the family business, and concerned with any or all of the above sources of value creation.

==The genogram==
A genogram is an organization chart for the family. It is an enhanced family tree that shows not only family events like births and deaths, but also indicates the relationships (close, conflicted, cut-off, etc.) among individuals in the family. It is a useful tool for spotting relationship patterns across generations, and decrypting seemingly irrational behavior.

Family myths—sets of beliefs that are shared by the family members—can play important defensive and protective roles in families. Myths help people cope with stress and anxiety and, by prescribing ritualistic behavior patterns, will enable them to establish a common front against the outside world. They provide a rationale for the way people behave, but because much of what makes up a family myth takes place deep beneath the surface, they also conceal the true issues, problems, and conflicts. Although these family myths can turn into a blueprint for family action, they can also turn into straitjackets, reducing a family's flexibility and capacity to respond to new situations. (''See also:'' [[Family nexus]].)&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genograms Assessment and Intervention (2nd edition)|year=1999|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|author=McGoldrick, M |author2=Gerson, R. |author3=Shellenberger, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel planning processes==
All businesses require planning, but business families face the additional planning task of balancing family and business demands. There are five critical issues where the needs of the family and the demands of the business overlap—and require parallel planning action to ensure that business success does not create a family or business disaster.&lt;ref name="Carlock 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Strategic Planning for the Family Business: Parallel Planning to Unify the Family and Business|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|author=Randel S Carlock|author2=John L Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=When Family Businesses are Best|date=October 2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|author=Carlock, Randel S.|author2=Ward, John L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#  '''Capital''' How are the firm’s financial resources allocated between different and family demands?
#  '''Control''' Who has decision-making power in the family and firm?
#  '''Careers''' How are individuals selected for senior leadership and governance positions in the firm or family?
#  '''Conflict''' How do we prevent this natural element of human relationships from becoming the default pattern of interaction?
#  '''Culture''' How are the family and business values sustained and transmitted to owners, employees and younger family members?

==Fair process==
Fairness is a fundamental issue in family business decision-making. Solutions that are perceived as fair by the family and business stakeholders are more likely to be accepted and supported. Fair process helps create organizational justice by engaging family members, whether as owners and employees, in a series of practical steps to address and resolve critical issues. Fair process lays a foundation for continued family participation over generations.

==Emotional dimension==
The challenge faced by family businesses and their stakeholders, is to recognise the issues that they face, understand how to develop strategies to address them and more importantly, to create narratives, or family stories that explain the emotional dimension of the issues to the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Family Business on the Couch: A Psychological Perspective|date=September 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=London|author=Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries |author2=Randel S. Carlock |author3=Elizabeth Florent-Treacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most intractable family business issues are not the business problems the organisation faces, but the emotional issues that compound them. Many years of achievement through generations can be destroyed by the next, if the family fails to address the psychological issues they face. Applying psychodynamic concepts will help to explain behaviour and will enable the family to prepare for life cycle transitions and other issues that may arise. Family-run organisations need a new understanding and a broader perspective on the human dynamics of family firms with two complementary frameworks, psychodynamic and family systematic.

==Structuring==
When the family business is basically owned and operated by one person, that person usually does the necessary balancing automatically. For example, the founder may decide the business needs to build a new plant and take less money out of the business for a period so the business can accumulate cash needed to expand. In making this decision, the founder is balancing his personal interests (taking cash out) with the needs of the business (expansion).

Most first generation owner/managers make the majority of the decisions. When the second generation (sibling partnership) is in control, the decision making becomes more consultative. When the larger third generation (cousin consortium) is in control, the decision making becomes more consensual, the family members often take a vote. In this manner, the decision making throughout generations becomes more rational.&lt;ref name="Alderson, K 2011"&gt;Alderson, K,. (2011). Understanding the Family Business. NY. Business Expert Press, {{ISBN|9781606491690}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The assets that are owned by the family, in most family businesses, are hard to separate from the assets
that belong to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walczak |first1=D. |last2=Voss |first2=G. |date=2013 |title=New Possibilities of Supporting Polish SMEs within the Jeremie Initiative Managed by BGK |url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/mjss/article/view/1144/1173 |journal=Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences |volume=4 |issue=9 |page=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scenarios==
Balancing competing interests often become difficult in three situations. The first situation is when the founder wants to change the nature of their involvement in the business. Usually the founder begins this transition by involving others to manage the business. Involving someone else to manage the company requires the founder to be more conscious and formal in balancing personal interests with the interests of the business because they can no longer do this alignment automatically—someone else is involved.

The second situation is when more than one person owns the business and no single person has the power and support of the other owners to determine collective interests. For example, if a founder intends to transfer ownership in the family business to their four children, two of whom work in the business, how do they balance these unequal differences? The four siblings need a system to do this themselves when the founder is no longer involved.

The third situation is when there are multiple owners and some or all of the owners are not in management. Given the situation above, there is a higher chance that the interests of the two off-spring not employed in the family business may be different from the interests of the two who are employed in the business. Their potential for differences does not mean that the interests cannot be aligned, it just means that there is a greater need for the four owners to have a system in place that differences can be identified and balanced.

These three scenarios can be mitigated by following the guidelines of TMP, or "The Maria Principle"

==Succession==
There appear to be two main factors affecting the development of family business and succession process: the size of the family, in relative terms the volume of business, and suitability to lead the organization, in terms of managerial ability, technical and commitment (Arieu, 2010).{{Full citation needed|date=August 2017}}
Arieu proposed a model in order to classify family firms into four scenarios: political, openness, foreign management and  [[Succession planning|natural succession]].

Potential successors who had professional experience outside the family business may decide to leave the firm to found a new one, either with or without the support of the family. Instead, successors tend to be characterized by professional experience only within the family business. The education of potential successors is a critical issue in the succession process because it affects the endowement of managerial capabilities of the firm.&lt;ref name="FBR"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pittino |first1=D. |last2=Visintin |first2=F. |last3=Lauto |first3=G. |date=May 2018 |title=Fly Away From the Nest? |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894486518773867 |journal=Family Business Journal |volume=in print |doi=10.1177/0894486518773867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest trends in family business is the number of women who are taking over their family firms. In the past, succession was reserved for the first-born son, then it moved on to any male heir. Now, women account for approx. 11-12% of all family firm leaders, an increase of close to 40% since 1996. Daughters are now considered to be one of the most underutilized resources in family businesses. To encourage the next generation of women to be valuable members of the business, potential female successors should be nurtured by assimilation into the family firm, mentoring, sharing of important tacit knowledge and having positive role models within the business.&lt;ref name="Alderson, K 2011"/&gt;

==Success==
Successfully balancing the differing interests of family members and/or the interests of one or more family members on the one hand and the interests of the business on the other hand require the people involved to have the competencies, character and commitment to do this work.

Family-owned companies present special challenges to those who run them. They can be quirky, developing unique cultures and procedures as they grow and mature. That is fine, as long as they continue to be managed by people who are steeped in the traditions, or at least able to adapt to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=2176257#ixzz0oesFCjGp |accessdate=May 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMJ1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pittino |first1=D. |last2=Visintin |first2=F. |last3=Lauto |first3=G. |date=April 2017 |title=A configurational analysis of the antecedents of entrepreneurial orientation |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026323731630086X |journal=European Management Journal |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=224–237 |doi=10.1016/j.emj.2016.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often family members can benefit from involving more than one professional advisor, each having the particular skill set needed by the family. Some of the skill sets that might be needed include communication, [[conflict resolution]], family systems, finance, legal, accounting, insurance, investing, leadership development, management development, and [[strategic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership in a family business will also show maturity of the business. If all the shares rest with one individual, a family business is still in its infant stage, even if the revenue is strong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=2176257# |accessdate=May 22, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Blake has attributed his participation in trading to a friend of his, who had shown him some municipal bonds and inquired for Blake's opinion. Blake noticed a trend in the numbers his colleague had showed him, and investigated further. His investigation led to the discovery that persistent trends in municipal bonds were decidedly systematic. This served as the basis of his mutual fund timing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://turtletrader.com/trader-blake/ | title = Gil Blake Profiled in the Market Wizards}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]], Blake placed second in the U.S. Trading Championships in 1988 and first in 1989-1993.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. This has been confirmed by Mr. Blake. [4] According to Andrew Selby’s posting on www.donttalkaboutyourstocks.com/market-wizard-gil-blake/ on February 26, 2013 his top five quotes from Gil Blake listed in Jack Schwager’s book Market Wizards (1992) were: Quote #1: "I’m not a big fan of diversification. If the odds are 70 percent in your favor and you make fifty trades, it’s very difficult to have a down year."  Quote #2: "Whenever I take a position, I like to imagine what it would be like under the worst-case scenario. In doing so, I minimize the confusion if that situation actually develops. In my view, losses are a very important part of trading. When a loss happens, I believe in embracing it."  Quote #3: "The lesson for me was that if you break a discipline once, the next transgression becomes much easier. Breaking a diet provides an appropriate analogy – once you do it, it becomes much easier to make further exceptions." Quote #4: "Opportunities change, strategies change, but people and psychology do not change. If trend following systems don’t work as well, something else will. There’s always money being lost, so someone out there has to win." and Quote #5: "First of all, most traders don’t have a winning strategy. Second, even among those traders who do, many don’t follow their strategy. Trading puts pressure on weaker human traits and seems to seek out each individual’s Achilles’ heel." [2,5]

Mr. Blake was born July 14, 1945 in New York, NY (not Pittsfield, MA).

{{Expert needed|Law|talk=Update|reason=information and references are antiquated|date=December 2013}}
'''Guarantee''' is a legal term more comprehensive and of higher import than either [[warranty]] or "security". It most commonly designates a private transaction by means of which one person, to obtain some trust, confidence or credit for another, engages to be answerable for him.  It may also designate a [[treaty]] through which claims, rights or possessions are secured. It is to be differentiated from the colloquial "personal guarantee" in that a Guarantee is a legal concept which produces an economic effect. A personal guarantee by contrast is often used to refer to a promise made by an individual which is supported by, or assured through, the word of the individual. In the same way, a guarantee produces a legal effect wherein one party affirms the promise of another (usually to pay) by promising to themselves pay if default occurs. 

At law, the giver of a guarantee is called the [[surety]] or the "guarantor". The person to whom the guarantee is given is the [[creditor]] or the "obligee"; while the person whose payment or performance is secured thereby is termed "the obligor", "the principal debtor", or simply "the principal".

Suretys have been classified as follows:
#Those in which there is an agreement to constitute, for a particular purpose, the relation of principal and surety, to which agreement the secured creditor is a party;
#those in which there is a similar agreement between the principal and surety only, to which the creditor is a stranger;
#those in which, without any such contract of suretyship, there is a primary and a secondary liability of two persons for one and the same debt, the debt being, as between the two, that of one of those persons only, and not equally of both, so that the other, if he should be compelled to pay it, would be entitled to reimbursement from the person by whom (as between the two) it ought to have been paid.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fox and Co. v. North and South Wales Bank, 6 App. Cas. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Guarantee is sometimes spelt "guarantie" or "guaranty".&lt;ref&gt;The guarantee (person) is sometimes distinguished from the guaranty (obligation).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is from an [[Old French]] form of "warrant", from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] word which appears in [[German language|German]] as ''wahren'': to defend or make safe and binding.{{citation needed|reason=source of etymology|date=December 2013}}

==Common law==

===England===
In [[English law]], a guarantee is a [[contract]] whereby the person (the guarantor) enters into an agreement to pay a [[debt]], or effect the performance of some duty by a third person who is primarily liable for that payment or performance. The extent of the debt that the guarantor is liable to this debt is co-extensive to the obligation of the third-party.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collateral contract, which does not extinguish the original obligation for payment or performance and is secondary to the primary obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Chitty on Contracts 32nd edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, Volume II Chapter 45-001, ''Lakeman v Mountstephen'' [1865] LR 7 HL 17, also cf Halsbury Laws of England &amp; Wales, Para 1013&lt;/ref&gt;  It is rendered null and void if the original obligation fails. Two forms of guarantee exists in England, (1) Guarantees creating a conditional payment, wherein if the principal fails, the guarantor will pay. Under this form, the guarantee is not enforceable until failure occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; (2) A "See-to-it" obligation where the guarantor's obligation is to ensure that the principal will carry out the obligation. Failure of the principal to do so will automatically make the guarantor in breach of his contractual obligation, on which the creditor can sue.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286&lt;/ref&gt;

The liabilities of a guarantor in law depend upon those of the principal [[debtor]], and when the principal's obligations cease the guarantor's do too,&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286. ''See'' Stacey v. Hill, I KB 666 (1901).  ''See'' Bateson v. Gosling, 1871 L.R. 7, 14&lt;/ref&gt; except in certain cases where the discharge of the principal debtor is by the operation of the law.&lt;ref&gt;''With regard to release of the debtor See'' Finley v Connell Associates [2002] Lloyds Rep PN 62 ''or also In re'' Fitzgeorge ''[[ex parte]]'' Robson, I KB 462 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[co-extensive]], secondary nature of the liability of the guarantor along with the fact that the guarantee is a contract to answer default, debt, or miscarriage; crucially differentiates the guarantee from an indemnity.&lt;ref&gt;Norwich and Peterborough Building Society v McGuinness [2010] EWCA Civ 1286 ''Also See'' Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law, OUP, 2007, Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; If, for example, a person wrongly supposes that someone is liable to them, and a guarantee is given on that erroneous basis, the guarantee is invalid by virtue of the law of contracts, because its foundation (that another was liable) failed.&lt;ref&gt;Mountstephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

No special phraseology is necessary to form a guarantee. What distinguishes a guarantee from [[insurance]] is not any difference between the words "insurance" and "guarantee", but the substance of the contract entered into by the parties.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v. Heath-Seaton v. Burnand, I QB 782, 792, C.A. (1899); ''In re'' Denton's Estate Licenses Insurance Corporation and Guarantee Fund Ltd. v. Denton, 2 Ch. 188 (1899); ''see'' Dane v. Mortgage Insurance Corporation, I Q.B. 54 C.A. (1894)&lt;/ref&gt;

The statutory requisites of a guarantee are, in England, prescribed firstly by the [[statute of frauds]], which provides in section 4 that "no action shall be brought whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another person, unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, or some [[memorandum]] or note thereof, shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized". This in effect means that the guarantee are not invalid but are merely unenforceable through a chose in personam. The requirement for a signature in writing was clarified in ''Elpis Maritimes Co v Marti Chartering Co Inc (the "Maria D") [1992] 1 AC 21'' and ''J Pereia Fernandes SA v Mehta [2006] EWHC 813 (Ch)''. In the latter, it was held that a contract was enforceable either by written agreement signed by the guarantor or his agent OR; if the guarantee was oral, a separate note or memorandum of the agreement could make the guarantee similarly enforceable. In the former, the court held it was sufficient that it was written or printed by the guarantor, a initial within an email was sufficient but a standard header name in an email was not. The court believed that the minor action was sufficient to engage the Statute as it had long been held that a single fingerprint, or "X" was sufficient. The [[Electronic Communications Act 2000]] created a power to issue statutory instruments to modify legislation so as to be congruent with modern use of electronic communications. This is congruent with Article 9 of the [[EU Directive on Electronic Commerce 2000]], this specifically allowed exceptions to the 'in writing' requirement of a guarantee. It has even been held that clicking a button to confirm personal details sufficiently discharges the Statute of Frauds requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Beale and Griffiths (2000) LMCLQ 467, 473&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requisite is Lord Tenterden's Act&lt;ref&gt;9 Geo. IV. c. 14 §6&lt;/ref&gt; which enacts that "no action shall be brought whereby to charge any person upon or by reason of any representation or assurance made or given concerning or relating to the character, conduct, credit, ability, trade or dealings of any other person, to the intent or purpose that such other person may obtain credit, money or goods upon unless such representation or assurance be made in writing signed by the party to be charged therewith".&lt;ref&gt;i.e. "upon credit"Lyde v. Barnard, 1 M. &amp; W. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Tenterden's Act, which applies to [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] companies and to individual persons,&lt;ref&gt;Hirst v. West Riding Union Banking Co., 2 K.B. 560 C.A. (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; was rendered necessary by an evasion of the statute of frauds, treating the guarantee for a debt, default or miscarriage, when not in writing as a fraudulent representation, giving rise to damages for a [[tort]].&lt;ref&gt;Pasley v. Freeman, 3 T.R. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Scotland, where a guarantee is called a "cautionary obligation," similar enactments to those just specified are contained in the Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 §6, while&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statute of frauds====
{{main article|Statute of frauds}}
The statute of frauds does not invalidate a verbal guarantee, but renders it unenforceable. It may therefore be available to support a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to an action, and money paid under it cannot be recovered.  An [[indemnity]] is not a guarantee within the statute, unless it contemplates the primary liability of a third person. It need not, therefore, be in writing when it is only a promise to become liable for a debt if the person to whom the promise is made should become liable.&lt;ref&gt;Wildes v. Dudlow, L.R. 19 Eq. 198; Harburg India-Rubber Co. v. Martin, 1902, I K.B. 786; Guild v. Conrad, 1894, 2 Q.B. 885 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither does the statute apply to the promise of a [[del credere]] agent to make no sales on behalf of his principal except to persons who are absolutely solvent, and renders the agent liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise. A promise to give a guarantee is within the statute, though not one to procure a guarantee. The general principles which determine what are guarantees within the statute of frauds are: (1) the primary liability of a third person must exist or be contemplated;&lt;ref&gt;Birkmyr v. Darnell, 1 Sm. L.C. Iith ed. 299; Mounistephen v. Lakeman, L.R. 7 Q.B. 196; L.R. 7 H.L. 17&lt;/ref&gt; (2) the promise must be made to the creditor; (3) there must be no liability by the surety independent of an express promise of guarantee; (4) the main object of the parties to the guarantee must be the fulfilment of a third party's obligation;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Harburg India-Rubber Comb Co. v. Martin, I K.B. 778, 786 (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; and (5) the contract entered into must not amount to a [[sales|sale]] by the creditor to the promiser of the security for a debt or of the debt itself&lt;ref&gt;''See'' de Colyar's ''Law of Guarantees and of Principal and Surety'', 3rd ed. pp. 65-161, where these principles are discussed in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards the kind of note or memorandum of the guarantee that will satisfy the statute of frauds, "no special promise to be made, by any person after the passing of this act, to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another person, being in writing and signed by the party to be charged, or some other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, shall be deemed invalid to support an action, suit or other proceeding, to charge the person by whom such promise shall have been made, by reason only that the consideration for such promise does not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document."&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 §3&lt;/ref&gt; Any writing embodying the terms of the agreement between the parties and signed by the party to be charged is sufficient; and the idea of agreement need not be present to the mind of the person signing.&lt;ref&gt;''In re'' Hoyle - Hoyle v. Hoyle, I Ch., 98 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, necessary that the names of the contracting parties should appear somewhere in writing; that the party to be charged, or his agent, should sign the agreement or another paper referring to it; and that, when the note or memorandum is made, a complete agreement shall exist. The memorandum need not be contemporaneous with the agreement itself.&lt;ref&gt;As regards the stamping of the memorandum or note of agreement, a guarantee cannot, in England, be given in evidence unless properly stamped.  [[Stamp Act]] 1891.  A guarantee for the payment of goods, however, requires no stamp. Nor is it necessary to stamp a written representation or assurance as to character within 9 Geo. IV. c. 14.  If under seal, a guarantee may require an [[ad valorem]] [[Revenue stamp|stamp]]; and, on certain prescribed terms, the stamps can be affixed any time after execution.  Stamp Act 1891, 15, amended by 15 of the Finance Act 1895&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, but not apparently elsewhere, there is a distinction between a '''surety''' and a '''guarantor'''.  A surety is usually bound with the principal, at the same time and on the same [[consideration]], while the contract of a guarantor is his own separate undertaking and the guarantor is not liable until [[due diligence]] has been exerted to compel the principal debtor to make good any default. There is no [[privity of contract]] between a surety and the principal debtor.  Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Bain v. Cooper, I Dowl. R. (N.S.) 11, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other common law jurisdictions===
In India a guarantee may be either oral or written&lt;ref&gt;Indian Contract Act §126&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Australia]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Sri Lanka]] it must be in writing.

In the Irish Statute of Frauds&lt;ref&gt;7 Will. III. c. 12&lt;/ref&gt; there are provisions identical with that found in the English Statute of Frauds.

==Civil law==
According to various existing [[civil code]]s, a suretyship, when the underlying obligation is "non-valuable", is null and void unless the invalidity is the result of personal incapacity of the principal debtor&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2012; Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822; Italy, 1899; Netherlands, 1858; Lower Canada, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, however, the mere personal incapacity of a minor to borrow suffices to eliminate the guarantee of a loan made to him&lt;ref&gt;Spain, 1824; Portugal, 822, §2, 1535, 1536&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian codes sanction guarantees expressly entered into "in view of debtor's want of legal capacity" to contract a valid principal obligation &lt;ref&gt;Egyptain Codes, Mixed Suits, 605; Native Tribunals, 496&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese code retains the surety's liability, in respect of an invalid principal obligation, until the latter has been legally rescinded&lt;ref&gt;art. 822, §I&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several codes civil sureties are divided into conventional, legal and judicial,&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium, 2015, 2040 et seq.; Spain, 1823; Lower Canada, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; while the Spanish code further divides them into gratuitous and for valuable [[consideration]].&lt;ref&gt;art. 1, 823&lt;/ref&gt;

The German code civil requires the surety's promise to be verified by writing where he has not executed the principal obligation.&lt;ref&gt;art. 766&lt;/ref&gt;  The Portuguese code renders a guarantee provable by all the modes established by law for the proof of the principal contract&lt;ref&gt;art. 826&lt;/ref&gt; According to most civil codes civil a guarantee like any other contract can usually be made verbally in the presence of witnesses and in certain cases (where for instance considerable sums of money are involved) ''sous signature privee''{{Technical statement|date=December 2013}} or by a judicial or notarial [[legal instrument|instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codes Civil, France and Belgium 1341; Spain, 1244; Portugal 2506, 2513; Italy, 1341 et seq.; Pothier's ''Law of Obligations'', Evans's ed. i. 257; ''Burge on Suretyship'', p. 19; van der Linden's ''Institutes of Holland'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The French and Belgian Codes, moreover, provide that suretyship is not to be presumed but must always be expressed&lt;ref&gt;art. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract law==
{{Main article|Contract|Offer and acceptance|Meeting of the minds}}
In England the common-law requisites of a guarantee are the same as any other [[contract]]. The mutual assent of two or more parties, competency to contract and valuable consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Pillan v. van Mierop and Hopkins, 3 Burr. 1666; Haigh v. Brooks, 10 A. &amp; E. 309; Barrell v. Trussell, 4 Taunt. 117; [[Indian Contract Act 1872]] §127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If the guarantee is made "under [[seal (device)|seal]]" no consideration may be required.  However, sealed contracts without consideration are no longer valid in most common law jurisdictions.{{citation needed|reason=support obsolescence of sealed contracts|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An offer to guarantee must be accepted, either by express or implied acceptance.

If a surety's assent to a guarantee has been procured by [[fraud]] by the person to whom it is given, there is no binding contract.  [[Fraud]] may consist of suppression, concealment or misrepresentation.  However, only facts that are really material to the risk undertaken need be spontaneously disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;Seaton v. Burn and Burn v. Seaton, 1900 A.C. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The competency of the parties to enter into a contract of guarantee may be affected by [[insanity]] or [[substance intoxication|intoxication]] of the surety, if known to the creditor, or by any disability. The ordinary disabilities are those of [[minor (law)|minors]].

In some guarantees the consideration is "entire". For example, in consideration for a [[lease]] being granted, the surety becomes answerable for the performance of the [[covenant (law)|covenants]] of the lease.  In other cases it is "fragmentary" or supplied from time to time, as where a guarantee is given to secure the balance of a running account at a bank, for goods supplied&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's v. Harper, 16 Ch. Div. 319&lt;/ref&gt; When the consideration is "entire", the guarantee runs on through the duration of the lease and is irrevocable. When the consideration is "fragmentary", unless the guarantee stipulates to the contrary, the surety may at any time terminate his liability under the guarantee.

Total [[failure of consideration]] or illegal consideration by the party giving a guarantee will prevent its being enforced. Though in all countries the mutual assent of two or more parties is essential to the formation of any contract,&lt;ref&gt;''See e.g.'' Codes Civil, Fr. and Bel. 1108; Port. 643, 647 et seq.; Spain, 1258, 1261; Italy, 1104; Holt. 1356; Lower Canada, 984&lt;/ref&gt; a consideration is not everywhere regarded as a necessary element.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Pothier's ''Law of Obligations'', Evans's edition vol. ii. p. l9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in Scotland a contract may be binding without a consideration to support it.&lt;ref&gt;Stair i. to. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liability==
{{Main article|Legal liability}}
The liability incurred by a surety under his guarantee depends upon its terms, and is not necessarily coextensive with that of the principal debtor. It is, however, obvious that the surety's obligation cannot exceed that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;de Colyar, ''Law of Guarantees'', 3rd ed. p. 233; Burge, ''Suretyship'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; By many existing civil codes, however, a guarantee which imposes on the surety a greater liability than that of the principal is not invalidated but is merely reducible to that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2013; Portugal 823; Spain, 1826; Italy, 1900; Netherlands, 1859; Lower Canada, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; However, in India the liability of the surety is, unless otherwise provided by contract, coextensive with that of the principal.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Contract Act 1872 §128&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the liability of the surety is less extensive in amount than that of the principal debtor, questions have arisen in England and America as to whether the surety is liable only for part of the debt equal to the limit of his liability, or, up to such limit, for the whole debt.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis v. Emmanuel, 4 Ex. Div. 157; Hobson v. Bass, 6 Ch. App. 792; Brandt, ''Suretyship'', sec. 219&lt;/ref&gt; The surety cannot be made liable except for a loss sustained by reason of the default guaranteed against. Moreover, in the case of a [[joint and several liability|joint and several guarantee]] by several sureties, unless all sign it none are liable thereunder.&lt;ref&gt;National Pro. Bank of England v. Brackenbury 1906, 22 Times L.R. 797&lt;/ref&gt;  The limit of the surety's liability must be construed so as to give effect to what may fairly be inferred to have been the intention of the parties as expressed in writing. In cases of doubtful import, recourse to [[parol evidence]] is permissible, to explain, but not to contradict, the written evidence of the guarantee.

As a general rule, the surety is not liable if the principal debt cannot be enforced. It has never been actually decided in England whether this rule holds good in cases where the principal debtor is a minor and on that account is not liable to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Kimball v. Newell 7 Hill (N.Y.) 116&lt;/ref&gt; When directors guarantee the performance by their company of a contract which is [[ultra vires|beyond their authority]], and therefore not binding on the company, the directors' liability is enforceable against them personally.&lt;ref&gt;Yorkshire Railway Waggon Co. v. Maclure, 21 Ch. D. 309 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination of liability===
It is not always easy to determine for how long liability under a guarantee endures. Sometimes a guarantee is limited to a single transaction, and is obviously intended to be security against one specific default only. On the other hand, it as often happens that it is not exhausted by one transaction on the faith of it, but extends to a series of transactions, and remains a standing security until it is revoked, either by the act of the parties or by the death of the surety. It is then termed a continuing guarantee.

No fixed rules of interpretation determine whether a guarantee is a continuing one or not, but each case must be judged on its individual merits.  Frequently, in order to achieve a correct construction, it becomes necessary to examine the surrounding circumstances, which often reveal what was the subject matter which the parties contemplated when the guarantee was given, and what was the scope and object of the transaction between them. Most continuing guarantees are either ordinary business securities for advances made or goods supplied to the principal debtor or else bonds for the good behavior of persons in public or private offices or employment. With regard to the latter class of continuing guarantees, the surety's liability is, generally speaking, revoked by any change in the constitution of the persons to or for whom the guarantee is given.&lt;ref&gt;Partnership Act 1890 §18, which applies to Scotland as well as England, provides that "a continuing guarantee or cautionary obligation given either to a firm or to a third person in respect of the transactions of a firm, is, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, revoked as to future transactions by any change in the constitution of the firm to which, or of the firm in respect of the transactions of which the guaranty or obligation was given." This section is mainly declaratory of the English common law, which indicates that the changes in the persons to or for whom a guarantee is given may consist either of an increase in their number, of a diminution thereof caused by death or [[retirement]] from business, or of the incorporation or consolidation of the persons to whom the guarantee is given.&lt;/ref&gt;  In England the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to vary the character of any security, for good behavior by the heads of public departments&lt;ref&gt;Government Offices (Security) Act 1875, Amended by the Statute Law Revision Act 1883&lt;/ref&gt; given by companies for the due performance of the duties of an office or employment in the public service.

===Limitation of liability===
Before the surety can be rendered liable on his guarantee, the principal debtor must have made default. When, however, this has occurred, the creditor, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, may sue the surety, without informing him of such default having taken place before proceeding against the principal debtor or resorting to [[securities]] for the debt received from the latter. In those countries where the municipal law is based on the [[Roman law]], sureties usually possess the right (which may, however, be renounced by them) of compelling the creditor to insist on the goods, etc. (if any) of the principal debtor being first "discussed," i.e., appraised and sold, and appropriated to the liquidation of the debt guaranteed before having recourse to the sureties.&lt;ref&gt;''See Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2021 et seq.; Spain, 1830, 1831; Portugal 830; Germany, 771, 772, 773; Netherlands, 1868; Italy, 1907; Lower Canada, 1941-1942; Egypt [mixed suits] 612; ibid. [native tribunals] 502&lt;/ref&gt; This right "accords with a common sense of justice and the natural equity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Hayes v. Ward, 4 Johns. New York, Ch. Cas. p. 132, (opinion by Kent, [[Chancellor]]&lt;/ref&gt; In England this right has never been fully recognized, nor does it prevail in America and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act (Scotland) 1856 §8&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, however, before any demand for payment has been made by the creditor on the surety, the latter can, as soon as the principal debtor has made default, compel the creditor, on giving him an [[indemnity]] against costs and expenses, to sue the principal debtor if the latter is solvent and able to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v. Bradford Banking Company 1894, 2 Ch. 75; Wright v. Simpson, 6 Yes. 733&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar remedy is also open to the surety in America.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Brandt on Suretyship'', p. 290 ¶205 Extent of surety's liability&lt;/ref&gt;  In neither of these countries nor in Scotland can one of several sureties, when sued for the whole guaranteed debt by the creditor, compel the latter to divide his claim among the sureties, and reduce it to the share and proportion of each surety. However, this ''beneficium divisionis'', as it is called in Roman law, is recognized by many existing codes.&lt;ref&gt;France and Belgium 2025-2027; Spain, 1837; Portugal, 835- 836; Germany, 426; Netherlands, 1873-1874; Italy, 1911-1912; Lower Canada, 1946; Egypt [mixed suits], 615,616&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement of liability===
The usual mode in England of enforcing liability under a guarantee is by action in the [[Her Majesty's High Court of Justice in England|High Court]] or a [[County court#England and Wales|County Court]]. It is also permissible for the creditor to obtain redress by means of a set-off or [[counterclaim]], in an action brought against him by the surety. On the other hand, the surety may now, in any court in which the action on the guarantee is pending, avail himself of any set-off which may exist between the principal debtor and the creditor. Moreover, if one of several sureties for the same debt is sued by the creditor or his guarantee, he can, by means of a third-party complaint, claim contribution from his co-sureties towards the common liability. Independent proof of the surety's liability under his guarantee must always be given at the trial.  The creditor cannot rely on admissions made by or a judgment or award against the principal debtor.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte'' Young ''In re'' Kitchin, 17 Ch. Div. 668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, 1883 §37&lt;/ref&gt;

A person liable as a surety for another under a guarantee possesses rights against the person to whom the guarantee was given. As regards the surety's rights against the principal debtor, where the guarantee was made with the debtors consent but not otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Hodgson, v. Shaw, 3 Myl. &amp; K. 190&lt;/ref&gt; after he has made default, be compelled by the surety to exonerate him from liability by payment of the guaranteed debt.&lt;ref&gt;Antrobus v. Davidson, 3 Meriv. 569, 579; Johnston v. Salvage Association, 19 Q.B.D. 460, 461; and Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 2 Ch. 514 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the surety has paid any portion of the guaranteed debt, the surety is entitled to rank as a creditor for the amount paid and to compel repayment.

In the event of the principal debtor's bankruptcy, the surety can in England act against the bankrupt's estate, not only in respect of payments made before the bankruptcy of the principal debtor, but also, it seems, in respect of the contingent liability to pay under the guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Ex parte'' Delmar re Herepath, 38 W.R. 752 (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;  If the creditor has already acted, the surety who has paid the guaranteed debt has a right to all dividends received by the creditor from the bankrupt in respect to the guaranteed debt, and to stand in the creditor's place as to future [[dividend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;This right is, however, often waived by the guarantee stipulating that, until the creditor has received full payment of all sums over and above the guaranteed debt, due to him from the principal debtor, the surety shall not participate in any dividends distributed from the bankrupt's estate amongst his creditors.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rights of the surety against the creditor are in England exercisable even by one who in the first instance was a principal debtor, but has since become a surety, by arrangement with his creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse v. The Bradford Banking Co., 1894 A.C. 586&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of surety against the creditor===
The surety's principal right against the creditor entitles him, after payment of the guaranteed debt, to the benefit of all [[securities]] which the creditor held against the principal debtor.  If the creditor has lost these securities by default or [[laches (equity)|laches]] or rendered them otherwise unavailable, the surety is discharged [[pro tanto]]. This right, which is not in abeyance till the surety is called on to pay extends to all securities, whether satisfied or not.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon v. Steel, 1901, 2 Ch. 602&lt;/ref&gt;  "[E]very person who being surety for the debt or duty of another, or being liable with another for any debt or duty, shall pay such debt or perform such duty, shall be entitled to have assigned to him, or to a trustee for him, every judgment, specialty, or other security, which shall be held by the creditor in respect of such debt or duty, whether such judgment, specialty, or other security shall or shall not be deemed at law to have been satisfied by the payment of the debt or performance of the duty, and such person shall be entitled to stand in the place of the creditor, and to use all the remedies, and, if need be, and upon a proper indemnity, to use the name of the creditor, in any action or other proceeding at law or in [[equity (legal concept)|equity]], in order to obtain from the principal debtor, or any co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, as the case may be, indemnification for the advances made and loss sustained by the person who shall have so paid such debt or performed such duty; and such payment or performance so made by such surety shall not be pleadable in bar of any such action or other proceeding by him, provided always that no co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor shall be entitled to recover from any other co-surety, co-contractor, or co-debtor, by the means aforesaid, more than the just proportion to which, as between those parties themselves, such last-mentioned person shall be justly liable".&lt;ref&gt;Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856, §5&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the surety to be [[subrogation|subrogated]] on payment by him of the guaranteed debt, to all the rights of the creditor against the principal debtor is recognized in America&lt;ref&gt;Tobin v. Kirk, 80 New York S.C.R. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and many other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2029; Spain, 1839; Portugal 839; Germany, - 994; Netherlands, 1877; Italy, 1916; Lower Canada, 2959; Egypt [mixed suits], 617; ibid. [native tribunals], 505&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights of surety against other sureties===
A surety is entitled to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is not the result of any contract, but is derived from a [[equity (legal concept)|equity]], on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case of a surety for a surety;&lt;ref&gt;''See ''In re'' Denton's Estate, 1904, 2 Ch. 178 C.A.&lt;/ref&gt; nor where a person becomes a surety jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolmershausen v. Gullick, 1893, 2 Ch. 514&lt;/ref&gt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy of a surety, proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one of them as an indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.

The Roman law did not recognize the right of contribution among sureties. It is, however, sanctioned by many existing codes.&lt;ref&gt;Code Civil France and Belgium 2033; Germany, 426,474; Italy, 1920; Netherlands, 1881; Spain, 1844; Portugal 845; Lower Canada, 1955; Egypt [mixed suits], 618, ibid. [native tribunals], 506; Indian Contract Act 1872, §§146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discharge of liability===
The most prolific ground of discharge of a guarantor usually arises from the creditor's conduct.  The governing principle is that if the creditor violates any rights which the surety possessed when he entered into the suretyship, even though the damage is only [[nominal damages|nominal]], the guarantee cannot be enforced.  The surety's discharge may be accomplished (1) by a variation of the terms of the contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, or of that between the creditor and the surety;&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Rickaby v. Lewis, 22 T.L.R. 130&lt;/ref&gt; (2) by the creditor taking a new security from the principal debtor in lieu of the original one; (3) by the creditor discharging the principal debtor from liability; (4) by the creditor binding himself to give time to the principal debtor for payment of the guaranteed debt; or (5) by loss of securities received by the creditor in respect of the guaranteed debt. The first four of these acts are collectively termed a [[novation]]. In general whatever extinguishes the principal obligation necessarily determines that of the surety, not only in England but elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil, France and Belgium 2034, 2038; Spain 1847; Portugal 848; Lower Canada, 1956; 1960; Egypt [mixed suits], 622, ibid. [native tribunals], 509; Indian Contract Act 1872, sec. 134&lt;/ref&gt;  By most civil codes the surety is discharged by conduct of the creditor inconsistent with the surety's rights,&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Codes Civil France and Belgium 2037; Spain, 1852; Portugal 853; Germany, 776; Italy, 1928; Egypt [mixed suits], 623&lt;/ref&gt; although the rule prevailing in England, Scotland, America and India which releases the surety from liability when the creditor extends without the surety's consent the time for fulfilling the principal obligation, while recognized by two existing codes civil,&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil Spain, 1851; Portugal 852&lt;/ref&gt; is rejected by the majority of them.&lt;ref&gt;Codes Civil France and Belgium 2039; Netherlands, 1887; Italy, 1930; Lower Canada, 1961; Egypt [mixed suits], 613; ib. [native tribunals], 503); ''see'' Morice, ''English and Dutch Law'', p. 96; van der Linden, ''Institutes of Holland'', pp. 120-121&lt;/ref&gt; A revocation of the contract of suretyship by act of the parties, or in certain cases by the death of the surety, may also operate to discharge the surety.

The [[death]] of a surety does not per se determine the guarantee, but, save where from its nature the guarantee is irrevocable by the surety himself, it can be revoked by express notice after his death, or by the creditor becoming receiving [[constructive notice]] of the death; except where, under the testator's [[will (law)|will]], the [[executor]] has the option of continuing the guarantee, in which case the executor should specifically withdraw the guarantee in order to terminate it.  If one of a number of joint and several sureties dies, the future liability of the survivors continues, at least until it has been terminated by express notice.  In such a case, however, the estate of the deceased surety would be relieved from liability. The [[statute of limitations]] may bar the right of action on guarantees subject to variation by statute in any [[U.S. state]] where the guarantee is sought to be enforced.

The '''Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation''' was established by [[Harry Guggenheim]] to support research on violence, aggression, and dominance.

The foundation writes: "He was convinced that solid, thoughtful, scholarly and scientific research, experimentation, and analysis would in the end accomplish more than the usual solutions impelled by urgency rather than understanding. We do not yet hold the solution to violence, but better analyses, more acute predictions, constructive criticisms, and new, effective ideas will come in time from investigations such as those supported by our grants."

The foundation places a priority on the study of [[neuroscience]], [[genetics]], animal behavior, the social sciences, history, criminology, and the humanities which illuminate modern human problems. Grants are made to study aspects of "violence related to youth, family relationships, media effects, crime, biological factors, intergroup conflict related to religion, ethnicity, and nationalism, and political violence deployed in war and sub-state terrorism, as well as processes of peace and the control of aggression."

In 2014, the foundation gave out the inaugural [[Guggenheim-Lehrman Prize in Military History]] to [[Allen C. Guelzo]], for ''Gettysburg: The Last Invasion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfg.org/prize/main.htm |title=Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation |publisher=HFG |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825010741/http://www.hfg.org/prize/main.htm |archivedate=2014-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/book-on-gettysburg-wins-50000-military-history-prize/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|title=Book on Gettysburg Wins $50,000 Military History Prize|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?318399-1/inaugural-guggenheimlehrman-prize-military-history |title=Inaugural GuggenheimLehrman Prize Military &amp;#124; Video |publisher=C-SPAN.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Ainslie''' (1787–1844) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] shepherd, best known as the first overseer of the property known as [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. During his time on the Limestone Plains he is said to have had a relationship with an Aboriginal woman. After 10 years at Duntroon, Ainslie  returned to Scotland and after numerous offences committed suicide in jail in 1844.&lt;ref name=henderson&gt;Henderson, Rowan. James Ainslie: Stranger than fiction [online]. Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society, Vol. 98, No. 2, Dec 2012: 227-248. Availability: &lt;http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=060895106086673;res=IELHSS&gt; ISSN: 0035-8762. [cited 02 Nov 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

The suburb [[Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory|Ainslie]], originally a part of Duntroon, is named after James Ainslie, as is [[Mount Ainslie]].

==Early life==
James Ainslie was born in Roxburghshire Scotland (at the [[Scottish Borders]]) in 1787.  He married Betty Catteral in [[Rufford, Lancashire]] in 1818.  

The couple had a son in 1820, also named James Ainslie. Before their child's first birthday, Betty died age 25.

==Time in Australia==
[[File:Mount Ainslie from Parliament House (2444619761).jpg|thumb|right|A view of Mount Ainslie from Parliament House.  Mount Ainslie is a prominent landmark in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] named after James Ainslie.]]
Leaving his son behind, James Ainslie traveled to [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the ship ''Admiral Cockburn'', arriving in February 1825.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt; He was recruited by [[Robert Campbell (1769–1846)|Robert Campbell]] in 1825 to establish a sheep station in the Limestone Plains of New South Wales.  On his way from [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] to find an appropriate site for a sheep station, Ainslie and his convict labourers came across a terrified group of [[Aboriginal Australians]] near [[Boorowa, New South Wales|Booroowa]].  It is said that the Indigenous people had never seen sheep or white people before and believing Ainslie to be a dead spirit "sacrificed" a woman to him, who they had earlier "stolen" from down on the Yass plains.&lt;ref name=CanberraPaulDaley2012&gt;{{cite book|title=Canberra|year=2012|publisher=UNSW Press Ltd|location=Sydney|isbn=9781742241210|author=Paul Daley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainslie was guided to the south-east by that woman&lt;ref name=SMHCleavage2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleavage gives Canberra allure|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/cleavage-gives-canberra-allure-20121116-29hgk.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=19 March 2013|author=Tony Wright|date=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established Campbell's property, later named [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]] in the area of present-day [[Canberra]].

In 1827 the unknown woman and James Ainslie had a daughter, called Ju Nin Mingo - or Nanny.&lt;ref name=CanberraPaulDaley2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MtTaylor2606&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart of the Nation: Mount Taylor 2606|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/heart-of-the-nation-mount-taylor-2606/story-e6frg8h6-1226593171250|publisher=The Australian|accessdate=19 March 2013|author=Ross Bilton|date=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ainslie ran Campbell's sheep station for around a decade, turning his flock of sheep from [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] into a flock of 20,000 (after sales).&lt;ref name=CanberraPaulDaley2012 /&gt; It was during this time that [[Mount Ainslie]] was named after him.&lt;ref name=CanberraPaulDaley2012 /&gt; 

In January 1835, Robert Campbell announced there had been "irregularities and insubordination...occasioned by a [liquor] Store on a neighbouring Farm"&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt; and made it known that he would henceforth pay no more orders drawn by Mr Ainslie.  Within two months of the announcement, Ainslie was making preparations to leave Australia.  He advertised in the ''Sydney Herald'' that he was about to "quit the Colony".&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt; 

Leaving behind his partner and his daughter, Ainslie sailed on the ''Edinburgh'' to [[Liverpool]], [[England]] from Sydney, departing 16 March 1835.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt; From Liverpool, he made his way back to the Scottish Borders.

==After his return to Scotland==
Between 1835 and 1844 Ainslie was often in trouble with the law including for assaults and public nuisance.&lt;ref name=DownhillCTJul2013&gt;{{cite web|title=After Canberra, it was all downhill for James Ainslie|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/after-canberra-it-was-all-downhill-for-james-ainslie-20120730-239ya.html|publisher=The Canberra Times|accessdate=19 March 2013|author=Ian Warden|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, court documents were prepared stating that Ainslie had "came home to see his son with the intention of returning to the Colony... but he has not yet found it convenient to return".&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Scotland, JC26/1842/603 (13) Trial papers relating to James Ainslie for the crime of assault, malicious mischief, breach of the peace at Mill Wynd, Kelso, Roxburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

On 11 April 1844, Ainslie committed suicide in [[Jedburgh Castle|Jedburgh Castle Jail]] aged 60. He hanged himself while awaiting trial for a charge of assault.&lt;ref name=henderson/&gt;

'''James Joseph "J.J." Brown''' (September 27, 1854 – September 5, 1922), was an American mining engineer, inventor, and self-made member of fashionable "society". His wife was ''[[RMS Titanic]]'' survivor [[Margaret Brown|Molly Brown]].

J.J. was born in [[Waymart, Pennsylvania]]. His father, James Brown, was an Irish immigrant. His mother, Cecilia Palmer, was a schoolteacher. J.J's family moved to [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]] shortly after his birth. J.J's mother home-schooled him and later sent him to St. John's Academy. He left home at the age of 23, lured by the riches in the West. His first stop was a farm in [[Nebraska]]. From Nebraska he moved to the placer mines in the Dakotas. He spent two years learning the mining trade before moving to Colorado where he tried his luck in Georgetown, Aspen, and Ashcroft. He spent another two years in the [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] and Ashcroft area before moving to [[Alma, Colorado|Alma]], [[Fairplay, Colorado|Fairplay]], [[Red Cliff, Colorado|Red Cliff]], and, finally, [[Leadville]]. He studied geology, ore deposits, and mining techniques to become a better miner.

==Marriage==
J.J. married [[Margaret Brown|Margaret Tobin]] on September 1, 1886, in Leadville's Annunciation Church. Margaret was later known as ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' when a Broadway fictionalized movie about her life titled, ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' was released in 1964. That was how Margaret's moniker ''Molly'' was acquired. Margaret Brown was one of the survivors of the [[RMS Titanic]] sinking in 1912. At the time of their marriage, J.J. was 31 and Margaret was 19. They first settled in [[Leadville, Colorado]] in a small, two-room log cabin, then later moved to a two bedroom house at 320 East Ninth Street.

The Browns had two children. Their first child, Lawrence Palmer Brown, nicknamed Larry, was born on August 30, 1887 in his maternal grandparents' four room cottage near the Mississippi River in [[Hannibal, Missouri]]. Larry married Eileen Elizabeth Horton (1890–1985) on January 1, 1911 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. They had two children, Lawrence Palmer "Pat" Brown Jr. (1911–1976) and Elizabeth "Betty" Brown (1913–1974). The marriage failed and Larry married Hollywood actress Mildred Gregory (1895–1956) on November 17, 1926 in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. This marriage produced no other children. Larry died on April 2, 1949. J.J. and Margaret's second child, Catherine Ellen Brown, nicknamed Helen, was born on July 22, 1889 in her parents' three bedroom house at 322 West Seventh Street in [[Leadville, Colorado]]. She married George Joseph Peter Adelheid Benziger (1877–1970) on April 7, 1913 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her children were James George Benziger (1914–1995) and George Peter Joseph Adelrich Benziger (1917–1985). Her grandchildren include Bradford Benziger (born December 13, 1944), Katherine Benziger (born July 12, 1947), Vincent Benziger (born August 3, 1950), Pamela Benziger Feeley (born 1946), Alice Lynne Davy (born 1948), Helen Anne Benziger (born 1950) and Heidi Rautio (born 1952). Helen died on September 18, 1970 Jackson County Nursing Home Carbondale, Jackson County Illinois.

===Separation===
In 1909, after 23 years of marriage, J.J. and Molly signed a separation agreement and went their separate ways. The agreement gave Margaret a cash settlement and possession of the Victorian mansion on Pennsylvania Street in Denver's Wealthy Capital Hill neighborhood, and also the summer mansion [[Avoca Lodge]] in Southwest Denver, near Bear Creak. She also received a $700 monthly allowance (equivalent to $19,066 today) to continue her travels and philanthropic activities. Although they never reconciled, they remained connected and cared for each other throughout their lives. At the time of J.J.'s death in 1922, Margaret told newspapers, ''"I've never met a finer, bigger, more worthwhile man than J.J. Brown."''{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Career==
Although J.J. was not born into wealth, he was ambitious, smart, and charismatic. He quickly rose through the mining ranks to shift-boss and timberman. He was foreman of the Louisville Mine by the time he and Margaret met. By 1887 he was superintendent of the Louisville Mine, and in 1888 he was superintendent of the Henriette &amp; Maid Consolidated Mining Company, at the time one of the most productive mines in the area.

The Brown family came into great wealth when J.J's engineering efforts proved instrumental in the production of a substantial gold and copper seam at the Little Jonny mine of his employers, Ibex Mining Company.

===Little Jonny mine===
J.J., who was the superintendent of all the Ibex properties, devised a method of using baled hay and timbers to stop cave-ins. His invention paid off. When the Little Jonny mine opened, vast quantities of high-grade copper and gold were found. The grade of gold was so pure and the vein so wide that it was heralded as the world's richest gold strike. By October 29, 1893, the Little Jonny was shipping 135 tons {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} of gold ore per day. J.J. was awarded 12,500 shares or 12.5% of stock and a seat on the board. The Ibex Company and its owners, including the Browns, became extraordinarily wealthy. In 1894, the Browns moved to [[Denver, Colorado]], buying a $30,000 Victorian mansion in Denver's wealthy Capitol Hill neighborhood. In 1897, they built a summer mansion [[Avoca Lodge]] in Southwest Denver, near Bear Creak.

==Death==
On September 5, 1922, J.J. died after suffering a series of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] at a hospital in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau, New York]], with his daughter Catherine by his side. He died without a will, and it took 5 years of fighting between Margaret and her two children to settle the estate. Due to their lavish spending, J.J. left an estate valued at only $238,000 (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|238000|1922}}}} today). Margaret was to receive $20,000 in cash and securities, and the interest on a $100,000 trust fund set up in her name. $118,000 was divided between her two children. Her son Lawrence received a $59,000 (worth ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1927}}}} today) trust fund, and her daughter Catherine received a $59,000 trust fund. From that time until her death in 1932, Margaret had no contact with her two children (but [[Margaret Brown|Margaret's page]] says they were reconciled). Both J.J. and Margaret are buried in the [[Cemetery of the Holy Rood]] in [[Westbury, New York]].

'''Julius Stjernvall''' (26 October 1874 – 6 May 1939) was a Finnish [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Stjernvall worked as manager in [[Finland|Finnish]] branch of [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] 1904–1914 and subsequently in [[Kone ja Silta]] until 1929; the company grew during his time through new products and [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]]. He was [[Minister of Trade and Industry (Finland)|Minister of Trade and Industry]] in the short-lived [[Ingman I Cabinet|Lauri Ingman's cabinet]] in 1918–1919&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://valtioneuvosto.fi/tietoa/historiaa/hallitukset-ja-ministerit/raportti/-/r/v9l/6|title=Finnish Government - Ministers of Trade and Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Valtioneuvosto.fi|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=no|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and studies ==

He graduated from [[Hamina Cadet School|Finnish Cadet School]] in [[Hamina]] in 1896.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; During his studies he served as [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 132nd [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] [[Infantry]] Regiment. He was later promoted [[lieutenant]] in 1907 when he was already in [[Military reserve force|reserve]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Stjernvall continued his studies in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki]] and graduated in 1900 as [[Mechanical Engineer]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt;

== Career ==
During 1904–1914 Stjernvall led technical office of [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] in [[Helsinki]];&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; in this period the company built the first [[steam turbine]] [[power plant]] of Finland in [[Tampere]] and connected [[Sveaborg]] to [[electrical grid]] through an [[Submarine communications cable|undersea cable]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Stjernvall represented [[Finnish nobility|nobility]] and [[Chivalric order|chivalry]] in [[Diet of Finland]] in 1904–1905.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; In 1914, shortly before the [[First World War]] Stjernvall moved to [[Kone- ja Siltarakennus]] (Kone ja Silta) as Deputy Director.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Due to intense [[arms race]] between the European [[superpower]]s prior the war, the company had a good order backlog from the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Russian military]]; Kone ja Silta produced [[munition]] and other military supplies, and repaired ships of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Stjernvall became company manager in 1917.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.141-151"/&gt; In the same year [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|Finland became independent]]. In 1918 [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] asked him to join in [[Ingman I Cabinet|Lauri Ingman's cabinet]] as [[Ministry of Trade and Industry (Finland)|Minister of Trade and Industry]]. Stjernvall agreed, but the cabinet turned out to be short-living, and already after few months, he was back.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

Kone ja Silta grew strongly during Stjernvall's time. In 1923 the company started producing [[Abloy]] locks.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Kone ja Silta took over [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works]]&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; on 22 December 1926. The articles of association were changed uniform with Kone ja Silta in December 1927, after which both companies shared the same management.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.90-104"/&gt;

In 1928–1929 the company turnover reached 90 million [[Finnish markka|marks]] and made 3 million marks' profit. At the time Kone ja Silta employed 1&amp;nbsp;300 people.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

Stjernvall was entitled [[vuorineuvos]] in 1924.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

Stjernvall handed over his managerial post of Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering works to Robert Lavonius on 1 April 1929.&lt;ref name="OyHS&amp;K: s.90-104"/&gt; At the end of the same year he submitted his resignation to Kone ja Silta for health reasons.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

After his resignation, Stjernvall continued in [[Position of trust|positions of trust]] in [[Helsingin Osakepankki]] (HOP).&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt; Between 1918 and 1939 Stjernvall was twice the [[chairman of the Board]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

== Private life and tribute ==
Stjernvall had no family. A street was named after him, Stjernvallintie in [[Kulosaari]], until it was renamed Vuorineuvoksentie in 1958.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall I"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: Julius Stjernvall II"/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Kazuhiko "Kay"&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt; Nishi'''|西 和彦|Nishi Kazuhiko|extra=born February 10, 1956 in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]}} is a Japanese businessman and [[personal computer]] pioneer.

Nishi's father ran a private school. Nishi attended [[Waseda University]] but dropped out to help found the first Japanese computer magazine, ''I/O''. Shortly thereafter he launched ''[[ASCII (magazine)|ASCII]]'' magazine (a Japanese equivalent of ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' or ''[[Creative Computing]]'') and, in 1978, [[ASCII Corporation]], which began by making a rough translation from English to Japanese of the game ''[[Wizardry]]''. Around the same time he met and became friends with [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]].&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;&lt;ref name=Antiquarian/&gt;

In Japan, Nishi worked with [[NEC]] on developing the [[PC-8001]], an early consumer-ready personal computer not requiring assembly, which became a standard in Japan, and was involved in the design of the Kyotronic 85 which, sold to [[Tandy Corporation|Radio Shack]], became the [[TRS-80 Model 100]], an early [[laptop]] computer.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

Nishi's relationship with Bill Gates helped ASCII Corporation to grow. [[MSX]], a new personal computer format, was jointly developed by Microsoft and ASCII Corporation for the Japanese market. But Nishi and Gates fell out,&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt; the partnership was dissolved in 1986, and Microsoft set up its own Japanese software subsidiary. But ASCII Corporation continued to thrive.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

Under Nishi's direction, ASCII Corporation invested heavily in American startups in the electronics industry. By 1992 ASCII Corporation was heavily in debt and its stock price collapsed. At the direction of the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], the [[Industrial Bank of Japan]] and other banks bailed out the company, which rebounded.&lt;ref name=Wired/&gt;

ASCII Corporation became a subsidiary of [[Kadokawa Group Holdings]] in 2004, and merged with another Kadokawa subsidiary [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] on April 1, 2008, and became [[ASCII Media Works]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

After 1986, Nishi wrote for [[newspaper]]s and authored a number of books.{{vague|date=February 2017}} He sat in several committees on behalf of the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (Japan)|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]] and of the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]], and he is a member of the [[Committee for World Economy in the 21st Century]]. Nishi is the president of MSX Association, a private organization originating from an assembly of people with affinity with the MSX standard, and the president of [[Digital do MaiN]], audio engineering company.&lt;ref name=Digital_do_main_company_info/&gt;

In 2005, Nishi ran unsuccessfully for president of a small university in rural Japan.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

'''Lagos Island''' (Isale Eko) is the principal and central [[Local government areas of Nigeria|local government area]] (LGA) in [[Lagos]], [[Lagos State]].  It is part of the Lagos Division.  As of the preliminary 2006 Nigerian census, the LGA had a population of 209,437 in an area of 8.7&amp;nbsp;km².  The LGA only covers the western half of Lagos Island; the eastern half is under the jurisdiction of the LGA of [[Eti-Osa]].

==Overview==
Lying on [[Lagos Lagoon]], a large protected harbour on the coast of [[Africa]], the island was home to the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] fishing village of '''Eko''', which grew into the modern city of Lagos. The city has now spread out to cover the neighbouring islands as well as the adjoining mainland.

Lagos Island is connected to the mainland by three large bridges which cross Lagos Lagoon to the district of [[Ebute Metta]]. It is also linked to the neighbouring island of [[Ikoyi]] and to [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. The Lagos harbour district of [[Apapa]] faces the western side of the island. Forming the main commercial district of Lagos, Lagos Island plays host to the main government buildings, shops and offices. The Catholic and Anglican Cathedrals as well as the Central Mosque are located here.

Historically, Lagos Island (Isale Eko) was home to the Brazilian Quarter of Lagos where the majority of the slave trade returnees from Brazil settled. Many families lived on [[Broad Street, Lagos|Broad Street]] in the Marina.

[[File:1962 Lagos Island map detail Lagos Nigeria txu-oclc-441966035-lagos-1962.jpg|thumbnail|Detailed map of Lagos Island]]
The poorer eastern side of the island contains the main markets and the poorer housing. The island is extremely crowded and congested and attempts have been made to build new roads out over the lagoon in order to improve traffic flows. It is the part of Lagos where the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] (or king) of Lagos resides. It is also believed that the Eyo festival can only be held in this part of Lagos.

==Economy==

Most Nigerian banks' head offices are located on Lagos Island.
[[First Bank of Nigeria]] is one of the Nigerian banks with its head office in Marina, Lagos Island. Another bank that has its head office situated in Lagos Island is United Bank for Africa (UBA). Other medium and large-scale businesses such as real estate consultancy firms, electrical appliances manufacturers and retail stores are based in Marina, Lagos Island.

===Tom Jones Memorial Hall And Library===
Located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Street, [[Idumota Market|Idumota]], formerly Victoria St, Tom Jones Memorial hall is noteworthy as the venue of the call for positive action by [[Zikism|zikists]] in November 1948. The hall was built by trustees selected by Mr Thomas Jones who died in 1913, In his will, he bequeathed the land and funds for a hall and library in his memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1920 |title=Judicial Committee of the Privy Council |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDdHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=tom+jones+hall+library+lagos+1913&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YpyXGL7PzI&amp;sig=zL-dXB1UKPxiQ4QZFvnMhukmemQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGisqsy6bdAhVQzlkKHanXBm0Q6AEwBHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tom%2520jones%2520hall%2520library%2520lagos%25201913&amp;f=false |journal=Western Weekly Reports |language=en |publisher=Burroughs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marina road===
The Lagos Marina host a number of office buildings, Bookshop House, formerly CMS and the [[Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos|Cathedral Church of Christ]]. Due to the conditions of the soil, the foundations of most of the tall buildings are either piled or raft. Buildings along the marina include National House, occupied by Shell, this was the first tall office building at Marina. Former Central Bank headquarters and Investment House, headquarters of [[The Bank of Industry|Bank of Industry]] were built in 1960. The Investment House land previously housed Grand Hotel before it was demolished. New Africa House of UAC, [[Elder Dempster Lines|Elder Dempster]] House, [[Nigerian Ports Authority]] head office and [[National Electric Power Authority]]'s former headquarters are located along the marina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/building-lagos/oclc/26014518 |title=Building lagos |last=Akinsemoyin |first=ʼKunle |date=1977 |publisher=F. &amp; A.

== History ==
Metadata was traditionally used in the [[library catalog|card catalogs]] of [[library|libraries]] until the 1980s, when libraries converted their catalog data to digital databases. In the 2000s, as digital formats were becoming the prevalent way of storing data and information, metadata was also used to describe digital data using [[metadata standards]].

The first description of "meta data" for computer systems is purportedly noted by MIT's Center for International Studies experts David Griffel and Stuart McIntosh in 1967: "In summary then, we have statements in an object language about subject descriptions of data and token codes for the data. We also have statements in a meta language describing the data relationships and transformations, and ought/is relations between norm and data." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Tobias|date=2017-11-23|title=Metadaten und OER: Geschichte einer Beziehung (Metadata and OER: [hi]story of a relationship)|url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:16929/|journal=Synergie. Fachmagazin für Digitalisierung in der Lehre|language=de-DE|volume=04|doi=10.17613/m6p81g|issn=2509-3096|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different metadata standards for each different discipline (e.g., [[museum]] collections, [[digital audio file]]s, [[website]]s, etc.). Describing the [[Content (media)|contents]] and [[Context (computing)|context]] of data or [[computer file|data files]] increases its usefulness. For example, a [[HTML editor|web page]] may include metadata specifying what software language the page is written in (e.g., HTML), what tools were used to create it, what subjects the page is about, and where to find more information about the subject. This metadata can automatically improve the reader's experience and make it easier for users to find the web page online.&lt;ref name="Practices in Using Metadata"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/dcc/bestpractices/chapter_11_structuralmetadata.html | title=Best Practices for Structural Metadata | publisher=University of Illinois | date=15 December 2010 | accessdate=17 June 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624011712/http://www.library.illinois.edu/dcc/bestpractices/chapter_11_structuralmetadata.html | archivedate=24 June 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CD]] may include metadata providing information about the musicians, singers and songwriters whose work appears on the disc.

A principal purpose of metadata is to help users find relevant information and discover resources. Metadata also helps to organize electronic resources, provide digital identification, and support the archiving and preservation of resources. Metadata assists users in resource discovery by "allowing resources to be found by relevant criteria, identifying resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information."&lt;ref name = Understanding_Metadata/&gt; Metadata of telecommunication activities including [[Internet]] traffic is very widely collected by various national governmental organizations. This data is used for the purposes of [[traffic analysis]] and can be used for [[mass surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/03/metadata_surveillanc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621225840/https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/03/metadata_surveillanc.html |archivedate=21 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the metadata relating to emails, telephone calls, web pages, video traffic, IP connections and cell phone locations are routinely stored by government organizations.&lt;ref name="NSA_Watching"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/03/nsa-recorded-every-single-call-one-country-country-america.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222081255/http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/03/nsa-recorded-every-single-call-one-country-country-america.html |archivedate=22 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
# Metadata means "data about data". Although the "meta" prefix (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] preposition and [[prefix]] μετά-) means "after" or "beyond", it is used to mean "about" in epistemology. Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarize basic information about data which can make tracking and working with specific data easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples include:
* Means of creation of the data
* Purpose of the data
* Time and date of creation
* Creator or author of the data
* Location on a [[computer network]] where the data was created
* [[Technical standard|Standards]] used
* File size
* Data quality
* Source of the data
* Process used to create the data

For example, a [[digital image]] may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color depth, the image resolution, when the image was created, the shutter speed, and other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adeoimaging.com |title=ADEO Imaging: TIFF Metadata |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517055358/http://www.adeoimaging.com/ |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A text document's metadata may contain information about how long the document is, who the author is, when the document was written, and a short summary of the document. Metadata within web pages can also contain descriptions of page content, as well as key words linked to the content.&lt;ref name="Rouse, M (2014)"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These links are often called "Metatags", which were used as the primary factor in determining order for a web search until the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="Rouse, M (2014)"/&gt; The reliance of metatags in web searches was decreased in the late 1990s because of "keyword stuffing".&lt;ref name="Rouse, M (2014)"/&gt; Metatags were being largely misused to trick search engines into thinking some websites had more relevance in the search than they really did.&lt;ref name="Rouse, M (2014)"/&gt;

Metadata can be stored and managed in a [[database]], often called a [[metadata registry]] or [[metadata repository]].&lt;ref&gt;Hüner, K.; Otto, B.; Österle, H.: Collaborative management of business metadata, in: ''International Journal of Information Management'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, without context and a point of reference, it might be impossible to identify metadata just by looking at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/ore/pdf/st000010.pdf |title=Metadata Standards And Metadata Registries: An Overview |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629082434/http://www.bls.gov/ore/pdf/st000010.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: by itself, a database containing several numbers, all 13 digits long could be the results of calculations or a list of numbers to plug into an equation - without any other context, the numbers themselves can be perceived as the data. But if given the context that this database is a log of a book collection, those 13-digit numbers may now be identified as [[ISBN]]s - information that refers to the book, but is not itself the information within the book. The term "metadata" was coined in 1968 by Philip Bagley, in his book "Extension of Programming Language Concepts" where it is clear that he uses the term in the ISO 11179 "traditional" sense, which is "structural metadata" i.e. "data about the containers of data"; rather than the alternative sense "content about individual instances of data content" or metacontent, the type of data usually found in library catalogues.&lt;ref name=Bagley&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} While this is the generally accepted definition, various disciplines have adopted their own more specific explanation and uses of the term.

== Types ==
While the metadata application is manifold, covering a large variety of fields, there are specialized and well-accepted models to specify types of metadata. [[Francis Bretherton|Bretherton]] &amp; Singley (1994) distinguish between two distinct classes: structural/control metadata and guide metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt; ''Structural metadata'' describes the structure of database objects such as tables, columns, keys and indexes. ''Guide metadata'' helps humans find specific items and are usually expressed as a set of keywords in a natural language. According to [[Ralph Kimball]] metadata can be divided into 2 similar categories: technical metadata and business metadata. ''Technical metadata'' corresponds to internal metadata, and ''business metadata'' corresponds to external metadata. Kimball adds a third category, ''process metadata''. On the other hand, NISO distinguishes among three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative.&lt;ref name=NISO/&gt;

''Descriptive metadata'' is typically used for discovery and identification, as information to search and locate an object, such as title, author, subjects, keywords, publisher. ''Structural metadata'' describes how the components of an object are organized. An example of structural metadata would be how pages are ordered to form chapters of a book. Finally, ''administrative metadata'' gives information to help manage the source. Administrative metadata refers to the technical information, including file type, or when and how the file was created. Two sub-types of administrative metadata are rights management metadata and preservation metadata. ''Rights management metadata'' explains intellectual property rights, while ''preservation metadata'' contains information to preserve and save a resource.&lt;ref name=Understanding_Metadata&gt;{{cite book|last=National Information Standards Organization|title=Understanding Metadata|year=2004|publisher=NISO Press|location=Bethesda, MD|isbn=1-880124-62-9|url=http://www.niso.org/publications/press/UnderstandingMetadata.pdf|author2=Rebecca Guenther|author3=Jaqueline Radebaugh|accessdate=2 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107022958/http://www.niso.org/publications/press/UnderstandingMetadata.pdf|archivedate=7 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

Statistical data repositories have their own requirements for metadata in order to describe not only the source and quality of the data&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; but also what statistical processes were used to create the data, which is of particular importance to the statistical community in order to both validate and improve the process of statistical data production&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

An additional type of metadata beginning to be more developed is ''accessibility metadata''. ''Accessibility metadata'' is not a new concept to libraries; however, advances in universal design have raised its profile.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beyene|first1=Wondwossen Mulualem|title=Metadata and universal access in digital library environments|journal=Library Hi Tech|date=2017|volume=35|issue=2|doi=10.1108/LHT-06-2016-0074}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213-214}} Projects like Cloud4All and GPII identified the lack of common terminologies and models to describe the needs and preferences of users and information that fits those needs as a major gap in providing universal access solutions.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210-211}}. Those types of information are accessibility metadata.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}} [http://Schema.org Schema.org] has incorporated several accessibility properties based on IMS Global Access for All Information Model Data Element Specification.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}} The Wiki page [https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/Accessibility WebSchemas/Accessibility] lists several properties and their values.

While the efforts to describe and standardize the varied accessibility needs of information seekers are beginning to become more robust their adoption into established metadata schemas has not been as developed. For example, while Dublin Core (DC)'s “audience” and MARC 21's “reading level” could be used to identify resources suitable for users with dyslexia and DC's “Format” could be used to identify resources available in braille, audio, or large print formats, there is more work to be done.&lt;ref name = "Beyene (2017)"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|214}}

== Structures ==
Metadata (metacontent) or, more correctly, the vocabularies used to assemble metadata (metacontent) statements, is typically structured according to a standardized concept using a well-defined metadata scheme, including: [[metadata standards]] and [[Metadata modeling|metadata models]]. Tools such as [[Controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]], [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesauri]], [[Data Dictionary|data dictionaries]], and [[Metadata registry|metadata registries]] can be used to apply further standardization to the metadata. Structural metadata commonality is also of paramount importance in [[data model]] development and in [[database design]].

Metadata (metacontent) syntax refers to the rules created to structure the fields or elements of metadata (metacontent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cathro3.html|title=Metadata: an overview|last=Cathro|first=Warwick|authorlink=Warwick Cathro|date=|year=1997|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222232625/http://www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cathro3.html|archive-date=22 December 2009|dead-url=no|accessdate=6 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single metadata scheme may be expressed in a number of different markup or programming languages, each of which requires a different syntax. For example, Dublin Core may be expressed in plain text, [[HTML]], [[XML]], and [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of (guide) metacontent is the bibliographic classification, the subject, the [[List of Dewey Decimal classes|Dewey Decimal class number]]. There is always an implied statement in any "classification" of some object. To classify an object as, for example, Dewey class number 514 (Topology) (i.e. books having the number 514 on their spine) the implied statement is: "&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;book&gt;&lt;subject heading&gt;&lt;514&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This is a subject-predicate-object triple, or more importantly, a class-attribute-value triple. The first two elements of the triple (class, attribute) are pieces of some structural metadata having a defined semantic. The third element is a value, preferably from some controlled vocabulary, some reference (master) data. The combination of the metadata and master data elements results in a statement which is a metacontent statement i.e. "metacontent = metadata + master data". All of these elements can be thought of as "vocabulary". Both metadata and master data are vocabularies which can be assembled into metacontent statements. There are many sources of these vocabularies, both meta and master data: UML, EDIFACT, XSD, Dewey/UDC/LoC, SKOS, ISO-25964, Pantone, Linnaean Binomial Nomenclature, etc. Using controlled vocabularies for the components of metacontent statements, whether for indexing or finding, is endorsed by [[ISO 25964]]: "If both the indexer and the searcher are guided to choose the same term for the same concept, then relevant documents will be retrieved."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:25964:-1:ed-1:v1:en {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617031837/https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/ |date=17 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant when considering search engines of the internet, such as Google. The process indexes pages then matches text strings using its complex algorithm; there is no intelligence or "inferencing" occurring, just the illusion thereof.

=== Hierarchical, linear and planar schemata ===
Metadata schemata can be hierarchical in nature where relationships exist between metadata elements and elements are nested so that parent-child relationships exist between the elements.
An example of a hierarchical metadata schema is the [[Learning object metadata|IEEE LOM]] schema, in which metadata elements may belong to a parent metadata element.
Metadata schemata can also be one-dimensional, or linear, where each element is completely discrete from other elements and classified according to one dimension only.
An example of a linear metadata schema is the [[Dublin Core Metadata Initiative|Dublin Core]] schema, which is one dimensional.
Metadata schemata are often two dimensional, or planar, where each element is completely discrete from other elements but classified according to two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| archivedate = 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypermapping ===
In all cases where the metadata schemata exceed the planar depiction, some type of [[hypermap]]ping is required to enable display and view of metadata according to chosen aspect and to serve special views. Hypermapping frequently applies to layering of geographical and geological information overlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXII/part4/kuebler51.pdf |title=THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A GEOLOGIC HYPERMAP PROTOTYPE |first1=Stefanie |last1=Kübler |first2=Wolfdietrich |last2=Skala |first3=Agnès |last3=Voisard |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003182157/http://www.isprs.org/proceedings/XXXII/part4/kuebler51.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Granularity ===
The degree to which the data or metadata is structured is referred to as its [[Data granularity|"granularity"]]. "Granularity" refers to how much detail is provided. Metadata with a high granularity allows for deeper, more detailed, and more structured information and enables greater level of technical manipulation. A lower level of granularity means that metadata can be created for considerably lower costs but will not provide as detailed information. The major impact of granularity is not only on creation and capture, but moreover on maintenance costs. As soon as the metadata structures become outdated, so too is the access to the referred data. Hence granularity must take into account the effort to create the metadata as well as the effort to maintain it.

== Standards ==
International standards apply to metadata. Much work is being accomplished in the national and international standards communities, especially [[ANSI]] (American National Standards Institute) and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (International Organization for Standardization) to reach consensus on standardizing metadata and registries. The core metadata registry standard is [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 11179 Metadata Registries (MDR), the framework for the standard is described in ISO/IEC 11179-1:2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(see [[ISO/IEC 11179]]). This standard specifies a schema for recording both the meaning and technical structure of the data for unambiguous usage by humans and computers. ISO/IEC 11179 standard refers to metadata as information objects about data, or "data about data". In ISO/IEC 11179 Part-3, the information objects are data about Data Elements, Value Domains, and other reusable semantic and representational information objects that describe the meaning and technical details of a data item. This standard also prescribes the details for a metadata registry, and for registering and administering the information objects within a Metadata Registry. ISO/IEC 11179 Part 3 also has provisions for describing compound structures that are derivations of other data elements, for example through calculations, collections of one or more data elements, or other forms of derived data. While this standard describes itself originally as a "data element" registry, its purpose is to support describing and registering metadata content independently of any particular application, lending the descriptions to being discovered and reused by humans or computers in developing new applications, databases, or for analysis of data collected in accordance with the registered metadata content. This standard has become the general basis for other kinds of metadata registries, reusing and extending the registration and administration portion of the standard.

The Geospatial community has a tradition of specialized [[geospatial metadata]] standards, particularly building on traditions of map- and image-libraries and catalogues. Formal metadata is usually essential for geospatial data, as common text-processing approaches are not applicable.

The [[Dublin Core]] metadata terms are a set of vocabulary terms which can be used to describe resources for the purposes of discovery.

Although not a standard, [[Microformat]] (also mentioned in the section [[Metadata#Metadata on the Internet|metadata on the internet]] below) is a web-based approach to semantic markup which seeks to re-use existing HTML/XHTML tags to convey metadata. Microformat follows XHTML and HTML standards but is not a standard in itself. One advocate of microformats, [[Tantek Çelik]], characterized a problem with alternative approaches: {{cquote|Here's a new language we want you to learn, and now you need to output these additional files on your server. It's a hassle. (Microformats) lower the barrier to entry.&lt;ref name="Wharton000"&gt;{{cite web |title=What's the Next Big Thing on the Web?

== Use ==

=== Photographs ===
Metadata may be written into a [[digital photo]] file that will identify who owns it, copyright and contact information, what brand or model of camera created the file, along with exposure information (shutter speed, f-stop, etc.) and descriptive information, such as keywords about the photo, making the file or image searchable on a computer and/or the Internet. Some metadata is created by the camera and some is input by the photographer and/or software after downloading to a computer. Most digital cameras write metadata about model number, shutter speed, etc., and some enable you to edit it;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=gurucamera.com|title=How To Copyright Your Photos With Metadata|url=https://gurucamera.com/copyright-photos-metadata/|work=Guru Camera|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630023616/https://gurucamera.com/copyright-photos-metadata/|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this functionality has been available on most Nikon DSLRs since the [[Nikon D3]], on most new Canon cameras since the [[Canon EOS 7D]], and on most Pentax DSLRs since the Pentax K-3. Metadata can be used to make organizing in post-production easier with the use of key-wording. Filters can be used to analyze a specific set of photographs and create selections on criteria like rating or capture time.

Photographic Metadata Standards are governed by organizations that develop the following standards. They include, but are not limited to:
* [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]] IIM (International Press Telecommunications Council),
* [[International Press Telecommunications Council|IPTC]] Core Schema for XMP
* [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] – Extensible Metadata Platform (an ISO standard)
* [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] – Exchangeable image file format, Maintained by CIPA (Camera &amp; Imaging Products Association) and published by JEITA (Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association)
* [[Dublin Core]] (Dublin Core Metadata Initiative – DCMI)
* PLUS (Picture Licensing Universal System).
* [https://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html VRA Core] (Visual Resource Association)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VRA Core Support Pages|url=http://core.vraweb.org|website=Visual Resource Association Foundation|publisher=Visual Resource Association Foundation|accessdate=27 February 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409191705/http://core.vraweb.org/|archivedate=9 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Telecommunications ===
Information on the times, origins and destinations of phone calls, electronic messages, instant messages and other modes of telecommunication, as opposed to message content, is another form of metadata. Bulk collection of this [[call detail record]] metadata by intelligence agencies has proven controversial after disclosures by [[Edward Snowden]] of the fact that certain Intelligence agencies such as the [[NSA]] had been (and perhaps still are) keeping online metadata on millions of internet user for up to a year, regardless of whether or not they [ever] were persons of interest to the agency.

=== Video ===
Metadata is particularly useful in video, where information about its contents (such as transcripts of conversations and text descriptions of its scenes) is not directly understandable by a computer, but where efficient search of the content is desirable. This is particularly useful in video applications such as [[Automatic number-plate recognition|Automatic Number Plate Recognition]] and [[Vehicle recognition identification|Vehicle Recognition Identification]] software, wherein license plate data is saved and used to create reports and alerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/LPRStandards-TN_1012-508.pdf|title=System Assessment and Validation for Emergency Responders (SAVER)|last=Homeland Security|first=|date=October 2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two sources in which video metadata is derived: (1) operational gathered metadata, that is information about the content produced, such as the type of equipment, software, date, and location; (2) human-authored metadata, to improve search engine visibility, discoverability, audience engagement, and providing advertising opportunities to video publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Creation ==
Metadata can be created either by automated information processing or by manual work. Elementary metadata captured by computers can include information about when an object was created, who created it, when it was last updated, file size, and file extension. In this context an ''object'' refers to any of the following:

* A physical item such as a book, CD, DVD, a paper map, chair, table, flower pot, etc.
* An electronic file such as a digital image, digital photo, electronic document, program file, database table, etc.

=== Data virtualization ===
{{main article|Data virtualization}}
Data virtualization has emerged in the 2000s as the new software technology to complete the virtualization "stack" in the enterprise. Metadata is used in data virtualization servers which are enterprise infrastructure components, alongside database and application servers. Metadata in these servers is saved as persistent repository and describe [[business object]]s in various enterprise systems and applications. Structural metadata commonality is also important to support data virtualization.

=== Library and information science ===

Metadata has been used in various ways as a means of cataloging items in libraries in both digital and analog format. Such data helps classify, aggregate, identify, and locate a particular book, DVD, magazine or any object a library might hold in its collection. Until the 1980s, many library catalogues used 3x5 inch cards in file drawers to display a book's title, author, subject matter, and an abbreviated [[Alphanumeric|alpha-numeric]] string ([[call number]]) which indicated the physical location of the book within the library's shelves. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] employed by libraries for the classification of library materials by subject is an early example of metadata usage. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s, many libraries replaced these paper file cards with computer databases. These computer databases make it much easier and faster for users to do keyword searches. Another form of older metadata collection is the use by US Census Bureau of what is known as the "Long Form." The Long Form asks questions that are used to create demographic data to find patterns of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; [[library|Libraries]] employ metadata in [[library catalog]]ues, most commonly as part of an [[Library management system|Integrated Library Management System]]. Metadata is obtained by [[Library cataloguing#Cataloging rules|cataloguing]] resources such as books, periodicals, DVDs, web pages or digital images. This data is stored in the integrated library management system, [[Library management system|ILMS]], using the [[MARC standards|MARC]] metadata standard. The purpose is to direct patrons to the physical or electronic location of items or areas they seek as well as to provide a description of the item/s in question.

More recent and specialized instances of library metadata include the establishment of [[Digital library|digital libraries]] including [[eprint|e-print]] repositories and digital image libraries. While often based on library principles, the focus on non-librarian use, especially in providing metadata, means they do not follow traditional or common cataloging approaches. Given the custom nature of included materials, metadata fields are often specially created e.g. taxonomic classification fields, location fields, keywords or copyright statement. Standard file information such as file size and format are usually automatically included.&lt;ref name=solodovnik&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solodovnik | first1 = Iryna | year = 2011 | title = Metadata issues in Digital Libraries: key concepts and perspectives | journal = [[JLIS.it|JLIS.it: Italian Journal of Library, Archives and Information Science]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | publisher = University of Florence | doi = 10.4403/jlis.it-4663 | url = http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/4663 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130616093855/http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/4663 | archivedate = 16 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Library operation has for decades been a key topic in efforts toward [[international standardization]].

=== In museums ===
Metadata in a museum context is the information that trained cultural documentation specialists, such as [[archivist]]s, [[librarian]]s, museum [[registrar (museum)|registrar]]s and [[curator]]s, create to index, structure, describe, identify, or otherwise specify works of art, architecture, cultural objects and their images.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zange |first=Charles S. |date=31 January 2015 |title=Community makers, major museums, and the Keet S'aaxw: Learning about the role of museums in interpreting cultural objects |url=http://mw2015.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/community-makers-major-museums-and-the-keet-saaxw-learning-about-the-role-of-museums-in-interpreting-cultural-objects/ |publisher=Museums and the Web |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104005603/http://mw2015.museumsandtheweb.com/paper/community-makers-major-museums-and-the-keet-saaxw-learning-about-the-role-of-museums-in-interpreting-cultural-objects/ |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cataloging cultural objects: a guide to describing cultural works and their images.

==== Usage ====
Metadata is developed and applied within collecting institutions and museums in order to:
* Facilitate resource discovery and execute search queries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Create digital archives that store information relating to various aspects of museum collections and cultural objects, and serves for archival and managerial purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Provide public audiences access to cultural objects through publishing digital content online.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Standards ====
Many museums and cultural heritage centers recognize that given the diversity of art works and cultural objects, no single model or standard suffices to describe and catalogue cultural works.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, a sculpted Indigenous artifact could be classified as an artwork, an archaeological artifact, or an Indigenous heritage item. The early stages of standardization in archiving, description and cataloging within the museum community began in the late 1990s with the development of standards such as [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), Spectrum, [[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model]] (CRM), [[Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO)]] and the [[CDWA Lite XML schema]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These standards use [[HTML]] and [[XML]] markup languages for machine processing, publication and implementation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]] (AACR), originally developed for characterizing books, have also been applied to cultural objects, works of art and architecture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Standards, such as the CCO, are integrated within a Museum's [[Collections Management System]] (CMS), a database through which museums are able to manage their collections, acquisitions, loans and conservation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Scholars and professionals in the field note that the "quickly evolving landscape of standards and technologies" create challenges for cultural documentarians, specifically non-technically trained professionals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linked Data for Libraries, Archives and Museums: How to Clean, Link and Publish Your Metadata|last=Hooland|first=Seth Van|last2=Verborgh|first2=Ruben|publisher=Facet|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Most collecting institutions and museums use a [[relational database]] to categorize cultural works and their images.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relational databases and metadata work to document and describe the complex relationships amongst cultural objects and multi-faceted works of art, as well as between objects and places, people and artistic movements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Relational database structures are also beneficial within collecting institutions and museums because they allow for archivists to make a clear distinction between cultural objects and their images; an unclear distinction could lead to confusing and inaccurate searches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cultural objects and art works ====
An object's materiality, function and purpose, as well as the size (e.g., measurements, such as height, width, weight), storage requirements (e.g., climate-controlled environment) and focus of the museum and collection, influence the descriptive depth of the data attributed to the object by cultural documentarians.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The established institutional cataloging practices, goals and expertise of cultural documentarians and database structure also influence the information ascribed to cultural objects, and the ways in which cultural objects are categorized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, museums often employ standardized commercial collection management software that prescribes and limits the ways in which archivists can describe artworks and cultural objects.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As well, collecting institutions and museums use [[Controlled vocabulary|Controlled Vocabularies]] to describe cultural objects and artworks in their collections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Getty Vocabularies]] and the [[Library of Congress controlled vocabularies|Library of Congress Controlled Vocabularies]] are reputable within the museum community and are recommended by CCO standards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Museums are encouraged to use controlled vocabularies that are contextual and relevant to their collections and enhance the functionality of their digital information systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Controlled Vocabularies are beneficial within databases because they provide a high level of consistency, improving resource retrieval.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Metadata structures, including controlled vocabularies, reflect the [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] of the systems from which they were created. Often the processes through which cultural objects are described and categorized through metadata in museums do not reflect the perspectives of the maker communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srinivasan |first=Ramesh |date=December 2006 |title=Indigenous, ethnic and cultural articulations of new media |url=http://ics.sagepub.com/content/9/4/497.abstract |journal=International Journal of Cultural Studies |volume=9 |issue=4 |doi=10.1177/1367877906069899 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018023354/http://ics.sagepub.com/content/9/4/497.abstract |archivedate=18 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Museums and the Internet ====
Metadata has been instrumental in the creation of digital information systems and archives within museums, and has made it easier for museums to publish digital content online. This has enabled audiences who might not have had access to cultural objects due to geographic or economic barriers to have access to them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the 2000s, as more museums have adopted archival standards and created intricate databases, discussions about [[Linked data|Linked Data]] between museum databases have come up in the museum, archival and library science communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Collection Management Systems (CMS) and [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] tools can be local or shared systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Digital humanities|Digital Humanities]] scholars note many benefits of interoperability between museum databases and collections, while also acknowledging the difficulties achieving such interoperability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====United States====

Problems involving metadata in [[litigation]] in the [[United States]] are becoming widespread.{{when|date=February 2011}} Courts have looked at various questions involving metadata, including the [[discovery (law)|discoverability]] of metadata by parties. Although the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have only specified rules about electronic documents, subsequent case law has elaborated on the requirement of parties to reveal metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Document metadata have proven particularly important in legal environments in which litigation has requested metadata, which can include sensitive information detrimental to a certain party in court. Using [[metadata removal tool]]s to "clean" or redact documents can mitigate the risks of unwittingly sending sensitive data. This process partially (see [[data remanence]]) protects law firms from potentially damaging leaking of sensitive data through [[electronic discovery]].

Opinion polls have shown that 45% of Americans are "not at all confident" in the ability of social media sites ensure their personal data is secure and 40% say that social media sites should not be able to store any information on individuals. 76% of Americans say that they are not confident that the information advertising agencies collect on them is secure and 50% say that online advertising agencies should not be allowed to record any of their information at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/|title=Americans’ Attitudes About Privacy, Security and Surveillance {{!}} Pew Research Center|date=2015-05-20|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====

In Australia, the need to strengthen national security has resulted in the introduction of a new metadata storage law.&lt;ref&gt;Senate passes controversial metadata laws&lt;/ref&gt; This new law means that both security and policing agencies will be allowed to access up to two years of an individual's metadata, with the aim of making it easier to stop any terrorist attacks and serious crimes from happening.

=== In legislation ===

legislative metadata has been the subject of some discussion in [https://public.resource.org/law.gov/ law.gov] forums such as workshops held by the [[Legal Information Institute]] at the [[Cornell Law School]] on March 22 and 23, 2010. The documentation for these forums are titled, "Suggested metadata practices for legislation and regulations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wiki/lexcraft/suggested_metadata_practices_for_legislation_and_regulations|title=Suggested metadata practices for legislation and regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=Legal Information Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A handful of key points have been outlined by these discussions, section headings of which are listed as follows:

* General Considerations
* Document Structure
* Document Contents
* Metadata (elements of)
* Layering
* Point-in-time versus post-hoc

=== In healthcare ===
Australian medical research pioneered the definition of metadata for applications in health care. That approach offers the first recognized attempt to adhere to international standards in medical sciences instead of defining a proprietary standard under the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) umbrella. The medical community yet did not approve the need to follow metadata standards despite research that supported these standards.&lt;ref&gt;M. Löbe, M. Knuth, R. Mücke [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-559/Paper1.pdf TIM: A Semantic Web Application for the Specification of Metadata Items in Clinical Research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511114907/http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-559/Paper1.pdf |date=11 May 2012 }}, CEUR-WS.org, urn:nbn:de:0074-559-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In biomedical research ===
Research studies in the fields of [[biomedicine]] and [[molecular biology]] frequently yield large quantities of data, including results of [[genome]] or [[Metagenomics|meta-genome]] [[sequencing]], [[proteomics]] data, and even notes or plans created during the course of research itself&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myneni|first=Sahiti|last2=Patel|first2=Vimla L.|date=2010-06-01|title=Organization of Biomedical Data for Collaborative Scientific Research: A Research Information Management System|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|issue=3|pages=256–264|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2009.09.005|issn=0268-4012|pmc=2882303|pmid=20543892}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The products of biomedical research are generally realized as peer-reviewed manuscripts and these publications are yet another source of data. Metadata for biomedical publications is often created by journal publishers and citation databases such as [[PubMed]] and [[Web of Science]]. The data contained within manuscripts or accompanying them as supplementary material is less often subject to metadata creation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evangelou|first=Evangelos|last2=Trikalinos|first2=Thomas A.|last3=Ioannidis|first3=John P.A.|date=2005|title=Unavailability of online supplementary scientific information from articles published in major journals|journal=The FASEB Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=14|pages=1943–1944|doi=10.1096/fj.05-4784lsf|pmid=16319137|issn=0892-6638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AlQuraishi|first=Mohammed|last2=Sorger|first2=Peter K.|date=2016-05-18|title=Reproducibility will only come with data liberation|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/339/339ed7|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=8|issue=339|pages=339ed7|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf0968|issn=1946-6234|pmc=5084089|pmid=27194726}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though they may be submitted to biomedical databases after publication.

=== Data Warehousing ===
A [[data warehouse]] (DW) is a repository of an organization's electronically stored data. Data warehouses are designed to manage and store the data. Data warehouses differ from [[business intelligence]] (BI) systems, because BI systems are designed to use data to create reports and analyze the information, to provide strategic guidance to management.&lt;ref&gt;Inmon, W.H. Tech Topic: What is a Data Warehouse? Prism Solutions. Volume 1. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Metadata is an important tool in how data is stored in data warehouses. The purpose of a data warehouse is to house standardized, structured, consistent, integrated, correct, "cleaned" and timely data, extracted from various operational systems in an organization. The extracted data are integrated in the data warehouse environment to provide an enterprise-wide perspective. Data are structured in a way to serve the reporting and analytic requirements. The design of structural metadata commonality using a [[data modeling]] method such as [[entity relationship model]] diagramming is important in any data warehouse development effort. They detail metadata on each piece of data in the data warehouse. An essential component of a [[data warehouse]]/[[business intelligence]] system is the metadata and tools to manage and retrieve the metadata. [[Ralph Kimball]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} describes metadata as the DNA of the data warehouse as metadata defines the elements of the [[data warehouse]] and how they work together.

[[Ralph Kimball|Kimball]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kimball|2008|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to three main categories of metadata: Technical metadata, business metadata and process metadata. Technical metadata is primarily [[definition|definitional]], while business metadata and process metadata is primarily [[description|descriptive]]. The categories sometimes overlap.
* '''Technical metadata''' defines the objects and processes in a DW/BI system, as seen from a technical point of view. The technical metadata includes the system metadata, which defines the data structures such as tables, fields, data types, indexes and partitions in the relational engine, as well as databases, dimensions, measures, and data mining models. Technical metadata defines the data model and the way it is displayed for the users, with the reports, schedules, distribution lists, and user security rights.
* '''Business metadata''' is content from the data warehouse described in more user-friendly terms. The business metadata tells you what data you have, where they come from, what they mean and what their relationship is to other data in the data warehouse. Business metadata may also serve as a documentation for the DW/BI system. Users who browse the data warehouse are primarily viewing the business metadata.
* '''Process metadata''' is used to describe the results of various operations in the data warehouse. Within the [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] process, all key data from tasks is logged on execution. This includes start time, end time, CPU seconds used, disk reads, disk writes, and rows processed. When troubleshooting the ETL or [[Information retrieval|query]] process, this sort of data becomes valuable. Process metadata is the fact measurement when building and using a DW/BI system. Some organizations make a living out of collecting and selling this sort of data to companies - in that case the process metadata becomes the business metadata for the fact and dimension tables. Collecting process metadata is in the interest of business people who can use the data to identify the users of their products, which products they are using, and what level of service they are receiving.

=== On the Internet ===
The [[HTML]] format used to define web pages allows for the inclusion of a variety of types of metadata, from basic descriptive text, dates and keywords to further advanced metadata schemes such as the [[Dublin Core]], [[e-GMS]], and AGLS&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Australia, AGLS Metadata Standard, accessed 7 January 2010, {{cite web |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/create-capture-describe/describe/AGLS/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054051/http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/create-capture-describe/describe/AGLS/index.aspx |archivedate=10 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; standards. Pages can also be [[geotagging|geotagged]] with [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]]. Metadata may be included in the page's header or in a separate file. [[Microformat]]s allow metadata to be added to on-page data in a way that regular web users do not see, but computers, [[web crawler]]s and [[search engine]]s can readily access. Many search engines are cautious about using metadata in their ranking algorithms due to exploitation of metadata and the practice of search engine optimization, [[Search engine optimization|SEO]], to improve rankings. See [[Meta element]] article for further discussion. This cautious attitude may be justified as people, according to Doctorow,&lt;ref&gt;Metacrap: Putting the torch to seven straw-men of the meta-utopia {{cite web |url=http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508200721/http://www.well.com/~doctorow/metacrap.htm |archivedate=8 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; are not executing care and diligence when creating their own metadata and that metadata is part of a competitive environment where the metadata is used to promote the metadata creators own purposes.

=== In broadcast industry ===
In [[broadcast]] industry, metadata is linked to audio and video [[broadcast media]] to:
* ''identify'' the media: [[Media clip|clip]] or [[playlist]] names, duration, [[timecode]], etc.
* ''describe'' the content: notes regarding the quality of video content, rating, description (for example, during a sport event, [[Index term|keywords]] like ''goal'', ''red card'' will be associated to some clips)
* ''classify'' media: metadata allows producers to sort the media or to easily and quickly find a video content (a [[TV news]] could urgently need some [[archiving|archive content]] for a subject). For example, the BBC have a large subject classification system, [[Lonclass]], a customized version of the more general-purpose [[Universal Decimal Classification]].

This metadata can be linked to the video media thanks to the [[Video server#Broadcast automation|video servers]]. Most major broadcast sport events like [[FIFA World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]] use this metadata to distribute their video content to [[TV station]]s through [[Index term|keywords]].

=== Geospatial ===
Metadata that describes geographic objects in electronic storage or format (such as datasets, maps, features, or documents with a geospatial component) has a history dating back to at least 1994 (refer [https://web.archive.org/web/20061018013240/http://libraries.mit.edu/guides/subjects/metadata/standards/fgdc.html MIT Library page on FGDC Metadata]). This class of metadata is described more fully on the [[geospatial metadata]] article.

=== Ecological and environmental ===
Ecological and environmental metadata is intended to document the "who, what, when, where, why, and how" of data collection for a particular study. This typically means which organization or institution collected the data, what type of data, which date(s) the data was collected, the rationale for the data collection, and the methodology used for the data collection. Metadata should be generated in a format commonly used by the most relevant science community, such as [[Darwin Core]], [[Ecological Metadata Language]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/eml-2.0.1/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423161141/http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/eml-2.0.1/index.html|date=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Dublin Core]]. Metadata editing tools exist to facilitate metadata generation (e.g. Metavist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metavist.djames.net/ |title=Metavist 2 |publisher=Metavist.djames.net |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821202734/http://metavist.djames.net/ |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercury: Metadata Search System]], Morpho&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp |title=KNB Data :: Morpho |publisher=Knb.ecoinformatics.org |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113143228/http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Metadata should describe [[data provenance|provenance]] of the data (where they originated, as well as any transformations the data underwent) and how to give credit for (cite) the data products.

=== Digital music ===
When first released in 1982, Compact Discs only contained a Table Of Contents (TOC) with the number of tracks on the disc and their length in samples.[http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32801641/Morris_2012_-_Making_Music_Behave.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1477195681&amp;Signature=2TLmhapcR0M5eYsfMQ8FgG2TZa0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMaking_music_behave_Metadata_and_the_dig.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkIaGZ0HWcMC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Fourteen years later in 1996, a revision of the [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Red Book]] standard added [[CD-Text]] to carry additional metadata.[http://web.ncf.ca/aa571/cdtext.htm] But CD-Text was not widely adopted. Shortly thereafter, it became common for personal computers to retrieve metadata from external sources (e.g. [[CDDB]], [[Gracenote]]) based on the TOC.

Digital [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] formats such as [[digital audio file]]s superseded music formats such as [[cassette tape]]s and [[CDs]] in the 2000s. Digital audio files could be labelled with more information than could be contained in just the file name. That descriptive information is called the '''audio tag''' or audio metadata in general. Computer programs specializing in adding or modifying this information are called [[tag editor]]s. Metadata can be used to name, describe, catalogue and indicate ownership or copyright for a digital audio file, and its presence makes it much easier to locate a specific audio file within a group, typically through use of a search engine that accesses the metadata. As different digital audio formats were developed, attempts were made to standardize a specific location within the digital files where this information could be stored.

As a result, almost all digital audio formats, including [[mp3]], broadcast wav and [[AIFF]] files, have similar standardized locations that can be populated with metadata. The metadata for compressed and uncompressed digital music is often encoded in the [[ID3]] tag. Common editors such as [[TagLib]] support MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, Speex, WavPack TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4, and ASF file formats.

=== Cloud applications ===
With the availability of [[Cloud computing|cloud]] applications, which include those to add metadata to content, metadata is increasingly available over the Internet.

== Administration and management ==

=== Storage ===
Metadata can be stored either ''internally'',&lt;ref name=id3&gt;{{cite web
 |first       = Dan
 |last        = O'Neill
 |url         = http://id3.org
 |title       = ID3.org
 |deadurl     = no

 |archivedate = 11 November 2011
 |df          = dmy-all
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same file or structure as the data (this is also called ''embedded metadata''), or ''externally'', in a separate file or field from the described data. A data repository typically stores the metadata ''detached'' from the data, but can be designed to support embedded metadata approaches. Each option has advantages and disadvantages:
* Internal storage means metadata always travels as part of the data they describe; thus, metadata is always available with the data, and can be manipulated locally. This method creates redundancy (precluding normalization), and does not allow managing all of a system's metadata in one place. It arguably increases consistency, since the metadata is readily changed whenever the data is changed.
* External storage allows collocating metadata for all the contents, for example in a database, for more efficient searching and management. Redundancy can be avoided by normalizing the metadata's organization. In this approach, metadata can be united with the content when information is transferred, for example in [[Streaming media]]; or can be referenced (for example, as a web link) from the transferred content. On the down side, the division of the metadata from the data content, especially in standalone files that refer to their source metadata elsewhere, increases the opportunities for misalignments between the two, as changes to either may not be reflected in the other.

Metadata can be stored in either human-readable or binary form. Storing metadata in a human-readable format such as [[XML]] can be useful because users can understand and edit it without specialized tools.&lt;ref name=Sutter&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, text-based formats are rarely optimized for storage capacity, communication time, or processing speed. A binary metadata format enables efficiency in all these respects, but requires special software to convert the binary information into human-readable content.

=== Database management ===
Each relational database system has its own mechanisms for storing metadata. Examples of relational-database metadata include:
* Tables of all tables in a database, their names, sizes, and number of rows in each table.
* Tables of columns in each database, what tables they are used in, and the type of data stored in each column.
In database terminology, this set of metadata is referred to as the [[database catalog|catalog]]. The [[SQL]] standard specifies a uniform means to access the catalog, called the [[information schema]], but not all databases implement it, even if they implement other aspects of the SQL standard. For an example of database-specific metadata access methods, see [[Oracle metadata]]. Programmatic access to metadata is possible using APIs such as [[JDBC]], or SchemaCrawler.&lt;ref name=schemacrawler&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

One of the first satirical examinations of the concept of Metadata as we understand it today is American Science Fiction author [[Hal Draper]]'s short story, [[MS_Fnd_in_a_Lbry]] (1961).
Here, the knowledge of all Mankind is condensed into an object the size of a desk drawer, however the magnitude of the metadata (e.g. catalog of catalogs of... , as well as indexes and histories) eventually leads to dire yet humorous consequence for the human race.
The story prefigures the modern consequences of allowing metadata to become more important than the real data it is concerned with, and the risks inherent in that eventuality as a cautionary tale.

'''Michael Diversey''' (born '''Diversy''' as shown on his grave in St. Boniface Catholic Cemetery in Chicago; December 10, 1810 – December 12, 1869) was an American [[brewing (beer)|beer brewer]], owner of the Diversey Beer Brewery. Diversey was an immigrant from Illingen [[Saarland]], Germany. He landed in the US in 1830, and went into partnership with English immigrant William Lill around 1841. The company changed its name and became the Lill &amp; Diversey Brewery, also known simply as The Chicago Brewery. It was destroyed in the [[1871 Great Chicago Fire]]

Michael Diversey was a philanthropist. He was also a Chicago alderman (1844–45; 1856–1868). During the 1850s, Diversey was active in the antiprohibitionist crusade that sought to repel the influence of temperance reformers who attempted to ban the sale and manufacture of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, Kyle G. (2014). ''Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy''. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 167, 173. {{ISBN|019937192X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Diversey Parkway]] in Chicago is named after him.
[[St. Michael's Church, Old Town, Chicago|St. Michael’s Catholic Church in Chicago]] was built on land donated to the parish by Michael Diversey. Until 1885, St. Michael’s was the tallest building in Chicago.

Married to Angela Diversy (June 10, 1810 – November 9, 1883). Oil portraits of Michael and Angela Diversy are in the collection of the [[Chicago History Museum]].

{{Political campaigning}}

'''Political consulting''' is a form of [[consulting]] that consists primarily of advising and assisting [[political campaigns]]. Although the most important role of political consultants is arguably the development and production of [[mass media]] (largely [[television]] and [[Advertising mail|direct mail]]), consultants advise campaigns on many other activities, ranging from [[opposition research]] and [[Polling place|voter polling]], to field [[strategy]] and [[get out the vote]] efforts.

==Origins==
President [[William McKinley]]'s closest political adviser [[Mark Hanna]] is sometimes described as the first political [[consultant]].

[[Whitaker and Baxter]] established the first true political consulting firm, '''Campaigns, Inc.''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Politics Became a Business|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/24/the-lie-factory|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focused exclusively on [[political campaign]]s in [[California]] in the 1930s - 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_yr2011_chunk_g978140513199521_ss54-1|title=Political Consultant|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Communication|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, political consulting blossomed with the increasing use of [[television advertising]] for '''campaign communications'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Virtuous Circle: Political Communications in Post-Industrial Societies|last = Norris|first = Pipa Norris|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 1, 2, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_yr2011_chunk_g978140513199521_ss54-1|title=Political Consultant|publisher=International Encyclopedia of Communication|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Napolitan]] was the first person to describe himself as a political [[consultant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manship Guide to Political Communication|last = Perlmutter|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The New York Times]] newspaper described him in a 1968 profile as ''"that newest American phenomenon, the professional campaign manager"'' and ''a "pioneering campaign [[consultant]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Joseph Napolitan, Pioneering Campaign Consultant, Dies at 84|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/us/joseph-napolitan-pioneering-campaign-consultant-dies-at-84.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-12-09|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Paul|last = Vitello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, political consulting has become more commonplace throughout the world and has extended its reach to campaigns at all levels of government. Many consultants work not only for campaigns, but also for [[political party|parties]] and [[political action committee]]s, while some focus on [[public relations]] and research work.

==Nature of the work==
Political consultants sometimes act as political strategists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.collegefortn.org/Career_Planning/Career_Profile/Career_Profile.aspx?id=brKDga9mCotJfFOGYghoowXAP3DPAXXAP3DPAX|title= Political Strategist|publisher=Tennessee.Gov |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior political consultant who promote the [[election]] of certain [[candidate]]s or the interests of certain groups. This is achieved by planning campaign [[Strategy|strategies]], coordinating campaign staffers, and arranging events to publicize candidates or causes.

Political consultants act as [[public relations]] specialists, salespeople and managers. By using many forms of [[marketing]]-suitable media, including [[advertising]] and [[press release]]s, the general goal of political [[consultant]]s is to make voters aware of their candidates' [[party platform]].

As political consulting has expanded worldwide, [[journalist]]s have noted the influence of political consulting on candidates, voters, presidents and governments of different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Brazilian Campaign Strategist Expands His Winning Streak|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/world/americas/a-brazilian-campaign-strategist-expands-his-winning-streak.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-04-05|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Simon|last = Romero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known [[American Association of Political Consultants|American political consultants]] such as [[James Carville]], [[Joseph Napolitan]] and David H. Sayers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = David H.

For example, [[Joseph Napolitan|Napolitan]] acted as a consultant of French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Válery Giscard d’Estaing]], several [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|Venezuelan presidents]], and [[Costa Rica]]’s [[Óscar Arias Sánchez]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Joseph Napolitan {{!}} American political consultant|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Napolitan|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dick Morris]] ''"has consulted for candidates in other countries of the western hemisphere, including the campaigns of [[Fernando de la Rúa|Fernando de la Rua]] for President of Argentina, [[Jorge Batlle Ibáñez|Jorge Batlle]] for President of Uruguay, [[Vicente Fox]] for President of Mexico, and [[Raphael Trotman]] for President of Guyana."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/27/news/mn-4173|title = Mexico Imports American-Style Campaigning|last = SCHRADER|first = ESTHER|date = August 27, 1999|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] political consultants have also led [[political campaign]]s outside of their native countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-McCain aide outfoxes Latin America's campaign gurus in Panama race {{!}} Fox News|url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/05/15/ex-mccain-aide-outfoxes-latin-america-campaign-gurus-in-panama-race.html|website = Fox News|date = 2014-05-15|accessdate = 2015-12-18|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is Brazilian political consultant [[:pt:João Santana|João Santana]], who simultaneously led three winning presidential campaigns in [[Latin America]]: [[Danilo Medina]], in the [[Dominican Republic]]; [[Hugo Chávez]], in [[Venezuela]]; and [[José Eduardo dos Santos]], in [[Angola]], in the [[Africa|African continent.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Brazilian Campaign Strategist Expands His Winning Streak|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/world/americas/a-brazilian-campaign-strategist-expands-his-winning-streak.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2013-04-05|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Simon|last = Romero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan political strategist [[JJ Rendón|JJ Rendon]] (who lives in [[United States]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Venezuelan spin doctor JJ Rendon lectures the world on Neo-Totalitarianism|url = http://latincorrespondent.com/2014/10/venezuelan-spin-doctor-lectures-world-neo-totalitarianism/|website = latincorrespondent.com|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been recognized internationally, having been ranked as one of the top five most prominent Latin American consultants by the U.S.-based publication ''[[Campaigns and Elections|Campaigns &amp; Elections]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.campaignsandelections.com/campaign-insider/1131/revista-politics-en-espanol|title = Revista Politics en español|last = Lieberman|first = Jordan|date = 2009|work = |access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin American edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.noticias24.com/venezuela/noticia/120706/j-j-rendon-en-el-salon-de-la-fama-de-la-consultoria-politica/|title = El estratega político J.J.

== Criticisms ==
===Scandals===
As political consulting has become more prevalent, consultants have become subject to increasing scrutiny and involvement in [[Spotlight Scandals|spotlight scandals]] as [[journalism|journalists]] have devoted considerable attention to their activities. Some successful political consultants, such as [[James Carville]] and [[Newt Gingrich]], capitalize on their consulting fame to become professional [[pundit (politics)|pundits]]. Such political consultants routinely appear on [[television]] [[news program]]s, write books and are treated as social media [[celebrity|celebrities.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Political Consultants and Strategists - Presidential Election of 2008 - John McCain - Terry Nelson|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/weekinreview/15nagourney.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2007-07-15|access-date = 2015-12-18|issn = 0362-4331|first = Adam|last = Nagourney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some detractors accuse political consultants of putting their own interests and images ahead of their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/JSS/JSS-16-0-000-000-2008-Web/JSS-16-2-000-000-2008-Abst-Text/JSS-16-2-127-08-339-Jelili-M-O/JSS-16-2-127-08-339-Jelili-M-O-Tt.pdf|title = Audience Mindset and Influence on Personal Political Branding|last = Omojola|first = Oladokun|date = 2008|journal = Audience Mindset and Influence on Personal Political Branding|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consultants allege that too many consultants put their own financial interests ahead of the campaigns they are hired to serve, take on too many clients, or focus too much energy on building their own reputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Carolina's dirty political reputation outlives reality - CNNPolitics.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/11/politics/sc-dirty-politics/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

===Social media in modern campaigns===
[[Social media]] has dramatically changed the way in which modern [[political campaign]]s are run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Political Campaigns and Social Media — Tweeting Their Way Into Office|url = http://source.southuniversity.edu/political-campaigns-and-social-media-tweeting-their-way-into-office-106986.aspx|website = source.southuniversity.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rand Paul Ready To Run As His Own Meme|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/07/rand-paul-campaign_n_7013804.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With younger and more tech-savvy citizens entering into the voting population, social media are the platforms on which the [[politician]]s need to establish themselves and engage with the public. In years to come, social media is anticipated to overtake traditional media in terms of importance to political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Media is Changing the Nature of Political Campaigns|url = http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/social-media-is-changing-the-nature-of-political-campaigns/619572|website = www.adweek.com|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 5 Ways New Media Are Changing Politics|url = https://www.usnews.com/opinion/slideshows/5-ways-new-media-are-changing-politics|website = US News &amp; World Report|date = 2010-02-03|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, in [[Australia]] 86% of Australians access the [[Internet]], and with a 17,048,864 voting age population (according to [http://www.idea.int/ IDEA]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voter turnout data for Australia (Parliamentary) {{!}} Voter Turnout {{!}} International IDEA|url = http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=AU|website = www.idea.int|accessdate = 2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 14,662,023 voting population has access to Internet, and 65% of them use [[social media]], which means 9,530,314 Australian voters use social media (The 2013 Yellow™ Social Media Report found that among internet users 65% of Australians use social media, up from 62% last year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalmktg.net/#!political-campaign-and-social/cjsl|title=Political Campaign and Social Media|publisher=Political Marketing|accessdate=2014-01-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131040/http://www.politicalmktg.net/#!political-campaign-and-social/cjsl|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positive assurance''' is a statement as to what the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]]{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} believes. An example is an opinion that the [[financial statement]]s are presented fairly in conformity with [[United States|U.S.]] [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles|GAAP]].

The opposite is [[negative assurance]], a statement about what the CPA does not know. A statement that the CPA was "not aware of material modifications that should be made to financial statements for them to conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles" is negative assurance used in review reports.

'''Robert Warren Miller''' (born May 23, 1933) is an American-born British billionaire, entrepreneur, [[co-founder]] of [[DFS Group|DFS (Duty Free Shops)]], and sailing [[champion]]. He is the father of [[Marie-Chantal|Crown Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece]], [[Princess Alexandra von Furstenberg|Alexandra Miller]], and [[Pia Getty]], dubbed by tabloids and high society as The Miller Sisters.

==Early life and education==
Miller was born in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]], Massachusetts, in 1933, the son of Ellis Warren Appleton Miller (1898 – c. 1986), a [[bookkeeper]], [[salesperson]], and descendant of several [[Mayflower]] passengers; and Sophia "Sophie" June Squarebriggs (1899–1998), a Canadian-born former [[governess]]. Miller's ancestry is rooted in the British North American colonial elite, and descends over time, he claims, from [[Henry I of England]], [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV the Carolingian]], and [[William the Lion|William, King of the Scots]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie Helen Otto &amp; William Addams Reitwiesner, Some ancestry of the Miller sisters [http://www.wargs.com/royal/miller.html 1995].&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller attended [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]] and graduated in 1955, with a Bachelor of Science in Hotel Administration. He was a member of the [[Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity]] and the [[Irving Literary Society (Cornell University)|Irving Literary Society]].

==Career==
===Duty Free Shoppers (DFS)===
[[File:DFS-Okinawa2.JPG|thumb|400px|DFS's Okinawa venue.]]
The concept of "[[duty-free shop]]ping" – offering [[high-end]] [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] to [[tourism|travelers]], free of [[import taxes]] – was in its infancy when, with [[Chuck Feeney]], Miller founded DFS on November 7, 1960.

DFS began operations in Hong Kong, where it still maintains its corporate headquarters, later expanding to Europe and other continents. DFS' first major breakthrough came in the early 1960s, when it secured the exclusive concession for duty-free sales in Hawaii and Hong Kong, allowing it to market its products to Japanese travelers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dermot Davitt, The Moodie Report, November Personality of the Month: Robert Miller (June 6, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; DFS eventually expanded to off-airport duty-free stores and large downtown Galleria [[Retailing|stores]], and became the world's largest travel retailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfsgalleria.com/Galleria/English/Global/Global_About_DFS.html|title=Duty Free Shopping Stores – DFS T Galleria &amp; Airport Shops|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Feeney's interests were acquired by [[Louis Vuitton]] [[Moët]] [[Hennessy]] ([[LVMH]]), the French [[luxury good]]s group, for $1.63&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3755/is_199703/ai_n8761288|title=FindArticles.com – CBSi|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller kept his shares and remains a significant minority shareholder (38%) in DFS alongside LVMH,&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which bought out Feeney's share. More recently, Miller targeted the emergence of mainland China's economic elite.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; To present its new merchandise, DFS has moved beyond the airport liquor store venue and into store environments, seeking to market the broadest portfolio of brand names in the travelling marketplace.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
In 2010, the DFS Group had an estimated sales of about €2.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt; As of 2012, it has 150 stores in 15 Pacific states.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt; Its downtown activities operate under the Galleriera name.&lt;ref name="Luxury"/&gt;

Miller was named the November 2010 Personality of the Month by The Moodie Report in recognition of his advancement of the luxury goods industry's cause.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That year, Duty Free Shops (DFS) celebrated its 50th anniversary at the DFS Galleria Sun Plaza store in Hong Kong, with a gala attended by 2000 guests, and featuring a performance by [[Wyclef Jean]].&lt;ref&gt;William Stolerman, DFS Celebrates 50th With Star Studded Gala in HK (Nov 21, [2010]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Davitt, The Moodie Report, Picture Gallery: DFS celebrates 50th anniversary in Hong Kong (July 11, [2010]).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Search Investment Group Ltd===
In 1973, Miller founded Search Investment Group Ltd, an international investment company of which he is CEO and chairperson. The Search investment Group Ltd is a large shareholder in Ortelius Capital Partners, which is an investment firm founded by Miller's son-in-law HRH Prince Pavlos of Greece and Mr. Peter DeSorcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchgroup.com/|title=Search Investment Group|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orteliuscapital.com|title=ortelius-aim|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also principal of SAIL advisors (Search Alternative Investments Ltd), global investors in hedge funds. Along with other assets, Miller is currently ranked the 68th wealthiest person in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,20590,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; down from 22nd in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/richlist/person/0,,33629,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sailing records==
In October 2003, Miller's [[monohull]] [[yacht]], the Mari-Cha IV, set a new [[world record]], becoming the first [[monohull]] ever to cross the Atlantic Ocean in under seven days. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040929151518/http://www.mike-sanderson.com/default.asp?m=da&amp;id=9977] During the same crossing, the yacht also broke the 24-hour distance record, by sailing {{convert|525.5|nmi|km|1}}. Both he and his son-in-law [[Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece]], son of King [[Constantine II of Greece]] were crew members.

On April 30, 2005, the Mari-Cha IV won the Rolex Transatlantic Challenge and broke the century-old record for a west-to-east transatlantic crossing established by [[Charlie Barr]]. It completed the 2,925-nautical mile passage across the North Atlantic between New York and England in a time of 9 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds—a full 2 days, 12 hours, 6 minutes and 56 seconds faster than the record set 100 years earlier.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Mike Hanlon, Century-old Transatlantic Challenge Record Broken (April 30, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; During the record-breaking crossing, Miller pushed the Mari-Cha III beyond its limits in poor weather, and the mainsail headboard and the headboard cars on both mainsail and mizzen broke.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Miller is married to Ecuadorian-born María Clara "Chantal" Pesantes Becerra,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wargs.com/royal/miller.html&lt;/ref&gt; they have three daughters: [[Pia Getty|Pia]] (b. 1966), [[Marie-Chantal, Crown Princess of Greece|Marie-Chantal]] (b. 1968), and [[Princess Alexandra von Fürstenberg|Alexandra]] (b. 1972)

He also owns the {{convert|36000|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} Gunnerside Estate in [[Yorkshire]], one of the largest sporting country estates in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

'''Samuel Beníquez Méndez''' was born on October 28, 1971, at Doctors' Center Hospital in Santurce, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. His biological mother is Antonia Beníquez Seguí. He was adopted by his maternal uncle and aunt, Félix Beníquez Quiñones and Ada Méndez Castro, on February 21, 1973.

However, Samuel Beníquez’s biological mother, Antonia Beníquez Seguí, remained in the Beníquez–Méndez family home, taking care of her son as if she were his nanny. Beníquez Méndez grew up believing this lie and was indoctrinated in the [[Mita Congregation|Congregación Mita]] religion, which was founded in Puerto Rico and is now established in several parts of the world.

Beníquez Méndez has studied music since age six and excels on instruments such as the clarinet, flute, and saxophone. He was a member of Mita Congregation’s wind band until 1995 and received a scholarship to study music at the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras campus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.samuelbeniquez.net Official Webite of Samuel Beniquez"]&lt;/ref&gt;

About thirty years later, on May 13, 2003, Beníquez Méndez and his mother, Beníquez Seguí, filed a motion before the Court of First Instance to nullify the adoption. They largely argued that Beníquez Seguí was coerced and intimidated by the Beníquez–Méndez couple to consent to the adoption of her son. Consequently, they alleged that her consent was unlawful, which rendered the resolution issued February 21, 1973, null and void. Unlawful consent deprives the Court of jurisdiction, making the resolution issued nonexistent.

The petitioners also argued that Beníquez Méndez was raised by his mother from birth and even moved with her at the age of six to live at a residence other than that of his aunt and uncle. Furthermore, they added that the Beníquez–Méndez couple only sought to adopt the minor in order to financially profit off a child they supposedly never raised.

On September 13, 2003, the Court of First Instance overruled the petitioners’ motion with an unsubstantiated resolution. This decision was never appealed or revised, becoming final and enforceable.

Later, on November 4, 2004, Beníquez Seguí and Beníquez Méndez filed a second claim regarding nullity of adoption procedures and declaration of filiation in which the petitioners alleged that Beníquez Seguí, when she was still pregnant with Beníquez Méndez, was coerced, threatened, and subjected to “mental, moral, emotional, and religious pressures” to give her consent for the Beníquez-Méndez couple to adopt her son.

Separately from what they alleged in their first motion, the petitioners also argued that the pattern of coercion and intimidation in question was because Mr. [[Teófilo Vargas Seín]], spiritual leader of the Mita Congregation religion, was the biological father of Beníquez Méndez and that the aunt and uncle – together with other people from the congregation – orchestrated the adoption in question in order to hide that fact. In agreement with the above, they requested that the adoption under examination be ruled null and that the Demographic Registrar be ordered to register Beníquez Méndez as the biological son of Beníquez Seguí and Vargas Seín.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lexjuris.com/lexjuris/tspr2012/lexj2012002.htm#_ftnref10 2012 Jurisprudencia del Tribunal Supremo de P.R. del año 2012 | 2012 DTS 002 BENIQUEZ MENDEZ V. VARGAS SEIN Y OTROS, 2012TSPR002"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal case spent nearly 10 years in court and even reached the [[Puerto Rico Supreme Court]], concluding in a resolution by the Supreme Court ordering that the proceedings of the case be continued and that Teófilo Vargas Seín, better known as Aarón, forcibly recognize the filiation, thus granting Samuel Beníquez Méndez the right to know his true paternal filiation.

As such, Aarón was officially summoned to appear at the Histocompatibility Institute of the Medical Sciences Campus of the University of Puerto Rico on March 11, 2013, at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to take a DNA test together with Samuel Beníquez Méndez and Antonia Beníquez Seguí.

The parties, including Samuel Beníquez Méndez, his vilified mother, Antonia Beníquez Seguí, and the lawyer who had brought the paternity suit for 10 years, Nicolás Nogueras, were summoned to the Court of San Juan to hear the reading of the DNA test on March 25, 2013, by Judge Arlene Sellés Guerrini.

The laboratory results reflected a 99.9999 percent chance that Aarón is Samuel Beníquez Méndez’s biological father. Beníquez Méndez, at the age of 41 years, celebrated that he had a father, named Aarón, and that his mother was vindicated.&lt;ref&gt;News published in the Puerto Rican newspaper ''El Nuevo Dia''[https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/eladnconfirmalapaternidaddeaaron-1477992/# El Nuevo Dia article]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Teófilo Vargas Seín, the top leader of the Mita Congregation, “left” the case and to this day, has never wanted to establish a relationship of friendship, love, spirituality, or fatherhood with his biological son, Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.samuelbeniquez.net Official Website of Samuel Beniquez]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesses==

Samuel Beníquez Méndez, CEO of AVFA,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.avfa.net Official Website of AVFA"]&lt;/ref&gt; got his start by working at a computer center at a very young age. Beníquez Méndez was 16 years old and still in high school when he began working as a data processor at the Government of Puerto Rico’s General Services Administration’s Computer Center, the only teenager hired at that time and on a night shift. At age 18, following the example set by his father, he began working at the Hermanos Unidos Savings and Credit Cooperative in Hato Rey, San Jose, Puerto Rico.

He held a number of positions in that line of work within the organization until he decided to work independently as an insurance and investment agent with the company Primerica Financial Services (formerly part of Citigroup), becoming a regional vice president while he attended the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico, where he received his Bachelor’s in Business Administration with a Concentration in Marketing. Meanwhile, he learned a lot about insurance and investments surrounded by qualified people with extensive knowledge in the field.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.samuelbeniquez.net/negocios/ Official Website of Samuel Beniquez"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beníquez Méndez had always intended to build a career and after succeeding, start his own company. He therefore founded the financial institution First Home Financial with his brother Samuel Ortiz in 1995, which has locations in several towns in Puerto Rico and the US state of Pennsylvania. He held the position of CEO of the bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the corporation. Following this, he was the CEO of successful companies such as ER Remodeling &amp; Construction Co., Imperial Music Studio, Imperial College, Black Dot Records, BD Authors, Imperial Recording Studios, and Imperial Artists, among others, while he continued his studies at SMC University. As CEO of these companies, in addition to administration, he was also directly involved in marketing and media relations.

His exciting career in the corporate world since he was young has provided him with important experiences in administration, marketing, communications, and the responsibility of being in charge of the losses and earnings of different companies.

Today, Beníquez Méndez is the CEO of AVFA Firm LLC, a leading company in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and the continental United States. The company offers public relations services, strategic communications, copywriting, media services, interactive services, and business advice to all types of companies.

Since taking the reins of the company, Beníquez Méndez has worked to expand and position it for success in the 21st century, focusing on growth and new business areas. Its portfolio focuses on protecting the company from taking too many risks while maximizing its opportunities for growth.

Just like how he learned when he was young, Beníquez Méndez has surrounded himself with talented and knowledgeable people. Additionally, he has simplified the organization and promotes a team approach to solving problems and determining a long-term strategic direction. Beníquez Méndez has also given employees a system of policies and values and encouraged them to live the company’s mission and vision, where professionalism and excellent service are the most important.

==Music and Writing==

Beníquez Méndez is the cowriter and composer (with Samuel Ortiz) of songs such as "Histeria," "Dame de ti," "Inevitable," "Todo fue por," and "Si a ti te gusta," as well as another 24 sets of lyrics and musical pieces. Also in collaboration with Samuel Ortiz, he produced the albums Histeriha and Off Da’ Hook, winning the Paoli Award for Best New Artist in 2002. In 2005, the songs off his album Off Da' Hook were again distributed on the world market under the label Critique, this time on the album Viper Boyz, sharing credits with artists as big as Lil Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz, D-Roc, DJ Smurf, Kaine, Los TNT, and Ludacris.

Their achievements led to them becoming voting members of the Recording Academy and the Latin Recording Academy, and in 2012, he received a recognition reading “In acknowledgment and recognition of 10 years of membership, and for supporting the Recording Academy’s mission of improving the climate for music and the lives of all the members of our creative community.” The recognition was signed by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, George Flanigen IV, and the president/CEO, Neil Portnow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.instagram.com/p/TcO4csJsLt/?taken-by=samuelbeniquez Certificate of recognition from The Recording Academy to Samuel Beniquez]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, under the pseudonym Miguel Amadeus, he wrote the bestselling book Tu alto precio ... Mi gran valor in 2004, and in 2015, he wrote and published his most recent book, El niño versus la bestia, which was displayed on the big screens in Times Square in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samuelbeniquez.net/musica-y-escritura Information about Music and Writing in the Official Website of Samuel Beniquez]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teheranno''' (alternatively '''Teheran-ro''', translation "[[Tehran]] Boulevard") is a street in the [[Gangnam district]] of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]. It runs from [[Gangnam Station]] through [[Yeoksam-dong]] and into [[Samseong-dong]]. It is colloquially known as "'''Teheran Valley'''" (after [[Silicon Valley]]) due to the number of [[internet]]-related companies operating there. The district of [[Gangnam-gu]] experienced phenomenal growth and waves of construction, with Teheranno becoming one of the busiest streets in South Korea. Its counterpart, Seoul St. in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] , runs in the north of that city, close to the [[Evin]] district.

Teheranno is a 3.5&amp;nbsp;km section of Korean Highway 90, and runs eastwards from [[Gangnam Station]] to [[Samseong Station]] and the [[COEX]]/[[KWTC]] complex. [[Yeoksam Station|Yeoksam]] and [[Seolleung Station|Seolleung]] stations are also on Teheranno. All stations are on [[Seoul Subway Line 2]].

Some of Korea's tallest skyscrapers and most expensive real estate are in Teheranno, while Seoul Metropolitan Government estimates that more than half of Korea's [[venture capital]], some 200,000,000,000 won (approximately $200,000,000), is invested in Teheran Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.seoul.go.kr/business/indust/indust_05ven_02.html|title=Teheran Valley, Seoul Metropolitan Government|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408214016/http://english.seoul.go.kr/business/indust/indust_05ven_02.html|archivedate=2004-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June 1977, the Seoul Metropolitan Government suggested that the city of Seoul and [[Tehran]], pre-[[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] [[Pahlavi Dynasty|Iran]] exchange the names of streets on the [[Iran–South Korea relations|occasion of the visit]] to Korea of [[Gholamreza Nikpey]], [[Mayor of Tehran]]. The following year, Samneungno street was renamed Teheranno, which then ran through a relatively underdeveloped area that been annexed into Seoul in 1963.

==Economy==
The area hosts major domestic [[internet portals]] [[Daum Communications|Daum]] and [[Naver]] as well as [[Google]]. [[Samsung Electronics]] and [[Hynix]] both operate offices there. Various Korean and international financial and business institutions including [[POSCO]], [[Standard Chartered]] and [[Citibank]] also maintain offices there. 

The headquarters of [[LOEN Entertainment]], one of the largest music companies in the country, is located in Teheranno.

{{nihongo|'''''Theme Aquarium'''''|テーマ アクアリウム}} is a [[simulation video game]] published by [[Electronic Arts Square]], in which the player creates and controls a sea life [[Public aquarium|aquarium]]. It was originally released on 17 December 1998 for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] only in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=PSN&gt;"[http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/data/574984.html ''Theme Aquarium'' Release Information for PlayStataion]" ''[[GameFAQs]]''. Retrieved December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The game was later ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] under the name '''''Aquarium''''' and was released in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=PC&gt;"[http://themeworld.simgames.net/aquarium/ ''Theme Aquarium'']" ''Theme World''. Retrieved December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is very similar to the other games in the ''Theme'' series, and the graphics are similar to ''[[Theme Hospital]]''. In ''Theme Aquarium'', the player begins with an expanse of empty floor space and the task is to construct a maritime attraction for visitors which must be filled with interesting and appropriate creatures at the same time as dealing with all the attendant challenges of running a profitable business. There are two ways of getting fish and other sea life, either by buying them off sellers or by catching them yourself. Dolphin shows can also be created and serve as the star attraction of the aquarium. Staff must be hired to maintain the aquarium and also to take proper care and attention to the animals.

== Development ==
In a 1999 interview, [[Bullfrog Productions]] co-founder [[Les Edgar]] stated that ''Theme Aquarium'' was produced and tested in the United Kingdom, but implemented in Japan. His intention was to "cross barriers" between the United Kingdom and Japan, and produce a game suitable for both markets, as, due to the success of ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'' and ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'' in Japan, he thought Bullfrog were more successful than other companies in producing games that were successful there. He commented that it sold well in Japan, but would not in the United Kingdom, and that the idea of having the producers in the United Kingdom and the development team in Japan worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Edge|publisher=[[Future plc]]|ISSN=1350-1593|department=Audience|pages=120–125|issue=74|date=August 1999|title=An Audience With Les Edgar|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bullfrog programmer Jonty Barnes asked fourteen ex-colleagues about the game, none of whom were familiar with it, with one describing it as "one of those obscure titles", although he also stated that it was known that it was intended for a Japan-only release on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|ISSN=1742-3155|title=Revisiting Bullfrog: 25 Years On|pages=60–67|issue=110|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other versions ==

=== Windows port ===
The game was originally intended to only be released in Japan, however Electronic Arts later developed an English version of the game.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt; This version however was not to be on PlayStation, the game's original platform, but rather on Microsoft Windows. Not only was the English version on a different platform but it was also renamed. It was released simply as ''Aquarium'' on 15 December 2000&lt;ref name=EU&gt;"[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/aquarium/similar.html?mode=versions ''Aquarium'' for PC – Release Summary]" ''[[GameSpot]]''. Retrieved December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; only in Europe.

A "Collector's Edition" version was released a year later on 5 October 2001.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;

=== PlayStation Network release ===
''Theme Aquarium'' has been released as a [[List of PSone Classics (Japan)|PSone Classic]] in Japan, allowing it to be played on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. It was released on 24 September 2009 and is available to download from the [[PlayStation Network]] store.&lt;ref name=JP&gt;"[http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/jp0006npjj00293_000000000000000001.html Software Catagloue – ''Theme Aquarium'']" ''PlayStation.com(Japan)''.

'''William Cameron Forbes''' (May 21, 1870 – December 24, 1959) was an [[United States|American]] [[investment banker]] and  [[diplomat]]. He served as [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] of the [[Philippines]] from 1909 to 1913 and [[Ambassador of the United States]] to [[Japan]] from 1930 to 1932.

He was the son of [[William Hathaway Forbes]], president of the [[Bell Telephone Company]], and wife Edith Emerson, a daughter of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], nephew of James Grant Forbes and grandson of [[Francis Blackwell Forbes]].  After graduating from [[Harvard]] in 1892, he embarked on a business career, eventually becoming a partner in J. M. Forbes and Company.&lt;ref name="nyt1930"&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00D16FF395C157A93C1A9178DD85F448385F9  "W. Cameron Forbes for Envoy to Japan; Bostonian Selected by President Hoover to Succeed W.R. Castle Jr.; Forbes was in Philippines; Served There as Vice Governor and Governor General Under Roosevelt and Taft,"] ''New York Times.'' June 3, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philippines==
During the administration of President [[William Howard Taft]], Forbes was [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] from 1909 to 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/06/22/100371322.pdf  "Gov. Forbes Ill; Worn Out by Eight Years Under High Tension in the Philippines,"] ''New York Times.'' June 22, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, during the administration of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], he had been [[Department of Commerce and Police|Commissioner of Commerce and Police]] in the American colonial [[Insular Government]] of the Philippines from 1904 through 1908; and he was Vice Governor from 1908 through 1909.&lt;ref name="nyt1930"/&gt; As modest legacy from those years of service in [[Manila]], the [[gated community]] of Forbes Park in [[Makati City|Makati]], was named after him; and this community is the residence of some of the wealthiest people in the country.  Also, Lacson Ave. (Formerly Forbes Ave.) in Manila is still called "Forbes" by some up to the present day.

In 1921, President [[Warren G. Harding]] sent Forbes and [[Leonard Wood]] as heads of the Wood-Forbes Commission to investigate conditions in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="nyt1930"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jones |first=O.

==Haiti==
Forbes was appointed by President [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1930 to lead a commission charged with investigating the reasons for ongoing minor rebellions in [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name="nyt1930"/&gt;

==Japan==
Forbes was nominated By President Hoover and confirmed as [[United States Ambassador to Japan]], 1930-1932.&lt;ref name="nyt1930"/&gt;

==Later years==
Forbes received an LL.D. from [[Bates College]] in 1932.  He was on the Board of Trustees, [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] and a Life Member of the Corporation, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  He was on the original standing committee of the [[Foundation for the Study of Cycles]] from 1941.  He died unmarried in 1959.

His seasonal home [[Birdwood (Thomasville, Georgia)|Birdwood]], a mansion built in the 1930s for him in southern [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Sources==
His papers are in the [[Houghton Library]] at [[Harvard University]]. Copies of his annotated journal are at the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]], Boston. The report of the Forbes Commission's Haitian analysis is at the Library of Congress.
