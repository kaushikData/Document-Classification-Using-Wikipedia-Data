'''Alexandru Cantacuzino-Deleanu''' or '''Alexandros Kantakouzinos''' ({{lang-el|Αλέξανδρος Καντακουζηνός}}: 1787 in [[Iași]], [[Moldavia]] – 1841 in [[Athens]], [[Greece]]) was a [[Phanariote]] [[Romanians|Romanian]]-[[Greeks|Greek]] magnate and politician.

==Biography==
Alexandros Kantakouzinos was born in [[Iași]], in the [[principality of Moldavia]], as a younger son of the [[boyar]] [[Matei Cantacuzino-Deleanu]] (c. 1750 – c. 1817), justiciar of Moldavia and state councillor of the [[Russian Empire]], and his wife princess Ralou ('Rhalouka', 'Ralitza') [[Callimachi]] (1763–1837). Matei Cantacuzino belonged to the [[Phanariote]] Greek [[Cantacuzino family]], which had long settled in the [[Danubian Principalities]].

Alexandros Kantakouzinos was born during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)|Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792]], during which Russia occupied parts of the Danubian Principalities for several years. In 1791, Matei Cantacuzino entered Russian service, and the family followed the departing Russian troops to the Russian Empire. Alexandros Kantakouzinos served as a chamberlain to the Russian tsar. As young man, he married the Ukrainian noblewoman Elisabeta Darahan, a grand-niece of the last [[Hetman of Ukraine]], the last sovereign lord of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. The matrimony made Alexandros a married-in-member of the influential [[Rozumovski]] clan – his wife's cousins, who at this time held such eminent positions as Ambassador to the Austrian court in Vienna, and Minister of Education in [[St. Petersburg]]. His brother, Grigore Cantacuzino-Deleanu served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and rose to the rank of colonel, before being killed in the [[Battle of Borodino]] in 1812 against [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]].

In 1812, after [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|another Russo-Turkish war]], [[Eastern Moldavia]] was annexed to the Russian Empire, and Alexandros' father, his mother and his siblings and their families returned to their ancestral home. In 1821, along with his brother Gheorghe (1786–1857), Alexandros joined the forces of [[Alexandros Ypsilantis]], the leader of the Greek secret society ''[[Filiki Etaireia]]'', when he crossed the [[Pruth]] into Moldavia and launched an anti-Ottoman revolt. The rebellion in the Danubian Principalities was swiftly crushed, but before its final defeat, Ypsilantis sent his younger brother [[Dimitrios Ypsilantis|Dimitrios]] along with Alexandros Kantakouzinos to the [[Peloponnese]] in Greece, where a parallel rebellion had broken out in March.

Kantakouzinos participated in the capture of [[Monemvasia]] and the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]], but in 1822 he fell out with Dimitrios Ypsilantis and joined the camp of his rival, the Phanariote [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]]. He later left Greece and settled in [[Dresden]]. He returned to Greece in 1829, after Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] became Governor of Greece. As Greek independence became internationally recognized, he bought up the estates (''[[Chiflik (Ottoman Empire)|çifliks]]'') of several Ottoman grandees in [[Attica]], most notably the ''[[mufti]]'' of [[Athens]] and Omer Pasha of [[Karystos]], from whom he purchased [[Tatoi]] (the future summer residence of the [[Greek royal family]]).

Alexandros Kantakouzinos died in 1841 in Athens.

== Family ==
His children included:

* Elpis (Nadine) Kantakouzini,  (before 1820 – 7  January 1883), heiress of some of her father's estates, such as Tatoi, in 1834 she married the Phanariote general [[Skarlatos Soutsos]] (1808–1887)
* Helene Kantakouzini (1819–1845)  wife of Count Maurice [[O'Donnell of Tyrconnell]]
* Matthaios Kantakouzinos (1809–1842)
* Mikael Kantakouzenos (1812–1881), marshal of nobility of [[Bessarabia]], an officer in the Greek and Russian military and a politician in Romania, married with countess Louise Armansperg (c 1817–1835), eldest daughter of count [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]], Prime Minister of Greece
* [[Alexandru Cantacuzino]] (1813–1884), author, lawyer in Bucharest and Foreign Minister of Romania.
* Dimitrios Kantakouzinos (1817–1877), Greek Army officer and husband of countess Sophia Armansperg, heiress of [[Loham]], sister of the abovementioned Louise, and co-heiress of estates in Bavaria and Austria such as their seat the [[Schloss Egg]] as well as [[Breitenried]] in Austria. The two countesses, sisters Armansperg, had a double wedding while their father was a leader of Greek politics.
* Alexandros Kantakouzinos, the maternal grandfather of the writer [[Elisa Soutzos]] (1837-1887) and of [[Dimitrios Soutzos]] (1846-1904), [[mayor of Athens]] (1879..1887).

'''Tyler Jordan Cassidy''' was a 15-year-old boy who was killed by [[Victoria Police]] officers in [[Australia]]. His death influenced changes in the way Victoria Police respond to people presenting as mentally ill, and in the use of tasers.

==Shooting==
Tyler Jordan Cassidy was shot by police and died on 11 December 2008 at [[Northcote, Victoria#All Nations Park|All Nations Park]] in [[Northcote, Victoria]]. Before the shooting Cassidy had armed himself with two large knives which he had stolen from a nearby shopping centre and threatened members of the public, insisting that they call the police. In the park, police demanded that Cassidy drop the knives, but he did not. After attempting to subdue Cassidy twice with [[OC spray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/just-shoot-me-i-want-to-die-inquest-told-of-tylers-final-moments-20101103-17dav.html | title='Just shoot me, I want to die': inquest told of Tyler's final moments | date=3 November 2010 | accessdate=16 December 2013 | first1=Farah | last1=Farouque | location=Melbourne | work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; three officers fired ten shots from their [[Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10]] [[.38 Special]]  revolvers, with five of these striking Cassidy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/the-fatal-police-shooting-of-tyler-cassidy-five-years-ago-still-haunts-all-involved/news-story/eb79285cd002665acb629eeb46412941&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="corin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/resources/cbd04294-9314-4f4a-804a-5c2b15e10e64/tylercassidypart1_554208.pdf | title=Court reference 5542/08 | publisher=Coroners Court of Victoria | work=Inquest into the death of Tyler Jordan Cassidy | date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
The [[Coroners Court of Victoria]] found that there was much public commentary of the incident and that the death of "a 15-year-old boy at the hands of the Victoria Police both shocked and bewildered us as a community."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/resources/cbd04294-9314-4f4a-804a-5c2b15e10e64/tylercassidypart1_554208.pdf  ''Coroner's Report, Redacted Finding into Death with Inquest, Tyler Jordan Cassidy'', Summary of Findings. P.10] accessed 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The competence and impartiality of the internal police investigation was questioned. The Coroner's Inquest heard 34 days of evidence from 63 witnesses and the brief of evidence was 3,710 pages long.&lt;ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coronerscourt.vic.gov.au/home/coroners+written+findings/findings+-+inquest+into+the+death+of+tyler+cassidy | title=Court reference 5542/08 | publisher=Coroners Court of Victoria | work=Inquest into the death of Tyler Jordan Cassidy | date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the inquest: "He [Cassidy] had been capsicum-sprayed twice without effect and advanced on an officer who became trapped at the top of a skate park bowl, the coroner found. Three of the police fired at him after a warning shot and several shots at his legs failed to stop Tyler moving forward with the knives towards [Leading Senior Constable Colin Dods]. Tyler had been drinking excessively during the night and was found to have a post mortem blood alcohol level of between 0.09g/100ml and 0.11g/100ml."

State Coroner Jennifer Coate rejected a submission from Cassidy's family that the officers used disproportionate force worthy of criminal charges, or that Cassidy had been standing still when he was fatally shot.&lt;ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"/&gt;

The incident was blamed on a lack of training and information gathering performed by Victoria Police. Subsequently, all police officers who might come into contact with individuals who appear to be mentally ill in the course of duty are required to undergo a two-day training course twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/file_uploads/Policing_people_who_appear_to_be_mentally_pyt8YbmN.pdf |page=32 |title=Policing people who appear to be mentally ill |date=November 2012 |first1=Ron |last1=Bonighton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family's Appeal to the UN==
Following the closing of the case by Australian &lt;!--or Victorian? they're different.--&gt;police and determining that the officers acted within the bounds of their duty, Cassidy's mother, Shani Cassidy, appealed to the [[United Nations]] for a review of the process by which fatal police shootings are investigated by the Victoria Police Homicide Squad. The author of the UN submission, Anna Brown, expected no additional evidence regarding the investigation to be elicited.&lt;ref name="Cassidy2013"&gt;{{Citation | last=Cassidy | first=Shani | url=https://www.hrlc.org.au/news/un-communication-lodged-by-shani-cassidy?rq=tyler%20cassidy | title= Complete statement from Shani Cassidy regarding UN Communication | publisher=Human Rights Law Centre | year=2013 | accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the complaints were allegations of poor investigative police work. Three of the four police officers involved attended a police function where alcohol was served the night before the fatal shooting occurred, but no alcohol or drug testing was administered at the time of the incident. Ten shots were fired but no bullets were recovered from the crime scene. Dods received a private phone call from his commanding officer immediately after the event; an issue Dods himself was highly critical about when cross examined.&lt;ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"/&gt; Gunshot residue testing was significantly delayed, possibly leading to inconclusive results. No reconstruction was requested of the officers.&lt;ref name="Coroners Court of Victoria"/&gt;

==Police integrity==
Shani Cassidy made complaints over the integrity of Victoria Police. She alleged that her son's name was disclosed to the media as well as a "demonising" report of the incident less than three hours of it occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1=Julie-Anne | first2=Milanda | last1=Davies | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/call-for-answers-after-cops-kill-boy/story-e6frg6of-1111118304499# | last2=Rout | title=Call for answers after cops kill 15-year-old Tyler Cassidy | accessdate=4 December 2013 | work=The Australian | date=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant Commissioner Cartwright, then the appointed officer for communicating with the media regarding the event, was accused of disclosing Cassidy's name by the family's counsel, but Victoria Police has strongly denied these accusations.

At one time Shani Cassidy was secretly recorded by homicide detectives during an interview. Her appeal to the UN raised her complaint that following the incident Victoria Police attempted to exculpate themselves.&lt;ref name="Cassidy2013"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, ''[[The Age]]'' reported that this Wikipedia page had been edited by Victoria Police at least 17 times to November 2014, apparently to give a more favourable impression of the officers' conduct and the subsequent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-police-edits-wikipedia-page-of-police-shooting-victim-tyler-cassidy-20150601-gh9vt1.html Liam Mannix, "Victoria Police edits Wikipedia page of police shooting victim Tyler Cassidy," ''The Age,'' 1 June 2015] Accessed 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate over use of Tasers==
Former [[Police commissioner|chief commissioner]] of [[Victoria Police]] [[Christine Nixon]] has suggested that Cassidy's death prompted further community debate about the use of Tasers by Victoria Police.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Nixon (2011) ''Fair Cop'' p.258, Victory Books, {{ISBN|9780522862058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Tasers were trialed in Bendigo and Morwell "because of the high use of OC spray, incidents involving people with a mental illness, sieges and instances where offenders have used weapons."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/country-police-equipped-with-tasers-from-sunday-in-trial-run/news-story/639bcc5a0a8ddf73bdb317d4c9b643a6 Wes Hosking, Herald Sun, June 30, 2010, "Country police equipped with Tasers from Sunday in trial run"] Accessed 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Tasers were made more widely available to Victoria Police. Deputy Commissioner Wendy Steendam said "What Tasers do for our members is to actually offer them another option in resolutions of incidents where they're having violent confrontations or where people are attempting to self-harm."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-14/regional-victorian-police-to-get-tasers/7245208 ABC News "Regional Victorian police to get Tasers to stop violent offenders"] Accessed 27 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defamation case of 2016==
In May 2016, lawyer Michael McDonald was found to have defamed Sergeant Colin Dods and ordered to pay damages. Justice Kevin Bell described the defamatory comments, made online, as "very grave. The publication caused (Sergeant Dods) to suffer continuing intense distress, humiliation and embarrassment and thereby great harm in his reputation," the judge said.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lawyer-ordered-to-pay-150000-to-police-officer-after-claiming-teenager-tyler-cassidy-was-executed-20160506-gonuas.html Mark Russell and Adam Cooper ''"Lawyer must pay police officer $150,000 over claim teenager Tyler Cassidy was 'executed''"'' The Age, May 6, 2016] Accessed 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dieudonné Joseph Saive''' (23 May 1888 – 12 October 1970) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[small arms]] designer who designed several well-known firearms for Belgian armsmaker [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal|Fabrique Nationale]], including the [[FN Model 1949]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Career ==

In 1921, the French military requested that [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal|Fabrique Nationale]] create a new semi-automatic [[9 mm caliber|nine millimetre]] pistol with a 15-round magazine. [[John Browning]], who was FN's chief weapons designer, initially declined to respond to the French request because he felt standard single-row magazines holding seven or eight rounds (such as was used in his Colt's [[Model 1911]]) were sufficient. Saive, who was then Browning's assistant at FN, set to work designing a high-capacity, double-row magazine. Saive mated his experimental magazine to a modified [[FN Model 1903]] for testing. Saive then provided the completed magazine to Browning who developed two 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistol designs using locked and unlocked breeches. Browning and Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. submitted a U.S. patent application for the locked-breech version of the pistol on June 28, 1923. The patent was granted on February 22, 1927, four months after Browning's death at FN's plant in [[Liège]], Belgium. Colt's elected to concentrate on manufacturing its hugely successful Model 1911 instead of either of Browning's new 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistols so Browning's son [[Val A. Browning|Val]] offered the design to FN. This pistol design, modified after Browning's death, was offered as the 13-shot FN Browning Model 1922 or ''Grand Rendement'' (meaning High Yield).&lt;ref&gt;Law, Clive M., ''Inglis Diamond, The Canadian High Power Pistol'', Collector Grade Publications, (2001), pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the expiration of the patents on the Model 1911, Saive redesigned the ''Grand Rendement'' to incorporate the best features of both pistols in the FN Model 1928, which still bore Browning's name.

In 1928 Saive traveled to [[Yugoslavia]] to set up the state arsenal in [[Kragujevac]].

In 1929, Saive returned to Belgium where he oversaw the manufacture of the commercial version of the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]]. By 1930, Saive was promoted to become FN's chief weapons designer (''Chef de Service''). Saive improved the operating mechanism of the .30 cal. [[M1919 Browning]] M2 AN aircraft machine gun in 1932, increasing its rate of fire to 1,200 rpm. In 1938, he made additional improvements to the M2 further increasing its rate of fire to 1,500 rpm.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Dolf L., ''The Browning Machine Gun, Volume II: Rifle Caliber Brownings Abroad'', Collector Grade Publications, 1st ed. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
During the same period, Saive continued to improve the ''Grand Rendement,'' and by 1934 the French term ''Grande Puissance'' ("Hi-Power") was first applied to the evolved design which became the French GP-35 self-loading pistol or FN [[Browning Hi-Power]].&lt;ref&gt;Law, Clive M., ''Inglis Diamond, The Canadian High Power Pistol'', Collector Grade Publications, (2001), pp. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hi-Power was the first [[9×19mm]] handgun to utilize a true staggered-column [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]. The large magazine enabled the weapon to carry a total of fourteen cartridges without an excessively oversized or protruding handgrip.

France declined to adopt the ''Hi-Power'' for its armed forces, instead using the [[Modèle 1935 pistol]]. Despite this rejection, the ''Hi-Power'' was a sales success with more than 56,000 produced by May 1940, mostly for the Belgian military. It was used extensively in World War II by many nations including the British Commonwealth and Chinese forces. More than 65,000 Hi-Power pistols were also used by German forces, renamed ''Pistole 640(b)'', after the Nazis captured FN's manufacturing plant in Liège on May 12, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Law, Clive M., ''Inglis Diamond, The Canadian High Power Pistol'', Collector Grade Publications, (2001), pp. 17-8&lt;/ref&gt;
Saive fled the German invasion, eventually arriving in London in mid-1941. He was soon at work at the [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] Design Department at the Drill Hall in Cheshunt, England, recreating [[production drawing]]s for the Hi-Power and further developing his design for a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] rifle called the ''EXP-1'', later the FN ''Model 1949''. By June 1943, the British modified Saive's technical drawings to produce the ''Mk. I U.K.'' model of the ''Hi-Power''.&lt;ref&gt;Law, Clive M., ''Inglis Diamond, The Canadian High Power Pistol'', Collector Grade Publications, (2001), pp. 18-22, ''citing'' Stevens, R. Blake, ''The Browning High Power Automatic Pistol,'' Collector Grade Publications, (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1943, China requested 180,000 Hi-Powers with hollow wooden shoulder stocks that also served as holsters through a Mutual Aid Plan with Canada. The Chinese were familiar with the C96 Mauser Broomhandle that came with a stock/holster and wanted the same thing for the Hi-Powers they requested. The Canadian contract was with the Inglis firm who hired Dieudonné Saive and Rene Laloux, both Belgian engineers, to work on production. After the war, the Browning ''Hi-Power'' was adopted as the standard military service sidearm of many Western countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia. Slightly modernized versions remain in production today, three-quarters of a century later.

'''Saive's Gas-Operated Rifle Designs'''

Saive is most famous for his series of gas-operated self-loading rifle designs, which used a tipping bolt to lock the action. His ''[[FN Model 1949|FN-49]]'' rifle went into production, and was later developed into the widely successful ''[[FN FAL]]'' selective-fire [[battle rifle]].

==Political life==
Cojuangco was a close adviser and personal friend to former Philippine president [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]], which led his estrangement from his cousin, [[Corazon Aquino]], who, after Marcos' ouster, succeeded him as president. He was a member of the group nicknamed the "[[Rolex 12]]", a group of 12 men who were closest to Marcos and allegedly were his enforcers of Martial Law. He is also an honorary member of  PMA Class 1951. Cojuangco also was accused by the military men at the scene of [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]]'s assassination, as the leader who orchestrated the crime.

He is currently the chairman emeritus of the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], the party he founded in 1992 which served as his vehicle to further his aspirations in the [[Philippine general election, 1992|1992 presidential elections]]. He was a candidate for the [[Philippine general election, 1992|Philippine presidency in 1992]], ultimately losing in a tight election to [[Fidel V. Ramos]]. Ramos received 23.6% of the vote. [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]] came in second with 19.7% and Cojuangco came in third with 18.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Sports patron==

He was also an advocate for sports in the country through using his companies as sponsor for various events. He is notable for supporting basketball in a huge way since the 1980s as a basketball godfather for President Marcos with the famed [[Northern Cement basketball team|Northern Consolidated]] team. Through [[San Miguel Corporation]], he currently owns three teams  in the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] (the flagship [[San Miguel Beermen]], [[Barangay Ginebra San Miguel]], and [[Star Hotshots]]). He is also the key benefactor of the [[De La Salle Green Archers]] men's basketball team.

==Personal life==
Cojuangco is the eldest child of Eduardo C. Cojuangco Sr. and Josephine B. Murphy. His mother, the daughter of an [[Irish Canadians|Irish-Canadian]] U.S. Army volunteer who married a Filipina woman, was born and raised in [[Baguio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W9BwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22josephine%20nene%20murphy%22|first=Earl G.|last=Parreño|title=Boss Danding|publication-place=Quezon City|publisher=First Quarter Storm Foundation|year=2003|page=45|oclc=54960241}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Eduardo Sr., the son of Melecio Cojuangco, was of [[Chinese Filipinos|Chinese descent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.townandcountry.ph/people/heritage/who-are-the-most-generous-enduring-families-of-the-philippines-a1590-20161104-lfrm2|title=The Most Influential and Enduring Families of the Philippines|work=Town &amp; Country Magazine Philippines|date=2016-11-24|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Dugger''' (June 6, 1894 – March 5, 1939) was a military commander and prominent [[African American]] citizen in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]. During his career, he served in [[World War One]], commanded Company K of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry Regiment]] ultimately rising to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. He was President of the West Medford Men's Community Club and Chair of the Citizen's Committee bringing Boy Scouts Troop No. 11 to the area.  Dugger was the first African American to be appointed to the Medford City Planning Board and to have a Medford public park named after him, "Dugger Park." Dugger died in 1939.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Dugger Park Sign Medford Massachusetts USA.jpg|thumb|Dugger Park Sign Medford Massachusetts USA]]
Dugger was born in Finchley, Virginia, on June 6, 1894. As a young boy he moved with his family to [[Natick, Massachusetts]], where he received his elementary education and was a member of the Boys' Patrol. Dugger's family eventually moved to [[Boston]] and he attended [[Boston English High]].  During his high school years, he was a track star and a member of his school's military regiment. Upon graduation in 1914, Dugger signed up for the National Guard and later enlisted in the famous Company L of the 6th Massachusetts Infantry. He was commissioned first lieutenant on October 14, 1917 at Fort Des Moines, and weeks later married a West Medford native, Madeline Mabray Kountze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/02/10/west-medford-historically-black-community-crossroads/aiGJYLMNo5TjnJmzSrJ9bK/story.html|title=In West Medford, a historically black community at a crossroads - Magazine - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
In June 1918, Dugger began his duty overseas.  The British had been training American soldiers as they arrived but refused to train the 92nd and 93rd Divisions.  To avoid trouble, the United States turned these men over to the French Army, who had been requesting extra troops.  In addition to racism, the men faced the many maladies of war.  Dugger's son, Cortland, recounts:

"They slept in the trenches... Everything they did&amp;nbsp;— they ate, they did, they fought in the trenches... in rain, sleet, whatever else, cold weather.  It was an awful war... You know they were gassed, their clothing wasn't adequate, they had a whole host of diseases over the place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dohmen|first=Ilsa|title=West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project, conducted by Tufts University|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ilsa-dohmen-interviewing-cortland-dugger-2006-february.jpg}}Ilsa Dohmen interviewing Cortland Dugger, February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local service ==
Dugger won distinction for bravery and returned home in March 1919.  He joined the Boston Police Force and later the Postal Service, where he worked until his retirement fifteen years later.  Edward and Madeline had six children between 1919 and 1930, and had a house built on Jerome Street in West Medford for their big family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ceruzzi|first=Kristina|title=A Tribute to the Life of:  Madeleine Dugger Andrews 1922 -1986|url=http://www.medfordhistorical.org/pdfs/madeleineduggerandrewsbio.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, Dugger had been commissioned a Major and made Captain of Company K of the [[372nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|372nd Infantry Regiment]]. He became the commanding officer in December 1930 and devoted much of his energy to the unit until his retirement in 1936.

At home and in the community, Dugger served as a model of duty and leadership.  He was President of the West Medford Men's Community Club and Chair of the Citizen's Committee that brought Boy Scouts Troop No. 11 to the area.  In 1936, he was appointed the first black member of the Medford City Planning Board by Mayor Irwin.  However he would serve for only two years due to illness.

== Illness and death ==
Between 1936 and 1938, Dugger retired from all these positions.  He had been sick with polycystic kidneys for many years and found his health failing.  On March 5, 1939, Dugger died in the U.S. Naval Hospital Chelsea, Massachusetts, at the age of 44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Kristen|title=A Legacy Remembered: The African American Community of West Medford|date=Mar 29, 2012|publisher=Author House|isbn=1468563688|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Deu4qTNqjc4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dugger Park dedication and remembrance ==
Later in 1939, for the first time in its history, the City of Medford honored an African American citizen in naming a public park after him. Called the "Dugger Park", the area along the Mystic River at Harvard Avenue has grown to include tennis and basketball courts, a baseball field, and a playground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dugger Park|url=http://medford.patch.com/listings/dugger-park|publisher=Medford Patch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Matthew Bullock remarked at the dedication that the park was "destined to be a large factor in moulding the lives of the children of this community."  And indeed it was.  The park plays host to myriad community events and a sign post at the intersection of Harvard Avenue and Mystic River Road boasts graffiti letting passersby know that local children consider it: "The Action Plase [sic]" .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The pole north-east of Dugger Park in which "Action Plase" is written.|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Action_%22Plase%22_Pole_Dugger_Park..png}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Dugger Park, the Medford Public Library, has an exhibit about Dugger under "Leaders in the Military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dohmen|first=Ilsa|title=Medford MA Public Library, Leaders in the Military : Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Dugger|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Lieutenant_Colonel_Edward_Dugger_Medford_Massachusetts_Public_Library_2014_Mural.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dohmen|first=Ilsa|title=West Medford African-American Remembrance Project, 2005 &gt; Series 11: Lt.

'''Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina''' (August 28, 1815 - March 29, 1890) was an Italian journalist, patriot and politician.

Considered one of the greatest journalists of the 19th century and a pioneer of modern journalism,&lt;ref&gt;Italo de Feo, ''Venti secoli di giornalismo'', Canesi, 1962, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; he is mostly remembered for his [[war correspondence]]. He wrote for many Italian papers and contributed to the press in France, Great Britain and Belgium. He was also a prolific novelist, mainly focused on religious themes.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Born at [[Moliterno]], Basilicata, at the time part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], his birth name was Ferdinando Petruccelli and he added "della Gattina" (name of a farm of his own) to his surname in order to avoid the [[Bourbon of Naples|Bourbon]] police who persecuted him for political reason. His father Luigi was a physician and member of the [[Carbonari]] while his mother Maria Antonia Piccininni was a noblewoman from [[Marsicovetere]].

Grown up in religious circles and because of the abuses received as a child, he developed a strong [[anticlericalism]] which will be reflected in his works. During his young age, he devoted himself to the study of [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Later, he attended the [[University of Naples]], graduating in medicine but he chose the path of journalism.

===Early career and exile===
In 1838, he began his career for the Neapolitan newspaper ''Omnibus'' and, in 1840, he traveled to France, Great Britain and Germany as a correspondent for ''Salvator Rosa'' and ''Raccoglitore fiorentino''. Because of his liberal ideas, he was arrested for his membership in [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] and was sent under guard to his native town.

Returned to [[Naples]] in 1848, Petruccelli was elected deputy of the Neapolitan parliament and founded ''Mondo vecchio e mondo nuovo'', a newspaper who accused the Bourbon dynasty of misgovernment in both internal and foreign policy and, for the frequent attacks on the crown, it was suppressed by the magistracy. After the suspension of the constitution promulgated by the king [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand II]] few months before, he took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|riots of the same year]]. The revolt failed and he was forced to escape to France, while the government sentenced him to death and confiscated his properties.

During his French residence, he broadened his political and cultural horizons, thanks to contacts with renowned thinkers. He attended courses at the [[Sorbonne]] and the [[Collège de France]], studied French and English literature and pursued a brilliant career as a journalist, becoming known and appreciated in Europe. Nicknamed, nicely, ''Pierre Oiseau de la Petite Chatte''&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Giordano, ''Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina'', Edisud, 1987, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; (French translation of his surname), he entered the world of French journalism thanks to [[Jules Simon]] and [[Daniele Manin]], who appreciated the intervention of ''Mondo vecchio e mondo nuovo'' in favour of the [[Republic of San Marco]].

===War correspondent===
Petruccelli became correspondent of French and Belgian journals such as ''[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]'', ''[[Journal des débats]]'', ''[[Revue de Paris]]'', ''[[Le Courrier français (1820–1851)|Le Courrier français]]'' and ''Indépendance Belge''. In 1851, he fought with the French republicans against the [[French coup of 1851|coup d'état]] of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (later known as [[Napoleon III]]) but, after the failure of the rebellion, he was expelled from France. He settled in England, where he met [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Louis Blanc]], [[Lajos Kossuth]] and other refugees. He worked for ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' of [[Charles Dickens]] and other newspapers like ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]''.

In 1859, he was correspondent of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] and, in 1860, of the [[Expedition of the Thousand]], following [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] from [[Calabria]] until his entry in Naples. With the birth of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], he was a member of the Italian parliament, sitting on the benches of the left for several years, and contributed to Italian newspapers and magazines such as ''L'Unione'', ''L'Opinione'', ''Fanfulla della Domenica'', ''Cronaca bizantina'' and ''Nuova antologia''.

In 1866, Petruccelli was correspondent for the ''Journal des Débats'' during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] and, in 1868, he married an English writer, Maude Paley-Baronet, whom he met in London in 1867. In 1870 he followed the [[Franco-Prussian War]], recouting the events from the Parisian barricades and, after the fall of the [[Paris Commune]], he was expelled from France by order of [[Adolphe Thiers]] (against which he turned bitter words) for having defended the Communards.

===Death===
He lived the rest of his life plagued by a paralysis that prevented him from writing but, with the help of his wife, he was able to continue his activity. Petruccelli died in Paris in 1890 and his corpse was cremated. The Neapolitan municipality proposed to carry his ashes to the cemetery of [[Cemetery of Poggioreale, Naples|Poggioreale]] but his wife refused and they were buried in London, respecting the will of Petruccelli.

==Legacy==
During his time, Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina wasn't much appreciated in Italy, rather he was rejected by many (especially the clerical hierarchies because of his marked anticlericalism), with the exception of authors such as [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] and [[Luigi Capuana]]. He was acclaimed in foreign countries, especially in France, where his work received positive reviews from [[Alphonse Peyrat]], [[Ernest Renan]] and [[Jules Claretie]], who said about his war correspondence of [[Battle of Custoza (1866)|Custoza]] : "Nothing could be more fantastic and cruelly true than this tableau of agony. Reportage has never given a superior artwork",&lt;ref&gt;Jules Claretie, ''La vie à Paris'', Bibliothèque Charpentier, 1896, p.367&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Justin McCarthy (1830–1912)|Justin McCarthy]] regarded him as "a brilliant, audacious, eccentric Italian journalist".&lt;ref&gt;Justin McCarthy, ''Modern Leaders'', Sheldon &amp; Co., 1872, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, Petruccelli was praised by [[Luigi Russo]] and [[Indro Montanelli]], who considered him the "most brilliant italian journalist of the 19th century" and his reports "would enchant for their freshness and modernity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/marzo/06/Trasformismo_nato_nei_salotti_finito_co_0_9903061816.shtml|title= Trasformismo, nato nei salotti finito nelle bettole|author= Indro Montanelli|date= 6 March 1999|work= |publisher= archiviostorico.corriere.it|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fijians''' ({{lang-fj|iTaukei}}) are a nation and ethnic group native to [[Fiji]], who speak [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and share a common history and culture.

Fijians, or ''iTaukei'',&lt;ref&gt;Since 2010, the word "Fijian" legally also denotes nationality and not ethnicity.&lt;/ref&gt; are the major indigenous people of the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]], and live in an area informally called [[Melanesia]]. Indigenous Fijians are believed to have arrived in Fiji from western [[Melanesia]] approximately 3,500 years ago, though the exact origins of the Fijian people are unknown. Later they would move onward to other surrounding islands, including [[Rotuma]], as well as blending with other (Polynesian) settlers on [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]]. They are indigenous to all parts of Fiji except the island of [[Rotuma]]. The original settlers are now called "[[Lapita]] people" after a distinctive pottery produced locally. Lapita pottery was found in the area from 800 BCE onward.

As of 2005, indigenous Fijians constituted slightly more than half of the total [[Demographics of Fiji|Fijian population]]. Indigenous Fijians are predominantly of [[Melanesian]] extraction, with some [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] admixture.

Australia has the largest Fijian expatriate population, according to the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, while Fijians were also the fifth largest Pacific ethnic group living in New Zealand; a decrease of 8 percent between 1996 and 2001. The estimated Pacific Islander population size is 231,800 in 2001 Fijians comprising about 7,000 of that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minpac.govt.nz/regional_pacificpeoplesinnz_fijian.htm |title= Fijian People in New Zealand |publisher = New Zealand Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs |accessdate = 19 March 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712184200/http://www.minpac.govt.nz/regional_pacificpeoplesinnz_fijian.htm |archivedate = 12 July 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside [[Oceania]], a substantial Fijian diaspora is found in other [[anglophone]] countries, namely [[Ethnic groups in Canada|Canada]], [[Fijian American|United States]] and the [[Fijians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].

The ''Bose Levu Vakaturaga'' ([[Great Council of Chiefs]]) once passed laws and regulations governing the indigenous Fijian people. Until its disbanding by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military of Fiji]] following the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|2006 coup]], the Great Council of Chiefs met yearly to discuss native Fijian concerns. The council, which was formerly responsible for appointing Fiji's president, was composed of 55 Fijian [[Ratu|chiefs]] selected from the 14 provinces. Included in the council were three appointees from the island of Rotuma and six appointed by the [[Minister of Fijian Affairs]]. The Minister of Fijian Affairs consulted with the President as part of the selection process. Former Prime Minister [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] was given a lifetime appointment on the council.

The [[Tabua]] is a much revered whale's tooth which is used in both public and private occasions or ceremonies. The tooth is considered sacred.&lt;ref name="Official Fiji government site"&gt;[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.shtml Official Fiji government site]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421073300/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.shtml |date=21 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yaqona (pronounced yung-gohna), otherwise known as [[kava]] – another important traditional custom – is an infusion prepared from the root of ''Piper methysticum'', a type of pepper plant. The plant itself is also often referred to as yaqona or the kava plant. Yaqona is extremely important in indigenous Fijian culture – in the time of the 'old religion' it was used ceremonially by chiefs and priests only. Today, yaqona is part of daily life, both in villages and in urban areas and across all classes and walks of life. 'Having a grog' or 'drinking grog', as drinking kava is sometimes known, is used for welcoming and bonding with visitors, for storytelling sessions or merely for passing time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The native [[Fijian language]] belongs to the Central Pacific (Fijian – Polynesian) branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Gary F. and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2017. [https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/central-pacific "Central Pacific"], Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Twentieth edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 86 percent of the land in Fiji is owned by indigenous Fijian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nltb.com.fj/commentary/00_05_02.html|title=Land Rights in Fiji - A Sad Irony : Commentary - Native Land Trust Board|author=|date=|website=www.nltb.com.fj|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Sir [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Hamilton-Gordon]], the British [[British Empire|colonial]] [[Governor of Fiji|Governor]], prohibited the sale of Fijian land to non-ethnic Fijians. This controversial policy continues today.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The Governor also banned the employment of native Fijians as labourers, and in 1878, began importing [[Indian indenture system|indentured labourers from India]] to work in the sugarcane fields. The effects of this immigration created an ethnic polarisation and rampant [[Anti-Indian]] sentiment, which has proven to be politically challenging to Fijian race relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The legacy of Indian migration to European colonies|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21727896-century-after-india-ended-system-indentured-labour-its-diaspora-building|accessdate=2 September 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indigenous Fijians overwhelmingly report as being Christian, with the [[Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma]] claiming the loyalty of 66.6% (1996 census). Other significant denominations include the [[Roman Catholicism in Fiji|Roman Catholic Church]] (13.3%), the [[Assembly of God|Assemblies of God]] (6.2%) and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] (5.1%). About 8% belong to other churches from a large number of denominations. Only about 0.8% report as following non-Christian religions or no religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Approximately 70% of indigenous Fijians are farmers, many of which are [[sustenance farming|sustenance farmers]]. They commonly grow such crops as [[sugar cane]], [[cassava]], rice, [[sweet potatoes]], and bananas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==History==
Historically, Fijians were known{{By whom|date=November 2010}} as the [[canoe]] building experts of the Pacific, using them to trade with [[Tonga]]. They were usually large double-hulled canoes, called a [[Drua]] (pronounced nDroo-ah), with each side being similar except one was shorter and served as a type of [[outrigger]]. These were united by beams, with a platform on it that extended beyond the sides.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

:''The article on the [[History of Fiji]] offers a [[time line]] of events.''

The [[Lapita]] people, named after their distinctive pottery style, were the first people to inhabit Fiji in about 3000 BCE, and evidence of their settlements exist throughout Fiji – particularly around the Sigatoka Sand Dunes. They were followed by the [[Melanesians]] in about 500 BCE, and relatively recent trading with the Polynesian Tongans has added to the cultural mix. In the Lau group of islands, aspects of both cultures still intermingle. There was active commerce between Tonga and Fiji, and later in the history of this relationship, the Fijians in the Lau Islands (Eastern Fiji) became vassals to the King of Tonga. One particular reason Tongans and Samoans came to Fiji was to build the Drua (large double-hulled canoes) which they couldn't build on their own islands because of the lack of proper timber.

From the early 19th century, both European and Chinese traders visited Fiji for its sandalwood, hardwoods, beche-de-mer, marinelife and, more recently, gold. The British ruled Fiji from 1874 to 1970. In 1970, Fiji became a fully independent nation with constitutional arrangements to ensure that traditional Fijian interests were preserved.

[[Prince of Wales|His Royal Highness Prince of Wales]], [[Prince Charles]], presented the Instruments of Independence to Prime Minister Ratu Sir [[Kamisese Mara]] on 10 October 1970 at a massive gathering at Albert Park in Suva. In 1972, [[Fijian general election, 1972|the first general elections]] were held using [[1970 Constitution of Fiji|the 1970 constitution]]. In 1987, [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|two military coups]] were staged. The first coup was bloodless, and the second coup severed ties with the [[British Monarchy]]. A controversial and racially divisive [[1990 Constitution of Fiji|new constitution was adopted in 1990]], and in 1992 the first general election was held under the auspices of the new constitution.

The constitution was [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|revised again in 1997]] and was deemed to be more equitable by the many racial groups in Fiji. Free and peaceful [[Fijian general election, 1999|elections in 1999]] resulted in a government led by an [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]], but [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|a violent coup]] in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political and racial turmoil. [[Fijian general election, 2001|Parliamentary elections]] held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]]. [[Fijian general election, 2006|Re-elected in May 2006]], Qarase [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|was ousted]] in a military coup on 5 December that year, led by the Commander of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Royal Fiji Military Forces]] (RFMF), [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama|Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama]], who initially appointed himself acting President, but in January 2007 assumed the position of interim Prime Minister, promising a return to democracy in the near future. This did not eventuate, however; elections were not held [[Fijian general election, 2014|until 2014]].

In August 2008, shortly before the proposed [[People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress]] was due to be released to the public, it was announced that it recommended a change in the name of Fiji's citizens. If the proposal were adopted, all citizens of Fiji, whatever their ethnicity, would be called "Fijians". At present, the word "Fijian" does not denote a nationality, and refers exclusively to indigenous Fijians. Citizens of Fiji are referred to as "Fiji Islanders". The proposal would change the English name of indigenous Fijians from "Fijians" to ''itaukei''.The indigenous word for Fijian is "Kaiviti"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/7352 "Charter proposes common Fijian name"], 4 August 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813005445/http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/7352 |date=13 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deposed Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] reacted by stating that the name "Fijian" belonged exclusively to indigenous Fijians, and that he would oppose any change in legislation enabling non-indigenous Fijians to use it. The Cabinet at its meeting on 30 June 2010 approved the Fijian Affairs [Amendment] Decree 2010. The new law effectively replaces the word 'Fijian' or 'indigenous' or 'indigenous Fijian' with the word 'iTaukei' in all written laws, and all official documentation when referring to the original and native settlers of Fiji. 
All Fiji citizens are now called 'Fijians'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijivillage.com/?mod=story&amp;id=080808151d4615fbbca6b1f2d9d72e "The Name “Fijian” Belongs to Indigenous – Qarase"], FijiVillage, 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fijianaffairs.gov.fj/iTaukei.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106014520/http://www.fijianaffairs.gov.fj/iTaukei.html |archivedate=6 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constitution2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Govt--Publications/Constitution.aspx|title=Fiji Government Online Portal - Constitution|author=|date=|website=www.fiji.gov.fj|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francis Jeffrey Dickens 1884.jpg|thumb|right|Francis Jeffrey Dickens as an Inspector in the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (1884)]]
'''Francis Jeffrey Dickens''' (15 January 1844 – 11 June 1886) was the third son and fifth child of Victorian English novelist [[Charles Dickens]] and his wife [[Catherine Dickens]] née Hogarth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myheritage.com/FP/family-tree.php?s=50445521&amp;familyTreeID=1 Dickens Family Tree website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career ==
Francis Dickens was nicknamed "Chickenstalker" by his father after the character Mrs. Chickenstalker in the Christmas book ''The Chimes'' that he was writing at the time of Francis's birth; however he came to be called Frank by those who knew him. He was born in England and went to school in Germany to train to become a doctor.  Giving up this ambition, he obtained a commission in the Bengal Mounted Police and served in India for seven years.

Following his father's death in 1870 he inherited some money, but he soon went through this, and his aunt, [[Georgina Hogarth]] (Catherine Dickens' sister) used her influence with family friend Lord Dufferin, then Governor General of Canada, to get Francis Dickens a commission in the [[North-West Mounted Police]].

Dickens joined the North-West Mounted Police as a Sub Inspector in Canada in 1874 shortly after the March West which brought the original police force of 300 members to the modern provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.  He would remain in the force 12 years, serving at Fort Walsh, Fort Macleod and Fort Pitt, getting promoted to Inspector in 1880.

== The Battle of Fort Pitt, 1885 ==
{{main|Battle of Fort Pitt}}
During the [[North West Rebellion]] of 1885, Francis Dickens was in charge of the defence of Fort Pitt on the North Saskatchewan River.   Francis Dickens' diary written during his charge at Fort Pitt, though very brief, is an important document of the events of the siege that led to the evacuation of the mounted police from the fort.   On his website, David J. Carter describes the events at Fort Pitt.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This site [Frog Lake, following Cree attacks on priests and Hudson's Bay Company employees and family members] was 35 miles northwest of Fort Pitt. Dickens sent out three scouts to reconnoitre. When they returned they were attacked by Cree warriors; one escaped unharmed, one was wounded – played dead then crawled to the 'fort', the other Constable Cowan was killed within sight of Fort Pitt. Then the warrior cut out young Cowan's heart and ate a piece of it before the horrified defenders of the fort.  
The NWMP detachment were outnumbered and outgunned 200 to 20. Negotiations led to the civilians agreeing to become prisoners of the Cree and Big Bear. The Chief gave Dickens and his men a short time to abandon the fort. This they did, and travelled amongst the ice pans in a leaky scow. Scouts from Fort Battleford reported that everyone at Fort Pitt had been massacred; however, after six days on the river Dickens and his men arrived at Battleford and received a hero's welcome.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Discharge and death ==
[[File:Francis Jeffrey Dickens grave.JPG|thumb|Dickens' grave in [[Riverside Cemetery (Moline, Illinois)|Riverside Cemetery]] in Moline, Illinois.]]
Following his discharge from the Mounted Police in 1886 (for reasons of ill health — he was becoming increasingly hard of hearing among other infirmities) Frank was going to embark on a series of lecture talks in the US (as his father had successfully done), but died of a heart attack at a friend's house in [[Moline, Illinois]] the night of his first speech.  He was 42 years old.

== Character reputation ==
Contemporary portrayals of Francis Dickens (such as the character Inspector Dicken in the romantic novel ''Annette the Metis Spy''), conformed to a conventional heroic type, reflecting the dominant view of the Rebellion held by (English-speaking) Eastern Canada.  However, some of his superiors in the Mounted Police held unfavorable opinions about his overall competence, echoing his father Charles Dickens, who wrote in a letter to his friend on being asked by his son for three hundred pounds, a horse and a gun to set himself up as a gentleman farmer in the colonies, that the consequence of the first is that he would be robbed of it, the second, that it would throw him, and the third, that he would shoot his own head off.

In histories of the Mounted Police, Francis Dickens is described as a tragic character, struggling to live in the shadow of his great father.  Charges against him include drunkenness, laziness and recklessness.  David Carter in the third chapter of his book questions the evidence that these claims are based on.  An article in a special RCMP issue of the Canadian history magazine The Beaver called "Francis J. Dickens, An Ordinary Officer" gives a balanced picture, pointing out his twelve years of service during which time many men in the fledging police force on the plains deserted or were discharged for misconduct, while others have gone so far as to say that he was partly responsible for the deterioration in relations between the NWMP and the Blackfoot in the 1880s!&lt;ref&gt;Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Francis Dickens in Fiction ==

The events surrounding Frog Lake and the battle of Fort Pitt are treated in ''The Temptations of Big Bear'' (1973) by [[Rudy Wiebe]].  &lt;br /&gt;In recent decades, Francis Dickens has been depicted as a comic figure.  In ''W.G. Grace's Last Case'' (1984), by [[Willie Rushton|William Rushton]], in a fantastic plot that includes fictional characters like Jekyll and Hyde and Dr. Watson, Francis Dickens encounters Apache Indians and (anachronistically) meets the famed cricketer of the title during the latter's team's 1872 North American tour.  &lt;br /&gt;

Francis Dickens later was the subject of a comic novel by humorist [[Eric Nicol]], ''Dickens of the Mounted'' (1989).  The book is a series of fictional letters, a mock document purporting to be a record of Dickens's correspondence spanning his twelve years in Canada, only "edited" by Nicol.  It is still frequently mistaken for non-fiction. &lt;br /&gt;
Frank Dickens also appears in the science fiction novel that deals with the NWMP in an alternative history, ''The Apparition Trail'' (2004) by [[Lisa Smedman]].  &lt;br /&gt;

In the novels ''The Winnipeg Wolf'' and ''The Search for Spade'' belonging to the "Inspector Bucket NWMP" series by Jeremy Allen the leading character, Francis Bucket, is based on Francis Dickens.&lt;br /&gt;
He is played by [[Joe Prospero]] in the TV mini-series ''[[Hans Christian Andersen: My Life as a Fairytale]]''. In 2007 a Fringe festival play called ''Dickens of the Mounted'' based on Nicol's novel toured several Canadian cities.

Francis Dickens is a character in [[Matthew Pearl]]'s 2009 novel, ''[[The Last Dickens]]''. Dickens also appears in Bill Gallaher's ''The Frog Lake Massacre'' (2008).

'''Frederick Steven Roach''' (born March 5, 1960) is an American [[boxing]] trainer and former professional boxer. Roach is widely regarded as one of the best boxing trainers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxinginsider.com/columns/freddie-roach-best-business/&lt;/ref&gt; He is the enduring boxing coach of the [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]], five-time and four-division world champion [[Miguel Cotto]], former [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Middleweight Champion [[Julio César Chávez Jr.]], defensive master and  three-time world champion [[James Toney]], former UFC Middleweight and eleven-time Welterweight Champion [[Georges St-Pierre]], as well as top prospects [[Jose Benavidez]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toprank.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=23700&amp;ATCLID=204912005 Profile of Roach-trained prospect Benavidez – Top Rank Boxing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717075130/http://www.toprank.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=23700&amp;ATCLID=204912005 |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Quillin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=23659&amp;more=1|title=265-001 - Boxing News 24/7|date=24 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vanes Martirosyan]]. Roach was the trainer of two-time women's world champion [[Lucia Rijker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2016/03/16/freddie-roach-career-11418/|title=A Quick Guide To The Freddie Roach Career|website=Boxing News and Views|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also trained former junior welterweight champion [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]].

==Boxing career==
Roach was trained by his father Paul Roach at a young age along with his brothers Joey and Pepper. As a teenager, he was a dominant force in the [[New England]] amateur and AAU ranks.  Roach turned pro in 1978, fighting as a [[lightweight]] and won his first 10 bouts. Roach trained under legendary trainer [[Eddie Futch]] and went 26–1 before appearing in a historic match at the [[Boston Garden]] on June 11, 1982.

The card that night was the first of two times that all three Fighting Roach Brothers appeared at the same time.

Brothers Joey and Pepper won their undercard bouts but in the main event, Freddie lost a unanimous decision to Rafael Lopez. Freddie would rebound and go on to contend twice for regional championships. 
   
Late in his career, Roach, who was known for being able to take on a barrage of punches, began showing early signs of [[Parkinson's disease]]. Futch asked Roach to retire but the boxer refused and continued to fight with his father as his trainer. He went on to lose five of his last six fights before retiring at age 26. His best payday was $7,500.

==Boxing trainer==
After his retirement from fighting, Roach worked in a variety of jobs around Las Vegas including [[telemarketing]] and a [[busboy]] before taking a job with his former trainer and mentor [[Eddie Futch]] as an unpaid assistant in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/3482/freddie-roach-takes-center-stage/ Thesweetscience.com]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918222418/http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/3482/freddie-roach-takes-center-stage/ |date=September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He excelled in his new position and worked as Futch's assistant for five years.

In 1991, actor [[Mickey Rourke]] returned to boxing midway through his acting career, and hired Roach to train him in [[Hollywood, California]]. In 1995, when Rourke decided to quit boxing, he gave gym equipment to Roach, and it can be found in the Wild Card Boxing Club on Vine Street.

Roach owns the Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles and works alongside his brother Pepper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouseboxing.com/DHB/Tyler110309.htm|title=Pepper Roach Interview on Manny Pacquiao vs Miguel Cotto, Floyd Mayweather Jr, James Toney, Oscar De La Hoya, Bernard Hopkins, Prediction and More!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the most popular trainers in boxing.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Roach's prized ward is [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]]. Roach also once trained [[Oscar De La Hoya]] for his [[De La Hoya-Mayweather|May 5, 2007 superfight]] against [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]]. His first world champion was [[Virgil Hill]], whom he took over from his own former trainer, [[Eddie Futch]]. He is also the former trainer for British boxers [[Gary Stretch]] (former WBC super welterweight Champion) Training Stretch for his WBO Middleweight Championship challenge against [[Chris Eubanks]] and [[Amir Khan (British boxer)|Amir Khan]], who became the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] Light Welterweight Champion on July 18, 2009 and the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] Light Welterweight Champion on July 23, 2011, under Roach's tutelage. Roach also trains welterweight boxer [[Zachary Wohlman|Zachary "Kid Yamaka" Wohlman]] among many others.&lt;ref name="laweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chelin |first=Pamela |url=http://www.laweekly.com/publicspectacle/2012/08/16/zachary-wohlman-aka-kid-yamaka-is-boxings-great-jewish-hope |title=Zachary Wohlman, aka 'Kid Yamaka,' Is Boxing's Great Jewish Hope |publisher=LA Weekly |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fightnetwork1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightnetwork.com/news/28609:zachary-wohlman-a-k-a-kid-yamaka/ |title=Zachary Wohlman, a.k.a.

In the world of [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA), Roach has trained former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] Heavyweight Champion [[Andrei Arlovski]] and was one of his primary trainers for Arlovski's victory over [[Ben Rothwell]] on July 19 at [[Affliction Entertainment|Affliction]]'s inaugural show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=ys-mmaweekaa071108&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns|title=Boxing's Freddie Roach working with Andrei Arlovski|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also trained MMA fighter [[Dan Hardy]] for his fight with [[Marcus Davis]] at UFC 99 as well as MMA greats, [[Tito Ortiz]], [[Anderson Silva]], and [[BJ Penn]]. In May 2010, he began a training engagement with [[Georges St-Pierre]] in advance preparation for the fighter's successful [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]] title defense against [[Josh Koscheck]] at [[UFC 124]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagepotato.com/it-begins-gsp-honing-his-knuckle-game-freddie-roach|title=It Begins: GSP Honing His Knuckle-Game With Freddie Roach - Cagepotato|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roach has also trained many other prominent mixed martial artists, such as: pro-boxer and kickboxer, and former [[List of EliteXC Champions#Lightweight Championship|EliteXC Lightweight Champion]], [[K.J.

==Parkinson's disease==
Roach suffers from [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/dec/05/boxing-khan-roach | title = Big interview: Amir Khan's trainer Freddie Roach | work = The Guardian | author = Lawrence Donegan	| date = December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=7910&amp;zoneid=3 FREDDIE ROACH PREDICTS ARLOVSKI TO KO FEDOR- MMA WEEKLY – Mixed Martial Arts &amp; UFC News, Photos, Rankings &amp; more]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As chronicled in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]'', he is able to actively control the disease through medication, injections and his training of boxers.  Roach's doctors feel that his active in-ring training routines with his fighters and tremendous [[eye-hand coordination]] that he has to exhibit have made it possible to slow the progress of the disease.

'''Gerhard "Gerd" Müller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡɛɐ̯t ˈmʏlɐ}}; born 3 November 1945) is a German retired [[association football|footballer]]. A prolific [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] renowned for his clinical finishing, especially in and around the six-yard box, he is regarded as one of the greatest goalscorers of all time.&lt;ref name="FIFA Muller"/&gt;

At international level with [[Germany national football team|West Germany]], he scored 68 goals in 62 appearances, and at club level, after 15 years with [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], he scored a record 365 goals in 427 [[Bundesliga]] games and an international record 66 goals in 74 European club games.&lt;ref name="FIFA Muller"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=174790/profile.html | title = Der Bomber wrote records for eternity | publisher = FIFA.com | accessdate = 25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Averaging more than a goal a game with West Germany, Müller is now 17th on the list of [[List of men's association football players with 50 or more international goals|all time international goalscorers]], despite playing fewer matches than every other player in the top 25. Among the top scorers, he has the third-highest goal-to-game ratio.

Nicknamed "''Bomber der Nation''" ("the nation's Bomber") or simply "''Der Bomber''",&lt;ref name="FIFA Muller"/&gt; Müller was named [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1970. After a successful season at Bayern Munich, he scored ten goals at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] for West Germany where he received the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as top goalscorer. He scored four goals in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]], including the winning goal in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|final]]. Müller held the all-time goal-scoring record in the World Cup with 14 goals for 32 years. In 1999, Müller was ranked ninth in the European player of the Century election held by the [[International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics]] (IFFHS), and he was voted 13th in the IFFHS' [[FIFA Player of the Century#Vote specialists (IFFHS)|World Player of the Century]] election.&lt;ref name="IFFHS Century Elections"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/iffhs-century.html|title=IFFHS Century Elections|publisher=RSSSF.com |accessdate= 21 June 2014 | date = 30 January 2000 | first = Karel | last = Stokkermans}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Pelé]] named Müller in the [[FIFA 100]] list of the world's greatest living players.&lt;ref name="FIFA Muller"/&gt;

==Club career==

===Bayern Munich===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F025342-0009, Bonn, Landesvertretung Bayern, Fußballmanschaft.jpg|thumb|221px|Müller autographing a football in 1967. To his right are [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Werner Olk]].]]
Born in [[Nördlingen]], Germany, Müller began his football career at his hometown club [[TSV 1861 Nördlingen]]. Müller joined [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in 1964, where he teamed up with future stars [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Sepp Maier]]. The club, which would go on to become the most successful German club in history, was then still in the Regionalliga Süd ''(Regional League South)'', which was one level below the Bundesliga at the time. After one season, Bayern Munich advanced to the Bundesliga and started a long string of successes. With his club, Müller amassed titles during the 1960s and 1970s: he won the German Championship four times, the [[DFB-Pokal]] four times, the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]] three consecutive years (the first West German team to win it; Müller scored in the 1974 final replay and the 1975 final), the [[European/South American Cup|Intercontinental Cup]] once, and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] once.

A supremely opportunistic goal-scorer, he also became German top scorer seven times and European top scorer twice. Müller scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches for Bayern Munich, almost 100 goals more than the second-most successful Bundesliga scorer, [[Klaus Fischer]]. He holds the single-season Bundesliga record with 40 goals in [[1971–72 Bundesliga|season 1971–72]], a record that is particularly impressive because unlike other top-flight national leagues, the Bundesliga only has 18 teams and therefore only 34 games per season. Müller averaged a goal per game or better in seven of his 14 seasons. He scored 68 goals in 62 German international games. He held the record for most goals scored in a calendar year, striking 85 goals in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story/_/id/1228330/hesse:-looking-for-gerd-muller-goals?cc=5901 | title = Looking for Goals | author = [[Ulrich Hesse-Lichtenberger|Uli Hesse]] | date = 17 November 2012  | publisher = [[ESPN]] | accessdate = 28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his total was surpassed 40 years later in 2012 by [[Lionel Messi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2242647/Lionel-Messis-record-breaking-2012--month-month-game-game.html | title = Month by month, goal by goal...

===Fort Lauderdale Strikers===
After his career in the  Bundesliga he went to the [[United States]], where he joined the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (1977–83)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968–1984)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL) in 1979. He played three seasons with this team, scoring 38 goals, and reaching, but losing, the league final in 1980. He was a 2nd-team NASL All Star in 1979.

==International career==
[[File:Finale wereldkampioenschap voetbal 1974 in Munchen, West Duitsland tegen Nederla, Bestanddeelnr 927-3080.jpg|thumb|221px|Müller (right) celebrating after winning the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. To his left is [[Wolfgang Overath]].]]
Müller scored 68 goals in 62 games for [[Germany national football team|West Germany]]. He was Germany's all-time leading scorer for almost 40 years until surpassed by [[Miroslav Klose]] in 2014, though Klose required more than double the number of caps to do so, scoring his 69th goal in his 132nd appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/matches/round=2000294/match=2008584/index.html | title = World Cup in sight as Germany see off Austria | website = UEFA.com | date = 6 September 2013 | access-date = 2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Müller's international career started in 1966 and ended on 7 July 1974 with victory at the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] at his [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|home stadium]] in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=790697&amp;cc=5739&amp;ver=global|title=Gerd Muller: Der Bomber|first=Mark|last=Lomas|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=13 September 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored the winning goal for the 2–1 victory over [[Johan Cruyff]]'s [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]]. His four goals in that tournament and his ten goals at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] combined made him the all-time highest [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] goalscorer at the time with 14 goals. His record stood until the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] tournament, coincidentally held in Germany, when it was broken by Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who also required more matches than Müller to achieve his tally. Müller also participated in the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championship]], becoming top scorer with four goals (including two in [[UEFA Euro 1972 Final|the final]]) and winning the Championship with the West German team.

==Life after football==
After Müller ended his career in 1982, he fell into a slump and suffered from [[alcoholism]]. However, his former companions at Bayern Munich convinced him to go through [[drug rehabilitation|alcohol rehabilitation]]. When he emerged, they gave him a job as a coach at [[FC Bayern Munich II|Bayern Munich II]]. There is also a collection of apparel released by sporting giants [[Adidas]] under the Gerd Müller name. It is part of the Adidas originals series. In July 2008, the Rieser Sportpark, in Nördlingen, where Müller had begun his career, was renamed the Gerd-Müller-Stadion in his honour.

In October 2015, it was announced that Müller is suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bayern Munich and Germany legend Gerd Muller suffering from Alzheimer's disease|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3262331/Bayern-Munich-Germany-legend-Gerd-Muller-suffering-Alzheimer-s-disease.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490|accessdate=6 October 2015|publisher=Daily Mail|date=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
In his book, ''[[Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football]]'', author [[David Winner (author)|David Winner]] writes, "Müller was short, squat, awkward-looking and not notably fast; he never fitted the conventional idea of a great footballer, but he had lethal acceleration over short distances, a remarkable aerial game, and uncanny goalscoring instincts. His short legs gave him a strangely low center of gravity, so he could turn quickly and with perfect balance in spaces and at speeds that would cause other players to fall over. He also had a knack of scoring in unlikely situations."

The impression that Gerd Müller was not very fast may stem from his short appearance. He did not run very much, but this is rather typical of people with fast-twitch muscle fibers – they rely on short bursts of speed. Speed and agility were always Gerd Müller's greatest assets – and this enabled him to reach an extreme acceleration and be first to the ball. He also regularly soared higher than much taller defenders while jumping for the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hallofchampions.com/PlayersBios.htm | title = PlayersBios | publisher = hallofchampions.com | accessdate = 2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team mate [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has emphasized Müller's unusual speed: "His pace was incredible. In training I have played against him and I never had a chance."

==Early life==

===Youth===
Prewitt grew up in the [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] area and lived there from 1963 to 1976. There he had his first exposure to [[auto racing]]; volunteering at [[Daytona International Speedway]]. He built his first computer in 1967 at 13. It performed simple math, which he disliked so much in school, and operated his phonograph.&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;[[File:01873 p w11aghvq93m1891 r01.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Cadet Captain Prewitt]] He joined the [[Civil Air Patrol]] as a cadet and earned his way to the second highest rank ([[Cadet grades and insignia of the Civil Air Patrol#Cadet Lieutenant Colonel|Cadet Lt. Colonel]]), learning leadership, search and rescue, about the military and the value of providing community service. Prewitt learned how to fly a plane, soloed at 16 and shortly thereafter earned his [[Private Pilots License]] at the youngest age allowed.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

As a [[teenager]], Prewitt learned [[sailing]], [[fishing]], [[boating]] and [[scuba diving]] and developed skills in [[mechanics]], [[engineering]], [[electronics]], [[navigation]] and [[construction]]. After school and in summers, he worked at jobs building homes and in a [[restaurant]] washing dishes and cooking. In high school, he rented out the family houseboat.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt; He was interested in painting and photography – he produced and sold a number of images.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

After graduating high school, Prewitt continued building boats, managing his business and began to focus on computer programming. Between 1972-1975 he learned various programming languages using an [[IBM 1130]]. In the early 1970s, Prewitt dreamed of designing, building and selling a generation of small business computers with a price tag much less than the going rate of $50,000. Convinced that there was a market, Prewitt unsuccessfully sought [[venture capital]] to get his plans off the ground.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt; In 1975, he built an [[Altair 8800]]. That same year, at the age of 21, Prewitt obtained his first [[Business software|business applications]] customer when he sold, designed and wrote [[computer programs]] for the [[IBM 5100]] and [[System/32]] as part of the business he had started at age 16. He joined the [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) and participated in [[autocross]] events.&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

Prewitt's father joined the [[US Air Force]] underage at 13 years old using his older brother's ID and then switched to the [[US Navy]] at 17 serving in [[World War II]] and Korea. His father left the military after 18 years (1945–62), did odd jobs and then worked as a [[mail carrier|mailman]] for the [[US Postal Service]] until his death. Prewitt's father was honored as a [[Kentucky Colonel]] by the [[Governor of Kentucky]]. His mother was a [[Registered nurse]] and lives in the Daytona Beach, Florida area.&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

Prewitt married his first wife Florine Andrews in August 1980 and divorced after 23 years in early 2004. They have two sons, Calvin and Tim. He married Corinne Brody (Loria) in October 2007. She has a son, Alex.&lt;ref name="Hal Prewitt"/&gt;

===Education===
Prewitt attended [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando#Secondary schools|All Souls Catholic School]] (1960–63) in [[Sanford, Florida]] until 3rd grade while his father served in the military. He attended Port Orange Elementary School (1963–65) from 3rd to 5th grade when his family moved to [[Allandale, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Daytona Schools"&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NJ&amp;p_theme=nj&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_field_label-0=Author&amp;p_text_label-0=godwin&amp;s_dispstring=allfields(prewitt)%20AND%20source(godwin)%20AND%20date(nj06)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=nj06&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22prewitt%22)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |publisher=[[Daytona Beach News Journal]] | date=January 29, 2006 | accessdate=February 7, 2012 | title= Microchip to motor for Prewitt | first1= Godwin | last1= Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, his family moved to [[Ormond Beach, Florida]] where he attended [[Volusia County Schools|Osceola Elementary]] (1965–66), Seabreeze Jr. High (1966–69) and then graduated from [[Seabreeze High School]] (1969–72).&lt;ref name="Daytona Schools"/&gt; At 16, he attended Burnside-Ott Aviation in [[Miami, Florida]] where he [[First solo flight|soloed]]. After high school, Prewitt attended [[Daytona Beach Community College]] (1972–76) studying business and computer science but left without earning a degree.

Prewitt started his first business when he was 16 and a junior in High School. "Ranger Systems", had four divisions: Ranger Manufacturing, Business World, Rent a Houseboat and Ranger Automotive Engineering.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

He used the manufacturing part of the business to build electronics, computers and fiberglass boats from 13' fishing runabouts to a 40' houseboat. Business World did marketing, photography, printing and advertising. Prewitt wrote brochures, shot pictures, placed ads and ran a printing press. The biggest and most profitable division was Rent a Houseboat. Prewitt took the family boat and turned it into a rental business. He sometimes used a small boat to travel to school and quickly reach the houseboat. Prewitt did everything from writing contracts to maintenance. Prewitt frequently missed classes to unstop a toilet or revive the boat engine. The automotive division focused on repairs.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

Prewitt operated Ranger Systems from 1970 to 1975 until his focus switched to [[computer programming]] and the [[History of personal computers#The beginnings of the personal computer industry|personal computer industry]].&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

In 1975, Prewitt created International Computer to continue building, selling, installing and programming computers. This was the period when he started developing storage devices which ultimately became his most successful products.[[File:N29793.jpg|thumb|right|Prewitt in 1979 with his 1941 [[Taylorcraft]]]] He had customers that were located from mid to south [[Florida]] in manufacturing, hotel, service, legal, medical, construction and agricultural industries.

In late 1979, Prewitt as sole owner created Core International from the assets of International Computer and Southeast Computer Consultants. Initially Core was created as a for-profit association of owners and operators of small IBM computers. It sold mail-order computer supplies and developed software for users of the [[IBM 5100]], [[IBM 5110|5110]] and [[IBM 5120]] systems.

Prewitt built his first [[computer storage]] product for the IBM 5100 series because the machines did not have [[hard disk drives]].&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt; Prewitt contracted with [[Control Data Corporation]] to manufacture the key component. Even though it was a niche product, the product became popular almost overnight when IBM discontinued its 5100 series and their customers turned to Core for parts and supplies. Within two years, Prewitt had sold $2.5 million worth of disk drives.

[[File:CORE1981.jpg|thumb|right|Core's 1979-85 Delray Beach, FL premises, two small homes converted to offices where Prewitt also lived.]]

Core's second hardware and major software product also catered to the IBM orphans, a device and software that allowed IBM 5110/20 users to transfer data and programs from old bulky computers into new personal computers, which in 1981 were revolutionizing the computer industry. Core's software was called PC51 and allowed any [[DOS]] personal computer to use, unmodified, any [[BASIC]] program written for the IBM 5110/20 series computer. IBM consequently approached Core to become an IBM dealer. Customers could buy an integrated [[IBM PC]], which completely replaced IBM's 5100 computers, or optionally attach their 5100 to Core's [[local area network]], connecting all machines. These were revolutionary products and Core was the only source.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

The company expanded internationally to include offices in Europe and Asia. In 1986, ''[[Inc Magazine]]'' selected Core as 21st in their annual list (Inc. 500) of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S.. By 1990, Core was well known as an industry leading developer of [[disk array]], [[computer data storage]] and [[backup]] products.&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt; COREtest became the industry standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RjsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Coretest+standard&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Coretest%20standard&amp;f=false|title=A User's View|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|accessdate=January 31, 2010|date=June 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most often quoted benchmark used to test, evaluate and compare performance of hard disk drives.&lt;ref name="Boyhood dream"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt;

Many&lt;ref name="Whiz kid"/&gt; of Prewitt's products were the first of their kind, had no direct competition and were widely regarded for their superior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hTwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22core+International%22+sherman+tank&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22core%20International%22%20sherman%20tank&amp;f=false|title=Hard Disk Drive Survives Sherman Tank Test|publisher=[[InfoWorld]]|accessdate=January 31, 2010|date=November 24, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; performance and reliability.

'''Heinrich Max Pommerenke''' (born July 6, 1937 in [[Bentwisch]] – December 27, 2008 in [[Asperg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|title=Women murderer Heinrich Pommerenke: "The beast in human form" is dead|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/kriminalitaet/frauenmoerder-heinrich-pommerenke-die-bestie-in-menschengestalt-ist-tot-1738472.html|author=Peter-Philip Schmitt|publisher=FAZ.net|date=30 December 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]]. Detained since 1959, he was the longest-serving prisoner in the Germany until at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/Pommerenke-Todesfall;art1117,2694847 Lifelong imprisonment: murderer Pommerenke dies after almost 50 years behind bars.] In: tagesspiegel.de, December 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and first offenses==
Pommerenke came from Bentwisch, [[Mecklenburg]], where his father worked at the Rostock Port. His father died during the War and his mother left her two children after the war in 1949 and moved to [[Switzerland]], and from then on Pommerenke lived with his grandparents in Mecklenburg. When he was still a student, he committed his first rape. After completing a painting apprenticeship and another rape, Pommerenke fled [[East Germany]] for [[West Berlin]] in 1953. There he was picked up by authorities, whom contacted his mother. He was then sent to live with his mother in [[Zürich]]. His sister, who had been in a children's home for three years, had already been able to move there a year before. Pommerenke found work at a fair in [[Schaffhausen]], but when he was again accused of rape, he was expelled from Switzerland and prevented from entering the country for ten years. Other offenses such as robberies and moral crimes were committed during this time in southern Germany and the [[Austria]]n city of [[Bregenz]].&lt;ref&gt;[for the full paragraphy see the ARD documentary on ''Die großen Kriminalfälle'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes and manhunt==
With a dense series of murders and attempted murders, Pommerenke struck fear and terror in the [[Black Forest]] area. He showed a certain affinity to trains, stations and railway enbankments, but without a single [[modus operandi]], his actions could not be assigned to him until his arrest. Pommerenke lived in [[Hornberg]] at the time.

According to Pommerenke's later confessions, his murderous spree was triggered when he a film screening of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] in a movie theater in [[Karlsruhe]]. After the presenation of the [[golden calf]] by slightly clothed women, he had come to the conclusion that all women are the root of evil and that it was his mission to punish them.

That same evening he committed the first murder in a park near the cinema. The body, who was raped and whose throat was slit, was that of 49-year-old Hilde Konter, found on February 26, 1959 at the motorway junction in [[Durlach]].

In March 1959, Pommerenke abused 18-year-old Karin Wälde in a wooden hut on the outskirts of Hornberg, killing the young woman with a stone and throwing her body across the river enbankment at the nearby railway embankment; her body was discovered on March 25, 1959 on the banks of the [[Gutach (Kinzig)|Gutach]].

On May 30, 1959, in [[Singen]], Pommerenke penetrated through the window of a 18-year-old store clerk in her parents' house and attempted to strangle her; however, the victim was able to free herself and call for help, whereupon Pommerenke fled. The woman was able to give the police the following day an exact description of the person, but he was not associated with the previous two murders.

On May 31, 1959, shortly before midnight at the [[Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof|main railway station]] in [[Heidelberg]], Pommerenke boarded the tourist special train D 969 to [[Finale Ligure]] on the [[Italian Riviera]]. In the train he murdered 21-year-old Dagmar Klimek with a knife stab to the chest, threw her body on the [[Rhine Valley Railway]] towards [[Basel]] just behind [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] near the [[Ebringen]] breakpoint from the train, then pressed the [[emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]], so that the train two miles further south of [[Schallstadt]] could come to a standstill. Pommerenke got out of his bed, returned to the corpse and dragged it to a nearby dirt road, where he committed sexual acts on it.&lt;ref&gt;Exact course of events taking into account the forensic examinations documented in: Death in a holiday train. The offender Heinz Pommerenke. In: Peter Hiess, Christian Lunzer: Murder Express. The biggest crime in the history of the railway. Deuticke, Vienna / Munich 2000, {{ISBN|3-216-30550-3}} , p. 99-106, here p. 99 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Dagmar Klimek was reported by her friends as missing the following day when the train reached the Swiss [[Bellinzona]]; a connection with the emergency brake at Schallstadt, in which two witnesses saw a figure climbing out of the train, was not made. On June 5, 1959, Klimek's body was found at the embankment near Ebringen; the forensic examination revealed that the cause of death was a stab wound, while the other injuries as a result from the fall from the train were non-fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Hiess / Lunzer, page 100 f. (after the original files)&lt;/ref&gt; The investigations of the Freiburg police were initially in the sand, also because the car in question, which was transferred with the help of the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police Office]] after a few days to Freiburg, had been repeatedly cleaned several times, so that no usable traces could be secured. There was no concrete evidence from the survey carried out on co-travelers at their holiday destinations in [[Italy]], which involved a lot of travel.

On June 2, before the Klimek murder became known, Pommerenke attacked a 25-year-old waitress near the [[Triberg im Schwarzwald]] train station, beating her down with an ironed wood and robbing her purse.

On June 6, while cycling around in Karlsruhe, Pommerenke injured two women severely by stabbing them in the necks.

On June 8, Pommerenke broke into the room of a 15-year-old girl through an open window and severely injured her by stabbing her in the neck, but was put to flight by her father, who had come to her aid. The police were able to secure a sole imprint of the offender at the scene.

On June 9, Pommerenke raped and strangled 16-year-old Rita Walterspacher near [[Baden-Baden]], dumping her body in a nearby wooded area where she as found the following day. Again, the investigators lacked, as in the previous murders, any leads.

On June 10, Pommerenke stole a small caliber rifle and an air-pressure pistol during a break-in in a weapons shop in Baden-Baden. With this pistol he invaded on June 18 a ticket office at Durlach station, seizing 540 [[Deutsche Mark]] and escaping unrecognized. On the same day he picked up a suit from a tailor in Hornberg, ordering it under his own name. He next left his own worn-out clothes and a package back in which was the small-caliber rifle which he wanted to use in a few days.

A footprint was secured at the scene in Durlach station, which corresponded to the track secured on June 8, and the description provided to police with the first evidence of a connection between the burglary and the murders. On June 19, a man named Schneider from Hornberg reported that he had found a small-caliber rifle and provided personal data of the perpetrator; the same day Pommerenke was recognized in Hornberg and was finally arrested on the station's forecourt.

==Confession and conviction==
In the course of the ensuing interrogations, Pommerenke admitted to a total of 65 offenses, including the four murders, seven attempted murders, two rapes and 25 attempted rapes, six robberies, ten burglaries and six thefts.

Pommerenke's trial began on October 3, 1960 before the district court of Freiburg im Breisgau. Of the offenses confessed by him, 38 were not prosecuted, since at the time he had not reached the age of 21. The appraisers Hans Ruffin and [[Christoph Staewen]] declared the defendant guilty. On October 22, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] six times and another 15 (from single sentences 165) years in prison; it was the most severe sentence of a West German court of the post-war period.

From 1960 Pommerenke was imprisoned in the Bruchsal prison; suspecion of the sentence was repeatedly denied on the grounds that he continued to be a high-security risk.

At the end of 2006, Pommerenke was transferred to [[Hohenasperg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|title=Long-time prisoner Pommerenke: Relocated to Hohenasperg|url=https://archive.is/20130212064015/http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/stn/page/detail.php/1904472|publisher=''[[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]]''|date=19 December 2008|archivedate=12 February 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the central hospital of [[Baden-Württemberg]] prison was located, where he would undergo social therapy.&lt;ref&gt;Steffen Kraft: ''[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/die-tage-und-naechte-des-insassen-p-/815650.html The days and nights of inmate P.]'' In: Der Tagesspiegel, February 27, 2007. According to a newspaper report of the ''Badische Neueste Nachrichten'' of 9 February 2008 confirmed the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Justice in Stuttgart that Pommerenke no longer in the prison in Bruchsal, but in another southern German prison, which allows him a social therapy; Details about his whereabouts were not officially made.&lt;/ref&gt; The therapy, however, was canceled after a year, since Pommerenke was moved the [[Heilbronn]] prison.

On December 27, 2008, Pommerenke died due to [[leukemia]] in Hohenasperg, at the age of 71.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|title=After 49 years of imprisonment: female murderer Pommerenke is dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231065156/http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/stn/page/1909986_0_2147_nach-49-jahren-haft-frauenmoerder-pommerenke-ist-tot.html|url=https://tools.wmflabs.org/giftbot/deref.fcgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de%2Fstn%2Fpage%2F1909986_0_2147_nach-49-jahren-haft-frauenmoerder-pommerenke-ist-tot.html|date=30 December 2008|archivedate=31 December 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body was cremated and the ashes scattered [[burial at sea|at sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[ARD-Documentation in the series Die großen Kriminalfälle of 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, until his death, Germany's longest-serving prisoner. In this regard, he has since been replaced by [[Hans-Georg Neumann]].

'''Ioan Alecu Bassarabescu''' (commonly rendered '''I. A. Bassarabescu'''; December 17, 1870 - March 27, 1952) was a Romanian comedic writer, civil servant and politician, who served one term (1926-1927) in the [[Senate of Romania]]. His work, mainly in prose form, is remembered as an accomplished and noteworthy contribution to [[Romanian literature]], capturing the dreary life of provincial clerks in the early 20th century. Not interested in producing a singular novel, like his mentor [[Gustave Flaubert]], he concentrated instead on the [[sketch story]] genre.

In his debut stage, Bassarabescu belonged to ''[[Junimea]]'', the mainly literary and politically conservative club. He was friends with [[Titu Maiorescu]], ''Junimea'' leader, and with the ''Junimist'' author [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești]] (with whom he is often compared). Married into a political family, Bassarabescu had joined the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]] by 1906, and, although still mainly active as a teacher, received high appointments in the bureaucracy.

During [[World War I]], Bassarabescu he supported the [[Central Powers]] and was even appointed [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] of [[Prahova County]] under a [[German Empire|German]]-led occupation. This put his political career on hold until 1925, when he joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]]. Moving into [[right-wing populism]] in the 1930s, Bassarabescu had stints in the [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]] and the [[National Christian Party]], and joined the official [[National Renaissance Front]] in 1939. His last years were spent in seclusion: losing his fortune to [[Bombing of Romania in World War II|Allied carpet bombing]], stripped of his [[Romanian Academy]] membership by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], he died suddenly in a road accident.

==Biography==

===Early life and debut===
Bassarabescu descended from ''[[boyar]]'' families that occupied court positions in [[Wallachia]]: his father, Alecu, was a ''[[Pitar (rank)|pitar]]''; his mother, Elisa, was the daughter of a ''[[Starosta|staroste]]'', relatives with General [[Romulus Boteanu]].&lt;ref name="gc581"&gt;Călinescu, p.581&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu had received a [[progressive education]] at the [[Saint Sava Academy]]; his colleagues there later instigated the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution in Wallachia]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.581; Eftimiu, p.462&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had settled in the [[Danube]] port of [[Giurgiu]], his own family was more closely associated with [[Bucharest]], the national capital. Noted members of this branch include Nicolae "Nae" Bassarabescu, who worked as a journalist in the [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal-radical]] press,&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.462&lt;/ref&gt; later setting up the first [[newsstand]] chain in town, and composer George Bassarabescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/58_viata-romaneasca-3-4-2009/10_cronica-literara/311_bucurestii-doctorului-vatamanu.html "Bucureștii doctorului Vătămanu"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 3-4/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the couple's seven children,&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt; Ioan Alecu was born in Giurgiu, an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] baptized into the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="luca"&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Pop-Luca, [http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/texte/nr34z7.html "Arhiva ''Revistei Române''. Fondul N. I. Herescu"], in ''Revista Română'' ([[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]]), Nr. 4/2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, the family left the city because of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] bombardments during the [[Romanian War of Independence]], settling in Bucharest.&lt;ref name="vladu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Bogdan Vladu, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/giurgiu/giurgiu-masoneria-ioan-a-bassarabescu-vicepresedintele-marelui-orient-romaniei-mihail-daia-autorul-imnului-masonic-1_527b4087c7b855ff56c83145/index.html "Giurgiu și masoneria"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' Giurgiu edition, November 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The eight-year-old Bassarabescu was first enlisted at school in Bucharest's Yellow Ward, and later in the Green Ward.&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt;

Enrolled at [[Saint Sava National College]], Bassarabescu was classmates with various intellectual luminaries and political figures of his generation, among them [[Constantin Banu]], [[Ion Livescu]] and [[Scarlat Orăscu]].&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.7, 299-300&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by their teacher, classical scholar [[Anghel Demetriescu]], they formed their own literary club, which held its meetings in the Saint Sava basement.&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.7, 300. See also Eftimiu, p.463&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they put out the makeshift literary review ''Armonia'', described by an aging Bassarabescu as [[Polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraphed]] "with the faintest and least readable violet letters to have ever been used for writing in this world."&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.299-300&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon replaced by a less makeshift periodical, the bi-monthly ''Studentul Român''. Bassarabescu published his first short stories in that paper, and then in the youth review ''Generația Viitoare'', before being hosted (with words of praise and encouragement) by the literary supplement of ''[[Românul]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.463&lt;/ref&gt;

''Studentul Român'' only put out three issues, closing down due to a "lack of funds", but not, as Bassarabescu quipped, to a "lack of scientific and literary contributions".&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.300&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the Saint Sava pupils began attending literary- and social-themed conferences at the [[Romanian Atheneum]]. It was there that Bassarabescu met the successful writer [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], who gave him some of his first literary pointers.&lt;ref name="pvh270"&gt;[[Petre Haneș]], "Fapte și comentarii. I. A. Bassarabescu despre Al. Vlahuță", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Nr. 5/1942, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Bassarabescu's pieces were hosted by ''Revista Nouă'', a literary journal managed by [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] (1893).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.581; Eftimiu, p.463&lt;/ref&gt; This was an impressive feat, to judge by Bassarabescu's own words: "imposingly grand" and "too expensive" venture, ''Revista Nouă'' had fascinated him and his Saint Sava colleagues.&lt;ref name="pvh270"/&gt; He also dabbled in [[Parody|parodic]] poetry, some of which was published by the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist]] review, ''[[Literatorul]]''.&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt;

By 1896, after such permutations, Bassarabescu was firmly affiliated with ''Junimea'', contributing to the ''Junimist'' tribune, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', and cultivating a friendship with its founder, [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"&gt;Boia (2010), p.165&lt;/ref&gt; Like his generational colleague [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești]], Bassarabescu joined in just as the ''Convorbiri Literare'', for long disregarded by Maiorescu, was entering its decline stage. As noted by literary historian [[Zigu Ornea]], the stories of Bassarabescu and Brătescu-Voinești were a rare diversion, the magazine having grown "monotonous", "suffocated by bulky specialized studies".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.113, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Bassarabescu was not dissuaded by such problems: he would contribute to the magazine throughout most of his life.&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"/&gt; He managed to impress a wide range of professionals, from the ''Junimist'' novelist [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]] (who guessed in him a future "great writer") to the independent [[Ilarie Chendi]].&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.463-464&lt;/ref&gt;

Between his move from ''Revista Nouă'' to ''Junimea'', Bassarabescu had enlisted at the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of the [[University of Bucharest]] (graduated 1897), while also working as a [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Finance Ministry]] clerk.&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt; At around that time, he had moved to [[Ploiești]] city, Prahova, where he would live for most of his life, and became a teacher of geography and French. Various sources have it that his relocation occurred in 1896&lt;ref name="vladu"/&gt; or 1897,&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"/&gt; but, according to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Bassarabescu had spent 1898 working as a substitute teacher in [[Focșani]].&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt; Around that moment, his work appeared in the review ''Noutatea'', put out in [[Iași]] by Berman Goldner-Giordano.&lt;ref name="vdpseudo"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romlit.ro/pseudonimele_lui_g._ibrileanu_colaborator_la_noutatea_iai_1897 "Pseudonimele lui G. Ibrăileanu. Colaborator la ''Noutatea'' (Iași, 1897)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and literary rise===
[[File:Casa în care a locuit scriitorul I. A. Bassarabescu, Str. Ștefan cel Mare nr. 10, Ploiești.JPG|thumb|350px|Temelie Dinescu and Bassarabescu's residence in [[Ploiești]]]]
In January 1900, with the start of a new ''Convorbiri Literare'' series, Bassarabescu was co-opted onto the journal's editorial committee, overseen by geographer [[Grigore Antipa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.119-120&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ornea, the panel membership evidenced in itself that political ''Junimism'' had mutated into eclecticism: Antipa was a [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]], and one regular member, [[Dimitrie Voinov]], a [[Socialism|socialist]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; Like other ''Convorbiri Literare'' contributors, Bassarabescu saw his work published in the more radical right-wing ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' magazine, but he did not necessarily identify with the ''Sămănătorul'' agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.601. See also Lovinescu, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to publish there by his mentor Vlahuță, who rewarded his contribution with an original canvas by painter [[Nicolae Grigorescu]].&lt;ref name="pvh270"/&gt; In 1903, he answered a similar call from Livescu, publishing in the new magazine ''Revista Teatrelor''.&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, he leaned toward the mainstream [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]], which had Maiorescu as chief doctrinaire. It is probable that Bassarabescu began frequenting the Ploiești Conservative chapter in or around 1901, making friends with political boss Temelie Dinescu, and courting his intellectual daughter, Ecaterina Dinescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Paul D. Popescu, [http://www.ziarulprahova.ro/stiri/cultura/82320/femei-prahovene-de-azi-de-ieri-si-mai-demult "Femei prahovene de azi, de ieri și mai de demult – Ecaterina Bassarabescu (I)"], in ''Ziarul Prahova'', December 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1906,&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; he registered formally with the Conservative Party.

In April 1904, Bassarabescu married Ecaterina Dinescu. The modest ceremony was compensated by a sizable dowry (including a family home on R. Stanian Street) and a honeymoon in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"&gt;{{ro icon}} Paul D. Popescu, [http://www.ziarulprahova.ro/stiri/cultura/82761/femei-prahovene-de-azi-de-ieri-si-mai-de-demult "Femei prahovene de azi, de ieri și mai de demult – Ecaterina Bassarabescu (II)"], in ''Ziarul Prahova'', December 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Temelie Dinescu died just four months after the event, leaving them ownership of another home, located on a street that was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"/&gt; Some time after, Ecaterina gave birth to a daughter, Maria-Elisabeta (whom both parents nicknamed ''Cireșica'', "Little Cherry").&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"/&gt;

The first bound collection of Bassarabescu's [[novella]]s and stories was released (as ''Nuvele'') in 1903, with [[Editura Socec]]. In 1907, [[Editura Minerva]] and ''Biblioteca pentru toți'' published two other selections, ''Vulturii'' ("The Eagles") and ''Norocul'' ("Luck").&lt;ref name="gc1007"&gt;Călinescu, p.1007&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], [[A. de Herz]], [[Emil Gârleanu]], [[George Ranetti]] and some others, he was employed by the [[National Theater Bucharest]] to work on professional translations of comedy and drama. As Livescu recounts, this was a project heralded by manager [[Pompiliu Eliade]], who had recently been "appalled" by the poor-quality translations already in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Bassarabescu was assigned to work on comedies by [[Georges Courteline]], and, Livescu argues, did an "excellent" job.&lt;ref&gt;Livescu, p.111, 144&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Socec published his adaptation of a 15th-century [[farce]], ''[[La Farce de maître Pierre Pathelin|Master Pierre Pathelin]]'' (as ''Ovidiu Șicană'').&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; His wife also wrote poetry and prose, published in reviews such as ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' or ''[[Epoca (Romania)|Epoca]]'', usually under the pen name of ''Irena Mohor''.&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"/&gt;

During those years, the Bassarabescu family played host to a long succession of writers visiting Ploiești.&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"/&gt; Bassarabescu became rather close friends with two senior figures on the cultural scene: the Ploiești literary theorist [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] and satirist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]].&lt;ref name="vef464"&gt;Eftimiu, p.464&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1908, Bassarabescu affiliated with the prototype [[Romanian Writers' Society]], and was elected a member of its steering committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Teodor Vârgolici, [http://www.romlit.ro/centenarul_societii_scriitorilor_romni "Centenarul Societății Scriitorilor Români"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 15/2008&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he had a say in the scandal during which the Society, which was Christian-only, moved to reprimand a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] writer, Eugen Porn, and was in turn accused of [[antisemitism]]. Bassarabescu took a partisan position, acknowledging that some of Porn's concerns were valid, but concluding that Porn was rather the [[Anti-Romanian discrimination|anti-Romanian]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Durnea, [http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2006/pdf/numarul5-6/p54-64.pdf "Primii pași ai Societății Scriitorilor Români (IV). 'Afacerea Porn' (continuare)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320015859/http://www.revistatransilvania.ro/arhiva/2006/pdf/numarul5-6/p54-64.pdf |date=2012-03-20 }}, in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 5-6/2006, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Freemasonry in Romania|Freemason]], he was proposed for membership in the [[Romanian Academy]] by Duiliu Zamfirescu and seconded by Maiorescu, themselves Freemasons.&lt;ref name="vladu"/&gt; He was elected a corresponding member on March 25, 1909.&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; Also in 1909, Socec published another selection of his writings, ''Noi și vechi'' ("New Ones and Old Ones").&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; Some two years later, Bassarabescu received high appointment in the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education Ministry]], as Inspector for the Arts for Minister [[Constantin C. Arion]].&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; In 1912, he was commissioned as Inspector-General for Education.&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt;

===Germanophile and Prefect===
The onset of [[World War I]] marked a turn in Bassarabescu's life. During Romania's neutrality years (1914-1916), he adapted himself to the [[Germanophile]] sentiments of his ''Junimist'' and Conservative peers. He gave lectures at the Bucharest Conservative Club, on topics such as ''[[Realpolitik]]'' and the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"/&gt; He also joined ''Junimea'' geographer [[Simion Mehedinți]] in putting out ''Dumineca Poporului'' review, but contributed his trademark satirical pieces, rather than political articles.&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"/&gt; Such works were grouped in the 1916 volume ''Nenea'' ("Old Chap"), published with [[Editura Librăriei Leon Alcaly|Alcaly]].&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt;

Eventually, [[Ferdinand I of Romania]] declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[German Empire]] and the other [[Central Powers]]. It came as a shock for the Germanophiles. Although subject to the [[Romanian Army]] draft, Bassarabescu managed to avoid being called into [[active duty]], and was instead appointed captain of a [[military reserve]] in [[Mogoșoaia]] train station.&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"/&gt; Through their personal contacts, both Mehedinți and Maiorescu tried to get Bassarabescu appointed to an even safer position, at a [[postal censorship]] bureau.&lt;ref name="lb(10)165"/&gt;

In the second half of 1916, the Central Powers broke through Romania's line of defenses, forcing the government and the Army to withdraw northeast, into [[Moldavia]]; Bucharest was abandoned. In these circumstances, Bassarabescu checked himself into a Bucharest hospital, claiming that he suffered from a "severe cold". This allowed him to stay in German-occupied territory, and, in the Romanian loyalist ranks, labeled him a probable [[deserter]].&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"&gt;Boia (2010), p.166&lt;/ref&gt; As historian [[Lucian Boia]] notes, the suspicion is still standing: an entry in Maiorescu's diary shows that Bassarabescu had left the hospital on at least one occasion during the interval of his supposed illness.&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"/&gt;

In the wake of the [[Battle of Bucharest]], Bassarabescu was held in captivity and processed by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]]. [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș]], a ''Junimist'' in the German ranks, intervened for his release, and then employed him at the Bucharest Police Prefecture — Bassarabescu served there as Divisional Chief from February to April 1917.&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"/&gt; The Germans then forced Bassarabescu back to his adoptive Ploiești and to his schoolteacher's career.&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"/&gt; According to writer [[Victor Eftimiu]], who knew and befriended Bassarabescu, this assignment suited him perfectly: "Himself a shy man [like his characters,] he was content with sticking to his provincial schoolteacher's job."&lt;ref name="vef464"/&gt;

A year later, with [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace negotiations]] under way between the Central Powers and Romania, Bassarabescu was reintegrated into the civil service by the emergency cabinet of [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], a Germanophile Conservative. On May 7, 1918,&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"/&gt; he was made [[Prefect (Romania)|Prefect]] of [[Prahova County]]. He lasted there for a full nine months, earning respect from the populace and defending its interests in disputes with the German occupiers.&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"/&gt;

The [[First Armistice at Compiègne|Armistice with Germany]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] revolutionized Romania's positioning and brought Marghiloman's administration to a standstill. On the very [[Armistice Day|day of the Armistice]], Bassarabescu handed in his resignation.&lt;ref name="lb(10)166"/&gt; The loyalist regime which took over suspended Bassarabescu from his teaching post, and subjected him to a military inquiry. He was eventually cleared, even praised for his efforts as Prefect, and allowed to resume his work in education.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2010), p.166, 359&lt;/ref&gt; He also resumed his literary activity, which resulted in the 1919 volume ''Un dor împlinit'' ("A Satisfied Longing", Steinberg Publishers), followed in 1923 by another Socec edition of ''Nuvele'' and ''Moș Stan'' ("Old Man Stan", [[Editura Cultura Națională]]).&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; In 1923, he joined the Writers' Society literary tour of [[Transylvania]], sharing the stage with [[Eugeniu Botez]], [[Al. T. Stamatiad]], [[Ion Minulescu]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Mohanu, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

===1918 downfall, 1925 return===
Throughout the war and down to Marghiloman's death, Bassarabescu held on to the presidency of a declining Prahova Conservative chapter.&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; The whole party, now redesigned into a "Conservative-Progressive" group, was becoming numerically insignificant. According to Bassarabescu's own claim, this was because, in post-war [[Greater Romania]], "mediocrity", "obscurantism" and "fishing in murky waters" had become the standard of political life. Marghiloman, he argued, was a "sailor" in an age that preferred "corsairs".&lt;ref&gt;''Lui Alexandru Marghiloman, omagiu cu prilejul unei îndoite aniversari: prietenii și admiratorii lui'', [[Editura Cultura Națională]], Bucharest, 1924, p.76-78&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1920s, Bassarabescu himself abandoned the Conservative-Progressives, and made a successful return to national politics. He joined the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] (PP) of [[Alexandru Averescu]]. In exchange, he was made Vice President of the PP section in Prahova and, following the [[Romanian general election, 1926|June 1926 election]], a [[Senate of Romania|Senator]] for that county.&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt;

In office only until the [[Romanian general election, 1927|1927 recall]],&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; he worked on the short story selections ''Un om în toată firea'' ("A Fully Grown Man"), published that year with Socec, and ''Domnu Dincă'' ("Mister Dincă"), which came out, in 1928, at Casa Școalelor.&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; Two more small volumes of his works were published in the [[Cartea Românească]] digest: ''Spre Slatina'' ("Onwards to [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]]"), then ''Pe drezină'' ("On the [[Draisine]]").&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; In 1930, the Grand Orient of Romania elected Bassarabescu one of its [[Masonic Lodge Officers]]—demoted to honorary member in 1933, and affiliated with the regional ''Libertatea'' Lodge in 1937.&lt;ref name="vladu"/&gt; There was also a proposal to make him a full member of the Romanian Academy, where, in 1928, he was giving a formal speech narrating "two epochs in Romanian literature".&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; According to his own recollections, although he passed one round of voting, he was eventually sidelined and another candidate took the seat (1931).&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt;

In 1932, the PP split between a conservative group, headed by Averescu, and a radical one, led by [[Octavian Goga]]. Bassarabescu sided with the latter, leaving the PP to join Goga's [[National Agrarian Party (Romania)|National Agrarian Party]] (PNA).&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; This was a problematic political move: the PNA was firmly planted on the antisemitic right-wing, albeit its prejudice was mild enough to even allow some Jews into party ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.102-103, 308&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, his more virulently antisemitic colleague, Brătescu-Voinești, was gathering support for purging the literary world of what he called "abject" Jewish influences.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.72-73, 78-83, 107, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Bassarabescu occasionally joined in, such as when he cosigned Brătescu's letter to novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]], an ambiguous document which implied that Sadoveanu had given in to such Jewish influences.&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, Bassarabescu followed the National Agrarians into their merger with the [[National-Christian Defense League]], and became a member of the resulting [[National Christian Party]] (PNC).&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; This was a more evidently antisemitic organization, unwelcoming of all Jewish PNA members, and publishing open statements against "the kikes".&lt;ref&gt;Boia (2012), p.70, 102-103, 178, 187, 209&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Bassarabescu himself, he was still a PNC member in May 1938, "upon the chief's [Goga's] death".&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; His literary work at the time was an [[anthology]] of Romanian literature, edited in collaboration with [[Petre Haneș]] (published 1937).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.978, 1007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, ''Convorbiri Literare'', in the process of recovering unknown writings by the late Maiorescu, also published four letters that Maiorescu had sent to Bassarabescu decades before.&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt;

===Final years===
Bassarabescu benefited from the rise of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] single-party regime during the early month of [[World War II]]. He made a publicized bid to join the [[National Renaissance Front]], and was accepted into its ranks on Christmas Day, 1939.&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; In 1940, Casa Școalelor put out his ''Opere complete'' ("Complete Works").&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; As a guest of the [[Romanian Atheneum]], Bassarabescu introduced the public to the largely forgotten work of a 19th-century female writer, [[Sofia Cocea]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1007; [[Sanda Golopenția]], "Sofia Cocea", in Katharina M. Wilson (ed.), ''An Encyclopedia of Continental Women Writers, Volume One: A-K'', [[Routledge]], London, 1991, p.259.  {{ISBN|0-8240-8547-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was by then a highly decorated member of the establishment: a recipient of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]] (commander), the [[Order of the Star of Romania]] (officer) and the [[Cultural Merit Order]] (officer).&lt;ref name="luca"/&gt; His work focused on recollections from an earlier age, such as a 1942 piece about his youthful encounters with Vlahuță, in ''Gazeta Cărților'', a literary newspaper.&lt;ref name="pvh270"/&gt; In 1943, [[Editura Cugetarea]] put on sale his definitive collection of ''Proză'' ("Prose"),&lt;ref name="gc1007"/&gt; which included some of his memoirs. As Eftimiu notes, they are self-deriding pieces, acknowledging "a mediocre destiny".&lt;ref name="vef464"/&gt;

The Bassarabescu family fortunes turned during the [[Bombing of Romania in World War II|carpet bombing campaign of 1944]]. While the Bassarabescus fled for their safety to nearby [[Slănic]], their Stanian Street lodging was destroyed; they moved to their Dinescu Street residence.&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"/&gt; Upon war's end, Bassarabescu was also targeted for political retaliation. In 1948, the new [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|stripped Bassarabescu and 112 others]] of their Academy membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Păun Otiman]], [http://www.akademos.asm.md/files/1948_anul%20imensei%20jertfe%20a%20Academiei%20romane.pdf "1948 - Anul imensei jertfe a Academiei Române"], in ''Academica'', Nr. 4 (31), December 2013, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Ecaterina Bassarabescu died, leaving Ioan Alecu to be cared for by daughter Maria-Elisabeta. The latter was a career woman, who had graduated law school and was among the first Romanian female judges.&lt;ref name="pdpecat2"/&gt; On March 27, 1952, Bassarabescu himself died, the result of a car accident in Ploiești. Although Călinescu and Eftimiu simply note this is a fact,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.581; Eftimiu, p.466&lt;/ref&gt; later sources describe the circumstances of this accident as generally suspicious.&lt;ref name="vladu"/&gt;

In death, Bassarabescu was recoverable. According to Eftimiu, communism allowed Bassarabescu's work to be published "in tens of thousands of copies", "a circulation that they have never had before."&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.466&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Giurgiu County]] library in his native city bears his name since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.bjgiurgiu.ro/istoric.htm History] at the I. A. Bassarabescu County Library site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary work==
The chief sources of inspiration behind Bassarabescu's comedic and [[Literary realism|realistic]] style were two ''Junimist'' figures: the Romanian classic [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], and his own friend, Brătescu-Voinești.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.581, 617; Eftimiu, p.462; Lovinescu, p.202; Mohanu, p.214&lt;/ref&gt; In their immediate temporal setting, Brătescu-Voinești and Bassarabescu were both influential on other noted, non-''Junimist'', authors of short prose: [[Emil Gârleanu]] and (for a while) [[Mihail Sadoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.617, 631; Eftimiu, p.462&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this generation, they also influenced the novels or novellas of [[Lucia Mantu]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.779&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Mircu|Marius "G. M. Vlădescu" Mircu]] and [[Cezar Petrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.330, 351&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye of such writers is firmly focused on a class of individuals, described for instance in Călinescu: "the isolated folk of provincial boroughs, small-time functionaries of the [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways]], minuscule bourgeois women grinding the great passions of life."&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.617&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Brătescu-Voinești, he did not depict such men and women as existential losers or "misfits", but as entirely content with their mediocrity, their "terrestrial ideal": "these people", Călinescu writes, "do not suffer, because they do not aim for, or better said they do not foresee, any existence that would be better than theirs."&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt; The [[telegraphist]] Domițian, protagonist of ''Vulturi'', identifies perfection with a hefty state pension; Mister Guță, of the eponymous story, will only accept the company of women who share his obsession for [[Nerium|oleander]] flowers.&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt;

As another distinguishing feature, Bassarabescu replaces Caragiale's sarcasm with a "lyrical", "tenderly grotesque", layer,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.581-582&lt;/ref&gt; while offering "the surprise of a humane bedding" within the provincial soul.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.351&lt;/ref&gt; His smile, Victor Eftimiu notes, was one "of compassion", his gaze "filtered by tears", like that of a Romanian [[Anton Chekhov]].&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.462, 464&lt;/ref&gt; Literary critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]] finds, in most of Bassarabescu's writings, "the same family atmosphere with its links of solidarity, with all the hardships of finding their daughters husbands, with sisters that will devour each other out of love, with brothers that will carry on their shoulders the maintenance of their entire household". This, Lovinescu believes, was the quintessential "Romanian family" of the urban milieu, with only a lack of "fantasy" and failure at pacing preventing Bassarabescu from producing the great Romanian [[urban fiction|urban novel]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; (According to Eftimiu, there is in fact an unpublished Bassarabescu novel, as well as a screenplay.)&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.462, 466&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassarabescu's most lyrical pieces may be characterologic studies of sheer timidity, or other debilitating emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.463-465; Lovinescu, p.202&lt;/ref&gt; In writing ''Un om în toată firea'', Bassarabescu shared his own experience as a schoolteacher. He found it impossible to fail a grown man trying to pass his primary school exam, even after discovering that he steals notes from his own daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiu, p.465-465&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, a luncheon among family and friends end in collective weeping: people at the table morn their very victim, a long-suffering turkey "with a memorable past".&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt; This "tenderly grotesque" particularity came through another major influence on Bassarabescu, which distinguishes him among Caragiale's followers: [[Gustave Flaubert]], whose ironic-but-sympathetic accounts of provincial life are at the source of Bassarabescu's "[[Bovarysme|Bovaryistic]] literature".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.581, 617, 618&lt;/ref&gt; Such a melange, Călinescu writes, allowed Bassarabescu to cut "his own profile, with just a minimal literary activity."&lt;ref name="gc582"&gt;Călinescu, p.582&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pe drezină'', possibly his most Bovaryistic story,&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt; the female protagonist dreams of escaping her drab marriage (to an obese [[station master]]), for just a taste of life in the capital. Her ideal of what that life is largely shaped by her one-time visit to Bucharest's [[Gara de Nord]].&lt;ref name="gc581"/&gt;

Several of Bassarabescu's [[sketch story]] works as recognized as tiny masterpieces of the "[[still-life]]" variety.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.582; Lovinescu, p.201, 202&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they suggest a deep layer of meaning just by describing the assortments of a room, or an object apart, without any actual human presence. ''Acasă'' ("Home") is a careful inventory of a room seemingly rented by a partying and womanizing officer, including the half-pleading, half-threatening, letter he receives from his desperate supplier of "colonial goods".&lt;ref name="gc582"/&gt; According to Călinescu, such works may even be paralleled to [[modern art]] in their studied depiction of "urban dreariness". For a relevant case, he cites the sketch story fragment: "At once, through the [[beer garden]] gates, a man showed up carrying with him a giant plank resting on a pole. On this plank, a poster. On the poster, in large handwriting and red paint: 'Gentlemen, today our [[buffet]] is serving you vanilla ice cream'."&lt;ref name="gc582"/&gt;

'''[[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]] [[vizier|Wazir]] Ismail Gangji''' / '''[[Vizier|Varas]] Ismail Gangji''' (1788-1883) was an [[Ismailis|Ismaili]] [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]], religious leader, Ismaili [[missionary]]  and  social worker from [[Junagadh]],&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|title=101 Ismaili Heroes: Late 19th Century to Present Age, Volume 1 by Mumtaz Ali Tajddin Sadik Ali|year=2003|pages=209–215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TlwwAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=ismail+gangji&amp;dq=ismail+gangji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ByAsUoiPI4yIrAfmyoGgDw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also noted for beautiful explanations of some often recited [[Ginans]] of Ismaili faith.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam in South Asia in Practice  edited by Barbara D. Metcalf|year=2009|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pR0LzVCpfw8C&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Ismail+Gangji&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=p8gmUuf1JYj-rAfp6YGwDw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ismail%20Gangji&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father Gangji, was a [[Hindu]], who had become follower of Ismaili faith during his lifetime and worked as an employee of ''[[wardrobe|jamdarkhana]]'' department of  [[Junagadh State]], where later Ismail Gangji was also employed.  Once the wife of the [[Nawab of Junagadh|Nawab]] lost her precious necklace, Ismail Gangji found it and returned to the Nawab. Due to his honesty, he was promoted to a very elevated post in Revenue department and afterwards, he became the head of the departments of the Treasury and Mint in 1821. The Nawab also gave him a piece of land in appreciation of his 50 years services in 1869. He was granted a land in the village of [[Anandpur, Gujarat|Anandpur]], where he built quarters for the destitute.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

He was an enlightened soul and [[Hasan Ali Shah]], the [[Aga Khan I]] had bestowed upon him title of [[vizier|Wazir]] of Kathiawar elevating him from his post of [[Vizier|Varas]] at a community meeting.&lt;ref name=a/&gt; Later, Varas Ismail Gangji was declared [[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]] after his death by the [[Aga Ali Shah]], when he visited his grave at [[Junagadh]] in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;"Private and Confidential Subjects Discussed" by Religious Study Group of Mombasa, Kenya, 1953-1959, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, he tried his best to improve the worst conditions of the Ismailis and worked hard to impart knowledge of Ismaili faith, especially in the [[Khoja]] community and served as a missionary converting thousands to his faith. [[Aga Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah|Imam Sultan Muhammad Shah, the Aga Khan III]] is also reported to have said that, "Ismail Gangji converted sixty thousand believers, and taken ten thousand with him."&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Short History of Aga Khan (Bombay, 1903, pp:263)&lt;/ref&gt; He was known as the ''Lion of [[Kathiawar]]'' in Ismaili community of Gujarat.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

Among his notable disciples and converts were Mukhi Virji Kamadia, who shared a close relationship with Wazir Ismail Gangji. Mukhji Virji's son Jamal Meghji was a brilliant orator who became a missionary, and Wazir Ismail Gangji was so impressed with his oratory that he had blessed Jamal Meghji that "Your status will be very high".&lt;ref name=c&gt;101 Ismaili Heroes:

Ismail died in 1883 after a brief illness and was survived by his sons Kassim and Itmadi Ibrahim both of whom served Junagadh State and were appointed to the post which became vacant upon death of Wazir Ismail Gangji and also served spreading Ismaili faith in Gujarat.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9198">'''James Henry Blake''' (October 7, 1808 – August 1, 1874)&lt;ref&gt;Vital Records 267:172&lt;/ref&gt; was the City Marshal of [[Boston]] from 1840–1845.&lt;ref&gt;Lane 46&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Edward Blake and Sarah (Parkman) Blake and nephew of [[John White Webster|Dr. George Parkman]].&lt;ref name="Blake 73"&gt;Blake 73&lt;/ref&gt; The Parkmans and Blakes were two prominent families of the [[Boston Brahmins]] who were well respected merchants.  Blake established himself as a merchant and real estate broker&lt;ref&gt;Boston Directory 28&lt;/ref&gt; and also served in the Massachusetts Artillery as Major of Independents Cadets beginning in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Artillery 437&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1831, while conducting business aboard the ship ''Mentos'', two pirates boarded the boat where Blake witnessed their arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Salem Gazette 04-26-1831;  Volume: IX;  Issue: 33;  Page: [3]&lt;/ref&gt;  He testified against the pirates in the first of his many court appearances.

On May 12, 1835, he married Marianne Wildes of Boston&lt;ref name="Blake 73"/&gt; and ran his brokerage on [[State Street (Boston)|State Street]]. He was appointed City Marshal of Boston on May 1, 1840 at an annual salary of $1,000.00.&lt;ref&gt;Police Museum, Lane 46&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's term as Marshal was a quiet one and most of his activities involved overseeing July 4 celebrations on the [[Boston Common|Common]],&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Atlas; Date: 07-02-1844; Volume: XIII; Issue: 2; Page: 1&lt;/ref&gt; taking a census of buildings,&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Atlas; Date: 11-11-1843; Volume: XII; Issue:114; Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; banning illegal hay scales along the wharf,&lt;ref&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 12-02-1843; Volume: XIV; Issue: 4098; Page: 3&lt;/ref&gt; and clearing the streets of snow.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 12-11-1843; Volume: XIV; Issue: 4105; Page: 3; Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 12-19-1844; Volume: XV; Issue: 4418; Page: 4
&lt;/ref&gt;  He also passed a leash law forbidding large dogs to roam the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 02-07-1844; Volume: XV; Issue: 4154; Page: 3
&lt;/ref&gt; The most violence he saw was snowball fights, against which he swiftly levied hefty fines.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 12-23-1843; Volume: XIV; Issue: 4116; Page: 3
&lt;/ref&gt;  For his due diligence, he received a salary increase of $100 in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Atlas, published as The Daily Atlas;  Date: 06-18-1844;  Volume: XII;  Issue: 300;  Page: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake was replaced as Marshal by Ira Gibbons in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;Police Museum&lt;/ref&gt;  and he returned to the more lucrative business of real estate.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Atlas, published as The Boston Daily Atlas; Date: 06-24-1845; Volume: XIII; Issue: 252; Page: 2
&lt;/ref&gt; He opened an office on State Street&lt;ref&gt;Daily Atlas, published as The Boston Daily Atlas; Date: 07-26-1845; Volume: XIV; Issue: 22; Page: 3
Daily Atlas, published as The Boston Daily Atlas; Date: 08-04-1845; Volume: XIV; Issue: 29; Page: 1
&lt;/ref&gt; and later, as his business grew, moved to Congress Street.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Atlas, published as The Boston Daily Atlas; Date: 12-14-1846; Volume: XV; Issue: 142; Page: 4
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1847, Blake, along with police officer Samuel D. Fuller, helped recover articles stolen from Ebenezer Mann, another merchant.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 04-23-1847; Volume: XVIII; Issue: 5135; Page: 2
&lt;/ref&gt;  Blake and Officer Fuller would meet again under more serious circumstances.

In May 1849, the City of Boston was growing weary of their City Marshal, [[Francis Tukey]], and 17 citizens petitioned to have Blake return to fill the post,&lt;ref&gt;Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 05-08-1849; Volume: XX; Issue: 5765; Page: 2
&lt;/ref&gt; but Tukey held on. Later that year, Tukey was in the unenviable position of coordinating the investigation into the disappearance of Blake's uncle, [[John White Webster|Dr. George Parkman]].

==The Disappearance of Dr. George Parkman==
On November 23, 1849, Blake's uncle, [[John White Webster|Dr. George Parkman]], never returned home for lunch. The Parkman family asked the doctor's business manager, Charles M. Kinglsey, to search for him, and James and his brother Edward joined the effort.  While Edward went to City Marshal Tukey&lt;ref name="Bemis 46-7"&gt;Bemis 46-7&lt;/ref&gt; to appeal for police help, James combed the streets of Boston.&lt;ref name="Bemis 167"&gt;Bemis 167&lt;/ref&gt; Tukey sent police officers to drag the river and search the areas the doctor frequented.&lt;ref name="Bemis 46-7"/&gt;  On November 25, James was standing outside the [[Harvard Medical School|Harvard Medical College]], speaking to police officer Trenholm,&lt;ref&gt;Journal 35; Globe 40&lt;/ref&gt; when he was approached by one of the professors from the College, [[John White Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Bemis 146; Stone 94;&lt;/ref&gt;[[John White Webster|John Webster]] hurriedly approached him, hand outstretched.  He was not wearing a coat, even though the weather required it, and it seemed as if he had just come from the College.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis 167; Stone 94-5&lt;/ref&gt;  James was confused as he only had a passing acquaintance with the Professor and yet here was Webster holding his hand while explaining he had a meeting with his uncle on the day he went missing.&lt;ref name="Bemis 167"/&gt;  He never suspected that he was conversing with the man who would later be hanged for Parkman's murder.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis 167; Stone 94; Journal 28; Globe 40&lt;/ref&gt;

After this strange encounter, while still searching, James met William V. Thompson, the City Clerk.&lt;ref name="Bemis 265; Journal 43"&gt;Bemis 265; Journal 43&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson told James that he had seen his uncle the afternoon of November 23, just after 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="Bemis 265; Journal 43"/&gt;  He also told him he had spoken to Dr. Webster about George Parkman and Webster told him that Parkman was angry and excited regarding Webster's failure to pay on the outstanding debt to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis 265; Journal 42-3; Globe 57&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 1849, Parkman's remains were found by the College janitor in Dr. Webster's privy. James requested his own Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles T. Jackson, be present to examine the remains.&lt;ref&gt;Bemis 73; Stone 47&lt;/ref&gt; There was little doubt they had found his uncle.

James recounted his meeting with Webster in the court trial.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 94-5; Boston Evening Transcript, published as Daily Evening Transcript; Date: 03-26-1850; Volume: XXI; Issue: 6037; Page: 1

'''Lance Peter Sijan''' (April 13, 1942 &amp;ndash; January 22, 1968) was a [[United States]] [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] [[military officer|officer]] and fighter pilot. On March 4, 1976, he [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] received the [[Medal of Honor]], the United States' highest military award, for his selflessness and courage in the face of lethal danger.&lt;ref name="mishalov.com"&gt;http://www.mishalov.com/Sijan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Lance Peter Sijan, also known by his Serbian name '''Lazar Šijan''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Лазар Шијан}}), was born to Sylvester and Jane Sijan on April 13, 1942, in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. His father, who owned a restaurant, was an [[Serbs|ethnic Serb]], his parents emigrated from [[Serbia]] during [[World War I]]; his mother was an Irish-American. Lance was the eldest of three children.&lt;ref name="mishalov.com"/&gt; Sijan graduated from [[Bay View High School]] in 1960. Immediately after his graduation he attended the [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] at the [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge]], [[Maryland]]. After completion of the program, he gained an appointment to the [[United States Air Force Academy]] at [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;"Naval Academy Preparatory School Reefpoints." MS. Naval Academy Preparatory School, Newport.&lt;/ref&gt; He played on the academy's football team for three years, but quit the team in his final year to concentrate on his studies. Graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Humanities]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;http://pow.usafalibrary.com/person.asp?id=35&lt;/ref&gt; he was awarded a [[second lieutenant]]'s commission and began [[Undergraduate Pilot Training]]. After its completion, he was assigned to the [[480th Tactical Fighter Squadron]], [[366th Fighter Wing]], stationed at [[Da Nang Air Base]], [[South Vietnam]]. He flew as a pilot and systems officer in an [[F-4 Phantom]].&lt;ref name="af.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/history/person.asp?dec%3D%26pid%3D123006524 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420172854/http://www.af.mil/history/person.asp?dec=&amp;pid=123006524 |archivedate=2009-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last mission==

On the night of November 9, 1967, for his 52nd combat mission, Sijan and pilot Lt. Col. John Armstrong were tasked with a bombing mission to Ban Laboy ford in Laos.  As they rolled in on their target to release their ordnance, their [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4C]] (AF Ser. No. 64-0751) was engulfed in a ball of fire due to the bomb fuses malfunctioning and causing a premature detonation on their release.  Sijan managed to eject from the aircraft, and although likely rendered unconscious in the ejection, his parachute landed him on a rocky limestone [[karst]] ridge adjacent to the target.

[[File:Lance Sijan.jpg|thumb|right|Sijan boarding a [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]]]]
From the night of 9/10 November to the morning of 11 November, no electronic or radio signals were heard from either Sijan or Armstrong.  However, early on the morning of 11 November, Sijan made radio contact with a [[Misty FAC]] F-100F aircraft that was flying over his crash site.  For the duration of that day, the USAF launched a massive effort to locate his position, and 'soften up' the numerous enemy air defences in his area.  At dusk, the [[search-and-rescue|SAR]] forces were finally able to position a [[CH-3|CH-3 Jolly Green Giant]] helicopter near Sijan's position.  (During this overall rescue operation, over 20 aircraft were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and many had to return to base.  One A-1H aircraft was shot down, though its pilot was soon rescued by a SAR helicopter on station.  Sijan, refusing to put other airmen in danger, insisted on trying to crawl to a jungle penetrator lowered by the helicopter, and he opposed the helicopter's Para-Jumper (PJ) coming down to find and rescue him.  Sadly, the helicopter crew could not see him in the heavy jungle, and strangely, they did not deploy the PJ to find and rescue Sijan.  After the Jolly Green hovered for 33 minutes, and upon hearing no further radio transmissions from Sijan, the on-scene SAR commander (flying in an [[A-1H]] Skyraider aircraft) suspected a trap, and thus ordered the Jolly Green and the entire SAR armada to withdraw.  Search efforts continued the very next morning, but they were called off when no further radio contact was made with Sijan.  He was then listed in a [[Missing In Action|MIA]] casualty status.

During his violent ejection and very rough parachute landing on the karst ridge, Sijan had suffered a fractured skull, a mangled right hand, and a compound fracture of the left leg. He was without food, with very little water, and no survival kit; nevertheless, he evaded enemy forces for 46 days.  During this entire period, Sijan was only able to move by sliding on his buttocks and back along the rocky limestone ridge and later along the jungle floor.  After managing to move several thousand feet, Sijan crawled onto a truck road along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, where he was finally captured by the North Vietnamese on Christmas Day, 1967.  Very emaciated and in poor health, Sijan was imprisoned in an NVA camp. Soon thereafter, he managed to incapacitate a guard and escape into the jungle, but was recaptured several hours later.

Sijan was transported to a holding compound in [[Vinh]], [[North Vietnam]], where he was placed in the care of two other recently captured [[Prisoner of War|POW]]s, Air Force Major Robert R. Craner and Air Force Captain [[Guy Gruters]]. Although in terrific pain from his severe wounds and brutal beatings and torture from his captors, Sijan had not disclosed any information other than what the [[Geneva Convention]] guidelines allowed (name, date of birth, service, rank, and service number). Suffering terribly from exhaustion, malnutrition, and disease, he was soon transported to [[Hanoi]], under the attentive care of both Craner and Gruters.  However, in his weakened state, he contracted pneumonia and died in [[Hỏa Lò Prison]] (better known as the "Hanoi Hilton") on January 22, 1968.&lt;ref name="af.mil"/&gt;

First Lieutenant Sijan was promoted posthumously to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] on June 13, 1968. His remains were repatriated on March 13, 1974, and were positively identified on April 22, 1974. He was buried with military honors in Arlington Park Cemetery in Milwaukee. His former cellmate USAF Colonel Craner recommended him for the Medal Of Honor, with supporting testimony provided by his other fellow cellmate, USAF Captain Gruters.  Sijan received the Medal Of Honor posthumously in 1976, with his parents (Sylvester and Jane Sijan) receiving it on his behalf on March 4, 1976, from President [[Gerald R. Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasdet355.com/sijan.html]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medal of Honor citation===
The [[President of the United States]] in the name of [[United States Congress|The Congress]] takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to
'''SIJAN, LANCE P.'''
Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Air Force, 4th Allied POW Wing, Pilot of an F-4C aircraft. Place and Date: North Vietnam, 9 November 1967. Entered service at: Milwaukee, Wis. Born: 13 April 1942, Milwaukee, Wis.

Citation:
While on a flight over North Vietnam, Capt. Sijan ejected from his disabled aircraft and successfully evaded capture for more than 6 weeks. During this time, he was seriously injured and suffered from shock and extreme weight loss due to lack of food. After being captured by North Vietnamese soldiers, Capt. Sijan was taken to a holding point for subsequent transfer to a prisoner of war camp. In his emaciated and crippled condition, he overpowered 1 of his guards and crawled into the jungle, only to be recaptured after several hours. He was then transferred to another prison camp where he was kept in solitary confinement and interrogated at length. During interrogation, he was severely tortured; however, he did not divulge any information to his captors. Capt. Sijan lapsed into delirium and was placed in the care of another prisoner. During his intermittent periods of consciousness until his death, he never complained of his physical condition and, on several occasions, spoke of future escape attempts. Capt. Sijan's extraordinary heroism and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty at the cost of his life are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces./S/[[Gerald Ford|GERALD R. FORD]]

==Other honors==
[[File:Lance Sijan park.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lance Sijan Memorial Site at Arlington Park Cemetery]]

Sijan's heroism and courage brought him numerous honors. The United States Air Force created the [[Lance P. Sijan Award]], recognizing individuals who have demonstrated the highest qualities of leadership in their jobs and in their lives.  It has become one of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force's]] most prestigious awards.

Because Sijan was the first graduate of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] to receive the [[Medal of Honor]], a cadet dormitory, Sijan Hall, was named after him. The dormitory was dedicated on [[Memorial Day]], 1976.

Sijan's high school in Milwaukee set up a scholarship in his honor, presented each year to the student who best exemplifies Lance Sijan's examples of leadership and courage. A nearby park, Sijan Playfield, is dedicated to him, and Milwaukee's Serbian community honors him with a memorial on the grounds of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Cathedral.

In June 2006, before the [[440th Airlift Wing]] was relocated to [[Pope Air Force Base|Pope AFB]] in [[North Carolina]], there were calls to move the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom]] jet fighter display from [[Mitchell International Airport]] to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the [[Lake Michigan]] lake front. However, the display was finally moved on February 28, 2017 to another more visible location at Mitchell International Airport. It will be re-dedicated at this location on May 26, 2017.&lt;ref name=phantomdisplaymove&gt;{{cite web|title=Hometown hero: Warplane of Vietnam War hero Lance Sijan arrives at new home|url=http://fox6now.com/2017/02/28/hometown-hero-warplane-of-vietnam-war-hero-lance-sijan-arrives-at-new-home/|publisher=WITI Milwaukee|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sijan is a member of the [[DeMolay International]] Hall of Fame.

[[Mountain Home Air Force Base|Mountain Home AFB]] in Idaho named Sijan St. in his honor. A major road at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage, Alaska, is also named for him.

'''Leona Florentino''' (born '''Leona Josefa Florentina''',&lt;ref name="baptism"/&gt; 19 April 1849 - 4 October 1884) was a Filipino poet in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]] languages.  She is considered as the "mother of Philippine women's literature" and the "bridge from oral to literary tradition".&lt;ref name=Firefly&gt;[http://www.filippiinit-seura.fi/firefly.html The History of Filipino Women's Writings], an article from Firefly - Filipino Short Stories (Tulikärpänen - filippiiniläisiä novelleja), 2001 / 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to a wealthy and prominent family in [[Vigan]], [[Ilocos Sur]], Florentino began to write her first verses in Ilocano at a young age. Despite her potential, she was not allowed to receive a university education because of her gender. Florentino was instead tutored by her mother, and then a series of private teachers. An educated Ilocano priest taught her advanced Spanish and encouraged her to develop her voice in poetry.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt;

Florentino married a politician named Elias de los Reyes at the age of 14. They had five children together. Their son [[Isabelo de los Reyes]] later became a Filipino writer, activist and senator. Due to the feminist nature of her writings, Florentino was shunned by her husband and son; she lived alone in exile and separately from her family.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt; She died at the age of 35.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt;

==Works==
Her lyrical poetry in Spanish, and especially that in Ilocano, gained attention in various international forums in [[Spain]], [[Paris]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Her literary contributions - particularly 22 preserved poems - were recognized when she was included in the ''Encyclopedia Internationale des Oeuvres des Femmes'' (International Encyclopedia of Women’s Works) in 1889.  She is believed to be the first Filipina to receive this international recognition, an homage that occurred after her death at a young age.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt;

'''Magomet Mamakaev''' (December 16, 1910 – 1973) was a [[Chechens|Chechen]] poet,  prose writer,  publicist, and literary critic.  He is one of the founders of the modern [[Chechen literature]].

==Biography==
Magomet Mamakaev was born on December 16, 1910, in the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] village [[Achhoy-Martan]] to a peasant family. At the age of ten he became an orphan. His childhood pain of loss, sorrow and pleasure are reflected in his poem «Conversation with mother» (1934). In his youth Mamakaev was a [[Komsomol]] member and studied in Moscow at [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East]]. The outlook of that period was reflected in its first literary works - «Morning over [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]]», "Swallow", "Pondar" and lyric epic poem «Bloody mountains» (1928).

On pages of magazines «Revolution and the mountaineer», «On lifting» he argued with authorities of that time concerning description of history of the [[Chechen Republic]] during the period of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] in the [[North Caucasus]]. He underlined in the articles the role of [[Russian intelligent]]sia in formation of the Chechen literature and [[Chechen art|art]], value of rapprochement of cultures of [[Russians]] and Chechens. Mamakaev's work in the [[Communist Party]], Soviet bodies of [[Checheno-Ingushetia]], in  newspapers "Groznensky worker", "the Lenin way" was connected with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He organised publishing of the Chechen language political and literary art magazines. Mamakaev was not only a popular writer, but also a recognised authority in [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]. He edited books of poetry, literary almanacs, magazines, participated in preparation of the anthology of Chechen-Ingush poetry. The writer gave a lot of attention to education of literary youth. Mamakaev role in formation of the modern Chechen literature has entered his name to the cultural history of the [[Chechen Republic]].

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:MartinLacey2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Circus advertisement featuring Martin Lacey in the 1970s.]] --&gt;

'''Martin Lacey''' (born 1947) is a circus ringmaster, company director and trainer of wild animals.  He trained most of the tigers that were used in the [[Esso]] television advertisements in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newshound.org.uk/April%202006.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/feb/07/martinwainwright | work=The Guardian | location=London | title='Nip' from tiger puts trainer in hospital | first=Martin | last=Wainwright | date=2001-02-07 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
He has been breeding and training animals including lions, tigers and elephants for over forty years.  He is a Government Registered Wild Animal Trainer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/content/articles/2007/09/18/circus_feature.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In his heyday he appeared in UK television variety shows and was known as the “King Of The Cage”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deabirkett.com/pages/journalism_film/film/the_show_must_go_on.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and "the Man Fear Forgot".&lt;ref&gt;http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://manchesterhistory.net/bellevue/circus/lion.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://manchesterhistory.net/bellevue/circus.html&amp;usg=__POJXvuahPi6QKQB8PsodfhLSQGo=&amp;h=285&amp;w=196&amp;sz=13&amp;hl=en&amp;start=77&amp;tbnid=r6gKqJY_HBAuLM:&amp;tbnh=115&amp;tbnw=79&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522martin%2Blacey%2522%26gbv%3D2%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26start%3D60&lt;/ref&gt; He provided most of the tigers used in the [[Esso]] oil television advertisements up until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keal Cotes]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, changes in public attitudes to performing animals mean that he has faced criticism in recent years.

==Companies==
He is the owner of the [[Great British Circus]] company that, unusually for the UK, organises circuses with live wild animals including tigers, camels and elephants.  He is also a director of Linctrek Ltd, a company which provides trained animals for films, television, commercials and zoos.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Protest-outiside-North-Somerset-zoo-circus-breeding-claims/article-1438604-detail/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of wild animals==
His use of wild animals has attracted considerable criticism and protests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/4511837.Animal_rights_protest_is_planned_outside_circus_ten&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.veggies.org.uk/event.php?ref=239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geocities.com/wmids_animalaction/great-british-circus.html
&lt;/ref&gt; However, he defends his company's approach as follows:  "The Circus takes veterinary advice from world-respected experts, not from campaign groups who too often seek to excite public sympathy in their quest for donations and support.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatbritishcircus.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==BBC investigation into links with Noah’s Ark Zoo Farm==
In October 2009 it was revealed by the [[BBC]] and the [[Captive Animals Protection Society]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that many of the animals at [[Noah's Ark Zoo Farm]] near Bristol, including [[tiger]]s and [[camel]]s are owned by Lacey’s [[Great British Circus]] company, and the owners had been keeping the arrangement secret from visitors and from the [[British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (BIAZA).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The zoo denied the claims, stating "We do not hold Circus Tigers here at the Zoo. Our tigers come from Linctrek Ltd., based in North West England,  and do not belong to the Great British Circus, contrary to claims made".&lt;ref&gt;

'''Michael Burnham''' is a fictional character on ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' portrayed by American actress [[Sonequa Martin-Green]].&lt;ref name="dl" /&gt; She originally appears as the First Officer of the {{USS|Shenzhou}} under Philippa Georgiou ([[Michelle Yeoh]]) until she commits mutiny and is stripped of rank. Burnham is later recruited by Gabriel Lorca ([[Jason Isaacs]]) on the {{USS|Discovery}} as a science specialist after serving only six months of her life sentence, with Lorca viewing Burnham as an asset in the war against the Klingons. She serves as the series lead. The character is introduced as an anthropologist helping the Earth-based [[Starfleet]] understand and engage with new cultures in outer space.

The character is the first black female to lead a ''Star Trek'' television series, as well as the first leading character that has never been a [[Starfleet]] captain. (However, Burnham is captain of the ISS ''Shenzhou'' in the [[mirror universe]].) [[Bryan Fuller]] conceived the character based on the cultural impact of [[Nichelle Nichols]]' portrayal of [[Uhura]], [[Mae Jemison]] and [[Ruby Bridges]]. She is also revealed as the foster sister to [[Spock]]. Burnham is an orphan after her parents are killed by Klingons, until she is taken in by [[Sarek]] ([[James Frain]]). Controversy of the character arose with the decision to connect her history to Spock's family, with debates of continuity discussed among Trekkies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16535404/star-trek-discovery-canon-continuity-spock-michael-burnham-technology-klingons |work=[[The Verge]] |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=Does continuity matter for Star Trek: Discovery? |date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also controversy in casting a black female protagonist, which spawned debate online and accusations of racism. Development of the character was largely praised by critics leading up to the debut for having a black female lead for the first time in ''Star Trek'' history and reviews of Martin-Green's performance have been positive.

==Creation and development==
In December 2016, it was announced that Martin-Green would serve as the series lead of ''Star Trek: Discovery'',&lt;ref name="announcement" /&gt; with the character initially named "Rainsford".&lt;ref name="dl" /&gt; In previous iterations of ''Star Trek'', [[Spock]] had never mentioned a sister. Executive producer [[Alex Kurtzman]] has explained that the specifics of Burnham's backstory would be revealed in a way that would not break the existing canon continuity.&lt;ref name="sdcc" /&gt; Unlike previous ''Star Trek'' leads, Burnham was not made a starship captain, "to see a character from a different perspective on the starship—one who has different dynamic relationships with a captain, with subordinates, it gave us richer context".&lt;ref name="11things" /&gt;

The character was originally to be referred to only by the name Number One, to honor [[Number One (Star Trek)|the character of that name]] portrayed by [[Majel Barrett]] in the original ''Star Trek'' pilot "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]."&lt;ref name="silence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="11things" /&gt; With changes in the pre-production storyline, the character is found guilty of mutiny and no longer a First Officer by the end of the pilot episode. Thus, the Michael Burnham name was revealed during the first episode, quickly making "Number One" her informal name, the same as [[William Riker|First Officer William Riker's]] informal name on the series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.

Series creator [[Bryan Fuller]] deliberately gave Martin-Green's character a traditionally male name, which he had done with the female leads ([[George Lass|George]], [[Wonderfalls#Jaye Tyler|Jaye]] and [[Charlotte "Chuck" Charles|Chuck]]) in three of his previous series. Martin-Green decided that the character was named after her father.&lt;ref name="father" /&gt; Executive producer [[Aaron Harberts]] spoke to ''[[TV Guide]]'' and explained the reason for calling the character a traditionally male name, explaining, "We've worked on many shows with Bryan and it's a motif. It's his signature move to name his lead women with names that would typically be associated as male."&lt;ref name="ind" /&gt; He felt the name was "cool and different"&lt;ref name="cnet" /&gt; and pitched it himself explaining, "[I was] thinking of female columnist Michael Sneed, who writes for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', and [[The Bangles]]' bassist [[Michael Steele (musician)|Michael Steele]]." He added, "And, of course, an archangel is named Michael as well, and it just had a lot of potency for us." Sonequa Martin-Green expressed enthusiasm about the name, liking the symbolism and anticipating a more gender-fluid and equal opportunity future. Of the name, she said, "I appreciated the statement it makes all on its own to have this woman with this male name, just speaking of the amelioration of how we see men and women in the future."&lt;ref name="tvg" /&gt;

[[Bryan Fuller]] had numerous inspirations for conceiving the character of Michael Burnham. He cited the cultural impact of [[Nichelle Nichols]]' portrayal of [[Uhura]] saying, "I couldn't stop thinking about how many black people were inspired by seeing Nichelle Nichols on the bridge of a ship [as Lt. Uhura in The Original Series]".&lt;ref name="bust" /&gt; Another inspiration came from the legacy of [[Ruby Bridges]], the first black child to attend an all-white elementary school in [[Louisiana]], as well as [[Mae Jemison]], the first woman of color to travel in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |number=826870849139380225 |title=VULCAN SALUTE BLACK WOMEN 🖖🏽🖖🏾🖖🏿 CREATING #StarTrekDiscovery LEAD, I WAS INSPIRED BY #RUBYBRIDGES GROWING UP TO BE @maejemison #BlackHistory |user=BryanFuller |date=2017-02-01 |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin-Green referred to her character as being "the only human to have not just attended the Vulcan Science Academy but excelled as well, [which] speaks to Burnham's intellect and just sheer level of intelligence". She referred to her character as "highly disciplined, highly principled, and the Vulcan-Human dichotomy that lives within her is emblematic of her personality. It is the two realities living within me at all times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/inside-star-trek-discovery-netflix-uk |work=Wired |first=Matt|last=Kamen |title=Inside Star Trek Discovery's mission to bring hope back to TV |date=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting==
===Auditioning process===
The casting process was difficult for producers. They searched long and hard to find an actor to pull off Burnham's divided nature between Vulcan and human. Harberts said, "We read a lot of people and they either went way too robotic and chilly or way too emotional. What's beautiful about Sonequa's performance is she's capable of playing two, three, four things at once. She's got such a great command of her craft, she's able to be aloof but warm; logical but able to surrender her emotional side to the audience."&lt;ref name="silence" /&gt; Alex Kurtzman felt the character's portrayal needed to have "remarkable duality inside her" between being "highly emotional" while also being "contained". "Unlike [[Spock]], who is half-human, half-Vulcan, she is all human, but she's been trained with the kind of Vulcan emotional-suppression ideology, and that is very challenging for her... you can see that wrestling match going on in every moment. That was the single most important thing to define the character, and I think we just had a sense that [Sonequa] intuitively understood it." He went further to express the challenges in casting an actor for the part saying, "It's a tough thing to learn with actors. You either have the ability to roll that off your tongue, or you don't. And if you don't, everything kind of trips over itself... And when [Sonequa] read, we all breathed a massive sigh of relief, because she brought an instant authenticity to it. It was very clear that the language was not going to be difficult for her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2017/09/29/star-trek-discovery-sonequa-martin-green-casting-michael-burnham/ |work=[[TVLine]] |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |title=Star Trek: Discovery EP on Casting Sonequa Martin-Green: 'We All Breathed a Massive Sigh of Relief' |date=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonequa Martin-Green first met with ''Discovery'' co-creator Bryan Fuller at [[New York Comic-Con]] in October 2016. Fuller talked to her about Burnham, a human orphan raised on planet Vulcan alongside [[Spock]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) from the original series, leading to a conflict with her two cultural identities. Knowing that her character [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha]] would be killed off ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', she shot a video audition. However, [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] refused to release her from her contract, leading [[CBS]] to look elsewhere.&lt;ref name="var" /&gt; Fuller revealed that he had long set his sights on Martin-Green to star in ''Discovery'', but CBS pushed back because AMC would not release her from her contract until Sasha's death was shown on-screen.&lt;ref name="hr" /&gt; CBS' second premiere date delay from May to September was due to the restrictions of Martin-Green's contract, though the first delay opened the door for her to land the role. She auditioned in person in December, and then began shooting in January. On getting the part, she expressed nervousness and excitement saying, "When I first got started, I had my freak-out phase. I had my almost catatonic moment where I thought, 'What is happening?' And I knew very quickly that I couldn't live there and that I couldn't create there. I owed it to the story and I owed it to the legacy to get it together. And I had to focus myself in gratitude. I had to focus myself on the passion for the vision for the story that we're doing."&lt;ref name="var" /&gt;

===Announcement===
The casting for Michael Burnham, under the pseudonym "Commander Rainsford" leaked in December 2016, with many speculating Martin-Green's previous role as [[Sasha Williams (The Walking Dead)|Sasha]] on ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-season-7-actor-sonequa-martin-green-sasha-cast-as-lead-in-star-trek-discovery-will-a7481166.html |first=Jacob |last=Stolworthy |title=The Walking Dead actor Sonequa Martin-Green cast as lead in Star Trek: Discovery |date=December 17, 2016 |work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, [[Nichelle Nichols]] tweeted "All my love @SonequaMG, I've been smiling since I heard. You're gonna knock em dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |number=810995597456994304 |title=All my love @SonequaMG, I've been smiling since I heard. You're gonna knock em dead |user=NichelleIsUhura |date=2017-12-19 |accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie Jane Anders for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' felt Martin-Green's casting fulfilled [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s ultimate vision saying, "It's all too easy to see Star Trek's humanism as merely a matter of embracing science and rejecting barbarism—but that's missing what makes Trek's version of humanism so powerful. Diversity was always a key part of Star Trek's vision of a better future for humanity. In the ideal world of the 24th century, every human being has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, either in the sciences or elsewhere; anything less doesn't represent real progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/12/star-trek-discovery-casts-black-female-lead/ |work=Wired |first=Charlie Jane |last=Anders |title=The New Star Trek realizes Gene Roddenberry's Ultimate Vision |date=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showrunner of ''The Walking Dead'' admitted it was unfortunate that the casting leak happened, spoiling events to come, but that "The folks over at Star Trek got lucky with the timing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.inquisitr.com/4147819/the-walking-dead-ep-scott-gimple-not-happy-about-major-spoiler-leak/ |work=Inquistr |first=Nick |last=Younker |title='The Walking Dead' EP Scott Gimple Not Happy About Major Spoiler Leak |date=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the importance and impact of the role, Martin-Green said, "My casting says that the sky is the limit for all of us. I think what we're seeing now in our media is this push to diminish and to devalue and to make people feel that the sky is not the limit for them, that they are meant for the ground. So having me as the first black female lead of a Star Trek just blasts that into a million pieces. I am eternally grateful that the diverse casting of our show means that we are now a part of the conversation and hopefully a part of making the world a better place, as cliché as this sounds. Because I really believe it and think its vital for us all right now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/star-trek-discovery-sonequa-martin-green-netflix-captain-michael-burnham-the-walking-dead-michelle-a7954196.html |work=The Independent |first=Gill |last=Pringle |title=How Sonequa Martin-Green became the first black female lead of Star Trek: 'My casting says the sky is the limit for all' |date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols and Martin-Green both posed together on the red carpet at the ''Star Trek: Discovery'' premiere. Martin-Green shared on Instagram that Nichols whispered, "Enjoy this time. It's yours now." Sonequa Martin-Green praised Nichols thereafter saying, "What a blessing, what a woman. I stand on your shoulders Nichelle Nichols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eonline.com/uk/news/882521/star-trek-discovery-s-sonequa-martin-green-shared-the-best-tribute-to-nichelle-nichols |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Chris |last=Harnick |title=Star Trek: Discovery's Sonequa Martin-Green Shared the Best Tribute to Nichelle Nichols |date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diversity backlash===
Following the release of the first trailer for ''Discovery'' in May 2017, some fans expressed outrage at the decision to have a black woman helm the series, in addition to the depiction of an Asian, female captain. Referred to as "white genocide in space",&lt;ref name="joest1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1664789/george-takei-responds-to-star-trek-discoverys-diversity-controversy |work=Cinema Blend |first=Mick |last=Joest |title=George Takei Responds To Star Trek: Discovery's Diversity Controversy |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision to create a diverse cast sparked debate online on the question of what had been referred to as 'forced diversity'. Media outlets, including ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]'' referred to the impact of Uhura&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-star-trek-discovery-diversity-20170623-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Travis |last=M. Andrews |title='Star Trek' fans anger at remake's diversity proves they don't understand 'Star Trek' |date=June 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the kiss between the character of Uhura and of Captain Kirk as being the first interracial kiss on American television, and its subsequent societal impact that Trek fans would be aware of, making the criticisms baffling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/for-alt-right-trolls-star-trek-discovery-is-an-unsafe-space |work=The New Yorker |first=Manu |last=Saadia |title=For Alt-Right Trolls, "Star Trek: Discovery" Is an Unsafe Space |date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Takei]], the actor who played [[Sulu]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' offered his view on the issue of cast diversity in the ''Star Trek'' franchise. He said, "You know, when you go out into space, you're going to have even greater diversity. These so-called trolls haven't seen a single episode of the new series because it hasn't been aired. And they don't know the history of 'Star Trek,' that Gene Rodenberry created this with the idea of finding strength in our diversity."&lt;ref name="joest1"/&gt;

Martin-Green spoke out on the criticism, saying she "would encourage [critics of the diverse cast] to key into the essence and spirit of ''Star Trek'' that has made it the legacy it is—and that's looking across the way to the person sitting in front of you and realizing you are the same, that they are not separate from you, and we are all one. That's something 'Star Trek' has always upheld and I completely believe that is why it's been a mainstay in society in the hearts of so many people for so many decades. [...] It's one of the foundational principles of ''Star Trek'' and I feel if you miss that then you miss the legacy itself. I'm incredibly proud to be the lead of this show and be at the forefront of an iteration of Star Trek that's from the eyes of a black woman that's never been done before, though obviously there's been other forms of diversity that have been innovated by Trek. I feel like we're taking another step forward, which I think all stories should do. We should go boldly where nobody has gone before and stay true to that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/22/star-trek-discovery-diversity/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=James |last=Hibberd |title=Star Trek: Discovery star replies to show's racist critics |date=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Background===
Burnham was born to human parents, who were killed when she was a child during a [[Klingon]] raid on a Human-[[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] research facility on Doctari Alpha, where the family lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Vulcan Hello|episodelink=The Vulcan Hello|series=[[Star Trek: Discovery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then adopted by the Vulcan ambassador [[Sarek]] ([[James Frain]]) and his human wife [[Amanda Grayson|Amanda]] ([[Mia Kirshner]]), who are also the biological parents of [[Starfleet]] officer [[Spock]], and moved to the Vulcan homeworld. She was the first human to attend both the Vulcan Learning Center and Vulcan Science Academy&lt;ref name="silence" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sdcc" /&gt; as a [[Anthropology|xenoanthropologist]]. After completing the academy she was brought by Sarek, who shared his [[Katra (Star Trek)|Katra]] with Burnham, to the USS ''Shenzhou'' to rejoin her people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Battle at the Binary Stars|episodelink=Battle at the Binary Stars|series=[[Star Trek: Discovery]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to make Burnham related to the history of original series character [[Spock]] was controversial. Beth Elderkin for ''[[io9]]'' decided that it "breaks canon" and that "It seems unlike Spock to completely ignore someone who seemed to be a major part of his life—especially one who came into his life after such tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/star-trek-discoverys-main-character-has-suddenly-becom-1797161552 |work=[[io9]] |first=Beth |last=Elderkin |title=Star Trek: Discovery's Main Character Has Suddenly Become a Major Canon Mystery |date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Laurie Ulster of ''[[TrekMovie.com]]'' felt the decision was "not that big of a deal", clashing with Elderkin's point about Spock, citing the fact that Spock never mentioned his half-brother Sybok until he showed up, or revealed his parents were Sarek and Amanda, as well as the numerous "secret siblings" placed in ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trekmovie.com/2017/07/31/editorial-spock-having-a-sister-in-star-trek-discovery-is-not-that-big-of-a-deal/ |work=TrekMovie |first=Laurie |last=Ulster |title=Editorial: Spock Having A Sister In 'Star Trek: Discovery' Is Not That Big Of A Deal |date=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Star Trek: Discovery''===
====Mutiny====
In the [[The Vulcan Hello|series premiere]] of ''Discovery'', she has already served under [[Philippa Georgiou|Captain Georgiou]] on the USS ''Shenzhou'' for seven years. The series opens with ''Shenzhou'' encountering the [[Klingons]], with Burnham committing an act of mutiny, breaking Starfleet regulation to give the order to fire first, avoiding a full-scale war, in an attempt to save her captain and ship against the Klingons. Her plan is unsuccessful and she is detained. In "[[Battle at the Binary Stars]]", Burnham escapes the brig and convinces Georgiou to take T'Kuvma hostage. However, T'Kuvma kills Georgiou. In a moment of emotional weakness, Burnham kills T'Kuvma, making him a martyr. She is convicted of mutiny, stripped of rank, and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ew.com/recap/star-trek-discovery-series-premiere/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Eric |last=Renner Brown |title=Star Trek: Discovery series premiere recap: 'The Vulcan Hello'/'Battle at the Binary Stars' |date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====USS Discovery====
In "[[Context is for Kings]]", USS ''Discovery''{{'}}s [[Gabriel Lorca|Captain Gabriel Lorca]] brings Burnham back to duty with a temporary war-time assignment as a scientist on his crew, praising her risk taking behaviour as valuable in the war. She is met with hostility among the ''Discovery'' crew, being viewed as responsible for starting the war with the Klingons. Burnham eventually befriends her roommate, Sylvia Tilly ([[Mary Wiseman (actress)|Mary Wiseman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/tv-lust/bs-fe-star-trek-discovery-recap-season-1-episode-3-story.html |work=Baltimore Sun |first=Zane |last=Moses |title='Star Trek: Discovery' recap: 'Context is for Kings'|date=October 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep4|"The Butcher's Knife Cares Not for the Lamb's Cry"]], Lorca orders Burnham and Landry ([[Rekha Sharma]]) to find a way to weaponize Ripper, a violent macroscopic [[Tardigrade]] found on the USS ''Glenn''. Burnham hypothesizes that Ripper's behavior on the ''Glenn'' was defensive in nature and that he was not inherently dangerous, since biological analysis showed him to be herbivorous. But with the Klingons attacking Corvan II, Landry was desperate for results and fired a phaser at him, causing him to maul her to death. She also overcomes her fear of opening the last will of Georgiou through Tilly's coercion. She learns Georgiou left her with a telescope, a prized possession handed down through her family for hundreds of years, noting Burnham as a curious explorer and believing she has her own command at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ew.com/recap/star-trek-discovery-season-1-episode-4/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Eric |last=Renner Brown |title=Star Trek: Discovery recap: 'The Butcher's Knife Cares Not for the Lamb's Cry'|date=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep5|"Choose Your Pain"]], Burnham voices her concerns about the spore drive jumps used on Ripper as Saru is acting captain upon Lorca's abduction by Klingons. Saru is outraged at Burnham for turning the spore-drive offline without his knowledge, and searching for compatible DNA sequences to replace Ripper. Burnham suggests a human host replacement would be possible, but Saru disregards her point, calling her a predator. Later, Burnham asks if he is afraid of her, but he tells her he is jealous because he wanted to learn everything from Georgiou and she did instead, and rather than she become captain and teach him, her actions led him to be unprepared as acting captain for today. Burnham gives Saru the telescope Georgiou gave her, feeling she doesn't deserve it. Saru lets Burnham free Ripper back into space, and Stamets becomes the host replacement needed, injecting himself with tardigrade DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2017/10/15/star-trek-discovery-recap-episode-5-choose-your-pain-harry-mudd/ |work=TVLine |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |title=Star Trek: Discovery Recap: Wrestling With Mudd Just Gets You Dirty |date=October 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep6|"Lethe"]], Sarek is almost killed and Burnham is forced to save him. She discovers he chose his biological son Spock over her, as Sarek was given only one option of which child to send to the Vulcan Expedition Group, with the Vulcans considering both children "experiments" (half-human and full human indoctrinated in Vulcan culture). The decision is ultimately pointless as Spock chose Starfleet, after Burnham was forced to go. After retrieving Sarek, Burnham attempts to get Sarek to open up to her about their encounter. Sarek pretends to be unaware, but Burnham can tell he is lying, saying he can do better. She says they will have the conversation one day, and leaves calling him "father" to spite him after he said they were technically not family because they are not related. She also develops a friendship with Ash Tyler ([[Shazad Latif]]), who helps her through Sarek attempting to push her away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/star-trek/52859/star-trek-discovery-episode-6-review-lethe |work=[[Den of Geek]]|first=James |last=Hunt|title=Star Trek: Discovery episode 6 review: Lethe|date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep7|"Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad"]], Harry Mudd ([[Rainn Wilson]]) takes over ''Discovery'' and keeps the ship in a time loop so he can complete his mission to sell the ship to the Klingons. Burnham appears uncomfortable as, during this time, a party is occurring and she struggles with her romantic feelings for Tyler. Stamets ([[Anthony Rapp]]), the only one aware of the time loop, warns Burnham while also helping her with her feelings for Tyler. Burnham and Tyler dance and kiss, before Mudd kills him. Burnham manipulates Mudd into turning back time again to save him, revealing who she is and how high a prize she is for the Klingons. She kills herself to convince Mudd to do so, although the next time around, Burnham successfully tricks Mudd and he is sent away. Burnham and Tyler are left to imagine their first kiss, which they only know of because Stamets has told them about it happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/star-trek-discovery/53005/star-trek-discovery-episode-7-review-magic-to-make-the-sanest-man-go-mad|work=

An attack is made on Kol's ship, blowing it up. Burnham notices Tyler's PTSD attack caused by seeing L'Rell ([[Mary Chieffo]]) and later learns that Tyler allowed her to sexually abuse him in order to stay alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ew.com/recap/star-trek-discovery-season-1-episode-9/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Eric |last=Renner Brown|title=Star Trek: Discovery recap: 'Into the Forest I Go' |date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mirror Universe====
In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep10|"Despite Yourself"]], the USS ''Discovery'' transports to the mirror universe. Burnham learns she earned the rank of captain on the ISS ''Shenzhou''. During her career, she won medals for Valor, for being a Master of Poisons, and for 100 kills. While in command of the ISS ''Shenzhou'', she was ordered to hunt down Gabriel Lorca, who was attempting a coup against the emperor. Her shuttlecraft was destroyed during this operation and she is presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/01/08/what-star-trek-discovery-gets-right-and-wrong-about-parallel-universes-season-1-episode-10/#489c05f63293|work=Forbes |first=Ethan |last=Siegel |title=What 'Star Trek: Discovery' Gets Right (And Wrong) About Parallel Universes: Season 1 Episode 10 |date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnham is forced to disguise as her Terran counterpart on the ISS ''Shenzhou'' in order to retrieve the data files on the ''Constitution''-class USS ''Defiant'', to uncover [[In a Mirror, Darkly|how it crossed into the mirror universe's past]]. Burnham and Lorca play the part of their Terran selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/star-trek-discovery-season-1-episode-10-despite-yourself-review-mirror-universe-parallel-lorca-a8149286.html |work=The Independent |first=Andrew |last=Lowry |title=Star Trek Discovery season 1 episode 10 'Despite Yourself' review: Darkness and light-heartedness in equal measure|date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensign Connor, who is now Captain Connor, attempts to kill Burnham in an attempt to maintain his new position, but fails. The ISS ''Shenzhou'' applaud Burnham for her killing as she takes the captain's chair. Later, Burnham appears exhausted keeping up the act, and goes to her quarters where she and Tyler, who joined Burnham as her personal bodyguard, have sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trekmovie.com/2018/01/09/review-despite-yourself-takes-star-trek-discovery-to-a-whole-new-place/ |work=[[TrekMovie.com]] |first=Anthony |last=Pascale |title=Review: "Despite Yourself" Takes 'Star Trek: Discovery' To A Whole New Place|date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep11|"The Wolf Inside"]], Burnham becomes increasingly agitated with her facade as Mirror Burnham, and questions how long you can keep a facade up until you actually become something you initially weren't. She is alarmed by Mirror Saru, who is a nameless slave in this universe, and decides to name him Saru in honor of her friend. Mirror Saru is shocked by her friendly gesture. Burnham is tasked to destroy a rebel base on the planet Harlak. Instead, she and Tyler opt to form a secret alliance with the Vulcans, Klingons, Andorians and Tellarites who oppose the Terran Empire. Voq appears, the mirror universe counterpart of the Klingon she fought at the Binary Stars, and asks Mirror [[Sarek]], known as The Prophet, to [[mind meld]] with Burnham to see if her intentions are pure. Mirror Sarek is taken aback by Burnham's memories, and concludes she is a compassionate person who means them no harm. Burnham becomes curious of Voq's ability to forge alliances with other alien races, in order to find the solution to the Klingon war in her universe. Voq's explanation triggers Ash who speaks in Klingon and attacks Voq. Burnham convinces Mirror Voq to spare Tyler's life. When Burnham and Tyler return to the ISS ''Shenzhou'', having faked the attack, she confronts Tyler. Tyler admits he doesn't think he is actually Ash Tyler. It becomes apparent Tyler is actually Voq and speaking with Mirror Voq set off his true nature, having been brought on the USS ''Discovery'' originally as a [[sleeper agent]] all along. Burnham is confused, but then realizes Tyler is the one she fought at the Binary Stars. Tyler, now mentally fully turned into Voq, attempts to kill her. Burnham is unable to defend herself, and Mirror Saru arrives and attacks Tyler, saving her. Burnham fakes Tyler's execution, actually transporting him to the ''Discovery'' ship together with the files from the {{USS|Defiant (NCC-1764)}} where he is held captive. Later, Burnham is dismayed to learn her falsities at Harlak have been uncovered by the silent emperor, who turns out to be her former captain Philippa Georgiou's mirror version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/39389-star-trek-discovery-episode-11-recap.html |work=[[Space.com]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Howell |title='Captain' Burnham Has a Really Bad Day in 'Star Trek: Discovery' Episode 11 |date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep12|"Vaulting Ambition"]], Burnham and Lorca are transported to the ISS ''Charon'', as the revelation that Georgiou is the emperor weighs down on her, making her feel the situation is a reckoning for her betrayal of her own Georgiou. Lorca refuses to bow to Georgiou, and is taken to an agony booth. Georgiou suspects Burnham of deception, and holding a knife to her neck asks why she has come here, revealing she is aware that she conspired to kill her and take her throne with Lorca. Burnham is left shocked by this revelation of her mirror counterpart's betrayal as well. When she refers to the emperor as "Philippa", she is outraged, as she would normally refer to her as "mother". Later, Burnham reveals prior to her execution that she is from another universe, using Prime Philippa's insignia as proof. Emperor Georgiou agrees to make a deal with Burnham to exchange the spore drive technology in exchange for her freedom to go home. Later, Burnham learns more about her mirror counterpart's history.&lt;ref name="ew va" /&gt; In this universe, due to Terran supremacy, rather than Sarek and Amanda raising Michael after her parents were killed, Emperor Philippa Georgiou did instead. However, Mirror Burnham's quest to hunt down Lorca appears to be a ruse, as she was conspiring against her own adoptive mother to kill her and take her throne with Lorca, who Mirror Burnham once viewed as a father figure, until she grew up and it became romantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/star-trek/54744/star-trek-discovery-episode-12-review-vaulting-ambition |work=Den of Geek |first=Kayti |last=Burt |title=Star Trek: Discovery episode 12 review: Vaulting Ambition|date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgiou tells Burnham about Lorca planning to "cross time and space itself to take what was rightfully his" and Burnham puts the pieces together, along with Georgiou's sensitivity to light (the single biological difference between the Terrans and humans), that Lorca is from the mirror universe and their crossing over was not an accident.&lt;ref name="ew va" /&gt;

In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep13|"What's Past is Prologue"]], Burnham works out a plan to deliver Georgiou to Lorca in the same way she planned. Burnham tells Lorca she will stay in exchange for ''Discovery''{{'}}s safe passage home, but it is a ruse, as Georgiou and Burnham begin attacking and killing Lorca's men. Eventually, Burnham gets the upper hand on Lorca with a phaser, telling him that they would've helped him get home, because that's who Starfleet is, and that is who she is, which is why she won't kill him. Georgiou, however, kills him instead. She then allows Burnham to go back home, with her reign as emperor gone given Lorca's rebellion, deciding to die killing Lorca's men. However, Burnham saves Georgiou at the last minute, holding onto her, as they are transported back to the ''Discovery'' and into the prime universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/star-trek-discovery/54932/star-trek-discovery-episode-13-review-whats-past-is-prologue |work=[[Den of Geek]] |first=James |last=Hunt |title=Star Trek: Discovery episode 13 review: What's Past Is Prologue|date=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ending the Federation-Klingon War====
In [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep14|"The War Without, The War Within"]], the ''Discovery'' jumps nine months ahead in 2257, with the Federation suffering significant losses in the war with the Klingons. Burnham reveals to Admiral Cornwell and Sarek about the arrival of their guest, Emperor Georgiou. Burnham asks Cornwell to give Emperor Georgiou political asylum, feeling sympathy for her, despite not being her Georgiou. Later, Tilly convinces Burnham to confront Ash, who is now fully recovered with dual memories, feeling deep remorse for Voq's actions. Sarek tells her not to regret loving someone, encouraging her further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2018/02/04/star-trek-discovery-recap-episode-14-the-war-without-the-war-within-georgiou-sarek-kronos/ |work=[[TV Line]] |first=Dave |last=Nemetz |title=Star Trek: Discovery Recap: Emperor Georgiou's New Groove|date=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnham ultimately ends their relationship. Ash begs her, saying he can't make it without her, but Burnham explains she was lost after the battle of the binary stars, and having to reclaim life is punishing and solitary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/star-trek-discovery-season-1-episode-13-the-war-without-the-war-within-georgiou-tyler-saru-a8196606.html |work=[[The Independent]] |first=Andrew |last=Lowry|title=Star Trek Discovery season 1 episode 14 'The War Without, The War Within' review and recap: One of the stranger HR decisions in TV history|date=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the season one finale, [[Star Trek: Discovery (season 1)#ep15|"Will You Take My Hand?"]], Emperor Georgiou poses as Prime Georgiou, enlisted by Starfleet to end the war however she sees fit in exchange for her freedom. Burnham, Tilly and Tyler accompany her to Qo'nos. Ultimately, Burnham is forced to stop Georgiou's genocidal attack on the Klingon home planet, outraged at Cornwell and Starfleet for enabling the act. Burnham manipulates Georgiou to give her the explosive device, by telling her if she doesn't, she will have to watch her daughter die again. Georgiou reluctantly agrees and walks off to her freedom. Burnham offers L'Rell a peace treaty, to call off the Klingons' planned invasion on Earth in exchange for the device as a measure of peace and diplomacy in order to end the war. Ash reassures a reluctant L'Rell to take charge. After the incident, Burnham's act of diplomacy in finishing the war ends with her, and many of the the ''Discovery'' crew, decorated by Starfleet with the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions. Burnham is fully reinstated as a Commander in Starfleet,  her record is expunged, she is pardoned by the Federation President, and she becomes the Chief Science Officer for the ''Discovery''. Burnham and Tyler decide to go their separate ways, Tyler planning to find a union between humans and Klingons with L'Rell, and Burnham back aboard ''Discovery''. On their course to Vulcan to pick up the new ''Discovery'' captain, they receive a transmission from Captain [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]] of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/star-trek/55277/star-trek-discovery-episode-15-review-will-you-take-my-handl |work=[[Den of Geek]] |first=James |last=Hunt|title=Star Trek: Discovery episode 15 review: Will You Take My Hand?|date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
Prior to the release of the television series, an original tie-in novel taking place in 2255, one year prior to the pilot, was announced. The novel titled ''Star Trek Discovery: Desperate Hours'' sees Burnham face the challenge needed in being a first officer upon recent promotion. The synopsis describes Burnham's journey as "To save thousands of innocent lives, Burnham must infiltrate the alien ship. But to do so she needs to face the truth of her troubled past, and seek the aid of a man she has tried to avoid her entire life—until now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nerdist.com/star-trek-discovery-comic-book-series-novel/ |work=Nerdist |first=Blair |last=Marnell |title=Star Trek: Discovery gets its first comic book series and novel|date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also works with her foster brother Spock, who visits the ''Shenzhou'' along with Captain Pike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://trekmovie.com/2017/09/25/review-desperate-hours-novel-tie-in-delivers-thrills-and-insights-into-star-trek-discovery/ |work=Trekmovie.com |first=Dénes |last=House |title=Review: 'Desperate Hours' Novel Tie-In Delivers Thrills And Insights Into 'Star Trek: Discovery' |date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writing for [[E!]] News, Chris Harnick reviewed the first two episodes of ''Discovery''—"[[The Vulcan Hello]]" and "[[Battle at the Binary Stars]]"—and considered Martin-Green's performance the strongest element of the show. He praised her acting as a human raised in a Vulcan world by saying, "[T]he emotional conflict between the two ideologies in Michael Burnham is perhaps the most interesting part of the series, and presents a fascinating window into the world of ''Star Trek: Discovery''."&lt;ref name="e!" /&gt; Writing for the episode "[[Context Is for Kings]]", Mallory Ortberg of ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' referred to Martin-Green as "the standout" who is "given a lot more to work with and is, in turn, captivating, charming (I didn't know I wanted to see her scrabbling through a series of Jefferies tubes reciting Alice in Wonderland to herself until it happened), and heartbreakingly winsome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-recap-season-1-episode-3.html |work=Vulture |first=Mallory |last=Ortberg |title=Star Trek: Discovery Recap: You Can't Sit With Us |date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaim Gartenberg for ''[[The Verge]]'' praised the uniqueness of Burnham in comparison to previous ''Trek'' protagonists saying, "[she] isn't like any protagonist we've seen in ''Star Trek'' so far, and not only because she doesn't command a starship or space station. She's a far more rounded, human character than any of the previous captains, with some serious trauma from a Klingon attack in her youth that's left her predisposed to hate the warrior race. And while ''Star Trek'' has plumbed the 'main character has demons' well in the past—most notably with [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] in ''[[Deep Space Nine]]'', and [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] in the later films, when it comes to the Borg—Burnham feels far more compelling for not being a flawless human being in other respects, as her series-protagonist predecessors were."&lt;ref name="verge" /&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'' listed Sonequa Martin-Green in the ranking of "The 25 Best TV Performances of 2017" coming at 14. The article highlighted, "Martin-Green has delivered the sort of performance that lights up every moment she's on screen. This is how stars are born."&lt;ref name="tv25" /&gt; ''CultureFly''{{'}}s David Bedwell included Burnham in their list of "11 Best TV Characters of 2017" saying, "With their first ever black female lead and a character that's hardly straight-laced, Sonequa Martin-Green gets a lot to sink her teeth into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://culturefly.co.uk/11-best-tv-characters-of-2017/ |work=CultureFly |first=David |last=Bedwell |title=11 Best TV Characters of 2017: Michael Burnham, Celeste Wright and more |date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' added Martin-Green among the list of Top Breakout TV Stars of 2017 in the role of Burnham. Joe Otterson said, "Despite a lot of negative news coming out ahead of "Discovery's" premiere (including multiple premiere date delays), Martin-Green deftly took on the challenge of leading the new installment of the iconic sci-fi franchise. Her portrayal of convicted Starfleet mutineer Michael Burnham made the new show truly binge-worthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/2017-tv-top-fresh-faces-jessica-henwick-jimmy-tatro-sean-astin-1202634290/ |work=Variety |first=Joe |last=Otterson |title=Top Breakout TV Stars of 2017 |date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin-Green was chosen as ''[[TVLine]]'' performer of the week for the episode "The Wolf Inside", as she "conveyed the resulting shock in gut-wrenching fashion, her eyes welling up with tears as Burnham was forced to point a phaser at the man she thought she loved." They went further saying, "Equally adept at big action scenes and quiet character moments, Martin-Green has been the glue holding Star Trek: Discovery together all season long—and all those weeks of repressed emotion just made this week's splendid showcase all the more impactful. Here's hoping Burnham lives long... and prospers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvline.com/2018/01/20/sonequa-martin-green-star-trek-discovery-performance-season-1/ |work=TV Line |first= |last= |title=Performer of the Week: Sonequa Martin-Green |date=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing the full season, Marissa Martinelli of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' felt that Martin-Green saved ''Discovery'' from "getting lost in a maze of plot twists [...] As a human raised by Vulcans, it would have been easy to make Burnham yet another Spock or [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], her humanity buried under layers and layers of logic. Instead, Martin-Green plays her with a fierce charisma and warmth, making Burnham not only a compass in the wilderness but a light in the darkness, too." Although the reviewer also felt Burnham's arc wrapped up "too neatly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/star-trek-discovery-season-1-reviewed.html |work=Slate |first=Marissa |last=Martinelli|title=Sonequa Martin-Green Saved Star Trek: Discovery From Getting Lost in a Maze of Plot Twists|date=February 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics had a negative reaction to Burnham's arc. Andy Vandervell for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' expressed disappointment in the conclusion of Burnham's first season arc saying, "I can see what they were trying to do with the finale in completing Michael Burnham's journey from mutineer to saviour of the Federation, both literally and figuratively, but the execution was so clumsy and anti-climactic it just undercut all the emotional weight of her story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/star-trek-discovery-episode-15-review-will-you-take-my-hand-season-2 |work=Wired |first=Andy|last=Vandervall |title=We need to talk about the season finale of Star Trek: Discovery|date=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Handlen for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented, "I can sort of see how Burnham changed (the trip to the Mirror Universe taught her the consequences of brutal thinking), but the show has done such a terrible job at establishing the character and motivations of Starfleet and the Federation that the sudden decision to commit murder on such a massive, unprecedented scale is at once shocking and utterly weightless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.avclub.com/star-trek-discovery-ends-its-first-season-with-a-promi-1822911143 |website=[[The A.V. Club]] |first=Zack |last=Handlen |title=Star Trek: Discovery ends its first season with a promise to do better|date=February 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liz Shannon Miller for ''[[IndieWire]]'' and James Luxford for ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]'' appreciated the conclusions of Burnham's arc. Miller said, "Burnham's lengthy speech to the council awarding her and her fellow crewmen with well-deserved honors had plenty of standout moments. But there's something interesting about her choice to invoke Voq's official title within the Klingon Empire, which speaks to how both civilizations are now struggling to sort out their place in the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2018/02/star-trek-discovery-review-season-finale-will-you-take-my-hand-enterprise-spoilers-1201927520 |work=IndieWire |first=Liz |last=Shannon Miller |title='Star Trek: Discovery' Finale Review: As One Chapter Ends, 'Will You Take My Hand?'

'''Walter Bryan "Mike" Hill''' (born June 2, 1958) [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[Florida House of Representatives]], representing the 1st District, which includes northern [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia County]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Hill was born at [[Scott Air Force Base]] in [[Illinois]], and attended the [[United States Air Force Academy]], from which he graduated in 1980. Following graduation, he joined the [[United States Air Force]], serving from 1980 to 1990. While serving, Hill received the [[Air Force Achievement Medal]], the [[Air Force Commendation Medal]], the [[Air Force Organizational Excellence Award]], and was named the Armament Division Company Grade Officer of the Year in 1988. He moved to [[Florida]] in 1985 and attended the [[University of West Florida]], graduating with his [[Master of Business Administration]] in 1988. He then worked as an insurance agent for [[State Farm Insurance]], while serving as a board member for [[Northwest Florida State College|Okaloosa Walton Community College]] from 1991 to 1996 and West Florida Hospital from 2003 to 2009. Hill also served as the President of the Northwest Florida [[Tea Party movement]] from 2010 to 2013.

==Florida House of Representatives==
Following the death on March 18, 2013, of Republican [[Florida House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Clay Ford]], who had represented the 2nd District since 2007, Hill ran in the [[special election]] and defeated Scott Miller, Ed Gray, Mark Taylor, Jack Nobles and David Radcliffe in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primary with 42 percent of the vote. He was endorsed in his primary campaign by the ''[[Pensacola News Journal]]'', which declared that his "military experience, passion for open government, and business experience" made him the best candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20130504/OPINION/305040005/ |title=RECOMMENDATION: Mike Hill in Dist. 2 |date=May 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |work=Pensacola News-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general election, he faced Jeremy Lau, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee and a labor union official. Lau received the support of Ed Gray, whom Hill had defeated in the primary, and attacked Hill for not living in the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnj.com/article/20130602/NEWS08/306020026/ |title=Hill vs. Lau for Florida House District 2 seat |date=June 1, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |work=Pensacola News-Journal |first=Louis |last=Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, owing to the district's strong partisan lean, Hill defeated Lau comfortably, having won 58 percent of the vote, which enabled him to become the legislature's only African-American Republican member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/mike-hill-wins-florida-hd-2-race-becoming-legislatures-only-black-republican |title=Mike Hill Wins Florida HD 2 Race, Becoming Legislature's Only Black Republican |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |work=Sunshine State News |first=Eric |last=Giunta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his campaign for re-election in 2014, Hill faced Lau once again. Hill campaigned for re-election with the full support of the [[Republican Party of Florida]], which declared, "Mike Hill knows what his constituents want. They want someone who will fight for increased spending in education, for reduced taxes, and regulations and that is what Mike Hill represents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintpetersblog.com/archives/149458 |title=With qualifying over, Jeremy Lau eyes rematch versus Mike Hill in HD 2 |date=June 21, 2014 |accessdate=December 14, 2014 |work=SaintPetersblog |first=Peter |last=Schorsch}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended up defeating Lau in a landslide once again, winning 65% of the vote to Lau's 35%.

Hill did not seek re-election to the House in 2016, instead facing [[Doug Broxson]] in the Republican primary for the District 1 seat in the [[Florida Senate]]. Hill was defeated, winning 43.5% of the vote to Broxson's 56.5%. 

In 2018, Hill successfully sought election to the Florida House once again, this time representing House District 1. Hill defeated Rebekah Bydlak and Lisa Doss in the Republican primary before defeating Democrat Vikki Garrett in the general election.

[[File:Simon Bolivar "The Liberator".jpg|thumb|right|Equestrian statue of Simón Bolívar]]
The '''military and political career of [[Simón Bolívar]]''', (July 24, 1783 &amp;ndash; December 17, 1830), which included both formal service in the armies of various revolutionary regimes and actions organized by himself or in collaboration with other exiled patriot leaders during the years from 1811 to 1830, was an important element in the success of the [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence wars in South America]]. Given the unstable political climate during these years, Bolívar and other patriot leaders, such as [[Santiago Mariño]], [[Manuel Piar]], [[José Francisco Bermúdez]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] often had to go into exile in the [[Caribbean]] or nearby areas of Spanish America that at the moment were controlled by those favoring independence, and from there, carry on the struggle. These wars resulted in the creation of several South American states out of the former [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]], the currently existing [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], and the now defunct [[Gran Colombia]].

In his twenty one-year career, Bolívar faced two main challenges. First was gaining acceptance as undisputed leader of the republican cause. Despite claiming such a role since 1813, he began to achieve this only in 1817, and consolidated his hold on power after his dramatic and unexpected victory in New Granada in 1819. His second challenge was implementing a vision of unifying the region into one large state, which he believed (and most would agree, correctly) would be the only guarantee of maintaining American independence from the Spanish in northern South America. His early experiences under the [[First Republic of Venezuela|First Venezuelan Republic]] and in [[Patria Boba|New Granada]] convinced him that divisions among republicans, augmented by federal forms of government, only allowed [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Spanish American royalists]] to eventually gain the upper hand. Once again, it was his victory in 1819 that gave him the leverage to bring about the creation of a unified state, Gran Colombia, with which to oppose the [[Monarchy|Spanish Monarchy]] on the continent.

==Historical background==
[[File:Simón Bolívar, 1804.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Miniature portrait of Bolívar at about age 21 made in Paris, circa 1804.]]
{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}
The idea of independence for Spanish America had existed for several years among a minority of the residents of northern South America. In 1797 the Venezuelans [[Manuel Gual]] and [[José María España]], inspired by exiled Spaniard Juan Bautista Picornell, unsuccessfully attempted to  establish a [[republic]] in [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Venezuela]] with greater social equality for Venezuelans of all racial and social backgrounds. Nine years later, in 1806 long-time Venezuelan [[expatriate]] [[Francisco de Miranda]] led a small group of mostly British and American foreign volunteers in an attempt to take over Venezuela and set up an independent republic. Like Gual and España's conspiracy, Miranda's [[Coup d'état|putsch]] failed to attract Venezuelans of any social and economic class, in fact local Venezuelans organized the resistance to Miranda's invasion and quickly dispersed it. The lack of interest on the part of the Venezuelan [[Criollo people|Criollos]] is often explained by their fear that the loss of the removal of Spanish control might bring about a revolution that would destroy their own power in Venezuela. Nevertheless, in the decades leading up to 1806, Criollos had often been at odds with the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]]: they wanted an expansion of the [[free trade]] that was benefiting their plantation economy and objected to the Crown's new policy of granting social privileges that had been traditionally been reserved for whites (''españoles'') to [[Mulatto|Pardos]] through the purchase of certificates of whiteness (''gracias al sacar''). So the Criollos' failure to support Gual, España and Miranda, which would have created a state under their control, needs to also be understood by the fact that a national identity separate from the Spanish had not yet emerged among them.

In neighboring [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] tensions also existed with the Crown but had not evolved into an outright desire for separation. In 1779 the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] pitted middle-class and rural residents against the royal authorities over the issue of new taxes instituted as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. Although the revolt was stopped and the leaders punished or executed, the uprising did manage to slow down the economic reforms that the Crown had planned for New Granada. In the subsequent decades, a few New Granadans, like [[Antonio Nariño]], became intrigued by the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and attempted to promote its values by disseminating translated documents like the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''. Again, this was a minority and not necessarily a sign that the majority in New Granada did not see themselves as members of the Spanish Monarchy.

The break with the Crown came in 1808 with the disappearance of a stable government in Spain. The crisis was precipitated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] removal of Bourbon Dynasty from the throne of Spain (he convinced [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to abdicate, and his father [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] to renounce any claim to returning to the throne he had abdicated only months earlier) and his [[Peninsular War|invasion of Spain]]. As the entire [[Spanish Empire|Spanish world]] rejected the new Bonaparte Dynasty (Napoleon gave the crown of Spain to his brother, the [[Joseph Bonaparte|King of Naples and Sicily]]), Spain itself fell into chaos and it took almost a year for a coordinated, centralized [[provisional government]] (the  [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies]]) to form. Even then, the rapid and large French advances in the Peninsula seemed to make the idea of a stable government in Spain pointless. By 1810, the Supreme Junta was cornered in the island city of Cadiz during the two-year [[Siege of Cádiz]]. Throughout Spanish America, people felt it was time to take the government into their own hands, if a Spanish world, independent of the French, were to continue to exist at all, and therefore in 1810 juntas were set up throughout the Americas, including in Caracas and [[Patria Boba|Bogotá]],  just as they had been in Spain two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Bolívar: A Life'', 44-48; Madariaga, 108-116; and Masur (1969), 62-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service under the First Republic (1810-1812)==
{{Main|First Republic of Venezuela}}

In 1809 a twenty-six-year-old Bolívar had retreated to his estate in the [[Aragua|Valleys of Aragua]], refusing to openly participate in calls for the establishment of a Venezuelan junta, because the plans did not consider the option of independence. He was still in his country estates when a junta was successfully established on April 19, 1810. The new Junta of Caracas chose him to be part of a delegation to the United Kingdom to seek British aid. The delegation did not have much success, but Bolívar did return in December 1810 with [[Francisco de Miranda]], who saw an opportunity in the political turmoil to return to Venezuela.

===Independence declared===
[[Civil war]] broke out between the provinces of Venezuela that recognized the Caracas Junta and those that still recognized the Regency in Spain that had replaced the Supreme Central Junta. The situation became more tense when a congress, called by the Caracas Junta, [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] on July 5, 1811, sparking rebellions in favor of the Regency and [[Cádiz Cortes]] in [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]]. Bolívar's first military service was as an officer under Miranda's command in the units created to put down this revolt. Bolívar was promoted to [[colonel]] and made [[commandant]] of [[Puerto Cabello]] the following year. At the same time that Frigate Captain [[Juan Domingo de Monteverde|Domingo de Monteverde]] was making fast and vast advances into republican territory from the west (his forces had entered Valencia on May 3, 1812), Bolívar lost control of [[San Felipe Castle]] along with its ammunition stores on June 30, when the royalist prisoners held there managed to take it over and attack the small number of  troops in the city. Deciding that the situation was lost, Bolívar effectively abandoned his post and retreated to his estate farm in [[San Mateo, Aragua|San Mateo]]. Miranda also saw the republican cause as lost and authorized a capitulation with Monteverde on July 25.&lt;ref&gt;Masur (1969), 98-102; and Lynch, ''Bolívar: A Life'', 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The royalist restoration===
The terms of the [[Capitulation (surrender)|Capitulation]] of San Mateo, which Monteverde approved but which Miranda never came to sign, granted amnesty and the right to emigrate from Venezuela to all republicans, if they chose to do so. Nevertheless, there was great confusion among the republicans as to what the treaty actually contained or if Monteverde would keep his word. It was in this uncertain environment that Miranda chose to abandon the country before Monteverde occupied Caracas. In the early morning of August 1, Miranda was sleeping in the house of the commandant of [[La Guaira]], Colonel Manuel María Casas, when he was awakened by Casas, Bolívar, Miguel Peña and four other soldiers, who promptly arrested Miranda for [[treason]] to the Republic and turned him over to Monteverde. For his apparent services to the royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bolívar a passport, and Bolívar left for [[Curaçao]] on August 27.

==Exile and the Second Republic (1812-1814)==
{{Main|Patria Boba|Second Republic of Venezuela}}

In Curaçao Bolívar learned that Monteverde had broken the promises given in the Capitulation of San Mateo. Many of the republicans who had stayed behind were arrested and the property of many republicans, both in Venezuela and in exile, were [[Confiscation|confiscated]] to make up for the large deficits the government faced. Bolívar decided to rejoin the patriot cause and made his way to [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], which had established itself as an independent republic on November 11, 1811 (in reaction as much to events in Spain as to attempts by the junta in Bogotá to control it) and joined a few days later in a confederation with four other provinces, the [[United Provinces of New Granada]]. In the weeks before arriving in Cartagena in October 1812, Bolívar began to analyze the collapse of the Venezuelan republic and published his thoughts in December in his [[Cartagena Manifesto]]. In the document Bolívar blamed the failure on the federal nature of the Venezuelan republic, which had allowed provinces to ignore the needs of other provinces threatened by Monteverde's advance, and the intransigence of the Venezuelan population to the republican cause, among other things. He saw the Venezuelan case as a warning to the divided New Granada and urged it to retake Caracas from the royalists. He enlisted as an officer in the army of the New Granadan Union and led forces in the [[Magdalena Campaign]] against cities in the lower [[Magdalena River]] that had refused to accept Cartagena's authority or that of the Union, and then attacked [[Ocaña, Norte de Santander|Ocaña]]. His success in these operations convinced the congress of the Union to authorize his plans to invade Venezuela in May 1813, and thus began his [[Admirable Campaign]].

His reentry into Venezuela marked a new, more violent phase of the wars of independence. Monteverde's troops had already carried out [[Laws of war|atrocities]]: he had allowed his soldiers to loot many of the cities he occupied and several of his commanders became notorious for torturing and killing civilians suspected of collaborating with the Republic. Bolívar also faced the fact that by 1813 much of the older aristocrats, who had led the republic, had abandoned the cause of independence, and the general population had turned against republicanism even before its collapse. In order to drive a wedge between Venezuelans and [[Peninsulares]], Bolívar's instituted a policy of [[no quarter]] in his [[Decree of War to the Death]], in which he promised to kill any Peninsular who did not actively support his efforts to restore independence and to spare any [[Criollo people|American]] even if they actively collaborated with Monteverde or the royalists.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Bolívar: A Life'', 70-75; and Masur (1969), 122-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Republic restored and lost===
[[File:Simón Bolívar, 1816.jpg|thumb|300 px|left|Portrait of Bolívar made in Haiti in 1816.]]
Bolívar's push towards Caracas was aided by the fact that the general population, which had welcomed Monteverde a year earlier, had become disillusioned by his failure to implement the terms of the San Mateo Capitulation or the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], which the capitulation promised. Monteverde also faced attacks on two fronts, since [[Santiago Mariño]] had already opened a front on the east in January 1813. Bolívar's forces easily defeated the overtaxed and underpaid royalist army in a series of battles, entered [[Caracas]] on August 6, 1813, and laid siege to Monteverde, who had retreated to Puerto Cabello. In Caracas Bolívar announced the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic, but placed himself at the head of a [[Military junta|military government]], since the situation did not allow for the restoration of the old authorities or new elections. Bolívar would base his subsequent and enduring claim to be the sole head of the Venezuelan republic and [[commander-in-chief]] of its forces on this accomplishment, although even at this time he was not universally acknowledged as head of the state or the republican forces. Mariño, based in [[Cumaná]], did not recognize Bolívar's claim, but did collaborate with him militarily. Reprisals were carried out against [[Peninsulares|Peninsular]] royalists that were captured. It was in during this period that the republican city fathers of Caracas, following the example of [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], granted Bolívar the title of [[Title of honor|Liberator]] and office of [[captain general]] in the [[Iglesia de San Francisco (Caracas)|Church of San Francisco]] (the more appropriate site, the [[Caracas Cathedral|Cathedral of Caracas]], was still damaged from the [[1812 Caracas earthquake|1812 earthquake]]).

Bolívar and Mariño's success, like Monteverde's a year earlier, was short-lived. The new Republic failed to convince the common people that it was not a tool of the urban elite. Lower-class people, especially the southern, rural ''[[llanero]]s'' (cowboys), flocked to the royalist cause. ''Llaneros'' played a key military role in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bolívar out of his home country once more. By 1814, the regular royalist army headed by Governor and Captain General [[Juan Manuel Cajigal]] was overshadowed by a large, irregular force of ''llaneros'' recruited and led by [[José Tomás Boves]]. With the royalist irregulars displaying the same passion and violence that Bolívar had demonstrated in his "war to the death" decree, the republicans suffered their first major setback at the Battle of [[La Puerta]] on June 15, 1814, and Boves took Caracas on July 16. The republicans and Criollo royalists in Caracas, who also feared Boves's ''llanero'' hoards, had to flee en masse to Mariño's strongholds in the east. The combined forces of Mariño's and Bolívar were defeated again at [[Aragua de Barcelona]] on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 royalist casualties of the 10,000 troops they fielded, most of the 3,000 combatants in the republican army, in addition to many civilian casualties. Due to their series of repeated reverses both Bolívar and Mariño were arrested and removed from power by [[José Félix Ribas]] and [[Manuel Piar]], each representing the two republican [[Command (military formation)|commands]] then in place in Venezuela. A few days later Ribas and Piar decided not to try them and instead released them into exile. On September 8, Bolívar and Mariño set sail for Cartagena de Indias, leaving Piar and Ribas to lead the increasingly encircled republicans.

===Royalist control consolidated===
{{Main|Spanish reconquest of New Granada}}
Earlier in March 1814, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] had returned to the throne. The [[War of the Sixth Coalition|Sixth Coalition]]'s advances made it impossible for Napoleon to continue holding Ferdinand or fighting in Spain. Once in Spain, however, Ferdinand was not pleased by the revolution in government that had been undertaken in his name, and by May he had abolished the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and began persecuting and arresting the liberals responsible for its creation. To deal with the Americas, Ferdinand organized the largest expeditionary force that Spain ever sent to the Americas up to that time. Colonel [[Pablo Morillo]], a veteran of the Spanish struggle against the French was chosen as its commander. The expeditionary force was made up of approximately 10,000 men and nearly sixty ships. Originally, they were to head for [[Montevideo]] in the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], another region that had fallen out of royalist control, but soon it was decided to send these forces to the Venezuela and New Granada, where the war had become exceedingly savage. Realizing that this change in plans would not go over well with the soldiers, the news was kept from them until they were at sea. When the expeditionary force arrived in Venezuela, it found that most of it had been restored to royalist control, save for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]], which surrendered to it with no blood shed. With Venezuela pacified, plans were quickly made to subdue neighboring New Granada, and the bulk of the troops moved to the coastal city of [[Santa Marta]], which had remained in royalist hands since 1810.

==Second exile in New Granada and the Caribbean (1814-1816)==
Like many other Venezuelan republicans who fled to New Granada after the second wave of royalist victories, Bolívar once again entered into the service of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|United Provinces]] and fought against cities that had refused to acknowledge its authority. His forces took Bogotá on December 12, 1814, after an eight-month-long war, and was promoted to captain general for his efforts. He was then given the task of capturing the royalist stronghold, Santa Marta, but Cartagena, the obvious base from which to launch this offensive, refused to give him the necessary soldiers and supplies, so infighting broke out. As Santa Martan forces gained ground against the divided republicans in northern New Granada, Bolívar left for [[Jamaica]] on May 8, 1815. Cartagena would fall to Morillo in December 1815 and Bogotá in May of the following year.

===Aid from the Haitian Republic and Curaçao===
[[File:Soublette, Briceño Méndez, Zea, Mac Gregor and Brión.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|Soublette, Pedro Briceño Méndez, [[Francisco Antonio Zea]], [[Gregor MacGregor]] and Brión in Ocumare. 19th century illustration by Carmelo Fernández.]]
Now thirty-two years of age, he found himself in exile for the second time. In Jamaica, Bolívar once again issued a manifesto explaining his view of the failure of the republican cause in Venezuela. His famous [[Carta de Jamaica|Letter from Jamaica]], though ostensibly written to one man, was an appeal to Great Britain specifically and the European powers in general to aid the cause of Spanish American independence, but it found no significant response. So he turned to the small and isolated republic of [[Haiti]], that had freed itself from French rule, but being composed of mostly former slaves, received little aid from either the United States or Europe. Bolívar and other Venezuelan and New Granadan exiles were warmly received by the Haitian president [[Alexandre Pétion]]. The growing exile community would receive money, volunteers and weapons from the Haitian president enabling them to resume plans to continue the struggle for independence. There was debate, however, over who should be in charge, but his ability to win over Pétion and a Curaçaoan sea merchant, [[Luis Brión]] (he is traditionally referred to by the Spanish form of his name), who had just acquired a much-needed warship in England to aid the embattled Cartagenan Republic, forced the other Venezuelan leaders to grudgingly accept his leadership. Pétion, for his part, convinced Bolívar to expand the fight for independence to include the liberation of slaves.

The émigrés successfully captured a [[beachhead]] at  Los Cayos on March 31, 1816. Bolívar proclaimed the restoration of the Venezuelan Republic and in two [[decree]]s of June 2 and July 16 declared the freedom of slaves conditional on their joining the republican forces. Shortly thereafter, Margarita Island, safely separated by water from Morillo's forces, rejoined the republican cause and became a second base of operations. Operating under the command of [[Santiago Mariño|Mariño]], [[Manuel Piar|Piar]] and [[Carlos Soublette]] the republican expeditionaries captured more coastal towns. On July 14 Bolívar led an assault against [[Ocumare de la Costa de Oro Municipality|Ocumare de la Costa]], which ended in a debacle in which Bolívar abandoned Mariño, Piar and the rest of his forces, and fled by sea. Piar's forces managed to fight their way from the Caribbean coast to the southern [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]], where the vast and underpopulated terrain and the forces forming under [[José Antonio Páez]] protected them from the royalist army. Mariño retreated to his home province of Cumaná, where he could rely on personal connections to maintain a base of operations. After failing to find support along the coast, Bolívar returned to Haiti. In the intervening months the divided republican leaders unable to agree on a single leader, decided to compromise and in October offered Bolívar the military command, with the understanding that a separate civilian government would be formed.  In Haiti Bolívar gathered new supplies and organized a second expedition, named by history as the Jacmel Expedition for the city from which it departed, and on December 31, 1816, landed in [[Barcelona, Anzoátegui|Barcelona]] controlled by Mariño, who by this point barely accepted Bolívar as head of the republicans.

==The Third Republic (1817-1820)==
[[File:CorreodelOrinoco.jpg|thumb|200px|right|First issue of the ''Correo del Orinoco'', June 27, 1818.]]
Bolívar took the forces he brought from Haiti to the Orinoco region, which was mostly controlled by Piar. Piar was making headway against the royalists of [[Ciudad Bolívar|Angostura]], and was preparing to lay siege to the city. The siege proved difficult and long, since Angostura had a lifeline in the river itself. Bolívar's reinforcements were useful and the city fell in August 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 210-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Angostura proved to be an immensely valuable base. From it the republicans had access to foreign trade in Caribbean and beyond via the Orinoco. The river's tributaries also provided access to the Venezuelan and New Granadan Llanos to the west, especially those in [[Casanare Department|Casanare]], where refugees from Morillo's troops had organized themselves under [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]. In Angostura Bolívar began publishing the ''Correo del Orinoco'' newspaper, an official organ of the revolutionaries, which was circulated not only in Venezuela, but in the Caribbean and in Europe. Under Páez and Piar, the republican armies had begun to recruit the local ''llaneros'' who, after Morillo disbanded Boves's informal units, no longer had an outlet for quick enrichment and social advancement under the royalist banner. This, however, posed the challenge to the Criollo republican leaders of channeling the ''llanero's'' energy, while not re-igniting the race war that had occurred under Boves. In this environment leaders like Piar, who in recent years had begun to emphasize his [[Mulatto|Pardo]] roots as he built a Pardo and ''llanero'' following, became suspect, and this weakness proved useful to Bolívar, when the moment came to reassert his position as head of the nascent republic.

===Challenges to Bolívar's authority===
The first overt challenge to his rule came with the meeting of the "Congresillo of [[Sucre (state)|Cariaco]]" on May 8 and 9 under the auspices of [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] José Cortés de Madariaga—who had been a member of the Junta of Caracas and had just returned to Venezuela after being imprisoned in Spain—Luis Brión and Santiago Mariño. The eight-member Congress proposed to restore the 1811 Constitution and establish a permanent government that could negotiate a recognition by  other nations. Mariño offered his and Bolívar's resignation in order to allow the Congress to elect a new executive. The Congress restored the [[triumvirate]] and selected Fernando Rodríguez del Toro (who was at the moment exiled in [[Trinidad]]), Francisco Javier Mayz (one of the eight deputies of the Congress) and Simón Bolívar as the new triumvirate. To replace in an interim manner the two who were not present, the Congress chose Francisco Antonio Zea and Canon Cortés de Madariaga. It made Mariño general-in-chief of the republican forces and established [[La Asunción]] as the temporary capital of the Republic. It sent word to Bolívar to present himself as soon as military conditions permitted to take his place in the triumvirate. Less than a month later, Rafael Urdaneta and [[Antonio José de Sucre]], who remained loyal to Bolívar, lead a group of officers that forced the triumvirate to dissolve itself. By June, Bolívar, aware of its rise and fall, compared its existence to "[[Cassava|cassava bread]] in hot soup" and noted that at the moment in Venezuela only those who could command by force could truly do so.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Salcedo-Bastardo, "Congreso de Cariaco" in ''Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela'', Vol. 1. Caracas: Fundación Polar, 1999. {{ISBN|980-6397-37-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was clear to Bolívar by mid-1817 that he need to set a clear example that he would not tolerate challenges to his leadership. After the fall of Angostura Piar had become upset at Bolívar's leadership and decided to leave the area. He requested a passport from Bolívar, which he granted. Piar had begun to leave the area, when Bolívar changed his mind and accused Piar of plotting to kill all whites in the area and setting up a black and Mulatto republic (a ''pardocracia'') in imitation of Haiti. Piar was tracked down, [[court-martial]]ed and found guilty. On October 16 he was executed. Although Piar's crime had ostensibly been fomenting racial hatred, it was understood that his true crime had been not recognizing Bolívar authority. After Piar's execution, Mariño, whom Bolívar's confidant and chronicler [[Daniel Florence O'Leary|Daniel Florencio O'Leary]] later admitted had been more guilty of insubordination than Piar, fell in line and dropped any other pretensions to an independent leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 210-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

His political position secured, Bolívar began to expand the scope of his military activity. He met with Páez for the first time in January 1818, who accepted Bolívar as head of the republicans. Páez, however, refused to take his powerful ''llanero'' cavalry outside of the Llanos, where they were extremely effective in holding off and defeating Morillo's formal army. Bolívar was, therefore, left alone in a mid-year attempt to take Caracas, which failed. Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the republicans were secure enough in southern Venezuela, that Bolívar felt it was time to convene a new Venezuelan congress to give the republican government a permanent form. Elections were held in republican areas and to pick representatives of the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada under royalist control, among the troops of those areas. The [[Congress of Angostura]], consisting of twenty-six delegates, began holding sessions in February 1819. The highlight of the opening session was Bolívar's "[[Address at the Congress of Angostura]]", now seen along with his "Cartagena Manifesto" and "Jamaica Letter" as a foundational exposition of his political thought. The same day the Congress elected Bolívar president of the Republic and ratified his command of its armies.

===The New Granada Campaign===
{{See also|Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}
After the opening of the Congress, Bolívar conceived of a daring, yet risky, plan of attacking New Granada which had been a Spanish stronghold for the past three years. If he could liberate New Granada he would have a whole new base from which to operate against Morillo. Central New Granada held great promise since, unlike Venezuela, it had only been recently conquered by Morillo and it had a prior six-year experience of independent government. Royalist sentiment was not strong. But it would be hard to take the initiative against the better prepared and supplied royalist army. To surprise it, Bolívar decided to move during the Venezuelan ''invierno'', the [[wet season|rainy season]], when the Llanos flooded up to a meter and the campaign season ended. Morillo's forces would be evacuated from the Llanos for months and no one would anticipate that Bolívar's troops would be on the move. This decision, however, would mean literally wading in waist-deep, [[malaria]]l water for days before attempting to scale the Andes. Understandably the plan received little support from the Congress or even from the master of the Llanos himself, Páez. With only the forces he and Santander had recruited in the [[Apure River|Apure]] and [[Meta River]] regions, Bolívar set off in June 1819.

[[File:Bolivar's troops in the Cordillera Oriental.jpg|thumb|Bolívar's troops cross the Cordillera Oriental]]
The small army consisted of about 2,500 men: 1,300 infantry and 800 cavalry, including a [[British Legions|British legion]]. It took a route that went from the hot and humid, flood-swept plains of Colombia to the icy mountain pass of the [[Páramo]] de [[Pisba, Boyacá|Pisba]], at an altitude of 3,960 meters (13,000 feet), through the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Cordillera Oriental]]. After the hardships of wading through a virtual sea, the mostly ''llanero'' army scaled the mountains poorly clothed and ill-prepared for the cold and altitude of the mountains. On both legs of the trip many became ill or died. Despite some intelligence that Bolívar was on the move, the Spanish considered the route impassable, and therefore, they were taken by surprise when Bolívar's small army emerged from the mountains on July 5. In a series of battles under the auspices of [[Francisco Mariño y Soler]] the republican army cleared its way to [[Bogotá]]. First at the [[Vargas Swamp Battle|Battle of Vargas Swamp]] on July 25, Bolívar intercepted a royalist force attempting to reach the poorly defended capital. Then at the [[Battle of Boyacá]] on August 7, the bulk of the royalist army surrendered to Bolívar.  On receiving the news, the viceroy, [[Juan José de Sámano y Uribarri|Juan José de Sámano]], and the rest of royalist government fled the capital so fast that they left behind the treasury, an incredible coup for Bolívar and Santander. On August 10 Bolívar's army entered Bogotá.

With New Granada secure under Santander's control, Bolívar could return to Venezuela in a position of unprecedented military, political and financial strength. In his absence the Congress had flirted with deposing him, assuming that he would meet his death in New Granada. The vice-president Francisco Antonio Zea was deposed and replaced by Juan Bautista Arismendi. All this was quickly reversed when word got to the Congress of Bolívar's success. By year's end Bolívar presented himself before the Congress and asked it to decree the union of Venezuela and New Granada in a new state, [[Gran Colombia|Colombia]]. It did so on December 17 and elected him president of the new country. The Constitution that the Congress had just written for Venezuela became null and void and a new congress was set to convene within two years.

==President and Commander-in-Chief of Gran Colombia (1820-1825)==
{{See also|Gran Colombia}}
[[File:Plaza armisticio 2005.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Monument to the meeting between Morillo and Bolívar in Santa Ana de Trujillo.]]
1820 proved to be a banner year for Bolívar. His dream of creating a new nation was becoming a reality. Morillo no longer had the upper hand militarily and by late March reports began to arrive about the success of the [[Rafael del Riego|Riego Revolt]]. The revolt meant that the reinforcements that Morillo's expeditionary force desperately needed would not be coming. Moreover, in June the official orders to reinstate the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cádiz Constitution]] arrived and were implemented. The new Constitutional government in Spain radically changed policy towards the rebellions in America. It assumed that the revolutionaries, as liberals, were either fighting for, or could be co-opted by, the Spanish Constitution. Although this might have been true in parts of Spanish America at the start of the decade, by 1820 most Spanish Americans did not trust Fernando VII to keep his oath to the Constitution for long. More importantly, it had always been Bolívar's stance that the wars were between two sovereign states, and therefore, the question of reconciling with the Spanish Monarchy under the 1812 Constitution was never a consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Earle, Rebecca A. ''Spain and the Independence of Colombia, 1810-1825''. Exeter, University of Exeter Press, 2000, 153. {{ISBN|0-85989-612-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Morillo continued with negotiations and focused on getting a [[ceasefire]] and bringing the war in line with the [[Jus gentium|law of nations]]. This was achieved in two treaties signed on November 25 and 26 in [[Trujillo (state)|Santa Ana de Trujillo]], which established a six-month cessation of hostilities and regularized the [[rules of engagement]]. The negotiations were also important because the Spanish government for the first time tacitly granted Colombia national status, rather than seeing its representatives as mere rebels. Spain did not of course recognize Colombia, but the negotiations papers referred to it as such, rather than with the previous denominations of "Bolívar's forces" or "the Congress at Angostura."&lt;ref&gt;Earle, ''Spain and the Independence of Colombia'', 154-159.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceasefire allowed Bolívar to build up his army for the final showdown everyone knew was coming. By the end of the year, the Constitutional government granted Morillo his long-standing request to resign and he left South America. He was replaced by [[Miguel de la Torre]].

===Victory in Venezuela===
{{Main|Battle of Carabobo}}
The truce did not last all six months. On January 28 the ''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' of [[Maracaibo]], which had been in secret negotiations with the republicans aided by native son [[Rafael Urdaneta]], declared the province an independent republic, which chose to join Colombia. La Torre took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed, when Bolívar returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, the Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela, save for [[Puerto Cabello]] and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Hostilities continued until the surrender of Puerto Cabello in 1823, but the main front of the war now moved to southern New Granada and Quito.

===The Southern Campaign, Quito and Peru (1821-1824)===
{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence|Peruvian War of Independence}}

[[File:La Victoria de Junín - J.J. Olmedo..jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Allegory]] of Bolívar's liberation of ''Colombia'' in a book of poetry by [[José Joaquín de Olmedo]].]]
With the Spanish Monarchy collapsing in South America and the uncertainty of constitutional rule in Spain, provinces of the [[Royal Audience of Quito|Presidency of Quito]] began to declare independence. In October 1820 a coup in [[Guayaquil]] set up a junta, which declared Guayaquil a republic. [[Portoviejo]] and [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] followed suit in the next few weeks. [[Quito]] remained in royalist control under the Audiencia President, Field Marshal [[Melchior Aymerich]], and by January 1821 had defeated the forces sent by Guayaquil against it. Bolívar was determined to ensure that the Presidency of Quito become part of Gran Colombia and not remain a collection of small, divided republics. To this end, Colombian aid in the form of supplies and an army under [[Antonio José de Sucre]] began to arrive in Guayaquil in February. Throughout 1821 Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides were exhausted and signed a 90-day armistice. The following year, at [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito. The territory of New Granada was secure. From [[Puerto Cabello]] royalist make a counterattack at [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]]. However the main focus now became neutralizing the royalist Army in Peru.

[[José de San Martín]] had already made incursions into Peru starting in 1820. He had been declared Protector of Peruvian Freedom, in August 1821 after liberating parts of the country, but the important cities and provinces still remained royalist. Bolívar and San Martín held a [[Guayaquil conference|meeting in Guayaquil]] on July 26 and  27, 1822, in which they discussed plans to liberate Peru and it was decided that Bolívar and Gran Colombia would take over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Martín departed from the scene. For the next two years Colombian and Peruvian patriot forces gain more territory. On February 10, 1824, Bolívar was given immense political powers when a Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru, which made Bolívar the head of state of a second country and allowed Bolívar to completely reorganize the political and military administration of Peru. Bolívar, assisted by Sucre, decisively defeated the remnants of the royalist cavalry on August 6, 1824, at the [[Battle of Junín]]. Sucre then destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the royalist army at [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9. South American independence was now all but secured. The only royalist area in the continent was highland country of [[Upper Peru]], [[El Callao]] and [[Chiloé]].

===The Peruvian and Colombian campaign in Upper Peru===
''For details, see [[Bolivian War of Independence]]''

Bolívar was now president of both Gran Colombia and Peru and had been granted extraordinary powers by the legislatures of both countries to carry out the war against the Spanish Monarchy. Since Bolívar was tied up with the administration of Quito and Peru, the liberation of Upper Peru fell to Sucre and [[Francisco Burdett O'Connor|O'Connor]], and within a year in April 1825, the task had been completed. A congress of Upper Peru on August 6, 1825, chose to name the new nation after the Liberator and called it the Republic of Bolívar. (The name would later be changed to Bolivia.) With independence secured for all of Spanish South America, Bolívar's political life entered a new phase. He now had to turn to consolidating the large nations he had created out of the former Spanish provinces. And dissension began to brew in the north as the regions of Gran Colombia began to chafe under the centralized government.

==The dissolution of Gran Colombia and aftermath==
[[File:Simón Bolívar - José María Espinosa, 1830.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sketch of Bolívar at age 47 made from life by José María Espinosa in 1830.]]

During 1826, internal divisions had sparked dissent throughout the nation and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela, and Gran Colombia appeared to be on the verge of collapse. An amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but political dissent appeared in New Granada as a consequence of this. In an attempt to keep the nation together, Bolívar called for a constitutional convention at [[Ocaña, Norte de Santander|Ocaña]] to be held in April 1828. To prevent the splintering of Gran Colombia, Bolívar proposed to introduce an even more centralist model of government, including some or all of the elements he had been able to place in the Bolivian constitution: a [[President for Life|lifetime presidency]] with the ability to select a successor, and a hereditary third chamber of the legislature. These proposals were deemed anti-liberal and met with strong opposition, including from a faction forming around Santander, who by now was openly opposed to Bolívar politically.

The [[Convention of Ocaña]] (April 9 to June 10, 1828) met under a cloud. Many felt that the breakup of the country was imminent. Addressing these fears, the Congress went in the opposite direction that Bolívar had hoped, and drafted a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government with greatly reduced the powers for the central administration. Unhappy with this outcome, pro-Bolívar delegates left the convention and the constitution was never ratified.

After the failure of the convention, Bolívar proclaimed himself dictator on August 27, 1828, through an [[Organic law|Organic]] [[Decree]] of Dictatorship. He considered this as a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, though it only increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents. On September 25, 1828 an attempt to assassinate Bolívar failed, but it illustrated the tense political atmosphere in Gran Colombia. Although Bolívar emerged physically intact from the event, he was, nevertheless, greatly affected. Dissent continued, and new uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela and Quito during the next two years. Gran Colombia finally collapsed in 1830. Bolívar himself died in the same year at age 47 on December 17. His closest political ally at the time, Sucre, who was intending to retire from public life, had been murdered earlier on June 4, 1830.

Bolívar's legacy continued in the [[Succession of states|successor states]] to Gran Colombia. Many of the officers who had fought by him were not only involved in the revolts that led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia, but continued to play important political and military roles in the decades and wars that followed. Bolívar's political thought—his emphasis on a strong, centralized government—became the basis of conservative thought in nineteenth-century South America.

{{Hazara people}}
The '''Hazāra of Muḥammad Khwāja''' ({{lang-haz|هزارهٔ محمد خواجه}}) is one of [[Hazara tribes|tribes]] of the ethnic [[Hazara people|Hazara]] inhabiting in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Poladi. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1f8MAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=maska+hazara&amp;dq=maska+hazara&amp;cd=1 The Hazāras]. Mughal Pub. Co., 1989. {{ISBN|0-929824-00-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-929824-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emir Muhammad khwaja belong to [[Barlas]] tribe. He is son of Emir Haji Saifuddin also spelled as Seifedin  &lt;ref&gt;Page 478, Book III , The History of Timur-Bec, by Sharaf al-din Ali Yazdi&lt;/ref&gt; who was Vizier of [[Timur]] in the beginning and later became Governor of [[Qandahar]] province now in Afghanistan. His great-grandfather, [[Hajji Beg]] Barlas, was leader of Barlas tribe who overthrown [[Abdullah (Chagatai Khanate)|Qara'unas Abdullah]] from power in southern [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[Abdullah (Chagatai Khanate)|Abdullah]], who had recently taken power, was young and inexperienced, and his move to [[Samarkand]] threatened Hajji Beg, whose territories were centered in the nearby city of [[Shahrisabz|Kish]].

[[Emir]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], [[Mirza]], [[Baig]], [[Shah]], [[wikt:ghazi|Ghazi]], and [[Sultan]] are titles to his tribes and descendants to date. But Emir and Mirza are titles specific to his family.

Emir Muhammad Khwaja was the commander in chief of [[Babur]]’s army. He is well known as Khwaja e Bozorg ‘the great khwaja’. His names appears in many historical script including [[Babur Nama]].

Emir was a great writer and calligrapher. This talent has also been depicted by many of his descendants in different era such as [[Faiz Mohammad Katib Hazara]] who served as  [[Afghan]] court chronicler and secretary to [[Habib Ullah Khan|Emir Habib Ullah Khan]] from 1901 to 1919.&lt;ref name="Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab 1988. p. 20"&gt;Kitab-e Tadakkor-e Enqilab, Translation: Shkirando as "Kniga Upominanii o Myatezhe" Moscow, 1988. p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Emir Muhammad Khwaja served as chief of army of [[Babur]] during his struggle to capture [[Delhi]] in each battle including the last one in [[Panipat]]. Emir admired the continental weather in central Asia and could never adjust to the hot weather of Delhi. It has been recorded that Emir Khwaja lived in [[Sharana, Afghanistan|Sharan]] district of [[Paktia]] province and many of his descendants scattered from there to other parts of Afghanistan. Emir Khawja is buried in [[Sharan District]] of Paktia Province in Afghanistan.

Emir Muhammad khwaja had three sons Emir Wali, Emir Babuk, and Emir Bahlool.

'''Nicolaes le Febure''' (16 April 1589 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1641), was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] mayor of [[Haarlem]].

==Biography==
He was the son of Mahu Nicolaesz. of [[Herzele]], and Jannetje Gillis. He became judge, magistrate and mayor and married Margaretha Deyman on 22 September 1612.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[http://explore.rkd.nl/nl/images/11132 Nicolaes le Febure] in record for this painting in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was portrayed by [[Frans Hals]] in ''[[The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627]]''. Because he was a dwarf, Hals portrayed him standing so that he appears the same height as the men sitting. The tallest man in the group was positioned behind him however, to accentuate his stature.

On 13 July 1641 he was buried in Haarlem.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

'''Richard Harrow''' is a fictional character on the television series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' played by actor [[Jack Huston]].

==Fictional Biography==
===Backstory===
Richard Harrow was a sharp shooter in the [[US Army]] during [[World War I]]. He was badly disfigured during the war, losing his eye, upper jaw and most of the cheekbone on the left side of his face. He has also suffered some throat damage which causes him to speak in a low, muffled voice. Because of his appearance, Harrow wears a tin mask in public that was molded to mirror the intact right side of his face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Alexander | first=Caroline | title=Faces of War  Amid the horrors of World War I, a corps of artists brought hope to soldiers disfigured in the trenches | work=Smithsonian Magazine | date=February 2007 | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/faces-of-war-145799854/#ZqbhIOceMshbS1Ak.99 | accessdate=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=chaunceydevega | title= Much More Than Gangsters and Guns. Boardwalk Empire's Richard Harrow and the Real Faces of War | work=Daily Kos | date=September 10, 2013 | url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/09/10/1237931/-Much-More-Than-Gangsters-and-Guns-Boardwalk-Empire-s-Richard-Harrow-and-the-Real-Faces-of-War | accessdate=March 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war he returned to Wisconsin where his twin sister, Emma, cared for him while his wounds healed. Once he was able to care for himself he left to live in Chicago.

===Season 1===
Richard meets fellow veteran [[Jimmy Darmody]] ([[Michael Pitt]]) in an army hospital in Chicago,&lt;ref name="RedWhiteBlack-favicon"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/jack-huston-bids-a-fond-farewell-to-the-boardwalk-20131125 |title='Boardwalk Empire' Q&amp;A: Jack Huston Discusses Richard Harrow's Tragic Departure |website=www.rollingstone.com |date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they become fast friends. To prove his loyalty, Richard kills a local gangster who had disfigured a young prostitute with whom Jimmy was close. Jimmy invites Richard to stay with him and his family, and brings him into his [[rumrunning|bootlegging]] outfit.

Richard accompanies Jimmy back to [[New Jersey]], where he becomes a hit man working for Jimmy under [[Atlantic City]] political boss [[Nucky Thompson]] ([[Steve Buscemi]]). Richard then moves into the Thompson home where he acts as a bodyguard to Nucky, his companion [[Margaret Thompson|Margaret Schroeder]] ([[Kelly Macdonald]]) and her two small children. At first Margaret and her children are frightened by Richard's appearance, but they eventually warm up to him.

===Season 2===
Richard is now established as the right hand man on Jimmy's bootlegging crew. Jimmy and Richard have now gone into business with [[Lucky Luciano|Charlie "Lucky" Luciano]] ([[Vincent Piazza]]), [[Meyer Lansky]] ([[Anatol Yusef]]) and [[Al Capone]] ([[Stephen Graham]]). Richard has also moved into the Darmody household, where he befriends Jimmy's wife Angela ([[Aleksa Palladino]]). Angela, a painter, asks Richard if she can do his portrait; he reluctantly agrees. During their session, Richard confides in Angela that he and his sister have not spoken since he left home. Richard then voluntarily removes his mask, and she paints his portrait.

Richard ventures out into a secluded forest during a remembrance day memorial, intending to commit suicide. As he puts a shotgun in his mouth, a hunter's dog runs off with his tin mask. Richard chases the dog, and  finds two hunters sitting around a campfire, who convince him to keep on living.

Richard serves as Jimmy's lieutenant throughout a turf war with Nucky, and remains loyal even as they suffer serious financial losses. Richard is deeply saddened by Angela's death at the hands of [[Philadelphia]] gangster Manny Horvitz ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]), and begins to wonder if their business is worth the price they pay. 

To mend fences with Nucky, Richard and Jimmy go to Alderman James Neary ([[Robert Clohessy]]), scheduled to testify against Nucky, force him to type a note at gunpoint exonerating Nucky, then Richard shoots him in the head and stages his death as a suicide. When Nucky calls Jimmy and says they have captured Horvitz, both Jimmy and Richard sense a trap, and Richard offers to go along. Jimmy refuses, however, and tells Richard to live a good life. After Jimmy is murdered, Richard moves in with Jimmy's mother Gillian ([[Gretchen Mol]]) at her estate.

===Season 3===
One year later, Richard is a permanent resident at the late Commodore's estate, which Gillian has since turned into a brothel. Richard now acts as a caretaker at the brothel, and looks after Jimmy's son Tommy. Richard seeks vengeance on Manny Horvitz, who is now a member of Nucky's organization, for the death of Angela. Richard waits outside the Horvitz home and then shoots Horvitz in the face with a shotgun as he opens the door to leave his house.

Richard ventures off one evening to a veteran's legion for support and to discuss compensation which has been promised to wounded veterans. It's here that Richard meets Paul Sagorsky (Mark Borkowski), a bitter drunk who lost his son in the war. Richard looks after Paul when he is injured in a bar fight, and meets Paul's daughter Julia ([[Wrenn Schmidt]]). He falls in love with her, and they begin a courtship, despite her father's objections. 

Later in the season, Gillian's brothel is occupied by New York gangster [[Gyp Rosetti]] ([[Bobby Cannavale]]), who is at war with Nucky Thompson. Fearing for Tommy's safety, Richard attempts to remove the boy to Julia's house, but Gillian finds out about the plan and, angered, she has Rosetti's men kick Richard out. Richard arms himself and methodically kills most of Rossetti's men one by one through the house, recovering Tommy, whom he leaves at the Sagorsky home. Richard then flees Atlantic City.

===Season 4===
One year later, Richard makes his way to his childhood home in Wisconsin to visit his twin sister Emma ([[Katherine Waterston]]). Richard returns home to find Emma widowed, pregnant and in debt. During his visit with his sister, Richard finds it difficult to put down the family dog. During this time Richard is tracked down by a former client who had hired Richard previously to carry out an assassination contract that was not honored. They corner Richard in the barn; during the ensuing struggle, Richard kills one of the gangsters, but the other one breaks Richard's hand and nearly kills him. Emma arrives just in time and kills the gangster, saving Richard's life. Richard realizes he is a danger to his sister and decides to go back to Atlantic City.

Upon returning to Atlantic City, Richard bumps into Paul Sagorsky, who is dying of [[cirrhosis]] of the liver. Richard finds out that Julia and Paul are locked in a custody battle with Gillian over Tommy. Richard returns to the Sagorsky's home to help Julia, whom he marries.&lt;ref name="RedWhiteBlack-favicon" /&gt; To provide for his new family, Richard gets a job washing dishes at the Onyx Club, with the help of Nucky.

When Gillian is arrested for murder, Richard and Julia see an opportunity to get permanent custody of Tommy. Gillian claims that the body found on her estate was that of her son, Jimmy, and with the body having been cremated, there is no way to prove otherwise. In order to undermine her story, Richard asks Nucky for the location where Jimmy's body is actually buried. Nucky agrees to tell Richard, but for a price: he must eliminate New York gangster Dr. Valentine Narcisse ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), who is causing problems for Nucky and his associate Chalky White ([[Michael K. Williams]]). As he prepares to shoot Narcisse, he hesitates and his hand shakes, and he accidentally kills White's daughter Maybelle when she unexpectedly steps into the line of fire.&lt;ref name="RedWhiteBlack-favicon" /&gt; Richard is mortally wounded in the ensuing gunfire, but manages to make his way to the Atlantic City Boardwalk, where he dies. His dying visions show him returning to the farm in Wisconsin to meet his entire family, with his face complete and healed.

== Interview ==
Jack Huston was interviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Huston stated that he was told that his character was going to die on the episode of Harrow's death. Huston stated that it was very appropriate for Harrow, a tragic character, to die tragically. Being honored instead of upset about the ending, Huston claimed that the writers wrote "the most unbelievably beautiful ending, and it made so much sense." Glad to have played a longer-than-initially-expected role in ''Boardwalk Empire'', Huston stated that it was the start of his career in acting. Terence Winter said that if Harrow was not fatally wounded after shooting Maybelle, then Harrow would have committed suicide. Huston agrees that Harrow would have done that, for fact of killing Maybelle would be unforgivable in Harrow's mind. Huston stated that at first "Richard was a brilliant killer"; then he gives up killing, losing confidence; later, he was intuitive and expected himself to err; after shooting Maybelle he hesitates, allowing himself to be shot. Huston posited that Harrow's scrapbook became a reality: he fell in love, married, and had a family. Regarding Harrow's vision at the end of his life, Huston stated "In a way he reached heaven in his life."&lt;ref name="RedWhiteBlack-favicon" /&gt;

*:Those lost at sea, on land or sky
*:Lie silent as their loved ones cry,
*:Remembered now and for ever more,
*:May their sacrifice bring an end to war.

== Non-profit and political work ==

In 2005, Savage started a non-profit organization called United Coalition Association. Its mission is to fight juvenile delinquency and counteract negative behavior in youth. It also organizes college fairs to prepare students the entrance to college.&lt;ref name="bxtimes1" /&gt;

Savage also appeared in PSAs encouraging youth to stay away from gang activity, which aired on TV stations such as [[MTV]] and [[VH1]]. In 2008, Savage was elected to the [[New York State Democratic Committee]] with the help of former NYS Assemblyman [[Peter M. Rivera|Peter M Rivera]]. Savage was honored by the [[NAACP]] with an award in recognition of his devotion and commitment and uplifting youth in the community. Ronald Savage is also the founder of the New York State College Fair Day. He also created a DVD called ''The Plan'' which provides information about entrance to college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb18794340__SRONALD%20SAVAGE__Orightresult__U__X4;jsessionid=08923EA14AFEAD710DB1C6682A403A08?lang=eng&amp;suite=def |title=Encore -- The plan.   vol. 2  [videorecording] : educational tool for preparing to look for college / writer, Ronald Savage, Charlie Watt. |website=browse.nypl.org |access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In 2011, Bronx Borough President [[Rubén Díaz Jr.]] did not reappoint Savage, then a New York State Democratic Committeeman for the 76th Assembly District, to local Community Board #9 in the Soundview area of the Bronx, due to the fact that Savage helped Charlie Ramos (a candidate for senate) in the 2011 September primary elections against Ruben Diaz Jr's father, New York state Sen. [[Rubén Díaz Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/bronx/farewell-elaine-bronx-gal-famed-saloon-article-1.127119|title=A farewell to Elaine's, that Bronx gal's famed saloon - NY Daily News|first=Bob|last=Kappstatter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Savage reported that [[Afrika Bambaataa]] [[child sexual abuse|molested]] him at the age of 15 in 1980.&lt;ref name="thump.vice.com"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/afrika-bambaataa-sexual-abuse-zulu-nation-ron-savage-hassan-campbell |title=Afrika Bambaataa Allegedly Molested Young Men For Decades.

On April 9, the exclusive story appeared in the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/afrika-bambaataa-sex-abuse-accuser-ronald-savage-speaks-article-1.2594599 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Afrika Bambaataa sex abuse accuser Ronald Savage details years of torment following hip-hop icon's molestation |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=April 9, 2016 |quote=Savage, 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Zulu Nation]] apologized to Savage, after three more men came forth with accounts of being abused by Bambaataa after the story was published. Savage has also fought to help change the [[statute of limitations]] laws in New York State against child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/exclusive-daily-news-inspires-queens-mom-fight-justice-article-1.2624019 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Daily News inspires Queens mom to fight for justice |newspaper=NY Daily News |access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2016-08-03-afrika-bambaataa-accuser-new-song |title=Afrika Bambaataa Accuser Ron Savage’s Vocals Added to Powerful Remix – DJBooth Article |newspaper=DJBooth.net |access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage was featured on the 2016 single "Don't Close Your Eyes" produced by [[Jonathan Hay (producer)|Jonathan Hay]], where he spoke over Bambaataa's song "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" which was replayed in the track. Savage speaks out about child molestation and issues a very bold challenge to the [[President of the United States]], stating, “Children are being molested every day. I was molested by a world Hip-Hop icon,” states Savage. “My question is to the President of the United States of America: what are you going to do about the child molestation crisis of America?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notey.com/@allhiphop_unofficial/external/11073095/child-molestation-victim-ronald-savage-drops-track-dissing-afrika-bambaattaa.html|title=allhiphop.com - Child Molestation Victim Ronald Savage Drops Track Dissing Afrika Bambaattaa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Savage also stated in an interview in London, "I don’t recognize the term [[Hip hop|hip hop Culture]] because that is a term Bambaataa coined and I don’t know what his intention was when he coined the term, but what I do recognize is [[hip hop]] and I salute the rebirth of the [[hip hop movement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://urbandandylondon.com/2016/11/02/an-un-zulu-nation/ |title=An Un-Zulu Nation |last=Angel |date=2016-11-02 |website=Urban Dandy London |access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Siegfried Schtauffen'''|ジークフリート・シュタウフェン|Jīkufurīto Shutaufen}} and {{nihongo|'''Nightmare'''|ナイトメア|Naitomea}} are two interconnected fictional characters in ''[[Soulcalibur]]'', a series of fighting games by [[Namco]]. Introduced as a [[tragic hero]] in the 1995 game ''[[Soul Edge]]'', Siegfried has been a mainstay and lead character for most of the series, especially ''[[Soulcalibur Legends]]'', until ''[[Soulcalibur V]]''. Nightmare is an evil, mutated form of Siegfried that later becomes an entity entirely separated from Siegfried in ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'' onward, the living incarnation of '''Soul Edge''' / '''{{nihongo|Inferno|インフェルノ|Inferuno}}'''.

Siegfried is a young German knight that, driven mad after killing his father, becomes possessed by the evil sword Soul Edge and physically transforms into the demon known as Nightmare. Though Siegfried does temporarily regain his sanity after Nightmare is defeated by [[Chai Xianghua|Xianghua]] in ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' (only to be taken over by Soul Edge again shortly after), it is not until after the events of ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'' that he is freed from the sword's control entirely and went on to pierce the cursed sword using Soul Calibur. He then seeks atonement for the atrocities he committed as Nightmare. In their final confrontation in ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]'', Siegfried successfully destroyed Soul Edge and freed himself from the evil power.

Nightmare first appeared in one of the possible endings for the Siegfried character in ''Soul Edge''. In the sequel ''Soulcalibur'', he was given a name and featured as a central character. Ever since then, Nightmare has been the owner of the powerful evil sword Soul Edge, and thus the objective of most other characters in the story. Appearing in every game of the series, Nightmare has served as a recurring antagonist in contrast to the [[protagonist]] role played by Siegfried, as well as serving as Siegfried's archenemy.

=== ''Soul'' games ===
{{summarize section}}

In his [[Soul Edge|''Soul Edge'']] debut, Siegfried is a 16-year-old former child of Frederick Schtauffen, a brave knight in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] following the [[Italian Wars]]. Named by his mother after the legendary Germanic hero [[Sigurd]], Siegfried had joined a band of brigands called the Schwarzwind after his father has had left on a foreign crusade, only to unintentionally kill his own returning father during an ambush. Driven insane by this act, Siegfried convinced himself that someone else was to blame for his father's death, thus embarking on a journey to find the legendary weapon known as Soul Edge and use it to take revenge. 

He traveled first to Ostrheinsburg Castle belonging to the noble Stefan, who he believed to be the possessor of Soul Edge; and he joined in its forces as a [[Landsknecht]], rising in its ranks with the hopes of acquiring Stefan's blade. During a siege on the castle, Siegfried saw an opportunity to kill Stefan, running off with his prized possession into the [[Black Forest|Black Woods]], but the sword held no power. Frustrated, he continued to search for the real Soul Edge, growing increasingly more insane for its power as time passed. He finally managed to come across the real Soul Edge, lying beside the corpse of the corrupted pirate [[Cervantes de Leon]] that lit up in a hellish blaze of fire and attacked him. Siegfried raised his mighty [[zweihänder]] and defeated his lingering spirit, the fiery demon Inferno, breaking his sword in the process and earning the right to wield the Soul Edge for himself. But at the moment that Siegfried obtained the cursed blade, the Evil Seed emanated from him in a beam of light that rained across the entire world, leading only to death and destruction. Soul Edge tempted Siegfried to wield it with a promise to resurrect his dead father in exchange for gathering souls for its consumption. Not knowing that he is just being used, Siegfried agreed and started killing people to gather souls. Eventually, Soul Edge consumed him and Nightmare is borns, transforming him into the Azure Knight. 

In ''[[Soulcalibur Legends]]'', Siegfried is saved from the Evil Seed by a group sent by the Masked Emperor to investigate it. Once brought to him, the Emperor requested that he resurrect Soul Edge to defeat the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]] Barbaros, who wielded Soul Calibur. The Emperor reminded the reluctant Siegfried of his father - who lived in the Empire's service and died protecting it - and he finally accepted the request, starting a journey alongside [[Ivy Valentine]] and court jester Iska Farkas. Siegfried travels around the world, gathering Soul Edge's shards and receiving help from [[Sophitia]], [[Astaroth (Soulcalibur)|Astaroth]], [[Mitsurugi (Soulcalibur)|Mitsurugi]], [[Taki (Soulcalibur)|Taki]] and [[Tales of Symphonia|Lloyd Irving]], eventually forming a bond with them, despite the fact that they all wish to either take Soul Edge away from him or destroy it. Along the way, Siegfried manages to defeat several Guardians of the Soul Edge shards and restore Soul Edge's power. Using it, Siegfried defeats Barbaros. The Masked Emperor gets Soul Calibur and reveals that she planned to defend her people by annihilating all possible enemies with the combined powers of it and Soul Edge. However, she is unsuccessful in seizing Soul Edge from Siegfried, and an event seemingly similar to the Evil Seed takes place during their battle. He defeats Inferno when the demon tries to stop him in the form of Nightmare and succeeds in sealing Soul Edge, replacing it with the sword Requiem. Siegfried saves his allies, and together they march against the Empire's army. He confronts and defeats the Masked Emperor and stop her conquest. As he leaves her, Soul Calibur, and Soul Edge behind, Iska betrays him and takes both swords but Siegfried emerges victorious. As Iska dies he exclaims that in the end all will betray Siegfried and that only those with power will prevail in the end, leaving those without it to suffer and ultimately die. As Siegfried leaves, he takes the unsealed Soul Edge with him again.

In ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'', his group of followers (Astaroth, [[Aeon Calcos]], and Ivy) aided him in Soul Edge's quest to devour souls for a resurrection ceremony to be performed in his chosen stronghold, Ostrheinsburg. But as the ceremony was about to take place, both Aeon Calcos and Astaroth have been defeated, and Ivy had left after learning the truth of her past from Taki. Two young warriors confronted Nightmare: [[Kilik (Soulcalibur)|Kilik]] and [[Chai Xianghua|Xianghua]]. After a raging battle, the evil sword shattered and Siegfried regained some of his humanity and managed to briefly break free from Soul Edge's control. But along came the memories of the sins he committed when he was consumed by Soul Edge. Moreover, he realized that he had been the one who murdered his father, and that his "resurrection" was only an illusion brought by his mind. Siegfried meditated on all he had done and decided that if he was to be successful in his new resolve, he must distance himself from the civilized society so that he never kills again. He could not see his mother until he was fully redeemed.

By ''[[Soulcalibur II]]'', the balance between the restored Soul Edge and Siegfried was broken, and Soul Edge was able to take over Siegfried's mind. He has been well aware that although he had regained his sanity and learned to accept his past sins, he was not yet fully redeemed. At first it was for short periods of time during his sleep, but eventually he took Siegfried's body completely and used him to cause destruction once more. Four years passed, as he had assumed the azure armor for a second time, becoming Nightmare all over again, desperately pursuing fragments of the Soul Edge that he might fully restore it. As Nightmare plundered powerful souls and recovered shattered fragments, the cracks in Soul Edge healed one by one. His goal nearing completion, Nightmare returned to Ostrheinsburg for the restoration of the evil sword's true power. [[List of Soul characters#Raphael|Raphael Sorel]], a French former-nobleman pursuing the blade for his own scheme, challenged Nightmare and was completely defeated, but managed to pierce Soul Edge's eye with his rapier in one final attack when Siegfried's will awakened and he struggled to free his mind from the influence of evil. The sword now in agony lost control over Siegfried, and allowed him to defeat Inferno and break free once again. Siegfried then discovered Soul Calibur, released from Inferno's body after its defeat, and impaled Soul Edge's eye with it. Both swords sealed, Siegfried abandoned his old armor and left with them, swearing to seal away Soul Edge for all eternity and atone for his sins. 

His fate would not release him so easily, however. In ''[[Soulcalibur III]]'', [[List of Soul characters#Zasalamel|Zasalamel]] revived "Nightmare" in essence. Created as an avatar for a disembodied Inferno using the original armor as a shell, he pursued and eventually recovered his true body, Soul Edge. Nightmare also met [[Tira (Soulcalibur)|Tira]], who became his servant and manipulated others into protecting Soul Edge and sacrificing souls for Nightmare, to eventually become sacrifices themselves. Meanwhile, Zasalamel manipulated Siegfried, leading him to Nightmare, and wielding Soul Calibur, he clashed against Soul Edge. At the moment the swords struck a burst of energy was released; Siegfried was mortally wounded, while Soul Edge and its body were pulled into a warped dimension, eventually returning to Ostrheinsburg. 

In ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]'', Soul Calibur revived Siegfried, while Inferno restored Soul Edge fully and strengthened his hold over the animated armor that was Nightmare. Inferno then claimed the entire city of Ostrheinsburg as a vessel due to the fact that Nightmare lacked the capacity to contain his consciousness, and as a result, the city became cursed and many of its inhabitants were corrupted. Tira continued serving Nightmare and manipulating [[Astaroth (Soulcalibur)|Astaroth]], [[Sophitia]] and others into serving Soul Edge, in order to weaken Soul Calibur and provide Nightmare with the strength necessary to destroy the spirit sword. Nightmare would then clash against Siegfried in a final duel, though his plans were interfered with the appearance of Algol and the Tower of Remembrance. 

As revealed in ''[[Soulcalibur V]]'', Siegfried gathered his staunchest allies from the Schwarzwind, having reformed the bandits into mercenaries, including [[Hildegard von Krone]] and [[Viola (Soul Calibur)|Viola]]. One day, after more than a decade of service protecting humanity from the malfested, Siegfried discovered that Soul Calibur had transformed into a new one-handed sword—a clear harbinger of Soul Edge's return. A new champion to wield Soul Calibur would need to be found and the now 40-year-old Siegfried assigned the task to the young [[List of Soulcalibur characters#Z.W.E.I.|Z.W.E.I.]], a wandering swordsman who had joined his group. Meanwhile, Soul Edge regained consciousness with what little pieces of it were found and collected by its servants; allowing Nightmare to gain a new body and assume the alias of Graf Dumas. From there, Dumas worked his way into the grace of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to be awarded the Kingdom of Hungary, exploiting the war with the Ottomans to initiate a widespread search to find the remaining fragments to restore Soul Edge to its former glory, while simultaneously wanted to consume more souls under the guise of massacring the "malfested", the cursed sword's minions. Unknown to him however, his former servant, Tira had been working to create a new Nightmare as she is not satisfied with Dumas. One of his soldier, [[List of Soul characters#Patroklos|Patroklos Alexander]]; whom he manipulated for the massacre in exchange for searching his sister Pyrrha, revolted and fled from service. Dumas eventually met with Patroklos and Pyrrha again; this time revealing himself as Nightmare, and forced Pyrrha's hidden Soul Edge power to consume her, causing Patroklos to abandon her. Nightmare then initiated a war throughout Europe with his newfound power, but is eventually struck down and killed by Z.W.E.I., whom he previously tried to hunt before. Though after Pyrrha Omega kills Z.W.E.I., Inferno made her his new host for Soul Edge,but was eventually defeated by Patrokalos and together the siblings use Soul Edge to Piece Soul Calibur and sealing them back into the Astral Chaos. 

Siegfried also appeared playable in ''[[Soulcalibur: Lost Swords]]'', where he is 40-years-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/news/201309/17039633.html|title=シリーズ最新作『ソウルキャリバー ロストソーズ』がF2PスタイルでPS3に登場|last=|first=|date=|website=famitsu.com|language=ja|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Soulcalibur VI]]'' serves as a retelling of the events in the original ''Soulcalibur''. Shortly after becoming Nightmare, Siegfried slaughters thousands of innocents in an attempt to resurrect his father, with Soul Edge mimicking Frederick's voice to manipulate Siegfried. Nightmare is eventually defeated by Kilik and Xianghua. After the Azure Knight's defeat, Siegfried reawakens in a nearby forest wracked with guilt over his memories of his atrocities as Nightmare and his role in his father's death. After facing off against multiple people who want revenge on him for Nightmare's crimes, his soul is partially purified by Sophitia, giving him the motivation to take down Soul Edge for good. After hearing the voice of Soul Calibur cry for help, he grips Soul Edge and becomes Nightmare once more to prevent Soul Edge from consuming Soul Calibur. He then waits for his chance to regain control of his body once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/403/G040382/20180413016/|title=「ソウルキャリバーVI」，ツヴァイハンダーを操り戦う青年“ジークフリート”が公開。バトルアクションが確認できるPVも|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-17|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other appearances ===
Outside of the ''Soul'' series, Nightmare appeared in [[Babylonian Castle Saga|''Seme COM Dungeon: Drururuaga'']] where the player can obtain him as an "ally" and use his armor along with Soul Edge. Soul Edge also appeared as an enemy in [[Namco x Capcom|''Namco x Capcom'']] where its shards became [[Charade (Soul Calibur)|Charade]] and was fought as enemies, and made a cameo in [[Retro Game Challenge|''Retro Game Challenge'']]. A Sackboy costume of Nightmare was released as a DLC for ''[[LittleBigPlanet 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/product/EP9000-CUSA00762_00-LBPDLCNBSCCO0003|title=SOULCALIBUR™ Nightmare Costume – LBP™ 3|website=PlayStation™Store|language=en-PL|access-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Epoch C-Works released a series of action figures based upon the original ''Soulcalibur'', amongst them Nightmare. The semi-posable figure came with equipable weapons from the title in the same package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/image/10013734p/10/1 Nightmare (Completed) Package 1]. Hobby Search.

Retrieved on 2008-08-02&lt;/ref&gt; In the web series ''[[Death Battle]]'', Nightmare fought Guts, the protagonist from ''[[Berserk (manga)|Berserk]]'', in his standard, Night Terror, and Inferno forms. He lost as Guts was able to cut through Soul Edge in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ScrewAttack|title=Guts VS Nightmare (Berserk VS Soul Calibur) {{!}} DEATH BATTLE!|date=2015-04-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGNWRaM3zX4|access-date=2018-08-18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Siegfried and Nightmare both appear in ''Soulcalibur'' manga and make a guest appearance as cards in a mobile video game ''Outcast Odyssey'' and in many cards in ''[[Universal Fighting System]]''. They are also both featured on the official ''Soulcalibur VI'' arcade stick.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inside-games.jp/article/2018/06/13/115411.html|title=『ソウルキャリバー VI』デザインのアーケードスティックが登場！人気キャラクターをあしらったオリジナルモデル {{!}} インサイド|work=インサイド|access-date=2018-08-17|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and gameplay ==
In his debut, Siegfried appeared as a young man with short blond hair and blue eyes, covered in simple knight armor. Following his redemption in ''Soulcalibur'' and beyond, he retains the armor but his hair has grown longer, past shoulder length. During ''Soulcalibur"'' he also gains a long scar dashing over his right eye. In ''Soulcalibur III'', he returns with armor bearing the motif of a phoenix as well as feathers on his pauldrons. As of ''Soulcalibur IV'', his armor remains the same, but a second layer of crystalline armor covers with an intricate design and wields Soul Calibur instead of Requiem. He also gains a long blue scarf as well, completing the 'knight in shining armor' visage. His weapon in Soul Edge was originally Faust, a simple zweihander (two-handed sword) with a basic design, but swapped it for Requiem, a large blade with a flat end and a black lining in the center. He continues to use this sword from ''Soulcalibur'' all the way to ''Soulcalibur III'' and resumes its use in ''Soulcalibur V''. In ''Soulcalibur V'', Siegfried's appearance begins to take on the traits of his father, and has grown a stubble. His hair is swept up with a couple bangs hanging down and his scar still remains. In all games, he is left-handed.

Usually a standalone character, Siegfried is an [[Unlockable (gaming)|unlockable]] character in ''Soulcalibur.'' In ''Soulcalibur II'', he only appears as Nightmare's alternate costumes. The 2P costume is Siegfried mid-transition into Nightmare, featuring his human form with a grotesque dragon-like arm, a golden right eye and ruined armor based off his Soulcalibur design. Nightmare's bonus costume is Siegfried in standard platemail without any mutations to his body.

Even though Nightmare originally debuted in ''Soulcalibur'', its predecessor, ''Soul Edge'', featured a prototype of his character. In the home version, an extra character named "Siegfried!" (an alternate version of normal Siegfried taken from his no-input ending, where he was consumed by the cursed sword Soul Edge) was added as an unlockable character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=April 1997|title=Soul Edge: The Basic Guide to Master Swordsmanship|url=|journal=Computer and Video Games Freeplay|volume=12|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early version has crimson armor and a more flesh-like design, almost as if he were part of Soul Edge itself; he has no story nor ending, and only used Siegfried's Soul Edge without effects. Nightmare has appeared as a playable character in all the main sequels to ''Soulcalibur'', visually different for each game. 

Siegfried's blade is powerful and has long range, but it has a slow swing. In addition to standard attacks, Siegfried fights with multiple stances. This allows him to mix up his attacks, allowing him to play mind games with his opponent. Mastering the stance changes will allow the player to maintain control over the battle and perform damaging combos against the opponent. [[1UP.com]] recommended Siegfried in ''Soulcalibur IV'' for both beginners and experts of the series due to his easy combos despite his slow movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/soul-calibur-knight-shining-armor|title=Soul Calibur 4 Character Spotlight: Siegfried|publisher=1UP.com|archiveurl=http://archive.li/MhDQ#selection-629.249-629.560|archivedate=July 17, 2013|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nightmare's moveset before the events of ''Soulcalibur III'' was nearly identical to Siegfried's (barring a couple of exclusive moves in each moveset). However, Nightmare's fighting style was altered after Siegfried was freed from Inferno's influence between ''Soulcalibur II'' and ''Soulcalibur III''. Siegfried retained a majority of his old moveset while Nightmare's new moveset became a brutish twist of Siegfried's moveset. Nightmare's moveset relies far less on stances and mindgames and focuses more on overwhelming the opponent with strong blows and otherworldly might. As such, Siegfried is seen as a technical stance character focused on mindgames and mix ups while Nightmare is an aggressive rushdown character focused on punishing his opponent's mistakes with his raw power. Despite ''Soulcalibur VI'' being a reboot that takes place during the events of ''Soulcalibur'', Nightmare and Siegfried retain these differences in their movesets.

== Derived characters ==

=== Inferno ===
[[File:Inferno (Soulcalibur).png|thumb|Inferno in ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]'']]

Inferno is the physical manifestation of the cursed sword Soul Edge's own soul and the true antagonist within ''Soul'' series, where it mostly started out as the final boss in ''Soul Edge'' (originally listed as '''"SoulEdge"''') until ''Soulcalibur II'', including the reboot/retelling game ''Soulcalibur VI''. It fights using the attack style of other fighters from its memories of past battles and will switch to a random one at the start of each round. Though it exists in its own dimension, Chaos (a realm where time and space never exist), it has used duplicity such as in the case of tricking Siegfried into expanding its will, and in more extreme cases utilized Cervantes' flaming corpse and later the remnants of Nightmare's armor to create an avatar for itself. Within Chaos, Inferno can manifest itself as a flaming and mostly skeletal body for itself, creating weapons to match whichever fighting style it currently uses, particularly Siegfried's being its primary likeness at most part. 

Inferno, along with Soul Edge is destroyed by Siegfried at the end of ''Soulcalibur IV'', though its will continues to live in the leftover shards of Soul Edge and later manifests itself in a new Soul Edge. However, after the new Nightmare was slain, Inferno choose Pyrrha as its new host until being defeated by her brother and Soul Edge along with Soul Calibur were both sealed away in the astral chaos. Its will and power has, directly and indirectly, affected several other characters in the series, such as the Evil Seed event that caused many to turn somewhat evil or insane. It has also caused the creation of several life forms or modification of them, such as Ivy's sword, Charade, [[Necrid]] and [[Zasalamel|Abyss]].

In ''Soulcalibur VI'', Inferno's gameplay is similar to his original ''Soul Edge'' counterpart as being an enhanced version of certain Soul Edge wielders than as a mimic fighter, in this case, its main alter-ego Nightmare instead of Cervantes. Due to its final boss role despite being an unlockable character, Inferno is banned from online matches and official tournaments.

=== Night Terror ===
{{nihongo|Night Terror|ナイトテラー|Naito Terā}} is the secret final boss of ''Soulcalibur III'', replacing the normal final boss Abyss if certain requirements are met. Its appearance has been a mystery as it is not player-controllable, is given very little mention in-game (its profile only stated that it is the result of Soul Edge and Soul Calibur fusing with Nightmare's remains), and does not appear or mentioned in future games. The official artbook of ''Soulcalibur V'' mentions the creature as the personification of "Catastrophe" residing in Astral Chaos who is very powerful that even Soul Calibur's creator, Algol avoids confronting it for the time being.

Night Terror utilizes a complete version of Soul Edge as its weapon with a fighting style simply referred to as "Memories of Nightmare?". It borrows many moves from Nightmare, albeit greatly amplified, including having greater range and power or becoming unblockable. Notably, Night Terror is the only character in the history of the series who cannot be defeated by ring outs; whenever it is knocked off the stage, it simply flies back using its wings.

==Reception==
Siegfried's overall reception in the series has been positive. Outlets such as [[Eurogamer]], [[Gameplanet]] and [[GamesRadar]] commented positively on his redesigns for ''Soulcalibur IV,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/playstation-3/reviews/132205.Soul-Calibur-IV/|title=Soul Calibur IV review|date=|work=GamePlanet|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/soulcalibur-iv-updated-impressions/|title=Soulcalibur IV - updated impressions|date=August 24, 2007|work=GamesRadar|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Soulcalibur VI''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-13-heres-siegfried-and-his-massive-sword-in-soulcalibur-6|title=Here's Siegfried and his massive sword in Soulcalibur 6|author=|date=|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] has too praised Siegfied for an appealing design and a powerful yet graceful fighting style while listing him together with Nightmare at a top of their top ten list for the series in 2008, where they both were called "a perfect representation of the series' core conflict," and opining that "a Soul game simply feels incomplete without an appearance by the warring personalities of Siegfried and Nightmare."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/895/895160p10.html|title=Soulcalibur: The Top Ten Fighters|author=Jesse Schedeen|work=[[IGN]]|date=2008-07-30|accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' ranked Siegfried/Nightmare the best character in the series, citing his duality as the reason that makes the character "one of the most fascinating characters in the entire series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/11/best-soul-calibur-characters-series/sie|title=The 20 Best Characters of the "SoulCalibur" Series | author=Knight, Rich | date=November 29, 2013 | work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] | accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preview of ''Soulcalibur V'', Siliconera said the franchise would not be same without Siegfried or Nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/05/11/a-clearer-look-at-patroklos-soulcalibur-vs-protagonist-and-the-new-siegfried/|title=A Clearer Look At Patroklos, Soulcalibur V’s Protagonist, And The New Siegfried| date=May 11, 2011| work=Siliconera | accessdate=May 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gamer listed him as the 12th most powerful ''Soulcalibur'' character in 2017, praising his role and impact in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thegamer.com/soulcalibur-the-8-weakest-characters-and-7-who-are-powerful-af/|title=A Soulcalibur: The 8 Weakest Characters (And 7 Who Are Powerful AF!!)

GameAxis Unwired expressed mixed thoughts about the character in ''Legends'' due to the fact he is the only playable character at first as the rest are unlockable. Additionally, the lack of his relationship with Nightmare not being featured as usual earned criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=February 2008|title=GameAxis Unwired|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=qOoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=siegfried+soulcalibur&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi899m98IPbAhWJkpAKHTX-ALkQuwUILjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=siegfried%20soulcalibur&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 13, 2018|work=GamePlanet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressing disappointment by the lack of famous characters in ''Soulcalibur V'', [[GameSpy]] noted that at least Siegfried's return might at least encourage him to play the game, citing lack of interest with the new cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/soulcalibur-v/1171699p1.html|title=The Interrogation Room: Soulcalibur V

'''Tobias Beecher''' is a main character on the television show ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'',&lt;ref&gt;^ Sean O'Sullivan and David Wilson, Images of Incarceration: Representations of Prison in Film and Television Drama (Waterside Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; played by [[Lee Tergesen]]. He is one of only nine regular characters to survive the entire run of the show. The others are [[Bob Rebadow]], [[Ryan O'Reily]], [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]], [[Arnold "Poet" Jackson]], [[Sister Peter Marie Reimondo]], [[Tim McManus]] and [[Dr. Gloria Nathan]].

==Character overview==
Beecher, a successful attorney and family man, is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who hits and kills a nine-year-old girl while [[driving under the influence|driving drunk]]. He is offered a [[plea bargain]] that would have allowed him to serve his sentence in a [[minimum security prison]], but Beecher, not wanting to do any time at all, instead goes to trial seeking an [[acquittal]]. The effort fails and the judge, a family friend of the Beechers, decides to make an example of him and sentences him to 15 years in the Oswald Maximum Security Penitentiary ("Oz") with a chance for [[parole]] after four.

Beecher's personal transformation forms a major part of the show's drama. Arriving in Oz without any street skills and having a naturally timid personality, he becomes an easy target for abuse and is hardened by his experiences. He later remarks that, in Oz, he "became the man he always was and never knew". Despite having done terrible things while in Oz, Beecher often tries to atone.

===Season 1===
Beecher quickly learns that he is out of his element when he witnesses fellow arrival [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]] getting [[shank (weapon)|shanked]] right before entering Cell Block E, or "[[Emerald City]]." He is roomed with monstrous inmate [[Simon Adebisi]] during his first week in the titular facility. Approaching him in friendship, fellow inmate [[Vernon Schillinger]] offers to be his new cellmate. Beecher, completely unaware that Schillinger is the leader of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], naively accepts the offer, only to be "initiated" into prison life when Schillinger [[rape]]s him and burns a [[swastika]] onto his right buttock. Beecher is routinely abused as the Brotherhood's [[sex slave]], or "prag". In attempting to deal with the trauma, Beecher starts using [[heroin]] and develops an addiction. This is quickly noticed by prison psychologist [[Sister Peter Marie Reimondo]], who arranges for Beecher to attend group drug counseling.

In preparation for a prison talent show, Schillinger has Beecher get a "makeover" from one of Em City's [[drag queen]]s. At the show, Beecher sings a rendition of "[[I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)]]" while dressed in women's clothing and makeup. Among other tortures, Schillinger makes Beecher beg to have sex with his wife before a [[conjugal visit]], forces him to eat pages of a law book, polish Schillinger's boots with his tongue, and orders him to tear up pictures of his family. In an attempt to reach him, Sister Pete arranges for Beecher to meet with the mother of his DUI victim. Beecher is too ashamed to speak, however, and the girl's mother angrily lashes out at him.

Eventually, Schillinger tires of Beecher and forces him to leave the cell wearing a [[Confederate Flag]] t-shirt. Beecher, fearing he will be killed by a black inmate, goes to [[Irish-American]] inmate [[Ryan O'Reily]], who provides him with [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. Beecher then seeks out Schillinger, smashes the acrylic glass wall of his cell, and sends a broken shard flying into his eye. Beecher almost commits suicide immediately afterward, but is restrained by guards and put in [[solitary confinement]]. After being released, he confronts Schillinger in the prison gym's basketball court. He assaults Schillinger, ties him down, then [[defecate]]s upon him in front of other inmates. This earns him respect from inmates such as O'Reily, Alvarez, and even Adebisi. When a riot erupts in Em City, Beecher sides with O'Reily in the chaos, defending him from an attack by the [[Muslim]]s, as neither belongs to any strong gangs.

===Season 2===
Beecher shares a cell with [[James Robson (Oz)|James Robson]], an Aryan who tries to make Beecher perform [[oral sex]] on him. Beecher bites off the tip of Robson's [[penis]], landing him in solitary. There, he is interviewed by [[Alvah Case]], who is investigating the riot. Upon his release from isolation, Beecher threatens to manipulate Sister Pete's psychiatric reports to ruin Schillinger's chances at [[parole]]. Frightened, Schillinger tries to put a [[contract killing|hit]] on Beecher. He resorts to [[blackmail]]ing [[corrections officer]] [[Diane Whittlesey]] with knowledge that she had shot prisoner [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]] during the riot. Whittlesey reluctantly agrees to the hit if Schillinger will keep quiet. Beecher disappears and Schillinger subsequently meets with Whittlesey to see his dead body. Whittlesey reveals that she recorded their conversation. Schillinger is arrested for [[conspiracy to commit murder]], lengthening his sentence.

Despite Beecher's celebratory mood, his new cellmate, [[Augustus Hill]], warns him that Schillinger will be out for revenge. McManus also forces Beecher to confront the judge who sentenced him; she expresses remorse for her ruling and apologizes to him. Beecher responds that she was right in her ruling, but adds that he can't forgive her. After Hill is transferred to a different cell, Beecher is paired with [[Chris Keller]], a charming [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. Later, Beecher receives word that his wife has killed herself; Schillinger brags that the Aryans actually killed her and staged the death as a suicide. Beecher gradually finds he is attracted to Keller, only to learn that Keller is working with Schillinger. After driving Beecher to start drinking again, the two corner him with the help of an Aryan guard, [[Karl Metzger]], and break his arms and legs.

===Season 3===
Keller discovers that he has genuinely fallen in love with Beecher, and is desperate to win back his trust. However, Beecher refuses to forgive him. Beecher then kills Metzger by sharpening his fingernails and slashing his throat. Later, Beecher stabs Keller shortly after his release from the infirmary. When Schillinger's son [[Andy Schillinger|Andy]] is sent to Oz, Beecher befriends the young man and arranges to share a cell with him. While Beecher does not mistreat Andy, he leads Schillinger to believe that he is going to sleep with him. Moved by Beecher's kindness, Andy renounces his father and his [[white supremacist]] ideology. Schillinger arranges to have his own son killed, having him thrown in solitary and getting a prison guard to deliver heroin on which he overdoses. Beecher feels guilty for his part in Andy's death and, following advice from Muslim leader [[Kareem Saïd]], resolves to beg forgiveness from Keller and Schillinger. Beecher finally forgives Keller after saving him from Schillinger's attack and the two reunite as lovers.

===Season 4===

====Part I====
Beecher tries to bury the hatchet with Schillinger further by having a private investigator at his father's law firm search for his younger son [[Hank Schillinger|Hank]]. However, Schillinger thinks Beecher was trying to turn Hank against him and orders his son to kidnap Beecher's children. Hank severs the hand of Beecher's son and mails it to him in Oz. Hank kills Beecher's son before ultimately releasing his daughter. Schillinger also pays another prisoner to tell Beecher that Keller is responsible for the kidnapping. Enraged, Beecher tries to kill Keller. When Beecher learns the truth, he tries to apologize to Keller, but Keller casts him aside. Upon learning that Hank has been [[acquitted]] due to a [[legal technicality]], he approaches [[Chucky Pancamo]] in order to commission a hit. Beecher has second thoughts and tries to cancel the hit, only to learn that Hank is already dead.

====Part II====
When Schillinger learns of Hank's death, he plots revenge — all chance of which is lost after Keller falsely confesses to having hired the hitman. Keller does so to make himself Schillinger's target instead of Beecher, and is transferred to [[Massachusetts]] not long afterwards. Beecher and Schillinger then are involved in a victim-attacker interaction program led by Sister Pete, who is trying to help Beecher fight his inner conflicts. With Keller in Massachusetts for confessing to Hank's murder, Beecher is up for [[parole]] and falls in love with his attorney, Katherine McClain. McClain does what she can for Beecher, but he is denied parole. Later that day in the library, Schillinger and Robson come by to taunt Beecher. Before they can harm him, Saïd appears and stabs them both.

===Season 5===
Fearing a war between the Aryans and Muslims, Sister Pete suggests Beecher act as a mediator between Schillinger and Saïd. In the first mediation, Beecher says that Saïd and Schillinger are very alike despite drastic differences in beliefs. Pancamo informs Beecher that [[Agent Pierce Taylor]] has implicated him in Hank's murder, and will likely inform Schillinger that Pancamo arranged the hit of his son. Shortly after, Keller is transferred back to Oz and, now suspected of a series of murders, is isolated from the general population and Beecher. During another mediation in which [[homosexuality]] is discussed, Beecher attacks Schillinger when he denies ever raping him. Afterwards, convicted rapists [[Franklin Winthrop]] and [[Adam Guenzel]] arrive in Oz, the latter being a friend of Beecher's family. Beecher, fearing for Guenzel's safety, recruits the Italians to protect him. Schillinger forces Winthrop, now a prag for the Aryans, to tell the [[homophobia|homophobic]] Guenzel about Beecher's past relationships with men and spread false rumors about the pair.

Schillinger offers to let Beecher reunite with Keller if he convinces McManus to transfer Guenzel to a cell block where the Italians won't protect him. Beecher initially refuses, but gives in when Guenzel assaults and humiliates Beecher. Beecher later finds a bloodied Guenzel in the gym following his [[gang rape]] by the Aryans. Saïd counsels a guilt-stricken Beecher to give up his relationship with Keller and help Guenzel any way he can. Beecher asks Sister Pete to talk to Guenzel and Schillinger; afraid that Guenzel will eventually inform on the Aryans, Schillinger arranges for Guenzel to die during a staged escape attempt. Beecher tells the authorities about Schillinger's rapes of Winthrop and Guenzel and his involvement with Guenzel's death. [[Prison warden|Warden]] [[Leo Glynn]] moves Schillinger to solitary. Beecher sees Keller, who has just been found guilty of murder, and the two share an intimate kiss.

===Season 6===
Beecher is transferred to a safer unit, as McManus sees that he is being targeted by the Aryans for testifying against Schillinger. Beecher's father, Harrison, appeals Keller's [[death sentence]] until Winthrop kills him to join the Aryans. Beecher is paroled, inherits his father's law firm, and gets Keller's sentence overturned. However, Beecher is sent back to prison after a lonely Keller arranges for him to get caught buying drugs. Upon returning to Oz, Beecher severs ties with Keller. In an attempt to make Beecher forgive him, Keller switches a [[Theatrical property|prop]] knife for a real one before a prison production of ''[[Macbeth]]'', resulting in Schillinger's death when Beecher stabs him. When Beecher rejects Keller for the final time, Keller throws himself backwards over a railing while screaming "Beecher, DON'T!", both committing suicide and implicating Beecher as his killer. At the end of the series, Beecher awaits trial for Keller's death.

'''Thomas Starr''' (1813–1890) was a [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] in the American West, who was declared an outlaw by his tribe in an internal conflict over treaties with the United States government.  He was also involved in running whiskey into Indian Territory and rustling stock.  Starr was the grandfather of [[Henry Starr]] and father in-law to [[Belle Starr]], through her marriage to Sam Starr. 
 
Starr's father was James Starr, a Cherokee leader and a signer of the [[Treaty of New Echota]] in December 1835.  This treaty had a large impact on the unity and well being of the Cherokee Nation, and many tribal members disagreed with its signing.  James Starr was targeted for assassination by Cherokee opposing the treaty, followers of the anti-Removal National Party led by [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], and on more than one occasion narrowly escaped death.

A violent series of confrontations eventually led to a Cherokee civil war.  Treaty supporters, including the Starr family, James Starr and his six sons, opposed the Ross faction.  In retaliation for the attempts on his father's life, Tom Starr became a guerrilla leader in civil war activities.  He was accused of attacking and murdering Ross supporter and trader, Benjamin Vore, and his family, at their home near Fort Gibson in 1843.  In November 1845, James Starr and his son Buck were attacked at their home by thirty-two armed men and both were killed.  Tom Starr witnessed the event but escaped and vowed to avenge the life of his father.  The Ross faction of the Cherokee Nation placed a price on Starr's head, and declared him and his surviving brothers outlaw.  At least 34 politically related murders were committed among the Cherokee in 1845 and 1846.

The internal Cherokee conflict ended with a formal truce in 1846.  The resulting peace treaty between the two factions included a special clause pardoning citizens of the Cherokee Nation for offenses and crimes, and this pardon was extended to Tom Starr.  Starr settled land in the southern portion of the Canadian District of the Cherokee Nation, near present-day Briartown, [[Oklahoma]]. The Starr brothers and their extended family used the base for a series of crimes, including arson and the theft of cattle, horses and supplies.  Starr was alleged to have killed 100 men throughout his lifetime, although the figure is probably exaggerated.  Starr also served in [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces during the American Civil War as a scout for General [[Stand Watie]] and was acquainted with [[William Clark Quantrill]].

'''Vic Tandy''' (1955 – 23 July 2005) was a British lecturer for information technology at [[Coventry University]] in Warwickshire and an engineer. He was known best for his research into the relationship between [[Infrasound#Suggested relationship to ghost sightings|infrasound]] and [[Apparitional experience|ghostly apparitions]].

During 2001 Tandy was asked to investigate the cellar of [[Coventry]]'s Tourist Information Centre&lt;ref name="personal"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/pioneering-ghost-hunter-vic-dies-3133806 |title=Pioneering Ghost Hunter Vic Dies |last=Cotterill |first=Helen |date=26 April 2013 |work=Coventry Evening Telegraph |agency=Coventry Live |orig-year=28 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frequency1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/GHOSTBUSTER%3b+Researcher+reveals+the+science+behind+our+haunted...-a098607424 |title=GHOSTBUSTER: Researcher reveals the science behind our haunted terrors |last=Dudman |first=Simon |date=11 March 2003 |work=Coventry Evening Telegraph |via=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 he was part of a research group looking for [[paranormal]] activity in [[Warwick Castle]].&lt;ref name="warwick"&gt;{{cite news|title = Bid to find Evidence of Ghosts at Castle|work = Coventry Evening Telegraph|date = 2 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases he found high levels of [[infrasound]] present.&lt;ref name="warwick"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Vic's Theory on Eerie in TV Spotlight |last=Wilson |first=Lucy  |date=2 November 2000 |work=Coventry Evening Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tandy also conducted large-scaled experiments including one experiment on 750 participants at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]].&lt;ref name="personal" /&gt;

Tandy also wrote a computer column for the newspaper ''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name="personal" /&gt; He was also an associate member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Boffin's Pocket Tool for Spooks|work = Coventry Evening Telegraph|date = 16 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leamington and Warwick Magic Society==

Vic Tandy had an interest in traditional conjuring skills and tricks used by stage magicians. He believed this type of knowledge allowed him to detect hoaxes. He was at the time of his death a fully paid member of the ''Leamington and Warwick Magic Society''.&lt;ref name="LAWN"&gt;Leamington and Warwick Magic Society archives (bulletin no 57)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with infrasound==

During the early 1980s Tandy was working in a research laboratory for a medical manufacturing company, when, in his own words: "I was sweating but cold, and the feeling of depression was noticeable – but there was also something else. It was as though something was in the room with me."&lt;ref name="research1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ottowa"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Science finds reasons for ghostly 'hauntings': Ultra-low sound waves blamed for visions, feelings of terror |last=Matthews |first=Robert  |date=29 June 1998 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tandy then claimed to have seen a spirit emerging in his peripheral vision, but when he turned to face the figure, it vanished.&lt;ref name="ottowa" /&gt;
