'''8K resolution''' refers to any screen or display with around 8000 pixels width. '''8K UHD''' is the current highest [[ultra high definition television]] (UHDTV) resolution in [[digital television]] and [[digital cinematography]]. 8K in 8K UHD refers to the horizontal [[display resolution|resolution]] of 7,680 pixels, forming the total image dimensions of (7680×4320), also known as 4320p, which refers to the vertical resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/hometheaterglossary/g/8k-Resolution-Definition-And-Explanation.htm |title=8K Resolution - Definition and Explanation of 8K Video Resolution |author= Robert Silva |publisher=About.com |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

8K UHD has twice as many horizontal and twice as many vertical pixels as [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K UHD]], as well as four times the linear resolution of [[1080p]] (Full HD), and six times the linear resolution of [[720p]].

High-resolution displays such as 8K allow for each pixel to be indistinguishable to the human eye when viewed at a typical distance from the screen. 8K resolution can also be used for the purpose of creating enhanced lower resolution videos through a combination of [[Cropping (image)|cropping]] techniques and/or with [[Decimation (signal processing)|downsampling]]&lt;ref name="NHK Has Finally Shrunk Their 8K Resolution Camera, but How Close Are We to Shooting in 8K?" /&gt; techniques used in [[film editing|video and film editing]]. Resolutions such as 8K allows filmmakers to shoot in a high resolution with a wide lens or at a further distance, in the case of potentially dangerous subjects (such as in wildlife documentaries), by being able to zoom and crop digitally in [[post-production]]. The technique involves taking a portion of the original 8K image and cropping it to match a smaller resolution such as the current industry standard for [[high-definition television]]s ([[4K resolution|4K]], [[1080p]], and [[720p]]).&lt;ref name="The power of 4K resolution and how to make it work for you creatively"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloom|first=Phillip|title=From Chicago to the Moon: The power of 4K resolution and how to make it work for you creatively|url=http://philipbloom.net/2013/10/25/moonchicago/|accessdate=April 3, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328022059/http://philipbloom.net/2013/10/25/moonchicago/|archivedate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

8K [[display resolution]] is the successor to [[4K resolution|4K]] resolution. TV manufacturers pushed to make [[4K resolution|4K]] a new standard by 2017.&lt;ref name="Toshiba suggests 4K TVs will be mainstream by 2017"&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Luke|title=Toshiba suggests 4K TVs will be mainstream by 2017|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/toshiba-suggests-4k-tvs-will-be-mainstream-by-2017|publisher=Trusted Reviews|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feasibility of a fast transition to this new standard is questionable in view of the absence of broadcasting resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/why-you-dont-need-a-4k-tv/ |title=Why You Don't Need a 4K TV |author=Roy Furchgott |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2018}}, few cameras had the capability to shoot video in 8K, with [[Japan Broadcasting Corporation|NHK]] being one of the only companies to have created a small broadcasting camera with an 8K [[image sensor]].&lt;ref name="NHK Has Finally Shrunk Their 8K Resolution Camera, but How Close Are We to Shooting in 8K?"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marine|first=Joe|title=NHK Has Finally Shrunk Their 8K Resolution Camera, but How Close Are We to Shooting in 8K?|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2012/05/nhk-finally-shrunk-8k-camera-data-rates/|publisher=No Film School|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018 [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company]] had delivered three 8K cameras in both a Full Frame sensor and Super 35 sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redsharknews.com/production/item/3862-red%E2%80%99s-radical-helium-s35-8k-sensor-the-story-so-far|title=RedShark News - RED’s radical Helium S35 8K sensor: the story so far|first=RedShark News|last=Staff|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until major content sources are available, 8K is speculated to become a mainstream consumer display resolution around 2023 as mentioned in UHD forum Phase-B recommendations. Despite this, 
filmmakers are pushing demand for 8K cameras due to their ability to capture better 4K footage.

==History==

[[File:NHKHitachi8Kcamerademo.JPG|thumb|[[NHK]] and [[Hitachi]] demonstrating their 8K camera at the 2013 [[NAB Show]]]]

Japan's public broadcaster [[NHK]] was the first to start research and development of 4320p resolution in 1995. The format was standardized by [[SMPTE]] in October 2007, Interface standardized by SMPTE in August 2010 and Recommended as the international standard for television by lTU-R in 2012. Followed by public displays at electronics shows and screenings of [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi and public viewings in February 2014 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil in June 2014 using HEVC with partners AstroDesign and Ikegami Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The history of Super Hi-Vision|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/8k/history/index_e.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812052859/http://www.nhk.or.jp/8k/history/index_e.html|archivedate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's First Hand-Held 8K Ultra High Definition Television Camera System, Developed in Collaboration with Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) (Press Release)|url=http://www.ikegami.com/NAB2015_shk810_piece_.html|publisher=Ikegami|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822030932/http://ikegami.com/NAB2015_shk810_piece_.html|archivedate=2016-08-22|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=8K (SHV) Ultra High Resolution/High Definition Imaging|url=http://www.astrodesign.co.jp/english/product/8k-info|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403003535/http://www.astrodesign.co.jp/english/product/8k-info|archivedate=2016-04-03|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2015, the MHL Consortium announced the release of the [[superMHL]] specification which will support 8K resolution at 120 fps, 48-bit video, the [[Rec. 2020]] color space, high dynamic range support, a 32-pin reversible superMHL connector, and power charging of up to 40 watts.&lt;ref name=superMHLJanuary2015Yahoo&gt;{{cite news |title=MHL Consortium Announces superMHL – the First Audio/Video Specification With Support Up to 8K |publisher=[[Yahoo Finance]] |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mhl-consortium-announces-supermhl-first-180000697.html |date=January 6, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020182427/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mhl-consortium-announces-supermhl-first-180000697.html |archivedate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=superMHLJanuary2015Anandtech&gt;{{cite news |title=MHL Consortium Announces superMHL: New Standard &amp; New Cable To Drive 8K TV |author=Ryan Smith |publisher=[[AnandTech]] |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8843/mhl-consortium-announces-supermhl-new-standard-new-cable-to-drive-8k-tv |date=January 6, 2015 |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=superMHLJanuary2015MHL&gt;{{cite news |title=Introducing superMHL |publisher=MHL |url=http://www.mhlconsortium.org/technology.aspx |accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 2016, The Video Electronics Standards Association ([[VESA]]) unveiled [[DisplayPort]] 1.4, a new format that lets the use of 8K resolution (7680×4320) at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz with [[High-dynamic-range rendering|HDRR]] and 32 audio channels through USB-C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.displayport.org/pr/vesa-publishes-displayport-standard-version-1-4/|title=VESA Publishes DisplayPort™ Standard Version 1.4 - DisplayPort|website=DisplayPort|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2017, the HDMI Forum announced [[HDMI]] 2.1 featuring support for 8k video with HDR, will be "released early in Q2 2017".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_2_1/index.aspx|title=Introducing HDMI 2.1 Specification|website=HDMI|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First cameras===
On April 6, 2013, Astrodesign Inc. announced the AH-4800, capable of recording 8K resolution.
In April 2015 it was announced by Red that their newly unveiled Red Weapon VV is also capable of recording 8K footage. 
In October 2016 they announced two additional 8K cameras, Red Weapon 8K S35 and Red Epic-W 8K S35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.red.com/news/introducing-epic-w-and-weapon-8k|title=Introducing the RED EPIC-W And New WEAPON Cameras|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Weapon Dragon VV has been discontinued {{as of|2017|October|7|lc=y|df=US}}, when Red unveiled the Red Weapon Monstro VV, their fourth camera capable of shooting 8K, with additional improvements in dynamic range and noise reduction, among other features.

===Productions===
In 2007, the original 65&amp;nbsp;mm negative of the 1992 film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' was re-scanned at 8K with a [[Motion picture film scanner|film scanner]] built specifically for the job at [[FotoKem|FotoKem Laboratories]], and used to remaster the 2008 [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the Blu-ray release as "the finest video disc I have ever viewed or ever imagined."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Blu-rayDefinition.com (June 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Grover Crisp, executive VP of restoration at Sony Pictures, the new 8K scan has such high resolution that when examined, showed a series of fine concentric lines in a pattern "reminiscent of a fingerprint" near the top of the frame. This was caused by the film emulsion melting and cracking in the desert heat during production. Sony had to hire a third party to minimise or eliminate the rippling artifacts in the new restored version.&lt;ref name="HT4kWay"/&gt;

On May 17, 2013, the [[Franklin Institute]] premiered ''To Space and Back'', an 8K×8K, 60&amp;nbsp;[[Frame rate|fps]], 3D video running approximately 25&amp;nbsp;minutes. During its first run at the Fels Planetarium it was played at 4K, 60&amp;nbsp;fps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phillytrib.com/metros/metros-west-south-southwest/to-space-back-latest-planetarium-feature/article_ff43b652-f60d-5198-acde-c3bdecab05d4.html|work=Philadelphia Tribune |title='To Space &amp;amp; Back' latest Planetarium feature|accessdate=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, NHK screened the experimental-drama short film "The Chorus" at Tokyo Film Festival which was filmed in 8k and 22.2 sound format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/77202-introducing-8k-the-final-frontier/#.V7qGOmWO7Vo|title=Introducing 8K: The Final Frontier? {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|last=Aftab|first=Kaleem|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2015, an 8K abstract computer animation was screened at the Filmatic Festival at the University of California, San Diego. The work was created as an assignment in the VIS 40/ICAM 40 Introduction to Computing in the Arts class taught at UCSD by Associate Teaching Professor Brett Stalbaum during the winter quarter of 2015, with each student producing 300 8192×4800 pixel frames.

The '''ANS synthesizer''' is a [[optoelectronics|photoelectronic]] musical instrument created by Russian engineer [[Evgeny Murzin]] from 1937 to 1957. The technological basis of his invention was the method of [[graphical sound]] recording used in [[cinematography]] (developed in Russia concurrently with USA), which made it possible to obtain a visible image of a [[sound wave]], as well as to realize the opposite goal&amp;mdash;[[sound synthesis|synthesizing a sound]] from an artificially [[drawn sound|drawn sound spectrogram]].

In this case the [[sine wave]]s generated by the ANS are printed onto five [[optical disc|glass discs]] using a process that Murzin (an optical engineer) had to develop himself. Each disc has 144 individual tracks printed onto it, for a total of 720 [[microtone]]s (discrete [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es), spanning 10 octaves. This yields a resolution of 1/72 [[octave]] (16.67 cents). The modulated light from these wheels is then projected onto the back of the synthesizer's interface. These are arranged in a continuous swath vertically, with low frequencies at the bottom and high frequencies at the top.

[[Image:ANS synthesizer's music score example, scratched on a glass plate covered with black mastic (clip).jpg|thumb|120px|An example of score on glass plate]]

The user interface consists of a glass plate covered in non-drying opaque black [[Mastic (plant resin)|mastic]], which constitutes a drawing surface upon which the user makes marks by scratching through the mastic, and therefore allowing light to pass through at that point. In front of the glass plate sits a vertical bank of twenty [[photocell]]s that send signals to twenty [[amplifier]]s and [[bandpass filter]]s, each with its own [[gain adjust control]]. It is akin to a ten-octave [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] with two knobs per octave. The ANS is fully [[polyphonic]] and will generate all 720 pitches simultaneously if required (a vertical scratch would accomplish this).

The glass plate can then be [[image scanner|scanned]] left or right in front of the photocell bank in order to transcribe the drawing directly into pitches. In other words, it plays what one has drawn, similar to how a [[Sheet music|score]] is written. This process can be aided with a gear-motor drive (similar to an engineering [[lathe]]) or it can be moved manually. The scan speed is adjustable down to zero. The speed at which the score scans has no relation to pitch but serves only as a means of controlling [[duration (music)|duration]].

Murzin named his invention in honour of the composer [[Alexander Scriabin|Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin]] (ANS): Scriabin (1872&amp;ndash;1915) was an occultist, [[theosophist]], and early exponent of [[Alexander Scriabin#Philosophical influences and influence of colour|color-sound theories]] in composition. The synthesizer was housed in the electronic-music studio situated above the Scriabin Museum (just off of the [[Arbat District|Arbat]] in central Moscow) before moving to the basement of the [[Moscow Conservatory|central university]] on the corner of [[Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street|Bolshaya Nikitskaya]]. It was saved from the scrapheap thanks to Stanislav Kreichi, who persuaded the university to look after it.

The ANS was used by [[Stanislav Kreichi]], [[Alfred Schnittke]], [[Edison Denisov]], [[Sofia Gubaidulina]], and other Soviet composers. [[Edward Artemiev]] wrote many of his scores of the movies of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] with the help of the ANS. Of particular note is Artemiev's score of Tarkovsky's ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in which the ANS was used to abstract, sci-fi effect akin to [[ambient music]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:ANS synthesizer.jpg|thumb|130px|PC power supplies have replaced the old ones (February 2006)]]
After several years at the [[Theremin Center]], the ANS (there is only one&amp;mdash;the original was destroyed and this is the improved version) is now located in the [[Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture]] in [[Moscow]].

==Recordings==
An album of works by the composers mentioned above, called "Musical Offering" was released on [[Melodiya]] (C60 30721 000) in 1990&amp;mdash;although the recordings date from the 1960s and 1970s. Recordings by Stanislav Kreichi&amp;mdash;"Ansiana" and "Voices and Movement"&amp;mdash;as well as earlier works ("Electroshock Presents: Electroacoustic Music") that used the synthesizer are available on [[Electroshock Records]]. A soundtrack of the film ''Into Space'' (1961) in collaboration with Edward Artimiev remains unreleased. In 2002, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a program about the ANS by Isobel Clouter as part of her ''Soundhunter'' series. In 2004, the British experimental group [[Coil (band)|Coil]] released ''[[ANS (box)|CoilANS]]'', a boxed set of experimental [[drone music]] performed on the ANS. The Norwegian artist [[Zweizz]] released a cassette in 2007 on which side B is made entirely out of ANS recordings.&lt;ref name="Zweizz ESR085"&gt;

The '''American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen (AUDAC)''' was an American society of designers and decorative artists that was active from 1928 until the early 1930s. The group aimed to bring modern principles of design, such as those promoted in Europe by the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] and the [[Bauhaus]], to decorative arts in the United States.

==History==

The modernist furniture designer [[Paul T. Frankl]] immigrated from Vienna to New York in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Wilson|last=Wilson|first=Richard Guy|chapter=Art Deco in the USA |title=Grove Art Online|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T2283819 |accessdate=2018-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked to establish Europe's flourishing principles of contemporary design in the United States by writing books such as ''New Dimensions: The Decorative Arts of Today'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Frankl| first=Paul Theodore |date=1028 |title=New Dimensions: The Decorative Arts of Today in Words and Pictures |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-dimensions-the-decorative-arts-of-today-in-words-pictures/oclc/299341249 | publisher=New York, Payson Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by establishing a collective of fellow designers called the American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen (AUDAC) in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Wilson|last=Wilson|first=Richard Guy|chapter=Art Deco in the USA |title=Grove Art Online|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press
 |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T2283819 |accessdate=2018-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early members included designers who exhibited at the American Designers' Gallery, which showed interiors and furnishings designed by contemporary New York designers, such as [[Donald Deskey]] and [[Ilonka Karasz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dsgn2/hd_dsgn2.htm
 |author=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |year=2018|title=Design, 1925-50|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUDAC was modeled on European decorative arts societies such as the [[Société des Artistes Décorateurs]] in France. They published books on the new American design such as ''Modern American Design''&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author=American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen, Robert L. Leonard, and C. Adolph Glassgold|title=Modern American Design
 |date=1933|publisher=New York, Ives Washburn|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/modern-american-design/oclc/1251649}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Annual of American Design''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen|title=Annual of American Design
 |date=1931|publisher=New York, Ives Washburn|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/annual-of-american-design-1931/oclc/1251637}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put together influential exhibitions of their members' work, including one at the Brooklyn Museum in 1931 which showed work by [[Russel Wright]], [[Ruth Reeves]], and [[Rockwell Kent]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |last1=Susswein |first1=Rita |last2=Whitehead |first2=Philip |date=1931 |title=The AUDAC Exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum |jstor=770529 |journal=Parnassus |volume= 3 |issue= 5 |pages=14–15 |doi=10.2307/770529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was well known by the early 1930s when [[Radio City Music Hall]] commissioned [[Donald Deskey]] and other AUDAC members to design the fabrics, textiles, and furnishings for the interior.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web| url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0995.pdf | author=New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission | date=1978 | title=RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL| access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members (see list below) went on long careers and well-known places in the history of twentieth-century design. However, due to the 1930s economic depression, the formal association was defunct by 1934.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last=Woodham | first=Jonathan M. |title=A Dictionary of Modern Design |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800978.001.0001/acref-9780192800978-e-28

==Mission==

AUDAC placed an ad in a supplement for the magazine ''Creative Art'' in March 1930&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite web| url=https://socalarchhistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/ | title=Foundations of Los Angeles Modernism: Richard Neutra's Mod Squad |publisher=Southern California Architectural History |last=Crosse |first=John |date=2010|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; which listed contact information for many of its members and described the mission of the American Union of Decorative Artists and Craftsmen thus:

{{Quote
|text=AUDAC stands convinced that contemporary life demands an appropriate setting and that it is the work of the artist of all ages to mould the external world to suit the life of his time.

AUDAC realizes that the cultural contribution of an era is as clearly reflected in the decorative as in the other arts.

AUDAC was founded to give these convictions organized aid and voice.

AUDAC stands for:
The advancement of the new tendencies in the decorative, industrial and applied arts. 
The elevation of standards in contemporary design.
The development of STYLE rather than styles.

'''Architectural engineer (PE)''' is a [[professional engineering]] designation in the [[United States]]. The architectural engineer applies the knowledge and skills of broader [[engineering]] disciplines to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and renovation of buildings and their component systems while paying careful attention to their effects on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asce.org/architectural-engineering/architectural-engineering-institute/&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of a specific "Architectural Engineering" [[NCEES]] [[professional engineering]] registration examination in the 1990s and first offering in April 2003,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncees.org&lt;/ref&gt; architectural engineering is now recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States.

Note that in the United States "architectural engineering technology" is different from architectural engineering;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abet.org&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States architectural engineering technologists tend to be drafters or assistants for the design and construction process, while in Europe, Canada, South Africa and other countries [[Architectural technologists]] have a role similar to [[Architects]] and Architectural Engineers.

==Areas of focus==
* [[Architecture]] (if licensed as an [[Architect]])
* [[Structural engineering]]
* [[Construction engineering]]
* [[Construction management]]
* [[Project management]]
* [[Green building]]
* [[Heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC)
* [[Plumbing]] and [[piping]] ([[hydronics]])
* [[Energy management]]
* [[Fire protection engineering]]
* Building power systems
* [[Lighting]]
* [[Building transportation systems]]
* [[Acoustics]], [[noise]] &amp; [[vibration]] control

A common combined specialization is ''[[Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing]]'', better known by its abbreviation '''MEP'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/3688.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  An MEP design engineer has experience in HVAC, lighting/electrical, and plumbing systems' analysis and design.

==Some topics of special interest==
* [[Building construction]]
* [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM)
* [[Efficient energy use]], [[Energy conservation]] or [[Energy demand management]]

'''''Big Brutus''''' is the nickname of the [[Bucyrus-Erie]] model 1850-B electric [[Power shovel|shovel]], which was the second largest of its type in operation in the 1960s and 1970s. Big Brutus is the centerpiece of a mining museum in [[West Mineral, Kansas]] where it was used in coal [[strip mining]] operations. The shovel was designed to dig from {{convert|20|to|69|ft|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5504.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703023704/http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5504.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; down to unearth relatively shallow coal seams, which would themselves be mined with smaller equipment.

==Description==
Fabrication of Big Brutus was completed in May 1963, after which it was shipped in 150 railroad cars to be assembled in Kansas.  It operated until 1974, when it became uneconomical to mine coal at the site.  At that time it was considered too big to move and was left in place.

Big Brutus, while not the largest electric shovel ever built, is the largest electric shovel still in existence. [[Marion 6360|The Captain]], at 28 million pounds &amp;ndash; triple that of Big Brutus &amp;ndash; was the largest shovel and one of the largest land-based mobile machines ever built, only exceeded by some [[dragline excavator|dragline]] and [[bucket-wheel excavator]]s. It was scrapped in 1992, after receiving extreme damage from an hours-long internal fire.&lt;ref name="col"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haddock|first=Keith|title=Colossal Earthmovers|publisher=MBI|date=September 18, 2000|pages=67|isbn=978-0-7603-0771-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
The Pittsburg &amp; Midway Coal Mining Company donated Big Brutus in 1984 as the core of a mining museum which opened in 1985.  In 1987, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] designated Big Brutus a Regional Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbrutus.org/about.html|title=About Big Brutus|publisher=Big Brutus, Inc.|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2018.

The museum offers tours and camping.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">[[File:Bleekveld.jpg|thumb|''Bleekveld in een dorp'' (''Bleachfield in a village''), circa 1650 ([[Jan Brueghel the Younger]])]]

A '''bleachfield''' or '''bleaching green''' was an open area used for spreading cloth on the ground to be purified and whitened by the action of the [[sunlight]].&lt;ref name="Cotton"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Cotton Industry|last=Aspin|first=Chris|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|date=1981|isbn=0-85263-545-1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleaching fields were usually found in and around [[mill town]]s in Great Britain and were an integral part of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]].

When cloth-making was still a home-based occupation, the bleachfields could be found on Scottish [[Croft (land)|crofts]] and English farm [[Field (agriculture)|fields]]. Just as wool needed [[fulling]] and flax needed [[retting]], so did the semi-finished fabrics need space and time outdoors to bleach. In the 18th century there were many [[linen]] bleachfields in Scotland, particularly in [[Perthshire]], [[Renfrewshire (historic)|Renfrewshire]] in the [[Scottish Lowlands]], and the outskirts of [[City of Glasgow|Glasgow]]. By the 1760s, linen manufacture became a major industry in Scotland, second only to agriculture. For instance, in 1782 alone, Perthshire produced 1.7 million yards of linen, worth £81,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|81000|1782|r=-3}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waterston|2008|pp=27–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleachfields were also common in [[northern England]]; for instance, the name of the town of [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]], on the outskirts of Manchester, is thought to derive from the medieval bleachfields used by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers.&lt;ref name="Wilsonp1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bleachfields became redundant after [[Charles Tennant]] developed a [[bleaching powder]] based on [[chlorine]], which permitted year-round processing of fabric indoors,&lt;ref&gt;Page 21 of ''Bleachfields of Perth'' by John McKay 978-1-873891-91-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotton"/&gt; but many of the factories continued to be called bleachfields.

A bleachfield is similar to, but should not be confused with, a [[tenterground]]. Bleachfields were a popular subject for Dutch painters in the 17th century. One of the [[stained glass]] windows made by Stephen Adam for the [[Maryhill]] Burgh Halls in 1878, shows linen bleachers at work.

'''Carfax, Inc.''' is a commercial web-based service that supplies [[vehicle history report]]s to individuals and businesses on [[used car]]s and [[light trucks]] for the [[United States|American]] and [[Canadians|Canadian]] consumers.

==History==
In 1984 Carfax was founded in [[Columbia, Missouri]], by a computer professional named Ewin Barnett III working together with Robert Daniel Clark, an accountant from [[Huntingdon, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2006/10/carfax_history.html Consumer Affairs.com News, October 10, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is now headquartered in Centreville, Virginia, with a data center operation in Columbia, Missouri. Barnett was initially trying to combat [[odometer fraud]]. By working closely with the [[Missouri]] Automobile Dealers Association, in 1986 he offered the early version Carfax vehicle history report to the dealer market. These reports were developed with a [[database]] of just 10,000 records and were distributed via [[fax]] machine. By the end of 1993, Carfax obtained title information from nearly all fifty states. In December 1996, the company's website was launched to offer consumers the same vehicle history reports already available to businesses. In the fall of 1999, Carfax became a wholly owned [[subsidiary]] of [[R.L. Polk &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcautos.com/carfax.html Town and Country Auto Sales website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227054147/http://www.tcautos.com/carfax.html |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[IHS Inc.|IHS]] acquired Polk  and Carfax, which added to its Automotive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.ihs.com/press-release/corporate-financial/ihs-completes-three-strategic-acquisitions]. IHS Completes Three Strategic Acquisitions.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Carfax introduced a free service to help vehicle owners keep their cars well maintained – myCARFAX. Car owners can track their service history, receive automatic service alerts and get critical information about open safety recalls reported for their car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Carfax Unveils New Car Care Mobile App – Jun 20, 2013 |url=http://news.carfax.com/2013-06-20-Carfax-Unveils-New-Car-Care-Mobile-App |website=news.carfax.com |accessdate=2015-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004161432/http://news.carfax.com/2013-06-20-Carfax-Unveils-New-Car-Care-Mobile-App |archivedate=2015-10-04 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 [[IHS Inc.|IHS]] had a merger of equals with Markit, and in July of that year became IHS Markit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/21/ihs-and-markit-to-merge-in-deal-valued-at-more-than-13b.html |title=IHS to buy data provider Markit |last=CNBC |date=2016-03-21 |website=CNBC |access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A similar company with the same name operated in New Zealand in 2007 and 2008 when they changed their name to [[Carjam Online Limited]].

== Products and services ==
Carfax offers several free products and services and charges a fee for more comprehensive reports.

===Free products and services===
In 2013, Carfax launched a new free service called myCARFAX. The service provides free access to vehicle service information reported to the company and alerts users to recommended maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.carfax.com/2013-06-20-Carfax-Unveils-New-Car-Care-Mobile-App |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004161432/http://news.carfax.com/2013-06-20-Carfax-Unveils-New-Car-Care-Mobile-App |archivedate=2015-10-04 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company offers four vehicle research services—Lemon Check, Record Check, Recall Check, and Problem Car. While these services are helpful, they do not contain all of the information provided in a full Carfax vehicle history report.

The company also provides Car Safety and Reliability Ratings, which provides access to reviews and other data from sources such as the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]], [[J.D. Power and Associates]], [[IntelliChoice]] and others.

===Vehicle history reports===
The Carfax [[Vehicle history report|Vehicle History Report]] is the company's core product. Users purchase either a single report or create an account for building multiple reports for different vehicles, allowing consumers to utilize Carfax over a period of time as they search for a vehicle. Additionally, buyers can request Carfax reports for free from auto dealers who offer Carfax service, and some automakers routinely provide Carfax reports as part of their pre-owned vehicle programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legacygt.com/forums/showthread.php?t=67083 Legacy Owners Association, "Carfax Expands Relationship with Subaru," July 27, 2007],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad-hoc-news.de/CorporateNews/en/14219612/Saturn-Selects-Carfax-for-Certified-PreOwned-Program Ad Hoc News "Saturn Selects Carfax for Certified Pre-Owned Program" November 16, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052610/http://www.ad-hoc-news.de/CorporateNews/en/14219612/Saturn-Selects-Carfax-for-Certified-PreOwned-Program |date=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===myCARFAX===

In early 2012 the company launched a new service which uses service information reported to CARFAX to help vehicle owners with things like oil changes and routine vehicle maintenance. The service was later expanded to include alerts about open safety recalls issued by vehicle manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kshb.com/money/consumer/mycarfax-free-app-makes-keeping-track-of-recalls-easy-with-your-license-plate-rather-than-vin# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001062350/http://www.kshb.com/money/consumer/mycarfax-free-app-makes-keeping-track-of-recalls-easy-with-your-license-plate-rather-than-vin# |archive-date=2015-10-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vehicle owners who are interested in having service information included on their CARFAX Vehicle History Report can find local service shops who will report them to CARFAX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autodealermonthly.com/news/story/2015/04/shiftmobility-integrates-carfax-information-into-shoplite-app.aspx |title=SHIFTMobility Integrates Carfax Information Into App |date=14 April 2015 |publisher=AutoDealer Monthly |access-date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carfax used car listings ===
In April 2014, Carfax introduced another free service called CARFAX Used Car Listings. The new service gives used car shoppers the opportunity to search for used cars using make, model, and a vehicle's history. For example, consumers may search for vehicles with "no reported accident" or "service records".

==Information sources==
Carfax claims to have access to twenty [[1,000,000,000|billion]] records &lt;ref&gt;https://www.carfax.com/press/carfax-database-hits-20-billion-records&lt;/ref&gt; from more than 100,000 sources, including motor vehicle departments for all 50 U.S. states and all 10 Canadian provinces. The company's information sources include U.S. state title and registration records, auto and salvage auctions, Canadian motor vehicle records, rental and fleet vehicle companies, consumer protection agencies, state inspection stations, extended warranty companies, insurance companies, fire and police departments, manufacturers, inspection companies, service and repair facilities, dealers and import/export companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carfax.com/about/data_sources.cfx CARFAX website/information sources]&lt;/ref&gt;

CARFAX lists only information that is reported to them and consumers should not take this report to be a complete accident history. Not all accidents are disclosed and CARFAX uses the language "no accidents have been reported to CARFAX," the emphasis being on "reported". Consumers should not rely on CARFAX alone when checking out a used vehicle.

Although Carfax continuously expands its database and resources, some information is not allowed to be provided. Under the 1994 U.S. ''[[Drivers Privacy Protection Act]]'', personal information such as names, telephone numbers and addresses of current or previous owners are neither collected nor reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessreports.com/statutes/DPPA1.htm Drivers Privacy Protection Act, 18 USC Section 2721, Public Law 103-322]&lt;/ref&gt; Carfax does not have access to every facility and mistakes are sometimes made by those who input data. In the event information is disputed but cannot be verified, Carfax allows consumers and dealerships to add information to its reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=7on_your_side&amp;id=3806247 ''ABC7-TV'' news, San Francisco, January 12, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class action lawsuit==
In a 2006 class action lawsuit, [http://www.westcarsettlement.com/ West v. Carfax, Inc.], the plaintiff claimed that Carfax violated consumer protection laws by not disclosing the limitations of their service, specifically their inability to check accident records in 23 states in the U.S. while stating that their database contains information from all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizen.org/litigation/forms/cases/CaseDetails.cfm?cID=398 West v. Carfax, Inc. and Polk Carfax, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was settled in May 2007 in the Trumbull County Common Pleas Court in [[Warren, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/automobiles/06CARF.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin It’s the Truth, but Not the Whole Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/cars/news/articles/2007/04/15/deal_in_carfax_lawsuit_draws_fire/ Deal in Carfax lawsuit draws fire]&lt;/ref&gt; Carfax spokesman [[Larry Gamache]] said more than 10 million consumers were affected. The company asserts that it has major accident information from all 50 states and it backs up its claim with a buyback guarantee. The settlement in the West v. Carfax, Inc lawsuit was overturned, not on the merits of the issue, but on the terms of the settlement which did not offer enough to the impacted consumers and because "not enough consumers were notified and the judge should not have agreed to the settlement without knowing more about what it would cost Carfax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/heavily-criticized-carfax-settlement-ruling-is-overturned/ Heavily criticized carfax settlement ruling is overturned]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huisvrouwengymnastiek.jpg|thumb|"Household gymnastics"]]

A '''carpet beater''' or '''carpetbeater ''' (also referred to as a rug beater or rugbeater, mattenklopper, carpet whip, rug whip, clothes-beater, dust beater or dustbeater, carpet duster, wicker slapper, rug duster, or pillow fluffer, and formerly also as a carpet cleaner or rug cleaner) is a [[housecleaning]] [[tool]] that was in common use until the vacuum cleaner became affordable during the early 20th century. Carpets, rugs, clothes, cushions, and bedding were hung over a clothesline or railing and the dust and dirt was beaten out of them. Typically made of wood, [[rattan]], cane, wicker, spring steel or coiled wire, antique rug beaters have become very collectible. Modern mass-production versions can also be in plastic or wire.

==Uses==
Its use in cleaning has been largely replaced since the 1950s by the [[carpet sweeper]] and then the [[vacuum cleaner]], although they are still sold in many household stores throughout [[Europe]]. In [[Germany]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bauunternehmen.com/teppichstange-im-hof-einbetoniere.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://natemat.pl/62875,joanna-mucha-chce-rozruszac-dzieci-kiedys-trzepak-dzis-komputer-i-iphone-rosnie-pokolenie-sprawnego-kciuka&lt;/ref&gt; an outdoor [[carpet hanger]] for beating is called a ''Teppichstange'' (carpet bar) or ''Klopfstange''. In [[Poland]] it is called ''trzepak'' (a noun from the word ''trzepać'', "to beat"; the beater itself is called ''trzepaczka''). In the [[Netherlands]] it is called ''mattenklopper'' (mat knocker)

Since the 1990s, it is very rare to see anyone using a trzepak for its prime function. In the newest housing developments, trzepak are rarely installed. Some people preferred to beat carpets in winter on the snow - they laid the carpet face down and beat it. This method had some advantages - for instance, insects would freeze to death even if they were not expelled through beating - but it left a dirty and unpleasant-looking patch on the snow, and therefore some communities forbade beating on the snow for aesthetic reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16884">'''Coherent control''' is a quantum mechanical based method for controlling dynamical processes by [[light]].
The basic principle is to  control quantum interference phenomena typically by shaping the phase of a [[laser]] pulses.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Robert J., and Stuart A. Rice. "Active control of the dynamics of atoms and molecules." Annual Review of Physical Chemistry 48, no. 1 (1997): 601-641.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Moshe, and Paul Brumer. "Coherent control of atomic, molecular, and electronic processes." Advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics 42 (2000): 287-345.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic ideas have proliferated finding vast application in [[spectroscopy]] 
[[mass spectra]], [[quantum information]] processing, [[laser cooling]], ultracold physics and more.

==Brief History==

The initial idea was to control the outcome of [[chemical reactions]]. Two approaches were pursued: In the time domain  a pump dump scheme where the control is the time delay between pulses
&lt;ref name="tannor"&gt;Tannor, David J., and Stuart A. Rice. "Control of selectivity of chemical reaction via control of wave packet evolution." The Journal of chemical physics 83, no. 10 (1985): 5013-5018.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="rice" &gt;Tannor, David J., Ronnie Kosloff, and Stuart A. Rice. "Coherent pulse sequence induced control of selectivity of reactions: Exact quantum mechanical calculations." The Journal of chemical physics 85, no. 10 (1986): 5805-5820.&lt;/ref&gt;
and in the frequency domain, interfering pathways controlled by one and three photons.&lt;ref name="brumer" &gt;Brumer, Paul, and Moshe Shapiro. "Control of unimolecular reactions using coherent light." Chemical Physics Letters 126, no. 6 (1986): 541-546.&lt;/ref&gt;
The two basic methods eventually merged with the introduction of [[optimal control]] theory
&lt;ref name="peirce" &gt;Peirce, Anthony P., Mohammed A. Dahleh, and Herschel Rabitz. "Optimal control of quantum-mechanical systems: Existence, numerical approximation, and applications." Physical Review A 37, no. 12 (1988): 4950.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental realisations soon followed. In the time domain &lt;ref&gt;Baumert, T., V. Engel, Ch Meier, and G. Gerber. "High laser field effects in multiphoton ionization of &lt;math&gt;Na_2&lt;/math&gt;. Experiment and quantum calculations." Chemical Physics Letters 200, no. 5 (1992): 488-494.&lt;/ref&gt;
and in the frequency domain.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, Langchi, Valeria Kleiman, Xiaonong Li, Shao Ping Lu, Karen Trentelman, and Robert J. Gordon. "Coherent laser control of the product distribution obtained in the photoexcitation of HI." SCIENCE-NEW YORK THEN WASHINGTON- (1995): 77-77.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Two interlinked developments accelerated the field of coherent control: Experimentally it was the development 
of  [[pulse shaping]] by a [[spatial light modulator]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=A.M. Weiner |url=http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~fsoptics/articles/Femtosecond_pulse_shaping-Weiner.pdf |title=Femtosecond pulse shaping using spatial light modulators |publisher=REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS VOLUME 71, NUMBER 5 MAY 2000 |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liquid Crystal Optically Addressed Spatial Light Modulator'', [http://www-optique.enst-bretagne.fr/18_LCOASLM.htm]

The second development was the idea of automatic feedback control
&lt;ref&gt;Judson, Richard S., and Herschel Rabitz. "Teaching lasers to control molecules." Physical Review Letters 68, no. 10 (1992): 1500.&lt;/ref&gt; and its experimental realization

==Controllability==

Coherent control aims to steer a quantum system from an initial state to a target state via
an external field. For given initial and final (target) states the coherent control is termed state-to-state
control. A generalisation is steering simultaneously an arbitrary set of initial pure states to an
arbitrary set of final states, i.e. controlling a [[unitary transformation]]. Such an application sets the
foundation for a quantum gate operation.&lt;ref&gt;Tesch, Carmen M., Lukas Kurtz, and Regina de Vivie-Riedle. "Applying optimal control theory for elements of quantum computation in molecular systems." Chemical Physics Letters 343, no. 5 (2001): 633-641.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palao, José P., and Ronnie Kosloff. "Quantum computing by an optimal control algorithm for unitary transformations." Physical review letters 89, no. 18 (2002): 188301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabitz, Herschel, Michael Hsieh, and Carey Rosenthal. "Landscape for optimal control of quantum-mechanical unitary transformations." Physical Review A 72, no. 5 (2005): 052337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controllability of a closed quantum system has
been addressed by Tarn and Clark.&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Garng M., Tzyh J. Tarn, and John W. Clark. "On the controllability of quantum‐mechanical systems." Journal of Mathematical Physics 24, no. 11 (1983): 2608-2618.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Their theorem based in [[control theory]] states that for a finite dimensional closed
quantum system, the system is completely controllable, i.e. an arbitrary unitary transformation
of the system can be realized by an appropriate application of the controls,&lt;ref&gt;Ramakrishna, Viswanath, Murti V. Salapaka, Mohammed Dahleh, Herschel Rabitz, and Anthony Peirce. "Controllability of molecular systems." Physical Review A 51, no. 2 (1995): 960.&lt;/ref&gt; 
if the control operators and the unperturbed Hamiltonian generate the [[Lie algebra]] of all Hermitian operators.
Complete controllability implies state-to-state controllability.

The computational task of finding a control field for a particular state to state
transformation is difficult and becomes more difficult with the increase in the size of the system.
This task is in the class of hard inversion problems of high [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]]. 
The algorithmic task of finding the
field that generates a [[unitary transformation]] scales factorially more difficult with the size of the
system. This is because a larger number of state-to-state control fields have to be found
without interfering with the other control  fields.

Once constraints are imposed controllability can be degraded. For example, what is the minimum time required to achieve a control objective
.&lt;ref&gt;Caneva, Tommaso, Michael Murphy, Tommaso Calarco, Rosario Fazio, Simone Montangero, Vittorio Giovannetti, and Giuseppe E. Santoro. "Optimal control at the quantum speed limit." Physical review letters 103, no. 24 (2009): 240501.&lt;/ref&gt; this is termed quantum speed limit.

==Constructive approach to coherent control==

The constructive approach uses a set of predetermined control fields for which the control outcome can be inferred.
The pump dump scheme &lt;ref name="tannor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rice" /&gt; in the time domain and the three vs one photon interference scheme in the frequency domain &lt;ref name="brumer" /&gt; are prime examples.
Another constructive approach is based on adiabtic ideas. 
The most well studied method is [[Stimulated raman adiabatic passage]] STIRAP &lt;ref&gt;Unanyan, R., M. Fleischhauer, B. W. Shore, and K. Bergmann. "Robust creation and phase-sensitive probing of superposition states via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) with degenerate dark states." Optics communications 155, no. 1 (1998): 144-154.&lt;/ref&gt;
which employs an auxiliary state to achieve complete state-to-state population transfer.

One of the most prolific generic pulse shapes is a [[chirp]]ed pulse a pulse with a varying frequency in time.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhman, S., and R. Kosloff. "Application of chirped ultrashort pulses for generating large-amplitude ground-state vibrational coherence: a computer simulation." JOSA B 7, no. 8 (1990): 1748-1752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cerullo, G., C. J. Bardeen, Q. Wang, and C. V. Shank. "High-power femtosecond chirped pulse excitation of molecules in solution." Chemical Physics Letters 262, no. 3 (1996): 362-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optimal control==

[[Optimal control]] as applied in coherent control seeks the optimal control field for steering a quantum system to its objective.&lt;ref name="peirce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kosloff"/&gt;  For state-to-state control the objective is defined as the maximum overlap
at the final time T with the state &lt;math&gt;|\phi_f \rangle &lt;/math&gt;: 
:&lt;math&gt;J= |\langle\psi (T)| \phi_f\rangle|^2 &lt;/math&gt; 
where the initial state is &lt;math&gt;| \phi_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.
The time dependent control Hamiltonian has the typical  form: 
:&lt;math&gt; H(t) = H_0 + \mu \cdot \epsilon(t) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \epsilon (t)&lt;/math&gt; is the control field. [[Optimal control]] solves for the optimal field &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(t)&lt;/math&gt;
using the [[calculus of variations]] introducing [[Lagrange multiplier]]s. A new objective functional is defined
:&lt;math&gt;
J' = J + \int_0^{T} \langle \chi (t)|\left( i \frac{\partial}{\partial t}-H(\epsilon(t))\right)|\psi(t) \rangle dt +\lambda \int_o^T |\epsilon(t)|^2 dt
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; |\chi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a wavefunction like [[Lagrange multiplier]] and the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; parameter regulates the integral intensity.
Variation of &lt;math&gt; J'&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt; \delta \epsilon &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta \psi &lt;/math&gt; leads to two coupled [[Schrödinger equation]]s

The '''Coopmans approximation'''&lt;!--, named after [[?????? Coopmans]],---&gt; is a method for approximating a [[fractional-order integrator]] in a continuous process with constant [[space complexity]]. The most correct and accurate methods for calculating the fractional integral require a record of all previous history, and therefore would require a linear space complexity solution O(''n''), where ''n'' is the number of samples measured for the complete history.

The [[fractor]] ( fractional capacitor ) is an analog component useful in [[control system]]s. In order to model the components behavior in a digital simulation, or replace the fractor in a digital controller, a linear solution is untenable. In order to reduce the space complexity however, it is necessary to lose information in some way. 

The Coopmans approximation is a robust, simple method that uses a simple [[convolution]] to compute the fractional integral, then recycles old data back through the convolution. The convolution sets up a weighting table as described by the [[fractional calculus]], which varies based on the size of the table, the sampling rate of the system, and the order of the integral. Once computed the weighting table remains static.

The data table is initialized as all zeros, which represents a lack of activity for all previous time. New data is added to the data buffer in the fashion of a ring buffer, so that the newest point is written over the oldest data point.
The convolution is solved by multiplying corresponding elements from the weight and data tables, and summing the resulting products. As described, the loss of the old data by overwriting with new data will cause echoes in a continuous system as disturbances that were absorbed into the system are suddenly removed.

The solution to this is the crux of the Coopmans approximation, where the old data point, multiplied by its corresponding weight term, is added to the newest data point directly. This allows a smooth (though exponential, rather than power law) decay of the system history. This approximation has the desirable effect of removing the echo, while preserving the space complexity of the solution.

The negative effect of the approximation is that the phase character of the solution is lost as the system frequency approaches DC. However, all digital systems are guaranteed to suffer this flaw, as all digital systems have finite memory, and therefore will fail as the memory requirement approaches infinity.

A '''crown block''' is the stationary section of a [[block and tackle]] that contains a set of pulleys or [[sheave]]s through which the [[drill line]] (wire rope) is threaded or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reeve reeved] and is opposite and above the [[traveling block]].

The combination of the [[traveling block]], crown block and wire rope [[drill line]] gives the ability to lift weights in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. On larger [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rigs]], when raising and lowering the derrick, line tensions over a million pounds are not unusual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13369">'''Design optimization''' is an engineering design '''methodology''' using a mathematical formulation of a design problem to support selection of the optimal design among many alternatives. Design optimization involves the following stages:&lt;ref name="pyp2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://principlesofoptimaldesign.org/|title=Principles of Optimal Design: Modeling and Computation|last=Papalambros|first=Panos Y.|last2=Wilde|first2=Douglass J.|date=2017-01-31|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781316867457|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Variable (mathematics)|Variables]]: Describe the design alternatives

# Constraints: Combination of Variables expressed as equalities or inequalities that must be satisfied for any acceptable design alternative

== Design optimization problem ==
{{Main|Optimization problem}}
The formal mathematical ([[Canonical form|standard form]]) statement of the design optimization problem is &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf|title=Convex Optimization|last=Boyd|first=Stephen|last2=Boyd|first2=Stephen P.|last3=California)|first3=Stephen (Stanford University Boyd|last4=Vandenberghe|first4=Lieven|last5=Angeles)|first5=Lieven (University of California Vandenberghe, Los|date=2004-03-08|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521833783|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h_i(x) = 0, \quad i = 1, \dots,m_1 \\ 
&amp;&amp;&amp;g_j(x) \leq 0, \quad j = 1,\dots,m_2 \\
&amp;\operatorname{and}
&amp; &amp;x \in X \subseteq R^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of ''n'' real-valued design variables &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the '''objective function''' 
* &lt;math&gt;h_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;'''equality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;g_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; '''inequality constraints''' 
* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a set constraint that includes additional restrictions on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; besides those implied by the equality and inequality constraints.

The problem formulation stated above is a convention called the ''negative null form'', since all constraint function are expressed as equalities and negative inequalities with zero on the right-hand side. This convention is used so that numerical algorithms developed to solve design optimization problems can assume a standard expression of the mathematical problem.

We can introduce the vector-valued functions

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;&amp;&amp;{h = (h_1,h_2,\dots,h_{m1})}\\
\operatorname{and}\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;{g = (g_1, g_2,\dots, g_{m2})}
\end{align}

&lt;/math&gt; '' ''

to rewrite the above statement in the compact expression

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;{\operatorname{minimize}}&amp; &amp; f(x) \\
&amp;\operatorname{subject\;to}
&amp; &amp;h(x) = 0,\quad g(x) \leq 0,\quad x \in X \subseteq R^n\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

We call &lt;math&gt;h, g&lt;/math&gt; the ''set'' or ''system of'' (''functional'') ''constraints'' and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the ''set constraint''.

== Application ==
Design optimization applies the methods of [[mathematical optimization]] to design problem formulations and it is sometimes used interchangeably with the term [[engineering optimization]].  When the objective function ''f'' is a [[Vector-valued function|vector]] rather than a [[Scalar field|scalar]], the problem becomes a [[multi-objective optimization]] one. If the design optimization problem has more than one mathematical solutions the methods of [[global optimization]] are used to identified the global optimum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">{{Other uses|Diffuser (disambiguation)}}

In [[optics]], a '''diffuser''' (also called a '''light diffuser''' or '''optical diffuser''') is any material that [[photon diffusion|diffuses]] or [[scattering|scatters]] light in some manner to transmit [[soft light]]. Diffuse light can be easily obtained by [[diffuse reflection|reflecting]] light from a white surface, while more compact diffusers may use [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] material, including [[ground glass]], [[teflon]], [[holograph]]s, [[opal glass]], and greyed glass.

==Perfect reflecting diffuser==
A perfect (reflecting) diffuser (PRD) is a theoretical perfectly white surface with [[Lambertian reflectance]] (its brightness appears the same from any angle of view). It does not absorb light, giving back 100% of the light it receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|first=Mark D.|last=Fairchild|page=65|isbn=0-470-01216-1|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_TxzK2B-5MC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22perfect+reflecting+diffuser%22&amp;ei=BHWzR5fnLYnIyATo7cjOBQ&amp;sig=0ir-7SuFRtR7CzujMeJSd8-WLEc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective diffusers can be easily characterised by scatterometers.&lt;ref name="zebraoptical.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zebraoptical.com/roughnessviascatterometry.html|title=Page Title|website=www.zebraoptical.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In photography==
A '''flash diffuser''' spreads the light from the [[Flash (photography)|flash]] of a [[camera]]. In effect, the light will not come from one concentrated source (like a [[Searchlight|spotlight]]), but rather will spread out, bounce from reflective ceilings and walls, thus getting rid of harsh light, and hard shadows. This is particularly useful for [[portrait]] [[photographers]], since harsh light and hard shadows are usually not considered flattering in a portrait.

A [[diffusion filter]] (sometimes called a "shoot-through" diffuser) is used in front of a flash or studio light to soften the light on the scene being shot.

==Photopolymer-based diffuser==
Recently, photopolymers have been used for making holographic diffusers. Photopolymers offer better performance than other materials and have a large viewing angle. Also, the process of synthesizing photopolymers is much simpler.

==Diffractive diffuser/homogenizer==
A diffractive diffuser is a kind of Diffractive Optical Element (DOE) that exploits the principles of [[diffraction]] and [[refraction]]. It uses a [[diffraction grating|Diffraction orders]] to manipulate [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] light, giving it a specific spatial-configuration and intensity profile. Diffractive diffusers are commonly used in commercially available LED illumination systems. Usually, the diffuser material is GaN or fused silica with processed rough surfaces. LED diffusers can be characterized online using scatterometry-based metrology.&lt;ref&gt;Walecki, Wojciech, and Peter Walecki. "Robust diffuser and roughness metrology tool for LED manufacturing." SPIE OPTO. International Society for Optics and Photonics, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zebraoptical.com"/&gt;

The '''Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard''' ('''EBICS''') is a [[Germany|German]] [[communication protocol|transmission protocol]] developed by the [[German Banking Industry Committee]] for sending payment information between banks over the [[internet]]. It grew out of the earlier BCS-FTAM protocol that was developed in 1995, with the aim of being able to use internet connections and [[TCP/IP]]. It is mandated for use by German banks and has also been adopted by France and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/index.cfm/newsletter/article/?articles_uuid=94E03F16-5056-B741-DBA1B6E004541E0C |title=The History and Vision of EBICS |date=January 30, 2012 |author=Narinda Viguier and Axel Weiß}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBICS supports [[Single Euro Payments Area]] SEPA as the standard can be used as the secure communication channel to initiate SEPA Direct Debits and SEPA Credit Transfers using the internet. SEPA concentrates on standardisation of clearing protocols in the inter-bank networks. The SEPA-Clearing guidelines do not supplant any national clearing transmission protocols. Theoretically the national banking transmission standards could be prolonged for decades.

==History==
In 2005, the German [[Zentraler Kreditausschuss]] (ZKA / ''Central Credit Committee'') initiated a project to replace the national banking clearing system based on [[FTAM]] (short BCS-FTAM). The design goals were specifically set to create a transmission protocol that can be used by other countries as well.

On 1 January 2006, the new EBICS transmission protocol was included in the German [[DFÜ-Abkommen]] ([[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]]-Agreement - enacted first on 15 March 1995). Since 1 January 2008, all German banks must support the EBICS transmission protocol and the required support for BCS-FTAM ends on 31 December 2010. It is expected that German banks will cease support for BCS-FTAM during 2011.

On 14 November 2008, a cooperation with the French "Comité Français d’Organisation et de Normalisation Bancaire" (CFONB - standardisation office in the banking sector of France) was pronounced such that EBICS would be adopted for usage in France. On 5 May 2009, a joint committee was created to resolve a modified EBICS. On 12 February 2010, a common EBICS for Germany and France was published (Version 2.4.2).

Most changes on the common EBICS involved to embed the French ETEBAC-3 message types and ETEBAC-5 signature elements into the EBICS transmission format where currently ETEBAC is transported via [[X.25]] packet network lines (in Germany the BCS-FTAM protocol is using ISDN direct lines). French Telecom closed its X.25 network in November 2011.

The EBICS protocol is based on an IP network. It allows use of standard HTTP with TLS encryption (HTTPS) for transport of data elements. The routing data elements are encoded in XML and optionally signed and encrypted with X.509 PKI certificates (replacing older RSA keys). The EBICS transmission protocol can be used to wrap SEPA-XML statements as they come forward.

The standard does include two major areas - for usage in the bank-client transmission including statements of account (MT940/STA) and for interbanking clearing. The German [[Bundesbank]] has adopted the EBICS transmission protocol on 28 January 2009 to accept clearing information to be routed to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication#SWIFTNet network|SWIFTnet interbanking network]]. The Bundesbank will only accept SEPA statements via SWIFTnet FileAct or EBICS submissions. &lt;!-- "SCT Verfahrensregeln" / "Procedural Rules for credit transfers", section 3.1, quote "Deliveries from the SEPA Clearer are made only by data telecommunication via EBICS or SWIFTNet FileAct. This is governed by the specifications on communication set out in the Procedural Rules for Communication via SWIFTNet FileAct for the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Retail Payment System (RPS) SEPA Clearer (SCL) and the Procedural Rules for Communication with Credit Institutions/payment institutions with a bank sort code via EBICS. Conversion of SEPA credit transfers in old formats (DTA, MT 103+) is not supported." --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26197">The '''Fernseh AG''' [[television]] company was registered in [[Berlin]] on July 3, 1929 by [[John Logie Baird]], [[Robert Bosch]] and other partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=7309|title=Fernseh ; Berlin - Darmstadt manufacturer in D, Model types,|first=Fernseh (Fernseh AG, GmbH, FESE, Bosch Fernsehanlagen); Berlin -|last=Darmstadt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial capital of 100,000 [[Reichsmark]]. Fernseh AG did research and manufacturing of television equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fernsehmuseum.info/fese-historie-00.0.html?&amp;L=0%29 Fernsehmuseum - Sie sind im Bereich : Fese Historie Start&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The company name "Fernseh AG" is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''Fernsehen'' ‘television’ and ''[[Aktiengesellschaft]] (AG)'' ‘joint-stock company’. The company was mainly known by its German abbreviation "FESE".&lt;ref name="The Bosch Group&amp;nbsp;— Published in 2004"&gt;[http://www.bosch.com/content/language2/html/3074_3202.htm The Bosch Group - Published in 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Fernseh#See also|section see also]] on this page for other uses.

==Early years==
In 1929 Fernseh [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]'s original board of directors included: [[Emanuel Goldberg]], Oliver George Hutchinson (for Baird), David Ludwig Loewe, and Erich Carl Rassbach (for Bosch) and Eberhard Falkenstein who did the legal work.&lt;ref name="The Bosch Group&amp;nbsp;— Published in 2004"/&gt;
[[Carl Zeiss]]'s [[Carl Zeiss AG|company]] worked alongside the early Bosch company. Much of the early work was in the area of research and development. Along with early TV sets (DE-6, E1, DE10) Fernseh AG made the first "Remote Truck"/"[[Outside broadcasting|OB van]]", an "intermediate-film" mobile television camera in August 1932. This was a film camera that had its film developed in the truck and a "telecine" then transmitted the signal almost "live".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fernsehmuseum.info/fese-historie-01.0.html?&amp;L=0%29 Sie sind auf der Homepage von Fernsehmuseum Wiesbaden: Fese Historie 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fernseh GmbH==
*In 1939 [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] took complete ownership of Fernseh AG when Zeiss Ikon AG sold its share of Fernseh AG.
*In 1952 Fernseh moved to [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] and increase its Broadcast product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fernseh-gmbh.de/seitenleiste_eng.html|title=Farvis TV museum Pfungstadt|first=|last=Fiona|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1967 Fernseh, by then commonly called "Bosch Fernseh", introduced color TV products. Fernseh offered a full line of video and film equipment: [[professional video camera]]s, [[VTR]]s and [[telecine]] devices. On August 27, 1967 the first color TV program in Germany aired, with a live broadcast from a Bosch Fernseh outside broadcast (OB) van. The networks [[ZDF]], [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] each acquired a new color OB van from Bosch Fernseh to begin broadcasting in color.

==Fernsehanlagen GmbH==
In 1972 Robert Bosch renamed its TV division: Fernsehanlagen GmbH (Fernseh facilities). The company supplied almost all the studio equipment for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich.



==Fernseh Inc.==
*In October 1979 [[Bell and Howell]]'s [[TeleMation Inc.]] Division located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], entered a joint venture with [[Robert Bosch GmbH]],  Bosch’s Fernseh Division. The new joint venture was call Fernseh Inc.,  Bosch Fernseh Division was located in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]
*In April 1982 Bosch fully acquired Fernseh Inc., renaming it "Robert Bosch Corporation, Fernseh Division"
*In 1986 Bosch entered into a new joint venture with [[Philips]] Broadcast in [[Breda]], [[Netherlands]]. This new Company was called [[Broadcast Television Systems Inc.|Broadcast Television Systems]] or BTS inc. Philips had been in the Broadcast market for many years with a line of PC- and LDK- [[Norelco]] [[professional video camera]]s and other video products.
*In 1995 Philips Electronics North America Corp. fully acquired BTS Inc., renaming it Philips Broadcast-Philips Digital Video Systems.
*In March 2001 this Philips division was sold to [[Thomson SA]], the Division was call Thomson Multimedia. In 2002, the French electronics giant Thomson SA also acquired the Grass Valley Group from a private investor that had acquired it three years earlier from [[Tektronix]] in Beaverton, Oregon, USA. The current name of this division of Thomson is [[Grass Valley (company)|Grass Valley]].  The Fernseh's [[Darmstadt]] factory, near the [[Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof|Darmstadt Train Station]] and [[European Space Operations Centre]] was moved a short distance to [[Weiterstadt]], [[Germany]]. (later, Grass Valley was sold to '''[[Belden (electronics company)|Belden]]''' on February 6, 2014, Belden also owns Miranda. )&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grassvalley.com/belden|title=Belden Announcement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Thomson Film Division, located in Weiterstadt including the product line of [[Spirit DataCine]], [[Spirit DataCine#Bones Dailies|Bones Work station]], [[Scanity]] realtime film scanner and [[3D LUT|LUTher 3D Color Space converter]], was sold to Parter Capital Group.&lt;ref name="parter-capital.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parter-capital.de/en/index.php|title=PARTER Capital Group - Gesellschaft für Beteiligungsberatung|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sale was made public on Sept. 9, 2008 and completed on Dec. 1, 2008. The new Headquarters was still in Weiterstadt, the former Bosch Fernseh&amp;nbsp;— BTS factory. Parter Capital Group continued to have worldwide offices to support products from Weiterstadt, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videography.com/articles/article_16060.shtml|title=Creative Planet Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parter-capital.de"/&gt; The new name of the company is '''Digital Film Technology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft-film.com/|title=Digital Film Technology GmbH - Scanity - HDR Film Scanner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DFT Digital Film Technology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft-film.de/ dft-film.de - DFT Digital Film Technology] - Manufacturer of CCD based telecines and data scanners&lt;/ref&gt; became part of a new company: Precision Mechatronics GmbH in Weiterstadt, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precision-mechatronics.com|title=Digital Film Technology GmbH - Scanity - HDR Film Scanner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2012 Precision Mechatronics and DFT were acquired by Prasad Group, part of [[Prasad Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prasadcorp.com/|title=Prasad Corp -  Visual Effects - Digital Archive - Digital Film Restoration - Media Asset Management - Digital Intermediate|first=Prasad|last=Group|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft-film.com/news/press_releases/01_10_12.php DFT Press Release, Weiterstadt, Germany&amp;nbsp;– October 1, 2012 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831235019/http://www.dft-film.com/news/press_releases/01_10_12.php |date=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 DFT moved from Weiterstadt to [[Darmstadt-Arheilgen|Arheilgen]]-Darmstadt, Germany.

'''Flatbed trolleys''' are a common form of transport in distribution environments, for moving bulk loads. A very simple design offers a basic flat platform with four [[caster]]s and a fixed handle which is used to either push or pull the platform with the load on the platform. Without a flat surface it becomes an "open frame" trolley and without a handle it is a [[bogie]] or dolly.&lt;ref name=Fazio2000 &gt;{{citation | last=Fazio | first=Larry  | title=Stage manager: the professional experience | publisher=Focal Press | isbn=978-0-240-80410-1 | date = July 23, 2000 | page=303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The frame is usually fabricated steel. The primary flatbed surface can be constructed from wooden boards, plastic, steel or mesh. Flatbed casters can vary dramatically, made of solid rubber, air filled pneumatic or cast iron. The caster is generally the component on the flatbed trolley that limits the safe working capacity.

Specialised trolleys include the piano dolly, which consistently features small multi-swivel castors and a stronger than usual frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| journal=Popular Mechanics | year=1928 |page=524 | volume=49.3 |issn=0032-4558 |publisher=Hearst Magazines | title=Dolly facilitates piano moving}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "U-boat" – used to move and stock [[Good (economics)|goods]] by retailers such as [[grocery stores]] – has two high handles on opposite ends of a thin flatbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nationalcart.com/dt_catalog/heavy-duty-u-boats/ | title = Heavy Duty U-Boats | publisher = National Cart Co | year = 2014 | accessdate = 2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern factory systems commonly track individual trolleys digitally to facilitate automated [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]]; automated systems may have remotely operated or autonomous trolleys for transport during storage and access.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Kendall | first1=Kenneth E. | year=2008 | title=Systems analysis and design | last2=Kendall | first2=Julie E. | edition=7 | publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0-13-224085-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''forklift''' (also called '''lift truck''', '''jitney''', '''fork truck''', '''fork hoist''', and '''forklift truck''') is a [[powered industrial truck]] used to lift and move materials over short distances. The forklift was developed in the early 20th century by various companies, including [[Clark Material Handling Company|Clark]], which made [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]s, and [[Yale Materials Handling Corporation|Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing]], which made hoists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History |publisher=Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc. |url=http://www.yale.com/north-america/en-us/about-us/our-history/ |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215195724/http://www.yale.com/north-america/en-us/about-us/our-history/ |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brindley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |title=History |publisher=Clark Material Handling Company |url=http://www.clarkmhc.com/company/history.asp |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909042606/http://clarkmhc.com/company/history.asp |archivedate=9 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since World War II, the use and development of the forklift truck have greatly expanded worldwide. Forklifts have become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing.&lt;ref name="backbone"/&gt; In 2013, the top 20 manufacturers worldwide posted sales of $30.4 billion, with 944,405 machines sold.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bond |first=Josh |date=1 August 2013 |title=Top 20 Lift truck suppliers, 2013 |publisher=Modern Materials Handling |url=http://www.mmh.com/article/top_20_lift_truck_suppliers_2013 |accessdate=14 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214150557/http://www.mmh.com/article/top_20_lift_truck_suppliers_2013 |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:"M. D. Shore, S1-c, operating a forklift truck at the Navy supply depot at Guam, Marianas.", 06-08-1945 - NARA - 520685.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A forklift truck being used during World War II]]

The middle nineteenth century through the early 20th century saw the developments that led to today's modern forklifts. The forerunners of the modern forklift were manually powered hoists that were used to lift loads.&lt;ref name="backbone"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forklift Trucks— The Backbone Of The Industry |publisher=The MHEDA Journal |url=http://www.themhedajournal.org/content/3q04/lifttrucks.php |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901014848/http://www.themhedajournal.org/content/3q04/lifttrucks.php |archivedate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] introduced battery powered platform trucks for moving luggage at their Altoona, Pennsylvania train station. [[World War I]] saw the development of different types of material handling equipment in the United Kingdom by [[Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies]] of Ipswich.  This was in part due to the labor shortages caused by the war. In 1917, [[Clark Material Handling Company|Clark]] in the United States began developing and using powered tractor and powered lift tractors in their factories. In 1919, the [[Caterpillar Inc.#Acquisitions|Towmotor Company]], and [[Yale Materials Handling Corporation|Yale &amp; Towne Manufacturing]] in 1920, entered the lift truck market in the United States.&lt;ref name="Brindley"&gt;{{cite web |last=Brindley |first=James |date=December 2005 |title=The History of The Fork Lift |publisher= Warehouse &amp; Logistic News |url=http://www.warehousenews.co.uk/News/December_2005/F-History.html |accessdate=2008-01-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831192629/http://www.warehousenews.co.uk/News/December_2005/F-History.html |archivedate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing development and expanded use of the forklift continued through the 1920s and 1930s. The introduction of hydraulic power and the development of the first electric power forklifts, along with the use of standardized [[pallet]]s in the late 1930s, helped to increase the popularity of forklift trucks.&lt;ref name="backbone"/&gt;

The start of [[World War II]], like World War I before, spurred the use of forklift trucks in the war effort.&lt;ref name="potted"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sellick |first=Tony |year=2010 |title=A potted history of the forklift truck |publisher=Forklift training website |url=http://www.fork-lift-training.co.uk/history.html |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215141259/http://www.fork-lift-training.co.uk/history.html |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, more efficient methods for storing products in warehouses were being implemented. Warehouses needed more maneuverable forklift trucks that could reach greater heights and new forklift models were made that filled this need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forklift- The Backbone of The Industry |publisher=MHEDA Journal Online |url=http://www.datakey.org/mhedajournal/3q04/lifttrucks_a.php3 |accessdate=2008-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218101546/http://www.datakey.org/mhedajournal/3q04/lifttrucks_a.php3 |archivedate=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1954, a British company named [[Lansing Bagnall]], now part of [[KION Group]], developed what was claimed to be the first narrow aisle electric reach truck.&lt;ref name="potted"/&gt; The development changed the design of warehouses leading to narrower aisles and higher load stacking that increased storage capability.&lt;ref name="potted"/&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, operator safety became a concern due to the increasing lifting heights and capacities. Safety features such as load backrests and operator cages, called overhead guards, began to be added to forklifts produced in this era.&lt;ref name="backbone"/&gt; In the late 1980s, [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic design]] began to be incorporated in new forklift designs to improve operator comfort, reduce injuries and increase productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lang |first=Susan S. |date=15 October 2003 |title=Prize winning Cornell researcher shows ergonomics aren't just for chairs and keyboards -- would you believe forklifts? |publisher=Cornell Chronicle |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2003/10/ergonomics-would-you-believe-forklifts |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215181319/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2003/10/ergonomics-would-you-believe-forklifts |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, exhaust emissions from forklift operations began to be addressed which led to emission standards being implemented for forklift manufacturers in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Liew |first=Christine |date=27 September 2007 |title=Emissions drive innovation |publisher=Forkliftaction.com |url=http://www.forkliftaction.com/news/newsdisplay.aspx?nwid=4751 |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215180849/http://www.forkliftaction.com/news/newsdisplay.aspx?nwid=4751 |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Alternating current|AC power]] forklifts, along with [[fuel cell]] technology, are also refinements in continuing forklift development.&lt;ref name="backbone"/&gt;&lt;ref name=brower&gt;{{cite web |last=Brower |first=Warren |date=April 2010 |title=Hydrogen fuel cells are a good choice for large forklift fleets |work=Fuel Cells Provide End-User Benefits |publisher=The MHEDA Journal |url=http://www.themhedajournal.org/index.php/2010/04/fuel-cells-provide-end-user-benefits/ |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216005507/http://www.themhedajournal.org/index.php/2010/04/fuel-cells-provide-end-user-benefits/ |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General operations==
[[File:Toyota L&amp;F Geneo 005.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Forklift cab with control layout.]]

Forklifts are rated for loads at a specified maximum weight and a specified forward [[Center of mass|center of gravity]].  This information is located on a nameplate provided by the manufacturer, and loads must not exceed these specifications. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to alter or remove the nameplate without the permission of the forklift manufacturer.

An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have [[rear-wheel steering]]. While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver’s traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. While steering, as there is no [[caster angle|caster]] action, it is unnecessary to apply steering force to maintain a constant rate of turn.

Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. A forklift must never negotiate a turn at speed with a raised load, where [[centrifugal force|centrifugal]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] forces may combine to cause a disastrous tip-over accident. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L"). A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. A forklift should not be used as a personnel lift without the fitting of specific safety equipment, such as a "cherry picker" or "cage".

Forklifts are a critical element of warehouses and distribution centers. It’s imperative that these structures be designed to accommodate their efficient and safe movement. In the case of Drive-In/Drive-Thru Racking, a forklift needs to travel inside a storage bay that is multiple pallet positions deep to place or retrieve a pallet. Often, forklift drivers are guided into the bay through guide rails on the floor and the pallet is placed on cantilevered arms or rails. These maneuvers require well-trained operators. Since every pallet requires the truck to enter the storage structure, damage is more common than with other types of storage. In designing a drive-in system, dimensions of the fork truck, including overall width and mast width, must be carefully considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phelan |first=John T., Jr. |date=18 March 2009 |title=Which storage rack system is right for your company? |work=Material Handling Wholesaler |url=http://www.mhwmag.com/article.cfm?id=26044 |accessdate=11 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417072637/http://www.mhwmag.com/article.cfm?id=26044 |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forklift control and capabilities===
Forklift hydraulics are controlled either with levers directly manipulating the hydraulic valves or by electrically controlled actuators, using smaller "finger" levers for control. The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design.

Forklift trucks are available in many variations and load capacities.  In a typical warehouse setting most forklifts have load capacities between one and five tons. Larger machines, up to 50 tons lift capacity, are used for lifting heavier loads, including loaded [[Intermodal container|shipping containers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalmarind.com/show.php?id=1020219|title=The Kalmar heavy range 20-50 tonnes, More than 50 years of development|accessdate=2008-10-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201201119/http://www.kalmarind.com/show.php?id=1020219|archivedate=1 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks. Tilt also provides a limited ability to operate on non-level ground. Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.

The following is a list, in no particular order, of the more common lift truck types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lencrowforklifts.com.au/news/different-types-of-forklift-and-their-common-use/|title=Types of Forklift}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[pallet jack|Hand pallet truck]] - no onboard power system of any kind; the operator's muscle power is used to jack-up and move loads.

* Rider low lift truck&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt; - usually electrically powered
* [[Electric tug|Towing tractor]] - may be internal combustion engine or electrically powered
* Walkie stacker&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt; - usually electrically powered
* Rider stacker&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt; - usually electrically powered
* Reach truck &lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt;- variant on a Rider Stacker forklift, designed for small aisles, usually Electrically Powered, named because the forks can extend to reach the load. There are two variants, moving carriage, which are common in North America, and moving mast which are common in the rest of the world, and generally regarded as safer {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Electric counterbalanced truck&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt;- comes in Stand on End Control, Stand on Center Control, and Sit Down Center Control, which is the most numerous {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
[[File:Electrical forklift.jpg|thumb|Electrical forklift]]
* Internal Combustion Engine Powered Counterbalanced Forklift&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt;- comes in Stand on End Control, Stand on Center Control, and Sit Down Center Control, which is the most numerous. Engines may be diesel, kerosene, gasoline, natural gas, butane, or propane fueled, and may be either two-stroke spark ignition, four stroke spark ignition (common), two-stroke compression ignition, and four-stroke compression ignition (common). North American Engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Battery electric forklifts, powered by [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] or, increasingly, [[lithium-ion batteries]], include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks. Electric forklifts are primarily used indoors on flat, even surfaces. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for indoor facilities, such as food-processing and healthcare sectors.
* [[Fuel cell forklift]]s also produce no local emissions, can be refueled in 3 minutes, and are often used in refrigerated warehouses as their performance is not degraded by lower temperatures.&lt;ref name=brower/&gt;
[[File:HUBTEX-2240-electric-multidirectional-sideloader.jpg|thumb|Electric Multidirectional Sideloader]]
* Sideloader&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt; - comes in Stand on End Control, and Sit Down End Control, which is the most numerous. It may be electrically powered, or have an internal combustion engine. Engines may be diesel, kerosene, gasoline, natural gas, butane, or propane fueled, and may be either two-stroke spark ignition, four stroke spark ignition (common), two-stroke compression ignition, and four-stroke compression ignition (common). North American Engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems. Some sideloaders have hybrid drivetrains. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[Telescopic handler]] - comes in Stand on Center Control, and Sit Down Center Control, which is the most numerous. Usually has an Internal Combustion Engine. Engines are almost always diesel, but sometimes operate on kerosene, and sometimes use propane injection as a power boost. Some old units are two-stroke compression ignition, most are four-stroke compression ignition (common). North American Engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries like Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems. Some Telescopic handlers have Hybrid drivetrains. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Walkie order picking truck&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt; - usually Electrically Powered
* Rider order picking truck&lt;ref name="OSHA" /&gt; - commonly called an "Order Picker"; like a small Reach Truck, except the operator rides in a cage welded to the fork carriage, while wearing a specially designed safety harness to prevent falls. A special toothed grab holds the pallet to the forks. The operator transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time by hand. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments, and is popular for use in large distribution centers.
[[File:Reach truck.jpg|thumb|A reach truck with a [[pantograph]] allowing the extension of the forks in tight aisles.]]
* Articulated very narrow aisle counterbalanced trucks - sometimes called "Flexi or Bendi Trucks" after two of the largest manufacturers. Comes in stand on center control, and sit down center control, which is the most numerous. May have an internal combustion engine or an electric motor. Electric motors are most common. Engines may be diesel, kerosene, gasoline, natural gas, butane, or propane fueled, and may be either two-stroke spark ignition, four-stroke spark ignition (common), two-stroke compression ignition, and four-stroke compression ignition (common). North American engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems. Some units have hybrid drivetrains. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Unlike standard counterbalance and reach forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.  
* Guided very narrow aisle truck - A counterbalance type Sit Down Rider Electric Forklift fitted with a specialized mast assembly. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets. Because the forklift does not have to turn, the aisles can be exceptionally narrow, and if [[wire guidance]] is fitted in the floor of the building the machine can almost work on its own. Masts on this type of machine tend to be very high. The higher the racking that can be installed, the higher the density the storage can reach. This sort of storage system is popular in cities where land prices are really high, as by building the racking up to three times higher than normal and using these machines, it is possible to stock an incredible amount of material in what appears to be a small space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pallet Racking Systems Ltd |url=http://www.palletrackingsystemsltd.co.uk/glossary/narrow-aisle-pallet-racking/ |accessdate=23 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925062050/http://www.palletrackingsystemsltd.co.uk/glossary/narrow-aisle-pallet-racking/ |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guided very narrow aisle order picking truck - counterbalance type Order Picking Truck similar to the guided very narrow aisle truck, except that the operator and the controls which operate the machine are in a cage welded to the mast. The operator wears a restraint system to protect him against falls. Otherwise the description is the same as guided very narrow aisle truck.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* Truck-mounted forklift / sod loader - comes in sit down center control. Usually has an internal combustion engine. Engines are almost always diesel, but sometimes operate on kerosene, and sometimes use propane injection as a power boost. Some old units are two-stroke compression ignition, most are four-stroke compression ignition (common). North American engines come with advanced emission control systems. Forklifts built in countries such as Iran or Russia will typically have no emission control systems.

===Specialty trucks===
[[File:Straight mast container handler 02.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A straight mast container handler at [[Haikou Xiuying Port]], Hainan, China]]
At the other end of the spectrum from the counterbalanced forklift trucks are more 'high end' specialty trucks:

* '''Articulated counterbalance trucks'''
These are, unlike most lift trucks, front-wheel steer and are a hybrid VNA (very narrow aisle) truck designed to be both able to offload trailers and place the load in narrow aisle racking.  Increasingly these trucks are able to compete in terms of pallet storage density, lift heights and pallet throughput with guided very narrow aisle trucks, while also being capable of loading trucks, which VNA units are incapable of doing.&lt;ref name="Bendi Truck Capability"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bendi Truck Training |work=Didac Ltd Industrial Training Services |publisher=Didac Ltd |url=http://www.didacindustrial.co.uk/courses/forklift-truck/forklift-operator-training/bendi-truck |accessdate=6 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303171105/http://www.didacindustrial.co.uk/courses/forklift-truck/forklift-operator-training/bendi-truck/ |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Guided very narrow aisle trucks'''
These are rail- or wire-guided and available with lift heights up to 40 feet non-top-tied and 98 feet top-tied.  Two forms are available: 'man-down' and 'man-riser', where the operator elevates with the load for increased visibility or for multilevel 'break bulk' order picking.  This type of truck, unlike articulated narrow aisle trucks, requires a high standard of floor flatness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* '''Omnidirectional trucks'''
Omnidirectional technology (such as [[Mecanum wheel]]s) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. An omnidirectional wheel system is able to rotate the truck 360 degrees in its own footprint or strafe sideways without turning the truck cabin. One example is the Airtrax Sidewinder. This forklift truck has also made an appearance in the TV series called 'Mythbusters'.

* '''UL 558 safety rated trucks'''
In North America, some internal combustion powered industrial vehicles carry [[Underwriters Laboratories]] ratings that are part of UL 558. Industrial trucks that are considered "safety" carry the designations GS (Gasoline Safety) for gasoline powered, DS (Diesel Safety) for diesel powered, LPS (Liquid Propane Safety) for liquified propane or GS/LPS for a dual fuel gasoline/liquified propane powered truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Trucks, Internal Combustion Engine-Powered - UL 558 |publisher=Underwriters Laboratories |url=http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0558.html |accessdate=27 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211221027/http://ulstandardsinfonet.ul.com/scopes/scopes.asp?fn=0558.html |archivedate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UL 558]] is a two-stage Safety Standard. The basic standard, which is G, D, LP, and G/LP is what Underwriter's Laboratories considers the bare minimum required for a lift truck. This is a voluntary standard, and there is no requirement in North America at least by any Government Agency for manufacturers to meet this standard.

The slightly more stringent GS, DS, LPS, and GP/LPS, or '''Safety''' standard does provide some minimal protection, however it is extremely minimal. In the past Underwriter's Laboratory offered specialty EX and DX safety certifications. If you require higher levels of protection you '''must''' contact your local Underwriter's Laboratory Office and check ask them what the correct safety standard is for your workplace. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Counterbalanced forklift components==
A typical counterbalanced forklift contains the following components:
[[File:Forklift Truck.jpg|thumb|300px|Image of an electric forklift with component descriptions]]
* ''' Truck frame''' - is the base of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, overhead guard and power source are attached. The frame may have fuel and [[hydraulic fluid]] tanks constructed as part of the frame assembly.
* '''[[Counterweight]]''' -  is a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. The purpose of the counterweight is to counterbalance the load being lifted. In an electric forklift the large battery may serve as part of the counterweight.
* ''' Cab''' - is the area that contains a seat for the operator along with the control [[Automobile pedal|pedals]], [[steering wheel]], [[lever]]s, [[switch]]es and a dashboard containing operator readouts. The cab area may be open air or enclosed but it is covered by the cage-like overhead guard assembly. When enclosed, the cab may also be equipped with a cab heater for cold climate countries along with a fan or air conditioning for hot weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=21 July 2005 |title=Cabin Comforts |publisher=Forkliftaction.com |url=http://www.forkliftaction.com/news/newsdisplay.aspx?nwid=2487 |accessdate=13 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603033026/http://www.forkliftaction.com/news/newsdisplay.aspx?nwid=2487 |archivedate=3 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' Overhead guard''' - is a metal [[roof]] supported by posts at each corner of the cab that helps protect the operator from any falling objects. On some forklifts, the overhead guard is an integrated part of the frame assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=14 May 2012 |title=Forklift Safety - Overhead Guards |publisher=ProLift |url=http://proliftequipment.com/blog/index.php/2012/05/14/forklift-safety-overhead-guards/ |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''' Power source''' - may consist of an [[internal combustion engine]] that can be powered by [[liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]], [[Compressed natural gas|CNG]], [[gasoline]] or [[diesel fuel]]. Electric forklifts are powered by either a battery or [[fuel cell]]s that provides power to the electric motors. For warehouses and other indoor applications, electric forklifts have the advantage of not producing carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="Iowa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Spears |first=David |year=2010 |title=Welcome to Session 303 Power Alternatives for Forklifts |work=ProMat 2011 |publisher=Yale Material Handling Corporation. |url=http://cdn.promatshow.com/seminars/assets/303.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 December 2013}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Tilt cylinders''' -  are hydraulic cylinders that are mounted to the truck frame and the mast. The tilt cylinders pivot the mast backwards or forwards to assist in engaging a load.
* '''Mast''' - is the vertical assembly that does the work of raising and lowering the load. It is made up of interlocking rails that also provide lateral stability. The interlocking rails may either have rollers or bushings as guides. The mast is driven [[hydraulic]]ally, and operated by one or more hydraulic cylinders directly or using chains from the cylinder/s. It may be mounted to the front axle or the frame of the forklift. A 'container mast' variation allows the forks to raise a few meters without increasing the total height of the forklift. This is useful when double-loading pallets into a container or under a mezzanine floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a Forklift Container Mast? |publisher=Eureka Forklifts |url=http://eureka-forklifts.com.au/container-masts |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213064514/http://eureka-forklifts.com.au/container-masts |archivedate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Carriage''' - is the component to which the forks or other attachments mount. It is mounted into and moves up and down the mast rails by means of chains or by being directly attached to the hydraulic cylinder. Like the mast, the carriage may have either rollers or bushings to guide it in the interlocking mast rails.&lt;ref name="Iowa"/&gt;
* '''Load backrest''' -  is a rack-like extension that is either bolted or welded to the carriage in order to prevent the load from shifting backward when the carriage is lifted to full height.&lt;ref name="Iowa"&gt;{{cite web |last=Reece |first=Wendel |date=September 2009 |title=Forklift Operator Safety Program |publisher=University of Northern Iowa |url=http://www.vpaf.uni.edu/ehso/programs/forklift_operator12.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213120926/http://www.vpaf.uni.edu/ehso/programs/forklift_operator12.pdf |archivedate=13 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Attachments''' - may consists of a mechanism which is attached to the carriage, either permanently or temporarily, to help in proper engagement of the load. A variety of material handling attachments are available. Some attachments include sideshifters, slipsheet attachments, carton clamps, multipurpose clamps, rotators, fork positioners, carpet poles, pole handlers, container handlers and roll clamps.
* '''Tires''' - either solid for indoor use, or [[Pneumatic tire|pneumatic]] for outside use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Forklift Operator Safety Training |publisher=MASCO.NET |url=http://www.masco.net/safety/forklift_safety/forklift_training_web_section1.html |accessdate=2012-12-08 |quote=These lifts usually have solid rubber tires, and are common in factories and warehouses.

===Attachments===
Below is a list of common forklift attachments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cascade Corporation - Attachments |url=http://www.cascorp.com/americas/en/products |accessdate=2008-01-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227212132/http://www.cascorp.com/americas/en/products |archivedate=27 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elevatore idraulico PORTER mod. ES 3200 - 4 LX.jpg|thumb|upright|Hydraulic elevator for tractors]]
* '''Dimensioning devices'''-fork truck-mounted dimensioning systems provide dimensions for the cargo to facilitate truck trailer space utilization and to support warehouse automation systems. The systems normally communicate the dimensions via 802.11 radios. NTEP certified dimensioning devices are available to support commercial activities that bill based on volume.
* '''Sideshifter''' - is a hydraulic attachment that allows the operator to move the tines (forks) and backrest laterally. This allows easier placement of a load without having to reposition the truck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolzoni Auramo - Attachments |url=http://www.bolzoni-auramo.com |accessdate=2008-10-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103030100/http://www.bolzoni-auramo.com/ |archivedate=3 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rotator''' - To aid the handling of skids that may have become excessively tilted and other specialty material handling needs some forklifts are fitted with an attachment that allows the tines to be rotated. This type of attachment may also be used for dumping containers for quick unloading.
* '''Fork positioner''' - is a hydraulic attachment that moves the tines (forks) together or apart. This removes the need for the operator to manually adjust the tines for different sized loads.
* '''Roll and barrel clamp attachment''' - A mechanical or hydraulic attachment used to squeeze the item to be moved. It is used for handling barrels, kegs, or paper rolls.  This type of attachment may also have a rotate function. The rotate function would help an operator to insert a vertically stored paper into the horizontal intake of a printing press for example.&lt;ref name="Paper"&gt;{{cite web |last=Liew |first=Christine |date=18 August 2005 |title=The Paper Industry: Forklift attachments do the job |publisher=Forkliftaction.com |url=http://www.forkliftaction.com/news/newsdisplay.aspx?nwid=2548 |accessdate=15 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215183643/http://www.forkliftaction.com/news/newsdisplay.aspx?nwid=2548 |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pole attachments''' - In some locations, such as carpet warehouses, a long metal pole is used instead of forks to lift carpet rolls. Similar devices, though much larger, are used to pick up metal coils.
* '''Carton and multipurpose clamp attachments''' - are hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to open and close around a load, squeezing it to pick it up. Products like cartons, boxes and bales can be moved with this type of attachment. With these attachments in use, the forklift truck is sometimes referred to as a clamp truck.&lt;ref name="Paper"/&gt;
* '''[[Slip sheet]] attachment (push - pull)''' - is a hydraulic attachment that reaches forward, clamps onto a slip sheet and draws the slip sheet onto wide and thin metal forks for transport. The attachment will push the slip sheet and load off the forks for placement.
* '''[[Drum handler]] attachment''' - is a mechanical attachment that slides onto the tines (forks). It usually has a spring-loaded jaw that grips the top lip edge of a drum for transport. Another type grabs around the drum in a manner similar to the roll or barrel attachments.
* '''Man basket''' - a lift platform that slides onto the tines (forks) and is meant for hoisting workers. The man basket has railings to keep the person from falling and brackets for attaching a safety harness. Also, a strap or chain is used to attach the man basket to the carriage of the forklift.
* '''Telescopic forks''' - are hydraulic attachments that allow the operator to operate in warehouse design for "double-deep stacking", which means that two pallet shelves are placed behind each other without any aisle between them.
* '''Scales''' -Fork truck-mounted scales enable operators to efficiently weigh the pallets they handle without interrupting their workflow by travelling to a platform scale. Scales are available that provide legal-for-trade weights for operations that involve billing by weight. They are easily retrofitted to the truck by hanging on the carriage in the same manner as forks hang on the truck.
* '''Single-double forks''' - are forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.  The fork control may have to replace the side-shifter on some lift trucks.
* '''Snow plough''' - is a mechanical attachment that allows the forklift operator to easily and quickly move snow. The snow plough can often also be utilised at other times of the year as an attachment to clean up workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.camsystem.com/en/products/mechanical-attachments/snow-ploughs|title=Snow ploughs|work=CAM System|access-date=2017-10-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013224457/https://www.camsystem.com/en/products/mechanical-attachments/snow-ploughs|archivedate=13 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Skips''' - is a mechanical attachment that is simply fitted to your forklift to allow safe and speedy removal of waste to the appropriate skip or waste compactor. There are two types of skips: the roll-forward type and the bottom-emptying type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.camsystem.com/en/products/mechanical-attachments/skips|title=Skips|work=CAM System|access-date=2017-10-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013172833/https://www.camsystem.com/en/products/mechanical-attachments/skips|archivedate=13 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. The actual load rating may be significantly lower.

===Replacing or adding attachments===
[[File:Plaque-de-charge-Chariot.jpg|thumb|right|a typical load capacity chart]]
It is possible to replace an existing attachment or add one to a lift that doesn't already have one.  Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features).  As mentioned in the preceding section, replacing or adding an attachment may reduce (down-rate) the safe lifting capacity of the forklift truck (See also General operations, below).

Forklift attachment manufacturers offer online calculators to estimate the safe lifting capacity when using a particular attachment. However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Before installing any attachment contact your local authorized dealer of your forklift brand and ask them to begin re-rating your lift according to the attachment you want to install. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift.

In the context of attachment, a hydraulic function consists of a valve on the forklift with a lever near the operator that provides two passages of pressurized hydraulic oil to power the attachment features.  Sometimes an attachment has more features than your forklift has hydraulic functions and one or more need to be added. There are many ways of adding hydraulic functions (also known as adding a valve).  The forklift manufacturer makes valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive. Other ways include adding a solenoid valve in conjunction with a hose or cable reel that diverts oil flow from an existing function. However, hose and cable reels can block the operator's view and are problematic, easily damaged.  The Ditto Valve kit uses a solenoid valve and special HydWire hoses, in which the wire reinforcing braid doubles as an electrical conduit. These hoses replace those already on the forklift, nesting in the original reeving, keeping it safe from damage and out of the operator's field of vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rocoinnovation.com/index.php/ditto-valve-kit/overview.html|title=Roco Innovation :: Ditto Valve Kit :: Overview|website=rocoinnovation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203085016/http://rocoinnovation.com/index.php/ditto-valve-kit/overview.html|archivedate=3 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lift truck associations and organizations==
There are many national as well as continental associations related to the industrial truck industry. Some of the major organizations are listed as:
* Industrial Truck Association (ITA) (North America)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Truck Association |url=http://www.indtrk.org/default.asp |accessdate=2008-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113162754/http://www.indtrk.org/default.asp |archivedate=13 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many significant contacts among these organizations and they have established joint statistical and engineering programs. One program is the ''World Industrial Trucks Statistics (WITS)'' which is published every month to the association memberships. The statistics are separated by area ([[continent]]), country and class of machine. While the statistics are generic and do not count production from most of the smaller manufacturers, the information is significant for its depth. These contacts have brought to a common definition of a Class System to which all the major manufacturers adhere.

==Forklift safety==

===Standards===
Forklift safety is subject to a variety of standards worldwide. The most important standard is the ANSI B56—of which stewardship has now been passed from the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) to the Industrial Truck Standards Development Foundation (ITSDF) after multi-year negotiations. ITSDF is a non-profit organization whose only purpose is the promulgation and modernization of the B56 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial Truck Standards Development Foundation |url=http://www.itsdf.org |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314141011/http://www.itsdf.org/ |archivedate=14 March 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forklift safety standards have been implemented in the United States by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and in the United Kingdom by the [[Health and Safety Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OSHA Standards: Powered Industrial Trucks |url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/poweredindustrialtrucks/standards.html |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082839/http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/poweredindustrialtrucks/standards.html |archivedate=22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driver safety===
In many countries, forklift truck operators must be trained and certified to operate forklift trucks. Certification may be required for each individual class of lift that an operator would use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forkliftcertificationhub.com/|title=Forklift Certification Hub|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217091914/http://forkliftcertificationhub.com/|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forklift training has many names, such as forklift licensing or forklift certification. Whichever term is used, training must adhere to federal or national standards.

Health care providers should not recommend that workers who [[Driving|drive]] or use [[heavy equipment]] such as forklifts treat chronic or acute pain with [[opioids]].&lt;ref name="ACOEMfive"&gt;{{Citation |author=American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |author-link=American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |date=February 2014 |title=Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher=American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |work=[[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-occupational-and-environmental-medicine/ |accessdate=24 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001813/http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-occupational-and-environmental-medicine/ |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, which cites

===Forklift training in the United States===
In the United States, workplace forklift training is governed federally by OSHA the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  In 1999, OSHA updated its 29 CFR 1910.178 regulations governing "Powered Industrial Trucks" (the term OSHA uses to include forklifts among other types of industrial vehicles.) A major component of these regulations deals with forklift operator training. The standard requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation, the types of vehicle(s) being used in the workplace,&lt;ref&gt;OSHA Interpretation on Forklift Training - http://www.oshainterpretations.com/1910_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Standards/?url=/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS~p_id=22751&amp;n=Powered%20industrial%20truck%20training:%20%20different%20types%20of%20trucks {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928193356/http://www.oshainterpretations.com/1910_Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Standards/?url=%2Fpls%2Foshaweb%2Fowadisp.show_document%3Fp_table%3DINTERPRETATIONS~p_id%3D22751&amp;n=Powered%20industrial%20truck%20training%3A%20%20different%20types%20of%20trucks |date=28 September 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the hazards of the workplace created by the use of the vehicle(s), and the general safety requirements of the OSHA standard. OSHA believes that trained operators must know how to do the job properly and do it safely as demonstrated by workplace evaluation. Formal (lecture, video, etc.) and practical (demonstration and practical exercises) training must be provided. Employers must also certify that each operator has received the training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. Prior to operating the truck in the workplace, the employer must evaluate the operator's performance and determine the operator to be competent to operate a powered industrial truck safely. Refresher training is needed whenever an operator demonstrates a deficiency in the safe operation of the truck.&lt;ref&gt;OSHA' Website - Frequently Asked Questions about Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training - {{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/library/pit/pit_q-a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406222643/https://www.osha.gov/dte/library/pit/pit_q-a.html |archivedate=6 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forklift training in the United Kingdom===
In the UK, the [[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998|Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations]] state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/l117.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; issued in 2013. Third party organisations have developed [[de facto standard|de facto]] 'best practice' standards for forklift training, commonly referred to in the UK as a 'forklift licence', these are no longer recognised as proof of training as defined in the COP 117 (third edition) and as such training is '''not''' a legal requirement as is commonly believed.&lt;ref name=training01&gt;{{cite web |title=Fork Lift Truck Association factsheet "How long does a forklift licence last?" |url=http://www.fork-truck.org.uk/web_images/manuals/factsheets/FS12.pdf |format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised training however helps to demonstrate that an employer has taken steps to ensure its 'duty of care' in the unfortunate event of an accident.

In the UK, forklift training is carried out by a number of different voluntary standard training organisations, They can be directly recognised by the HSE who have formed a new organisation known as "Accrediting Body Association Work place transport 2012".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abawt.co.uk|title=ABA - Workplace Transport|website=ABA - Workplace Transport|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728225519/http://www.abawt.co.uk/|archivedate=28 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases qualified forklift instructors must be registered with at least one of the voluntary training organisations. Although RTITB operators are registered on a database which has to be a 3 yearly basis, the amount of time determined between refresher courses is subject to the H&amp;S Executive, Insurance companies or company policies. The H&amp;S Executive (HSG136 Workplace Transport Safety) does recommend re-training/testing every 3 to 5 years.&lt;ref name="HSE Refresher Training"&gt;{{cite web|title=Refresher Training|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/workplacetransport/personnel/refreshertraining.htm|work=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=5 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209113610/http://www.hse.gov.uk/workplacetransport/personnel/refreshertraining.htm|archivedate=9 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forklift instructors throughout the UK tend to operate either as small independent training companies or as a part of a larger training provider. Training is delivered in one of two ways; on-site (sometimes referred to as in-house training) where training is delivered to a clients' premises making use of their own equipment, or off-site (public courses) at a training centre. Training centres offer the opportunity for the unemployed with little or no forklift operating experience to achieve a certificate of competence and increase their employment opportunities. Training certification standards at schools tends to follow closely the standard required by their individual Training Standards Accrediting Body to which they are affiliated. It is not unusual for a Training school to be registered with one or more body at any one time.

The British Industrial Truck Association (BITA) categorises the different forklift truck types into groups and assigned a unique identifier to each classification. Known as the ‘BITA List’ it has become accepted as a standard in the UK. Forklift training certificates display the appropriate BITA classification to clearly identify the confines of the certification.&lt;ref name="BITA List"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forklift Certification - BITA List Classification|url=http://www.didacindustrial.co.uk/certification/fork-lift-truck-certification-bita-list|work=Didac Ltd Industrial Training Services|publisher=Didac Ltd|accessdate=6 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103005623/http://www.didacindustrial.co.uk/certification/fork-lift-truck-certification-bita-list/|archivedate=3 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forklift training in Australia===
Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.

Whilst the Occupational Health and Safety laws of the different states were based on similar underlying principles there were differences between the various jurisdictions in the detail and application of those Occupational Health and Safety laws.

In 2008 the Inter-Governmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety was formed between the Commonwealth of Australia and the six states and two territories of Australia to formalize cooperation between these jurisdictions on the harmonization of Occupational Health and Safety legislation.&lt;ref name=government_agreement&gt;{{cite web |title=Inter-Governmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety |url=http://www.coag.gov.au/sites/default/files/OHS_IGA.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327155936/http://www.coag.gov.au/sites/default/files/OHS_IGA.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the national Model Work Health and Safety Act (WHS) was enacted following a review of work health and safety laws across Australia, which review included significant public consultation. This act was finalized in June 2011.&lt;ref name=national_act&gt;[http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/pages/model-work-health-safety-act-23-june-2011 Model Work Health and Safety Act(WHS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328060437/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/about/publications/pages/model-work-health-safety-act-23-june-2011 |date=28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act formed a framework for the individual jurisdictions to enact supporting legislation, as the individual jurisdictions are tasked with managing State and Territory Occupational Health and Safety laws, including the issue of licences coming under the legislation.

Each individual state and territory issue licences in their own jurisdiction, including what is known as "high-risk work licences" for high-risk work. Forklift licences are classed as "high-risk work licences".&lt;ref name=high_risk_work&gt;[http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/whs-information/licensing/high-risk-work/pages/high-risk-work-licences-high-risk-work High Risk Work Licences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331081031/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/whs-information/licensing/high-risk-work/pages/high-risk-work-licences-high-risk-work |date=31 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. The unit of competence is known as the National High Risk Licence Unit of Competence TLILIC2001 – Licence to Operate a Forklift Truck, or in the case of an LO licence Unit of Competence TLILIC2002 – Licence to Operate an Order Picking Forklift Truck. There is a fee attached which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Forklift licences issued in one jurisdiction are recognized in all. Licence cancellation in one jurisdiction is also recognized in all.

===Forklift training in New Zealand===
Forklift operator training is divided into two types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/forklift-driver-training/ |title=Forklift training in New Zealand |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327060653/https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/forklift-driver-training/ |archivedate=27 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operator's certificate (previously OSH certificate)
* F endorsement

The operator's certificate is based on the Approved Code of Practice for Training Operators and Instructors of Powered Industrial Lift Trucks ('ACOP')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.competenz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/ACOP-Aug-1995.pdf|title=Approved Code of Practice for Training Operators and Instructors of Powered Industrial Lift Trucks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210042111/https://www.competenz.org.nz/assets/Uploads/ACOP-Aug-1995.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1995 by the then Department of Labour. It gives permission for operators to operate a forklift in an enclosed space (i.e. a space not considered to be a 'road'). The F endorsement is an additional qualification which allows an operator to use a forklift on a public road. Operators with an operator's certificate are not required to have a car driver licence, but to hold an F endorsement an operator must hold a class 1 (car) driver licence for forklifts up to 18000&amp;nbsp;kg or a class 2 (heavy rigid vehicle) driver licence for forklifts over 18000&amp;nbsp;kg as the endorsements are printed on the licence.

The ACOP is a set of best practices, guidelines and recommendations for training a forklift operator. However, training should be tailored to the operator's specific needs and the attachments they use, as required under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worksafe.govt.nz/managing-health-and-safety/businesses/providing-information-training-instruction-or-supervision-for-workers/|title=Health and Safety at Work Act 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416201920/https://worksafe.govt.nz/managing-health-and-safety/businesses/providing-information-training-instruction-or-supervision-for-workers/|archivedate=16 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training consists of a theory session delivered in-person or online followed by a brief practical assessment of 15–20 minutes. If the ACOP guidelines are followed this consists of a stacking and destacking pallets at low, medium and high levels, as well as driving forwards and in reverse around a coned figure-of-eight while carrying a load.

====Unit standards====
Unit standards are available for forklift training but are not required. The primary unit standard is US10851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/assessment/view-detailed.do?standardNumber=10851|title=Forklift unit standard 10851|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511230614/http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/assessment/view-detailed.do?standardNumber=10851|archivedate=11 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attachments====
The ACOP deals specifically with a forklift operator using only the standard forks. Forklift attachments, such as barrel clamps, fork extensions, rotators and personnel cages are covered under a separate unit standard (US10852). It is not mandatory to achieve a unit standard; a company can simply induct the operator on the attachments used.

===Safety Products===
A number of solutions can be found on the market today to reduce occupational hazards caused by forklifts.

====Pedestrian Detection Systems==== 
[[File:Blaxtair 7.jpg|thumb|right|A pedestrian detection system.]]
These are proximity sensors that detect objects and pedestrians from a few centimeters to several meters. The sensor makes the difference between a person and an object and alerts the driver without useless alarms. 
Based on stereovision, an algorithm analyses in real time if a person is in a blind zone of the forklift.

====Ultrasound Radars==== 
Ultrasonic sensors are proximity sensors that detect objects at distances ranging from a few centimeters to several meters. The sensor beeps and measures the time it takes for the signal to return. It does not discriminate between people and objects. Any obstacle located behind the truck will be detected. Normally, this type of sensor is used only for detection in rear areas.

====RF Systems====
These are solutions that alert forklift drivers of the people found in its vicinity. Pedestrians must carry a radio frequency device (electronic tags) which, emit a signal when a truck detects them, alerting the driver of the potential risk of an accident. It detects both in the front and at the back and it differentiates between people and the usual obstacles found in warehouses. For this reason, the driver is only alerted when there is a pedestrian near the truck. 
There are different solutions on the market:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7041">A '''global distribution system''' (GDS) is a computerised network system owned or operated by a company that enables transactions between travel industry service providers, mainly airlines, hotels, car rental companies, and [[Travel agency|travel agencies]]. The GDS mainly uses ''real-time inventory'' (for e.g. number of hotel rooms available, number of flight seats available, or number of cars available) to service providers. Travel Agencies traditionally relied on GDS for services, products &amp; rates in order to provision travel-related services to the end consumers. Thus, a GDS can link services, rates and bookings consolidating products and services across all three travel sectors: i.e., airline reservations, hotel reservations, car rentals.

GDS is different from a [[Computer reservation system|computer reservations system]], which is a reservation system used by the service providers (also known as vendors). Primary customers of GDS are travel agents (both online and office-based) to make reservation on various reservation systems run by the vendors. GDS holds no inventory; the inventory is held on the vendor's reservation system itself. A GDS system will have real-time link to the vendor's database. For example, when a travel agency requests a reservation on the service of a particular airline company, the GDS system routes the request to the appropriate airline's computer reservations system.

==Example of a booking facilitation done by an airline GDS==
A mirror image of the [[passenger name record]] (PNR) in the [[airline reservations system]] is maintained in the GDS system. If a passenger books an itinerary containing air segments of multiple airlines through a travel agency, the passenger name record in the GDS system would hold information on their entire itinerary, each airline they fly on would only have a portion of the itinerary that is relevant to them. This would contain flight segments on their own services and inbound and onward connecting flights (known as info segments) of other airlines in the itinerary. e.g. if a passenger books a journey from Amsterdam to London on KLM, London to New York on British Airways, New York to Frankfurt on Lufthansa through a travel agent and if the travel agent is connected to Amadeus GDS. The PNR in the Amadeus GDS would contain the full itinerary, the PNR in KLM would show the Amsterdam to London segment along with British Airways flight as an onward info segment. Likewise the PNR in the Lufthansa system would show the New York to Frankfurt segment with the British Airways flight as an arrival information segment. The PNR in British Airways system would show all three segments. One as a live segment and the other two as arrival and onward info segments.

Some GDS systems (primarily [[Amadeus CRS]] and [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]]) also have a dual use capability for hosting multiple computer reservations system, in such situations functionally the computer reservations system and the GDS partition of the system behave as if they were separate systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Global-Distribution-System-GDS.html What is global distribution system (GDS)? definition and meaning].

== Systems and vendors ==

=== List ===
While the most famous GDS systems globally are Amadeus, Sabre and [[Travelport]] (Galileo, Worldspan and Apollo) there are other smaller regional GDS systems in specific markets. For. e.g. Travelsky is a state owned company in China.

== Future of GDS systems and companies ==

GDS in the travel industry originated from a traditional legacy business model that existed to inter-operate between airline vendors and travel agents. During the early days of computerized reservations systems flight ticket reservations were not possible without a GDS. As time progressed, many airline vendors (including budget and mainstream operators) have now adopted a strategy of 'direct selling' to their wholesale and retail customers (passengers). They invested heavily in their own reservations and direct-distribution channels and partner systems. This helps to minimize direct dependency on GDS systems to meet sales and revenue targets and allows for a more dynamic response to market needs. These technology advancements in this space facilitate an easier way to cross-sell to partner airlines and via travel agents, eliminating the dependency on a dedicated global GDS federating between systems. Also, multiple [[Comparison shopping website|price comparison websites]] eliminate the need of dedicated GDS for point-in-time prices and inventory for both travel agents and end-customers. Hence some experts argue that these changes in business models may lead to complete phasing out of GDS in the Airline space by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businesstravelnews.com/Business-Travel-Research/Vision-2020--Old-Dogs,-New-Tricks-And-The-Future-Of-GDSs&lt;/ref&gt;

Lufthansa Group announced in June 2015 that it was imposing an additional charge of €16 when booking through an external Global Distribution System rather than their own systems. They stated their choice was based upon that the costs of using external systems was several times higher than their own. Several other airlines including Air France–KLM and Emirates also stated that they are following the development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jainchill|first1=Johanna|title=Lufthansa to add surcharge for GDS bookings|url=http://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/Lufthansa-to-charge-fee-for-GDS-bookings|website=Travel Weekly|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buying ticket from airline website cheaper than travel agency|url=http://www.emirates247.com/business/corporate/buying-ticket-from-airline-website-cheaper-than-travel-agency-2015-06-12-1.593520|website=emirates 24/7|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, hotels and car rental industry continue to benefit from GDS, especially last-minute inventory disposal using GDS to bring additional operational revenue. GDS here is useful to facilitate global reach using existing network and low marginal costs when compared to online air travel bookings. 
Some GDS companies are also in the process of investing and establishing significant offshore capability in a move to reduce costs and improve their profit margins to serve their customer directly accommodating changing business models.

The '''ISO 14698 Standards''' features two International Standards on [[contamination|biocontamination]] control for [[cleanroom]]s. [[IEST]], the Secretariat and Administrator of ISO Technical Committee 209, helped develop this series of ISO 14698 Standards.&lt;ref&gt;

*'''ISO 14698-2, Cleanrooms and associated controlled environments—Biocontamination control, Part 2: Evaluation and interpretation of biocontamination data'''

==ISO 14698-1==

ISO 14698-1 was first written in 2003. ISO 14698-1 describes the principles and basic methodology for a formal system to assess and control biocontamination, where cleanroom technology is applied, in order that biocontamination in zones at risk can be monitored in a reproducible way and appropriate control measures can be selected. In zones of low or negligible risk this standard may be used as a source of information.&lt;ref&gt;

==ISO 14698-2==

ISO 14698-2 became available to the public in October 2003. ISO 14698-2 gives guidance on basic principles and methodological requirements for all [[microbiological]] data evaluation, and the estimation of biocontamination data obtained from sampling for viable particles in zones at risk, as specified by the system selected. This is not intended for testing the performance of microbiological counting techniques of determining viable units.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">An '''instruction window''' in [[computer architecture]] refers to the set of [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]]s which can [[out-of-order execution|execute out-of-order]] in a [[speculative execution|speculative]] [[processor (computing)|processor]].

In particular, in a conventional design, the instruction window consists of all instructions which are in the [[re-order buffer]] (ROB).&lt;ref&gt;Shen and Lipasti. ''Modern Processor Design: Fundamentals of Superscalar Processors.'' McGraw-Hill, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a processor, any instruction within the instruction window can be executed when its operands are ready. Out-of-order processors derive their name because this may occur out-of-order (if operands to a younger instruction are ready before those of an older instruction).

The instruction window has a finite size, and new instructions can enter the window (usually called ''dispatch'' or ''allocate'') only when other instructions leave the window (usually called ''retire'' or ''commit''). Instructions enter and leave the instruction window in program order, and an instruction can only leave the window when it is the oldest instruction in the window and it has been completed. Hence, the instruction window can be seen as a sliding window in which the instructions can become out-of-order. All execution within the window is speculative (i.e., side-effects are not applied outside the CPU) until it is committed in order to support asynchronous [[exception handling]] like [[interrupt]]s.

This paradigm is also known as '''restricted dataflow'''&lt;ref&gt;Patt et al., ''HPS, A New Microarchitecture: Rationale and Introduction.'' In IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; because instructions within the window execute in dataflow order (not necessarily in program order) but the window in which this occurs is restricted (of finite size).

The instruction window is distinct from [[Instruction pipeline|pipelining]]: instructions in an in-order pipeline are not in an instruction window in the conventionally understood sense, because they cannot execute out of order with respect to one another. Out-of-order processors are usually built around pipelines, but many of the pipeline stages (e.g., front-end instruction fetch and decode stages) are not considered to be part of the instruction window.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18209">The '''magnetic amplifier''' (colloquially known as a "mag amp") is an [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] device for amplifying electrical signals.   The magnetic amplifier was invented early in the 20th century, and was used as an alternative to [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers where robustness and high current capacity were required.   [[World War II]] [[Germany]] perfected this type of amplifier, and it was used in the [[V-2 rocket]].  The magnetic amplifier was most prominent in power control and low-frequency signal applications from 1947 to about 1957, when the [[transistor]] began to supplant it.&lt;ref name=Westman68&gt;H. P. Westman et al, (ed), ''Reference Data for Radio Engineers, Fifth Edition'', 1968, Howard W. Sams and Co., no ISBN, Library of Congress Card No. 43-14665 chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The magnetic amplifier has now been largely superseded by the transistor-based amplifier, except in a few safety critical, high-reliability or extremely demanding applications. Combinations of transistor and mag-amp techniques are still used.

== Principle of operation ==
[[File:Magnetic amplifier.svg|thumb|right|A saturable reactor, illustrating the principle of a magnetic amplifier]]
Visually a mag amp device may resemble a [[transformer]], but the operating principle is quite different from a transformer – essentially the mag amp is a [[saturable reactor]]. It makes use of [[saturation (magnetic)|magnetic saturation]] of the core, a non-linear property of a certain class of transformer cores. For controlled saturation characteristics, the magnetic amplifier employs core materials that have been designed to have a specific [[hysteresis#Magnetic hysteresis|B-H curve]] shape that is highly rectangular, in contrast to the slowly tapering B-H curve of softly saturating core materials that are often used in normal transformers.

The typical magnetic amplifier consists of two physically separate but similar transformer [[magnetic cores]], each of which has two windings: a control winding and an AC winding. A small DC current from a low-impedance source is fed into the series-connected control windings.  The AC windings may be connected either in series or in parallel, the configurations resulting in different types of mag amps. The amount of control current fed into the control winding sets the point in the AC winding waveform at which either core will saturate. In saturation, the AC winding on the saturated core will go from a high-impedance state ("off") into a very low-impedance state ("on") – that is, the control current controls the point at which voltage the mag amp switches "on".

A relatively small DC current on the control winding is able to control or switch large AC currents on the AC windings. This results in current amplification.

Two magnetic cores are used because the AC current will generate high voltage in the control windings. By connecting them in opposite phase, the two cancel each other, so that no current is induced in the control circuit.

== Strengths ==
The magnetic amplifier is a static device with no moving parts. It has no wear-out mechanism and has a good tolerance to mechanical shock and vibration.  It requires no warm-up time.&lt;ref name="Storm55"/&gt;
Multiple isolated signals may be summed by additional control windings on the magnetic cores. The windings of a magnetic amplifier have a higher tolerance to momentary overloads than comparable solid-state devices. The magnetic amplifier is also used as a transducer in applications such as current measurement and the [[Magnetometer|flux gate compass]]. The reactor cores of magnetic amplifiers withstand neutron radiation extremely well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynn |first1=Gordon E. |last2=Pula |first2=Thaddeus J. |last3=Ringelman |first3=John F. |last4=Timmel |first4=Frederick G. |year=1960 |chapter=Effects on Nuclear Radiation on Magnetic Materials |title=Self-saturating Magnetic Amplifiers |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |lccn=60-6979 |quote=The nature of ferromagnetic materials results in far less damage from nuclear radiation than is done to [[semiconductor materials]]. … One study devoted to the problem indicates that the major damage to core material suitable for self-saturating magnetic amplifiers consists of loss of loop rectangularity and increased dynamic coercive force. This study was made at a total integrated neutron flux of 2.7 ✕ &lt;math&gt;10^{18}&lt;/math&gt; neutrons/&lt;math&gt;cm^2&lt;/math&gt;. |ref=Lynn1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this special reason magnetic amplifiers have been used in nuclear power applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilmore |first1=Ken |date=July 1960 |title=Magnetic Amplifiers – how they work and what they do |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Poptronics/60s/60/Pop-1960-07.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Popular Electronics |location=New York, New York |publisher=Ziff-Davis Publishing Company |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=71–75, 109 |accessdate=2014-10-20 |quote=The electronic watchdogs that keep the Triton's powerful nuclear plant operating without a hitch are magnetic amplifiers – almost hundred of them are used for this critical job. |ref=Gilmore1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The gain available from a single stage is limited and low compared to electronic amplifiers. Frequency response of a high-gain amplifier is limited to about one-tenth the excitation frequency, although this is often mitigated by exciting magnetic amplifiers with currents at higher than [[utility frequency]].&lt;ref name=Westman68/&gt; Solid-state electronic amplifiers can be more compact and efficient than magnetic amplifiers. The bias and feedback windings are not unilateral and may couple energy back from the controlled circuit into the control circuit. This complicates the design of multistage amplifiers when compared with electronic devices.&lt;ref name=Westman68/&gt;

== Applications ==
Magnetic amplifiers were important as modulation and control amplifiers in the early development of voice transmission by radio.&lt;ref name=Storm55&gt;H. F. Storm, ''Magnetic Amplifiers'', John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1955 page 383&lt;/ref&gt; A magnetic amplifier was used as voice modulator for a 2 kilowatt [[Alexanderson alternator]], and magnetic amplifiers were used in the keying circuits of large high-frequency alternators used for radio communications. Magnetic amplifiers were also used to regulate the speed of Alexanderson alternators to maintain the accuracy of the transmitted radio frequency.&lt;ref name=Storm55/&gt; Magnetic amplifiers were used to control large high-power alternators by turning them on and off for [[telegraphy]] or to vary the signal for voice modulation.  The alternator's frequency limits were rather low to where a frequency multiplier had to be utilized to generate higher radio frequencies than the alternator was capable of producing.  Even so, early magnetic amplifiers incorporating powdered-iron cores were incapable of producing radio frequencies above approximately 200&amp;nbsp;kHz.  Other core materials, such as ferrite cores and oil-filled transformers, would have to be developed to allow the amplifier to produce higher frequencies.

The ability to control large currents with small control power made magnetic amplifiers useful for control of lighting circuits, for [[stage lighting]] and for advertising signs. Saturable reactor amplifiers were used for control of power to industrial furnaces.&lt;ref name=Storm55/&gt; Magnetic amplifiers are still used in some arc welders.

Small magnetic amplifiers were used for radio tuning indicators, control of small motor and cooling fan speed, control of battery chargers.

Magnetic amplifiers were used extensively as the switching element in early switched-mode ([[Switched-mode power supply|SMPS]]) power supplies,&lt;ref&gt;Abraham I. Pressman (1997). ''Switching Power Supply Design''. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-07-052236-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in lighting control. [[Semiconductor]]-based solid-state switches have largely superseded them, though recently there has been some regained interest in using mag amps in compact and reliable switching power supplies. PC [[ATX]] power supplies often use mag amps for secondary side voltage regulation. Cores designed specifically for switch mode power supplies are currently manufactured by several large electromagnetics companies, including Metglas and Mag-Inc.

Magnetic amplifiers were used by locomotives to detect wheel slip, until replaced by [[Hall Effect]] current transducers. The cables from two [[traction motors]] passed through the core of the device.  During normal operation the resultant flux was zero as both currents were the same and in opposite directions. The currents would differ during wheel slip, producing a resultant flux that acted as the Control winding, developing a voltage across a resistor in series with the AC winding which was sent to the wheel slip correction circuits.

Magnetic amplifiers can be used for measuring high DC-voltages without direct connection to the high voltage and are therefore still used in the [[HVDC]]-technique. The current to be measured is passed through the two cores, possibly by a solid bus bar. There is almost no voltage drop in this bus bar. The output signal, proportional to the ampere turns in the control current bus bar, is derived from the alternating excitation voltage of the magnetic amplifier, there is no voltage created or induced on the bus bar. The output signal has only a magnetic connection with the bus bar so the bus may be, quite safely, at any ([[High voltage|EHT]]) voltage with respect to the instrumentation.

Instrumentation magnetic amplifiers are commonly found on space craft where a clean electromagnetic environment is highly desirable. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The German [[Kriegsmarine]] made extensive use of the magnetic amplifiers. They were used for the master stable element systems, for slow moving transmission for controlling guns, directors and rangefinders and train and elevation controls. Magnetic amplifiers were used in aircraft systems ([[avionics]]) before the advent of high reliability semiconductors. They were important in implementing early [[autoland]] systems and [[Concorde]] made use of the technology for the control of its [[Concorde#Engines|engine air intakes]] before development of a system using digital electronics.  Magnetic amplifiers were used in stabilizer controls of [[V-2 rocket|V2 rockets]].

===Usage in computing===
Magnetic amplifiers were widely studied during the 1950s as a potential switching element for [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers. Mag amps could be used to sum several inputs in a single core, which was useful in the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU). Custom tubes could do the same, but transistors could not, so the mag amp was able to combine the advantages of tubes and transistors in an era when the latter were expensive and unreliable.

The principles of magnetic amplifiers were applied non linearly to create [[magnetic logic|magnetic digital logic gates]]. That era was short, lasting from the mid-1950s to about 1960, when new fabrication techniques produced great improvements in transistors and dramatically lowered their cost. Only one large-scale mag amp machine was put into production, the [[UNIVAC Solid State]], but a number of contemporary late-1950s/early-1960s computers used the technology, like the [[Ferranti Orion]] and the English Electric [[KDF9]], or the one-off [[MAGSTEC]]. The best known type of this is [[magnetic core memory]].

== History ==

===Early development===

A voltage source and a series connected [[variable resistor]] may be regarded as a [[direct current]] signal source for a low resistance load such as the control coil of a saturable reactor which amplifies the signal. Thus, in principle, a saturable reactor is already an [[amplifier]], although before 20th century they were used for simple tasks, such as controlling lighting and electrical machinery as early as 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Electronics Design and Development Division |editor-link= |title=Magnetic Amplifiers – A Rising Star in Naval Electronics |date=May 1954 |origyear=1951 |publisher=Bureau of Ships, Department of the Navy |location=18th and Constitution Avenue, Washington 25, D.C. |id=NAVSHIPS 900,172 |page=2 |chapter=History |quote=The magnetic amplifier is not new – the principles of the saturable core control were used in electrical machinery as early as 1885 although they were not identified as such. |ref=Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mali |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Mali |title=Magnetic Amplifiers – Principles and Applications |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114175548/http://www.pmillett.com/Books/mag_amp.pdf |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-19 |date=August 1960 |publisher=John F.

In 1904 radio pioneer [[Reginald Fessenden]] placed an order for a high frequency rotary mechanical alternator from the General Electric Company capable of generate AC at a frequency of 100 kHz to be used for continuous wave radio transmission over great distances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/alexanderson.html Ernst F. Alexanderson, The accomplishments and life of E. F. Alexanderson, 1878-1975, Edison Tech Center- 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milestones:Alexanderson Radio Alternator, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; The design job was given to General Electric engineer Ernst F. Alexanderson who developed the 2&amp;nbsp;kW [[Alexanderson alternator]]. By 1916 Alexanderson added a magnetic amplifier to control the transmission of these rotary alternators for transoceanic radio communication.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Thomas G.|title=The Evolution of Power Electronics|journal= Fourteenth Annual Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, 1999. APEC '99|year=1999|volume=1|pages=3–9|doi=10.1109/APEC.1999.749482}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/the_magnetic_amplifier George Trinkaus, The Magnetic Amplifier, Nuts &amp; Volts Magazine - February 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The experimental telegraphy and telephony demonstrations made during 1917 attracted the attention of the US Government, especially in light of partial failures in the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transoceanic cable]] across the Atlantic Ocean.  The 50&amp;nbsp;kW alternator was commandeered by the US Navy and put into service in January 1918 and was used until 1920, when a 200&amp;nbsp;kW generator-alternator set was built and installed.

===Usage in electric power generation===
Magnetic amplifiers were extensively used in electricity power generation from the early 1960s onwards. They provided the small signal amplification for generator automatic voltage regulation (AVR) from a small error signal at milliwatt (mW) level to 100&amp;nbsp;kilowatt (kW) level. This was in turn converted by a rotating machine (exciter) to 5&amp;nbsp;megawatt (MW) level, the excitation power required by a typical 500&amp;nbsp;MW Power Plant Turbine Generator Unit. They proved durable and reliable. Many are recorded in service through the mid-1990s and some are still in use at older generating stations, notably in hydroelectric plants operating in northern California.

== Misnomer uses ==
[[File:Lundahl MagAmp schematic.png|thumb|320px|right|A ''real'' magnetic audio amplifier, designed by Swedish engineer Lars Lundahl, utilizes saturable reactors in its final power amplifying stage.]]
In the 1970s, [[Robert W. Carver|Robert Carver]] designed and produced several high quality high-powered audio amplifiers, calling them magnetic amplifiers. In fact, they were in most respects conventional audio amplifier designs with unusual power supply circuits. They were not magnetic amplifiers as defined in this article. That should not be confused with real magnetic audio amplifiers, which also exist.

'''Maleyka Mehdi qizi Abbaszadeh''' ({{lang-az|Məleykə Abbaszadə}}, née '''Mustafayeva''', born 1953, [[Baku]]) is the Chair of the State Students Admission Commission of [[Azerbaijan]].

==Career==
Maleyka Abbaszadeh was born in Baku and attended Public School #189. In 1975, she graduated from the [[Moscow State University]] majoring in calculus and cybernetics. She did an internship at the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]] Institute of Cybernetics and for the next two years, at the Institute of Calculus Mathematics of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]]. In 1988, she defended her masters thesis in cybernetics at the [[Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] Institute of Cybernetics. Until 1994, Abbaszadeh worked on a number of government and non-government projects in the field of education.&lt;ref name="genderaz"&gt;[http://www.gender-az.org/index_az.shtml?id_main=11&amp;id_sub=36 Azərbaycanın qadın siyasətçiləri]. Azerbaijan Gender Information Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, she was appointed Deputy Chair of the State Students Admission Commission (SSAC), a newly established organisation in charge of the national entrance test for aspiring post-secondary students. In October 2000, she was appointed head of the said committee.&lt;ref name="genderaz"/&gt; As the Chair of the SSAC, Abbaszadeh was a vocal critic of the education policy under ex-Minister of Education [[Misir Mardanov]], which, according to her, yielded lower examination score among prospective students year after year.&lt;ref name="azadliq"&gt;[http://www.azadliq.info/asagi-manset/351-asagi-manshet/27358-meleyke-abbaszade-tekebburlu.html Fəzail Ağamalı: "Məleykə Abbaszadə təkəbbürlü və kariyeristdir"].

Haqqin.az. 9 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, she openly questioned the transparency of the Best School and Best Teacher award contest held by the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/npo/blok/3819-novaya-voyna-mezhdu-misirom-i-maleykoy.html Новая война между Мисиром и Малейкой]. Haqqin.az. 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she accused the Ministry of reporting false numbers of students currently enrolled in secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;Rauf Orujov.

Zerkalo. 4 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbaszadeh also pointed out significant flaws and errors in the Ministry-approved textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.info/xeberler-menu/311-son-xbrlr/27415-tqdk-dan-fezail-agamaliya-cavab.html TQDK-dan Fəzail Ağamalıya cavab]. Azadlig. 19 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to opposition media, Abbaszadeh's towering criticism of Mardanov was in fact part of the behind-the-scene campaign orchestrated by the [[Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan Republic|Presidential Administration]] and aimed at removing Misir Mardanov from his position.&lt;ref name="azadliq"/&gt; Mardanov, one of the most controversial ministers,&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lent.az/news.php?id=43777 |title=Misir Mərdanov: "Dostbazlıq eləməyə imkanım olmayıb" |trans-title=Misir Mardanov: "I had no opportunity to have more friends" |publisher = Lent.az |author= Elkhan Salakhov |location = Baku |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced by Mikayil Jabbarov as the Education Minister on 19 April 2013 by a presidential decree.

==Personal life==
Abbaszadeh was married to Ilgar Abbaszadeh, but is now divorced. They have two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.168.az/news/analytics/4974 Məleykə Abbaszadənin ərə getməsi xəbəri yalan çıxdı]. 168.az. 5 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Abbaszadeh's daughter [[Nargiz Birk-Petersen]] was one of the three presenters of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]] held in Baku.&lt;ref name="azadinform"&gt;[http://ru.azadinform.az/news/a-7418.html Maleyka Abbaszadeh: 'I'm Proud of My Daughter Nargiz'].

The '''Mineral Products Association''' ('''MPA''') is the [[United Kingdom]] [[trade association]] for the [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]s, [[asphalt]], [[cement]], [[concrete]], dimension stone, [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]],  and [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] sand industries.

==Membership==
The Mineral Products Association (MPA) is the trade association for the aggregates, asphalt, cement, concrete, dimension stone, lime, mortar and silica sand industries. With the affiliation of British Precast, the British Association of Reinforcement (BAR), Eurobitume, QPA Northern Ireland, MPA Scotland and the British Calcium Carbonate Federation, it has a growing membership of 480 companies and is the sectoral voice for mineral products. MPA membership is made up of the vast majority of independent SME quarrying companies throughout the UK, as well as the 9 major international and global companies. It covers 100% of UK cement production, 90% of aggregates production, 95% of asphalt and over 70% of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete production. Each year the industry supplies £20 billion worth of materials and services to the Economy and is the largest supplier to the construction industry, which has annual output valued at £144billion. Industry production represents the largest materials flow in the UK economy and is also one of the largest manufacturing sectors.

==History==
The Mineral Products Association (MPA) was formed in March 2009 from the merger of the Quarry Products Association, the British Cement Association and The Concrete Centre. MPA was officially launched in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineralproducts.org/09-release003.html|title=MPA - Mineral Products Association - Press release 2009|publisher=|accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanometrology''' is a subfield of [[metrology]], concerned with the science of [[measurement]] at the [[nanoscale]] level. Nanometrology has a crucial role in order to produce nanomaterials and devices with a high degree of accuracy and reliability in [[nanomanufacturing]].

A challenge in this field is to develop or create new measurement techniques and standards to meet the needs of next-generation advanced manufacturing, which will rely on nanometer scale materials and technologies. The needs for measurement and characterization of new sample structures and characteristics far exceed the capabilities of current measurement science. Anticipated advances in emerging U.S. nanotechnology industries will require revolutionary metrology with higher resolution and accuracy than has previously been envisioned.&lt;ref name="NIST08" /&gt;

==Introduction==
Control of the critical dimensions are the most important factors in nanotechnology. Nanometrology today, is to a large extent based on the development in [[semiconductor]] technology. Nanometrology is the science of [[measurement]] at the nanoscale level. Nanometer or nm is equivalent to 10^-9 m. In Nanotechnology accurate control of dimensions of objects is important. Typical dimensions of nanosystems vary from 10&amp;nbsp;nm to a few hundred nm and while fabricating such systems measurement up to 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm is required.
[[File:SEM chamber1.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A Scanning Electron Microscope| "[[Scanning electron microscope]]"]]
At nanoscale due to the small dimensions various new physical phenomena can be observed. For example, when the crystal size is smaller than the electron mean free path the [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of the crystal changes. Another example is the discretization of stresses in the system. It becomes important to measure the physical parameters so as to apply these phenomena into engineering of nanosystems and manufacturing them. The measurement of length or size, force, mass, electrical and other properties is included in Nanometrology.
The problem is how to measure these with reliability and accuracy. The measurement techniques used for macro systems cannot be directly used for measurement of parameters in nanosystems. Various techniques based on physical phenomena have been developed which can be used for measure or determine the parameters for nanostructures and nanomaterials. Some of the popular ones are [[X-Ray diffraction]], [[transmission electron microscopy]], High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, [[atomic force microscopy]], [[scanning electron microscopy]], field emission scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer, Emmett, Teller method to determine specific surface.

Nanotechnology is an important field because of the large number of applications it has and it has become necessary to develop more precise techniques of measurement and globally accepted standards. Hence progress is required in the field of Nanometrology.

==Development needs==
Nanotechnology can be divided into two branches. The first being [[molecular nanotechnology]] which involves bottom up manufacturing and the second is [[engineering nanotechnology]] which involve the development and processing of materials and systems at nanoscale. The measurement and manufacturing tools and techniques required for the two branches are slightly different.

Furthermore, Nanometrology requirements are different for the industry and research institutions. Nanometrology of research has progressed faster than that for industry mainly because implementing nanometrology for industry is difficult. In research oriented nanometrology resolution is important whereas in industrial nanometrology accuracy is given precedence over [[Sensor resolution|resolution]]. Further due to economic reasons it is important to have low time costs in industrial nanometrology it is not important for research nanometrology. The various measurement techniques available today require a controlled environment like in [[vacuum]], [[vibration]] and noise free environment. Also, in industrial nanometrology requires that the measurements be more quantitative with minimum number of parameters.

==Standards==

===International standards===
Metrology [[Standard (metrology)|standards]] are objects or ideas that are designated as being authoritative for some accepted reason. Whatever value they possess is useful for comparison to unknowns for the purpose of establishing or confirming an assigned value based on the standard. The execution of measurement comparisons for the purpose of establishing the relationship between a standard and some other measuring device is calibration. The ideal standard is independently reproducible without uncertainty. The worldwide market for products with nanotechnology applications is projected to be at least a couple of hundred billion dollars in the near future.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Until recently, there almost no established internationally accepted standards for nanotechnology related field. The [[International Organisation for Standardization]] TC-229 Technical Committee on Nanotechnology recently published few standards for terminology, characterization of [[nanomaterials]] and [[nanoparticles]] using measurement tools like [[Atomic force microscopy|AFM]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], [[Interferometer]]s, optoacoustic tools, gas adsorption methods etc. Certain standards for standardization of measurements for electrical properties have been published by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].
Some important standards which are yet to be established are standards for measuring thickness of thin films or layers, characterization of surface features, standards for force measurement at nanoscale, standards for characterization of critical dimensions of nanoparticles and nanostructures and also Standards for measurement for physical properties like conductivity, elasticity etc.

===National standards===
Because of the importance of nanotechnology in the future, countries around the world have programmes to establish national standards for nanometrology and nanotechnology. These programmes are run by the national standard agencies of the respective countries. In the United States, [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] has been working on developing new techniques for measurement at nanoscale and has also established some national standards for nanotechnology. These standards are for nanoparticle characterization, [[surface roughness|Roughness]] Characterization, [[magnification]] standard, [[calibration]] standards etc.

===Calibration===
It is difficult to provide samples using which precision instruments can be calibrated at nanoscale. Reference or [[calibration]] standards are important for repeatability to be ensured. But there are no international standards for calibration and the calibration artefacts provided by the company along with their equipment is only good for calibrating that particular equipment. Hence it is difficult to select a universal calibration artefact using which we can achieve repeatability at nanoscale. At nanoscale while calibrating care needs to be taken for influence of external factors like [[vibration]], [[noise]], motions caused by [[thermal drift]] and [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and internal factors like the interaction between the artefact and the equipment which can cause significant deviations.

==Measurement techniques==
In the last 70 years various techniques for measuring at nanoscale have been developed. Most of them based on some physical phenomena observed on particle interactions or forces at nanoscale. Some of the most commonly used techniques are Atomic Force Microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy.
[[File:Atomic force microscope block diagram.svg|thumb|right|alt=A Atomic Force Microscope|Block Diagram of atomic force microscope.]]
[[Atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) is one of the most common measurement techniques. It can be used to measure Topology, grain size, frictional characteristics and different forces. It consists of a silicon cantilever with a sharp tip with a radius of curvature of a few nanometers. The tip is used as a probe on the specimen to be measured. The forces acting at the atomic level between the tip and the surface of the specimen cause the tip to deflect and this deflection is detected using a laser spot which is reflected to an array of photodiodes.
[[File:ScanningTunnelingMicroscope schematic.png|thumb|left|alt=A Scanning Tunneling Microscope|Diagram of ''[[Scanning tunneling microscope]]''.]]
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is another instrument commonly used. It is used to measure 3-D topology of the specimen. The STM is based on the concept of quantum tunneling. When a conducting tip is brought very near to the surface to be examined, a bias (voltage difference) applied between the two can allow electrons to tunnel through the vacuum between them. Measurements are made by monitoring the current as the tip's position scans across the surface, which can then be used to display an image.

Another commonly used instrument is the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which apart from measuring the shape and size of the particles and topography of the surface can be used to determine the composition of elements and compounds the sample is composed of. In SEM the specimen surface is scanned with a high energy electron beam. The electrons in the beam interact with atoms in the specimen and interactions are detected using detectors. The interactions produced are back scattering of electrons, transmission of electrons, secondary electrons etc. To remove high angle electrons magnetics lenses are used.

The instruments mentioned above produce realistic pictures of the surface are excellent measuring tools for research. Industrial applications of nanotechnology require the measurements to be produced need to be more quantitative. The requirement in industrial nanometrology is for higher accuracy than resolution as compared to research nanometrology.

===Nano coordinate measuring machine===
A [[coordinate measuring machine]] (CMM) that works at the nanoscale would have a smaller frame than the CMM used for macroscale objects. This is so because it may provide the necessary stiffness and stability to achieve nanoscale uncertainties in x,y and z directions. The probes for such a machine need to be small to enable a 3-D measurement of nanometre features from the sides and from inside like nanoholes. Also for accuracy laser interferometers need to be used. NIST has developed a surface measuring instrument, called the Molecular Measuring Machine. This instrument is basically an STM.  The x- and y-axes are read out by laser interferometers. The molecules on the surface area can be identified individually and at the same time the distance between any two molecules can be determined. For measuring with molecular resolution, the measuring times become very large for even a very small surface area. Ilmenau Machine is another nanomeasuring machine developed by researchers at the Ilmenau University of Technology.
[[File:9.12.17 Coordinate measuring machine.png|thumb|right|alt=A CMM|Dimensional metrology using CMM.]]The components of a nano CMM include nanoprobes, control hardware, 3D-nanopositioning platform, and instruments with high [[Sensor resolution|resolution]] and [[accuracy]] for [[linear]] and angular measurement.

==Traceability==
In metrology at macro scale achieving traceability is quite easy and artefacts like scales, laser interferometers, step gauges, and straight edges are used. At nanoscale a [[crystalline]] [[HOPG|highly oriented pyrolytic graphite]] ([[HOPG]]), [[mica]] or [[silicon]] surface is considered suitable used as calibration artefact for achieving traceability. But it is not always possible to ensure traceability. Like what is a straight edge at nanoscale and even if take the same standard as that for macroscale there is no way to calibrate it accurately at nanoscale. This so because the requisite internationally or nationally accepted reference standards are not always there. Also the measurement equipment required to ensure traceability has not been developed. The generally used for traceability are miniaturisation of traditional [[metrology]] standards hence there is a need for establishing nanoscale standards. Also there is a need to establish some kind of uncertainty estimation model. Traceability is one of the fundamental requirements for manufacturing and assembly of products when multiple producers are there.

==Tolerance==
[[File:Diopsis.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A IC| "[[Integrated circuit]]" made using monolithic integration technique.]]
[[Engineering tolerance|Tolerance]] is the permissible limit or limits of variation in dimensions, properties, or conditions without significantly affecting functioning of equipment or a process. Tolerances are specified to allow reasonable leeway for imperfections and inherent variability without compromising performance. In nanotechnology the systems have dimensions in the range of nanometers. Defining tolerances at nanoscale with suitable calibration standards for traceability is difficult for different [[nanomanufacturing]] methods. There are various integration techniques developed in the semiconductor industry that are used in [[nanomanufacturing]].

===Integration techniques===
*In [[hetero integration]] direct fabrication of nanosystems from compound substrates is done. Geometric tolerances are required to achieve the functionality of the assembly.
*In [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid integration]] nanocomponents are placed or assembled on a substrate fabricating functioning nanosystems. In this technique, the most important control parameter is the positional accuracy of the components on the substrate.
*In [[Monolithic integrated circuit|monolithic integration]] all the fabrication process steps are integrated on a single substrate and hence no mating of components or assembly is required. The advantage of this technique is that the geometric measurements are no longer of primary importance for achieving functionality of nanosystem or control of the fabrication process.

==Classification of nanostructures==
There are a variety of nanostructures like nanocomposites, nanowires, nanopowders, nanotubes, fullerenes nanofibers, nanocages, nanocrystallites, [[nanoneedle]]s, nanofoams, nanomeshes, nanoparticles, nanopillars, thin films, nanorods, nanofabrics,  quantumdots etc. The most common way to classify nano structures is by their dimensions.
[[File:Epitaxial Nanowire Heterostructures SEM image.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A Nanowire| SEM of ''[[nanowire]]''.]]

===Dimensional classification===
{| border="1" cellpadding="2"
|-
! Dimensions
! Criteria
! Examples
|-
| Zero-dimensional  (0-D)
| The nanostructure has all dimensions in the nanometer range.
| Nanoparticles, [[quantum dots]], nanodots
|-
| One-dimensional   (1-D)
| One dimension of the nanostructure is outside the nanometer range.
| [[Nanowires]], nanorods, nanotubes
|-
| Two-dimensional   (2-D)
| Two dimensions of the nanostructure are outside the nanometer range.
| Coatings, thin-film-multilayers
|-
| Three-dimensional (3-D)
| Three dimensions of the nanostructure are outside the nanometer range.
| Bulk
|}

===Classification of grain structure===
Nanostructures can be classified on the basis of the grain structure and size there are made up of. This is applicable in the cas of 2-dimensional and 3-Dimensional Nanostructurs.

==Surface area measurement==
For [[nanopowder]] to determine the specific surface area the [[BET theory|B.E.T.]] method is commonly used. The drop of pressure of nitrogen in a closed container due to [[adsorption]] of the [[nitrogen]] molecules to the surface of the material inserted in the container is measured.  Also, the shape of the nanopowder particles is assumed to be spherical.

:D = 6/(ρ*A)

Where "D" is the effective diameter, "ρ" is the [[density]] and "A" is the surface area found from the B.E.T. method.

[[File:Fragrance pyramid.svg|thumb|Fragrance pyramid.]]
'''Notes''' in [[perfume]]ry are descriptors of scents that can be sensed upon the application of a perfume. Notes are separated into three classes; '''top/head notes''', '''middle/heart notes''', and '''base notes'''; which denote groups of scents which can be sensed with respect to the time after the application of a perfume. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process and intended use of the perfume. The presence of one note may alter the perception of another—for instance, the presence of certain base or heart notes will alter the scent perceived when the top notes are strongest, and likewise the scent of base notes in the dry-down will often be altered depending on the smells of the heart notes.

The idea of ''notes'' is used primarily for the marketing of fine fragrances. The term is sometimes used by [[perfumer]]s to describe approximately scents or the perfumery process to laypeople.

|-
|Top Notes: || 1 to 14 (most volatile)
|-
|Middle Notes: || 15 to 60
|-
|Base Notes: || 61 to 100 (least volatile)
|}

==Top notes==
Top notes are otherwise called the head notes.

Perceived immediately upon application of a perfume, top notes consist of small, light molecules that [[evaporation|evaporate]] quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of the product. The scents of this note class are usually described as "fresh", "assertive" or "sharp". The compounds that contribute to top notes are strong in scent, very volatile, and evaporate quickly. 

Although not as saliently perceived, the heart and base-notes contribute much to the scent in the top notes.

[[Citrus]] and [[ginger]] scents are common top notes.

==Middle notes==
They are also called the "heart notes".

The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to when the top notes dissipate. The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a perfume and emerge in the middle of the [[perfume]]'s dispersion process. They serve to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Not surprisingly, the scent of middle note compounds is usually more mellow and "rounded". Scents from this note class appear anywhere from twenty minutes to one hour after the application of a perfume. 

[[Lavender]] and [[rose]] scents are typical middle notes.

==Base notes==
The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class are often the fixatives used to hold and boost the strength of the lighter top and middle notes. Consisting  of large, heavy molecules that evaporate slowly, compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after the application of the perfume or during the period of perfume dry-down. 

Some base notes can still be detectable in excess of twenty-four hours after application, particularly the animalic and [[musk]] notes.

'''OrCam Technologies Ltd.''' is an Israeli-based company producing wearable artificial intelligence space. OrCam develops and manufactures assistive technology devices for individuals who are visually impaired, partially sighted, blind, print disabilities, or have other disabilities. OrCam headquarters is located in Jerusalem operating under the company name OrCam Technologies Ltd.

== History ==

OrCam Technologies Ltd was founded in 2010 by Professor Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram. Before co-founding OrCam, the two in 1999 co-founded Mobileye, an Israeli company that develops vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) providing warnings for collision prevention and mitigation, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017.
OrCam launched OrCam MyEye in 2013 after years of development and testing, and began selling it commercially in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionaware.org/blog/visionaware-blog/the-orcam-a-portable-wearable-visual-system-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-persons/12 Vision Aware]&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, the company raised $22 million, $6 million of which from Intel Capital. In March 2017, OrCam had raised $41 million in capital, making it worth $600 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-mobileye-orcam/after-sale-to-intel-mobileyes-founder-raises-sights-on-ipo-for-orcam-idUSKBN1711V6|title=After sale to Intel, Mobileye's founder raises sights on IPO for OrCam|date=30 March 2017|publisher=|access-date=8 February 2018|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, OrCam has over 150 employees, is headquartered in Jerusalem, and has offices in New York, Toronto, and London.

== Devices ==

OrCam Technologies Ltd has created three devices; OrCam MyEye 2.0, OrCam MyEye 1, and OrCam MyReader.

'''OrCam My Eye 2.0:'''                [[File:OrCam155.jpg|thumb|OrCam MyEye 2.0]]
* OrCam debuted the second-generation model, the OrCam MyEye 2.0 in December 2017.                                       
* About the size of a finger, the MyEye 2.0 is battery-powered, and has been compressed into a self-contained device.
* The device snaps onto any eyeglass frame magnetically.
* Orcam 2.0 is smaller and lighter (only 22.5 grams/0.8 ounces) with more functionality to restore independence to the visually impaired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/12/06/new-device-gives-people-with-vision-problems-a-second-chance-at-sight/ CBS New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical Studies ==
'''JAMA Ophthalmology:'''
In 2016 JAMA Ophthalmology conducted a study involving 12 legally blind participants to evaluate the usefulness of a portable artificial vision device (OrCam) for patients with low vision. The results showed that the OrCam device improved the patient’s ability to perform tasks simulating those of daily living, such as reading a message on an electronic device, a newspaper article or a menu.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.jamanetwork.com/news-item/portable-artificial-vision-device-may-be-an-effective-aid-for-patients-with-low-vision/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wills Eye:'''
Wills Eye was a clinical study designed to measure the impact of the OrCam device on the quality of life of patients with End-stage Glaucoma. The conclusion was that OrCam, a novel artificial vision device using a mini-camera mounted on eyeglasses, allowed legally blind patients with end-stage glaucoma to read independently, subsequently improving their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2335212&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leitnagel Hund (Mining cart).png|thumb|Contemporary illustration of guided truck used in 16th-century mines in Germany]][[File:Silberbergwerk Suggental Josephistollen.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of flat wooden track for transporting silver ore; guidance was by a vertical pin running between the timbers]]
The '''permanent way''' is the elements of [[Rail transport|railway]] lines: generally the pairs of [[Rail profile|rails]] typically laid on the [[Railway sleeper|sleepers]] ("ties" in American parlance) embedded in ballast, intended to carry the ordinary trains of a railway. It is described as permanent way because in the earlier days of railway construction, contractors often laid a temporary track to transport spoil and materials about the site; when this work was substantially completed, the temporary track was taken up and the permanent way installed.

The earliest tracks consisted of wooden rails on transverse wooden sleepers, which helped maintain the spacing of the rails. Various developments followed, with [[cast iron]] plates laid on top of the wooden rails and later [[wrought iron]] plates or wrought iron angle plates ([[angle iron]] as L-shaped plate rails). Rails were also individually fixed to rows of stone blocks, without any cross ties to maintain correct separation. This system also led to problems, as the blocks could individually move. The first version of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s {{RailGauge|7ft}} [[broad gauge]] system used rails laid on longitudinal sleepers whose rail gauge and elevation were pinned down by being tied to piles (conceptually akin to a [[pile bridge]]), but this arrangement was expensive and Brunel soon replaced it with what became the classic broad gauge track, in which the piles were forgone and transoms, similar to sleepers, maintained the rail gauge. Today, most rail track uses the standard system of rail and sleepers; [[ladder track]] is used in a few applications.

Developments in manufacturing technologies has led to changes to the design, manufacture and installation of rails, sleepers and the means of attachments. Cast iron rails, {{convert|4|ft|2}} long, began to be used in the 1790s and by 1820, {{convert|15|ft|2|}} long wrought iron rails were in use. The first steel rails were made in 1857 and standard rail lengths increased over time from {{convert|30|to|60|ft|2|}}. Rails were typically specified by units of weight per linear length and these also increased. Railway sleepers were traditionally made of [[Creosote]]-treated [[hardwood]]s and this continued through to modern times. Continuous welded rail was introduced into Britain in the mid 1960s and this was followed by the introduction of concrete sleepers.

==Wooden tracked systems==

===Plank ways===
The earliest use of a railway track seems to have been in connection with mining in Germany in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1943: 11)&lt;/ref&gt; Mine passageways were usually wet and muddy, and moving barrows of ore along them was extremely difficult. Improvements were made by laying timber planks so that wheeled containers could be dragged along by manpower. By the 16th century, the difficulty of keeping the wagon running straight had been solved by having a pin going into a gap between the planks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | surname= Lewis | given=M J T | title=Early Wooden Railways | publisher=Routledge Keegan Paul, [[London, England]] | year=1970 }}, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Agricola]] describes box-shaped carts, called "dogs", about half as large again as a wheelbarrow, fitted with a blunt vertical pin and wooden rollers running on iron axles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Re Metallica |last=Agricola |first=Georgius |authorlink=Georg Agricola |others=[[Herbert Hoover|Herbert Clark Hoover]] (trans.) |year=1912 |publisher=''Mining'' magazine |location=London |oclc=181688102 |page=156 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Elizabethan era]] example of this has been discovered at Silvergill in [[Cumbria]], England,&lt;ref&gt;Paper given at ''Early Railways 4'' Conference (publication awaited).&lt;/ref&gt; and they were probably also in use in the nearby [[Society of Mines Royal|Mines Royal]] of Grasmere, Newlands and Caldbeck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cranstone|first=David|year=1994|title=Early Surface Features of Metal Mining|journal=Bulletin of the Peak District Mines Historical Society|publisher=Peak District Mines Historical Society|location=Matlock, England|volume=12|issue=3|page=3|url=http://www.pdmhs.com/BackIssues.asp|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where space permitted round-section wooden tracks to take trucks with flanged wheels were installed: a painting from 1544  by the Flemish artist [[Lucas Gassel]] shows a coppermine with rails of this type emerging from an [[adit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKiernan|first=Mick|year=2008|title=Lucas Gassel, Coppermine|journal=Occupational Medicine|publisher=Society of Occupational Medicine|location=London|volume=58|pages=159–60|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn038|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/58/3/159|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edged rails===
{{Main|wagonway}}
A different system was developed in England, probably in the late 16th century, near [[Broseley]] for conveying coal from mines, sometimes [[drift mine]]s down the side of the [[Ironbridge Gorge|Severn Gorge]] to the [[River Severn]]. This, probably a rope-hauled incline plane, had existed 'long before' 1605.&lt;ref&gt;Peter King, 'First Shropshire Railways', Paper given at ''Early Railways 4'' Conference (publication awaited).&lt;/ref&gt; This probably preceded the [[Wollaton Wagonway]] of 1604, which has hitherto been regarded as the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | surname=Smith | given=R. S. | title=England's First Rails: A reconsideration | journal=Renaissance and Modern Studies| year=1960 | volume=IV | page=119 to 134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | surname=New | given=J. R. | title=400 years of English railways - Huntingdon Beaumont and the early years | journal=Backtrack | volume=18 | issue=11 | year=November 2004 | page=660 to 665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shropshire, the gauge was usually narrow, to enable the wagons to be taken underground in drift mines. However, by far the greatest number of wagonways were near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where a single wagon was hauled by a horse on a wagonway of about the modern standard gauge. These took coal from the pithead down to a [[staithe]], where the coal was loaded into river boats called keels.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wear of the timber rails was a problem. They could be renewed by turning them over, but had to be regularly replaced. Sometimes, the rail was made in two parts, so that the top portion could easily be replaced when worn out. The rails were held together by wooden sleepers, covered with ballast to provide a surface for the horse to walk on.

==Early iron rails==
Cast iron strips could be laid on top of timber rails, and the use of such materials probably occurred in 1738, but there are claims that this technology went back to 1716. {{sfn|Baxter|1966|p=39}} In 1767, [[Ketley|Ketley ironworks]] began producing [[cast iron]] plates, which were fixed to the top of wooden rails with nails, to provide a more durable running surface. This construct was known as [[strap-iron rail]] (or strap rail) and was widely used on pre-steam railways in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What was a Railroad?|url=http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/ptracks/chapter4/chapter4.htm|work=(Includes illustration of a length of strap rail.)|publisher=Past Tracks|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TaTARNC3TS-1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bianculli|first=Anthony J.|title=Trains and Technology: The American Railroad in the Nineteenth Century - Volume 3: Track and Structures|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=0-87413-802-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7T3qECx0CLUC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=illustrated|pages=85–8|year=2003}} – This section describes strap rails, their uses and problems in considerable detail.''&lt;/ref&gt; Although relatively cheap and quick to build, they were unsuited to heavy loads and required 'excessive maintenance'. Train wheels rolling over the spikes loosened them, allowing the rail to break free and curve upwards sufficiently that a car wheel could get beneath it and force the end of the rail up through the floor of the car, writhing and twisting, endangering passengers. These broken rails became known as "snake heads".&lt;ref name="TaTARNC3TS-1" /&gt;
 
When wrought iron became available, wrought iron plates provided an even more durable surface. The rails had projecting lugs (or ears) with a hole to enable them to be fixed to the underlying wooden rail.

===Iron plateways===
[[File:L-shaped plate rails.jpg|thumb|Section of L-shaped plate rails]][[File:Long fish bellied rail.jpg|thumb|right|A long fish bellied rail supported over several chairs]]
An alternative, developed by [[John Curr]] of Sheffield, the manager of the [[Duke of Norfolk]]'s colliery there. This had a L-shaped rail, so that the flange was on the rail rather than on the wheel. This was also used by [[Benjamin Outram]] of [[Butterley Company|Butterley Ironworks]] and [[William Jessop]] (who became a partner in them in 1790). These were used to transport goods for relatively short distances down to canals, though Curr's ran between the manor colliery and [[Sheffield]] town. These rails are referred to as plates, and the railway is sometimes called a plateway. The term "platelayer" also derives from this origin. In theory, the unflanged wheels could have been used on ordinary highways, but in practice this was probably rarely done, because the wagon wheels were so narrow that they would have dug into the road surface.

The system found wide adoption in Britain. Often, the plates were mounted on stone blocks, and sometimes without sleepers, but that was liable to cause the rails to spread apart, increasing the gauge. Railways of this kind were widely used in south Wales, particularly to transport limestone down to the ironworks, and then to take the iron to a canal, sometimes several miles away, which took the products to market. The rails were at first made of cast iron, typically in lengths of {{convert|3|ft}}, spanning between stone blocks.&lt;ref name ="van Laun"&gt;J. van Laun, ''Early limestone railways'' (Newcomen Society, London, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone blocks had been assumed to be permanent, but experience quickly showed that they settled and gradually moved under traffic, creating chaotic [[track geometry]] and causing derailments. Another problem was that the running surface was liable to become obstructed by stones, displaced from the ballast. An alternative was to use an iron tie bar to keep the rails to the proper gauge, incorporating a shoe in which the rail was fixed.&lt;ref name ="van Laun"/&gt;

An example of this was the [[Penydarren Ironworks|Penydarren or Merthyr]] [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]]. This was used by [[Richard Trevithick]] to demonstrate a pioneer [[locomotive]] in 1804, using one of his high pressure [[history of the steam engine|steam engine]]s, but the engine was so heavy that it broke many of the rails.

===Early edge rails===&lt;!-- "Fish bellied rail" redirects here --&gt;
Cast iron edge rails were used by [[Thomas Dadford, Jr.|Thomas Dadford junior]] when building the [[Beaufort, Ebbw Vale|Beaufort]] and [[Blaenavon]] lines to the [[Monmouthshire canal]] in 1793. These were rectangular, {{convert|2.5|in|lk=on}} in width with a depth of {{convert|3|in}} and {{convert|4|ft}} in length, and required flanges on the wagon wheels. The same year, [[Benjamin Outram]] used edge rails on the [[Cromford Canal]]. T-shaped beams were used by William Jessop on the [[Loughborough]]-[[Nanpantan]] line in 1794, and his sons used I-shaped beams in 1813–15 on a railway from [[Grantham]] to [[Belvoir Castle]]. Samples of these rails are held in the [[Science Museum, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=William Jessop, Engineer|author1=Charles Hadfield|author2=Alec Skempton|year=1979|publisher=Devon:David &amp; Charles|pages=171–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short-lived alternative was the ''fish-bellied'' profile, first used by Thomas Barnes (1765–1801) at Walker Colliery, near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1798, which enabled rails to have a longer span between blocks. These were T-section edge rails, three feet long and laid on transverse stone sleepers. These were still made of [[cast iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skepton|first=Alec|title=A biographical dictionary of civil engineers in Great Britain and Ireland|volume=1|year=2002|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|location=London|isbn=0-7277-2939-X|page=44|chapter=Barnes, Thomas (1765–1801)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Butt v Lapp Joints ===
The earliest rails had square butt joints, which were weak and difficult to keep in alignment. [[George Stephenson]] introduced lapped joints, which maintained their alignment quite well.&lt;ref&gt;Lives of the Engineers, by Samuel Smiles, [[The Folio Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern edge rails==
The breakthrough came when [[John Birkinshaw]] of [[Bedlington Ironworks]] in [[Northumberland]] developed rolled [[wrought iron]] rails in 1820 in {{convert|15|ft}} lengths, as used for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]]. This was strong enough to bear the weight of a locomotive and of a train of wagons (or carriages) pulled by it. This marks the beginning of the modern rail era. This system was instantly successful, although some false starts took place. Some early rails were made in a T cross section, but the lack of metal at the foot limited the bending strength of the rail, which has to act as a beam between supports.

As metal technologies improved, these wrought iron rails were made progressively somewhat longer, and with a heavier, and therefore stronger, cross-section. By providing more metal in the foot of the rail, a stronger beam was created, achieving much better strength and stiffness, and a section was created similar to the bullhead rail section still visible today. This was expensive, however, and the promoters of early railways struggled with decisions about the appropriate weight (and therefore strength, and cost) of their rails.

At first, the rail section was almost symmetrical top-to-bottom, and was described as a double-headed rail. The intention was to invert the rail after the top surface had become worn, but rails tend to develop chair gall, an attrition of the rail where it is supported in the chairs, and this would have made running on the former bottom surface impossibly noisy and irregular. It was better to provide the extra metal on the top surface and gain extra wear there without the need to invert the rail at its half life.

Many railways preferred a flat bottom rail section, where the rails could be laid directly on the sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide a sole plate under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of flat-bottom rail only starting in about 1947.

===Steel rails===
The first rails made from [[steel]] were made in [[1857 in rail transport|1857]], when [[Robert Forester Mushet]] remelted scrap steel from an abortive [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] trial, in crucibles at [[Ebbw Vale]] ironworks, and were laid experimentally at [[Derby Midland railway station|Derby railway station]] on the [[Midland Railway]] in [[England]]. The rails proved far more durable than the iron rails they replaced and remained in use until 1873.&lt;ref&gt;K. Barraclough, ''Steelmaking 1850-1900'' (London: Institute of materials 1990), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fweb.org.uk/Dean/deanhist/marefold.htm fweb.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Bessemer]] supplied 500 tons of steel blooms to the [[London and North Western Railway]]'s rail mill at [[Crewe]] in 1860. Several other companies began producing steel rails in the following years.&lt;ref name="Barraclough 1990, 67"&gt;Barraclough 1990, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to steel rails was hastened by the introduction of [[Open hearth furnace|open hearth steelmaking]]. [[William Siemens]] set up his Landore steelworks partly to supply rail to the [[Great Western Railway]].&lt;ref name="Barraclough 1990, 67"/&gt; A boom in rail production followed, but a banking crisis in America slowed the rate at which railways were built there and orders to British rail producers.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Carr and W. Taplin, ''History of the British steel Industry'' (Oxford 1962: Blackwell), 81&lt;/ref&gt; The British iron and steel industry went into a recession, which particularly affected the wrought iron sector. When demand for rails began to grow again, it was largely for steel rails, which were more durable than those of iron.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Sleepers ===
{{Main|Railway sleeper}}
Timber sleepers, that is transverse beams supporting the two rails that form the track, replaced the individual stone blocks formerly used. This system has the major advantage that maintenance adjustments to the [[track geometry]] did not disrupt the all-important track gauge. The alignment of the track could be adjusted by sluing it bodily, without loss of gauge. Softwood was widely used, but its life was limited if it was not treated with preservative, and some railways set up creosoting plants for the purpose. [[Creosote]]-treated hardwood is now widely used in North America and elsewhere.

By now relatively long (perhaps 20&amp;nbsp;ft) wrought iron rails supported in chairs on timber cross-sleepers, were in use – a track form recognisable today in older track.

Steel sleepers were tried as an alternative to timber; Acworth&lt;ref&gt;Acworth, W M, ''The Railways of England'', Second Edition 1889, John Murray, London&lt;/ref&gt; writing in 1889 describes the production of steel sleepers on the London &amp; North Western Railway, and there is an illustration showing rolled channel section (shallow upturned "U" shapes) with no shaped ends, and with three-part forged chairs riveted direct. However steel sleepers seem not to have enjoyed widespread adoption until about 1995. Their dominant usage now is for life extension of existing track on secondary routes. They have a significant advantage on weak formations and poor ballast conditions, as the bearing area is at a high level, immediately under the rail seat.

===Rail fastenings===
{{main|Rail fastening systems}}
The early cast iron rails of the 18th century and before used integral fixings for nailing or bolting to the railroad ties. Strap rails introduced in the late 18th century, of cast and later rolled iron were nailed to wooden supports via countersunk holes in the metal. The introduction of rolled rail profiles in the 1820s such as the ''single flanged T parallel rail'' and later ''double flanged T parallel rail'' required the use of chairs, keys to hold the rail, and bolts or spikes to fix the chair. The ''flat bottomed rail'' invented by [[Robert L. Stevens]] in 1830 was initially spiked directly to wooden sleepers, later tie plates were used to spread the load and also keep the rail in gauge with inbuilt shoulders in the plate. Outside North America a wide variety of spring based fastening systems were later introduced in combination with baseplates and flat bottomed rail, these are now ubiquitous on main line high speed railways.

===Ballast===
{{Main|Track ballast}}
The track was originally laid direct on the ground, but this quickly proved unsatisfactory and some form of ballast was essential, to spread the load and to retain the track in its proper position. The natural ground is rarely strong enough to accept the loading from locomotives without excessive settlement, and a layer of ballast under the sleeper reduces the bearing pressure on the ground. The ballast surrounding the sleepers also tends to keep them in place and resists displacement.

The ballast was usually some locally available mineral product, such as gravel or reject material from coal and iron mining activities. The [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] used river [[gravel]] – round pebbles. In later years the ash from steam engines was used and [[slag]] (a by-product of steel making).

==Gauges==

=== Early track gauges ===
{{Main|Rail gauge}}
The early railways were almost exclusively local concerns involved with conveying minerals to some waterway; for them the gauge of the track was adopted to suit the wagons intended to be used, and it was typically in the range 4&amp;nbsp;ft to 4&amp;nbsp;ft 8½ in, and at first there was no idea of the need for any conformity with the gauge of other lines. When the first public railways developed, [[George Stephenson]]'s skilful innovation meant that his railways were dominant and the {{RailGauge|ussg}} gauge he used was therefore the most widespread. As early notions of linking up different railway systems evolved, this gauge secured general adoption. It is more or less an accident of history that this gauge – which suited the wagons already in use at the colliery where George Stephenson had been an engine man – became the British standard gauge: it was exported to most of Europe and North America.

Reference is sometimes made to the "gauge" of ruts in stone roadways at ancient sites such as [[Pompeii]], and these are often asserted to be about the same as Stephenson's gauge. Of course the ruts were made by the wheels of carts, and the carts were of a sensible size for horse-drawn carts prior to the industrial era, pretty much the same as the size of the pre-railway carts at the colliery where Stephenson worked: that is the only connection.

===Broad gauge track===
{{Main|Baulk road}}
When [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] conceived the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), he sought an improved design for his railway track and accepted none of the previous received wisdom without challenge. The 4&amp;nbsp;ft 8½in gauge had been fine for small mineral trucks on a horse-drawn tramway, but he wanted something more stable for his high speed railway. The large diameter wheels used in stage coaches gave better ride quality over rough ground, and Brunel originally intended to have his passenger carriages carried in the same way – on large diameter wheels placed outside the bodies of the carriages. To achieve this he needed a wider track gauge and he settled on the famous {{convert|7|ft}} [[broad gauge]]. (It was later eased to 7&amp;nbsp;ft 0¼in). When the time came to build the passenger carriages, they were designed conventionally with smaller wheels under the bodies after all, but with a seven-foot track gauge the bodies could be much wider than on the standard gauge. His original intention to have the wheels outside the width of the bodies was abandoned.

Brunel also looked at novel track forms, and decided to use a continuously supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow [[Rail profile#Barlow rail|bridge rail]] for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms – transverse spacers – and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly was referred to as the [[baulk road]] – railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day [[Ladder track]].

The group of railways that had Brunel as their engineer were successful and the broad gauge track spread throughout the west of England, South Wales, and the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. But, as the British railway network spread, the incompatibility of the two systems became a serious blockage, as a wagon could not be sent from one system to the other without transshipping the goods by hand. A [[Standard Gauge#The Royal Commission|Gauge Commission]] was appointed to determine national policy. The Broad Gauge was technically superior but conversion of the standard gauge routes to broad would have meant reconstructing every tunnel, bridge and station platform, whereas universal adoption of the standard gauge only required the progressive conversion of the track itself. The broad gauge was doomed, and no further independent broad gauge lines could be built.

The existing broad gauge routes could continue, but as they had no development potential it was only a matter of time before they were eventually converted to standard. In the meantime, an extensive mileage of [[dual gauge|mixed gauge]] track was installed, where each line had three rails to accommodate trains of either gauge. There were some instances of ''mixed gauge trains'' being run, where wagons of each gauge were run in a single train. The legacy of the broad gauge can still be seen where there seems to be an unnecessarily wide space between station platforms.

==Twentieth century and beyond==

=== 1900 to 1945 ===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the form of British track had converged on the use of [[wrought iron]] bullhead rails supported in cast iron chairs on timber sleepers, laid in some form of ballast. In North America, the standard was T-rails and tie plates fastened to timber crossties with cut spikes. Many railways were using very light rails and, as locomotive weights and speeds increased, these became inadequate. Consequently, on main lines, the rails in use were made progressively heavier (and stronger). Metallurgical processes improved and better rails, including some of steel, came into use. From a maintenance point of view, the rail joints were the source of most of the work, and as steel-making techniques improved it became possible to roll steel rails of increased length – reducing the number of joints per mile. The standard length became 30&amp;nbsp;ft (9 144mm), then 45&amp;nbsp;ft (13 716mm) and finally 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18 288mm) rails became the norm. For main line use, the standard rail section became the 95BH section, weighing 95&amp;nbsp;lb per yard (47.13&amp;nbsp;kg per metre). For secondary routes, a lighter 85BH (42.16&amp;nbsp;kg per metre) section was used.

Flat bottom rails were still seen as undesirable for British main line railway use, despite their successful use in North America, although some lightly operated British railways used them, generally spiked direct to the sleepers. Under heavy usage, they indent the sleepers severely and the incremental cost of a base-plate appeared at this early date, to rule the flat bottom section out.

Timber sleepers were expensive and not durable, and the railways’ engineers had strong – and conflicting – views about the best wood species and the best preservative treatments. The railways moved towards standardisation on a softwood sleeper preserved by pressure injection of [[creosote]], measuring 8&amp;nbsp;ft 6in (2 591&amp;nbsp;mm) long by 10in (254mm) by 5in (127mm). Chairs were secured to the sleepers by trenails (steel spikes driven through a timber sleeve) or three chair-screws on first class routes. The GWR alone among the main line railways kept to its own standard, the 00 rail at 97½ lb/yd (48.365&amp;nbsp;kg per metre), and with two fangbolts securing each chair to the sleeper, with the head of the bolt under the sleeper and a nut above the chair—more secure but much more difficult to adjust.

Some experiments were made before 1945 with reinforced concrete sleepers, in most cases with bullhead chairs mounted on them. This was in response to the very high price of the best (most durable) timber, but reinforced concrete sleepers were never successful in main line use. Concrete pots were also used in sidings; they are sometimes called twin-block sleepers, and consisted of two concrete blocks each mounted with a chair, and an angle iron connecting them and retaining the gauge.

===Post-war developments===
At the end of the Second World War in 1945, the British railways were worn out, having been patched up following war damage without the availability of much new material. The country was economically in a weak situation also, and for nearly a decade after the war, materials – especially [[steel]] and [[timber]] – were in very short supply. Labour too was seriously restricted in availability.

The railway companies became persuaded that the traditional bullhead forms of track needed revision, and after some experimentation a new flat bottom rail format was adopted. The [[British Standard]] sections were unsuitable and a new profile, a 109&amp;nbsp;lb/yard rail, was made the new standard. In 60&amp;nbsp;ft lengths, laid on steel baseplates on [[softwood]] sleepers, it was to be the universal standard. The fastenings were to be of a resilient steel type, and for secondary routes a 98&amp;nbsp;lb/yd rail was adopted. Regional variations still persisted, and [[hardwood]] sleepers and Mills clip fastenings were favoured on the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]], for example.

The new designs were successful, but they introduced many challenges, especially as the availability of experienced track maintenance staff became acutely difficult, and poorly maintained flat bottom track seemed more difficult to keep in good order than poorly maintained bullhead track. The greater stiffness of flat-bottom was an advantage, but it tended to straighten out between the joints on curves; and flat bottom’s rigidity led to high vertical impact forces at badly maintained joints and this resulted in high volumes of fatigue fractures at the joints. Moreover, the elastic rail fastenings had little resistance to rail creep – the propensity of the rails to move gradually in the direction of traffic, and the workload of pulling back the rails to regulate the joints was surprisingly high.

===Long welded rails===
Much of the work of maintaining the track was at the joints, especially as the stiff rails became dipped, and the joint sleepers took a hammering. Pre-war experiments with long welded rail lengths were built upon, and in the years from 1960 long rail lengths were installed, at first on hardwood sleepers but soon on concrete sleepers. For example, the first long welded rail (almost {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}}) on the UK's [[East Coast Main Line]] was laid in 1957, just south of [[Carlton-on-Trent]], resting on rubber pads to resist rail creep.&lt;ref&gt;Railway Magazine December 1957 p. 882&lt;/ref&gt; In this pioneering stage, some catastrophic mistakes in detailed design were made, but from about 1968 continuous welded rail became a reliable standard for universal installation on main and secondary routes. The form adopted used pre-stressed concrete sleepers and a 110A rail section – a slight improvement on the 109 rails previously used – the A was to distinguish it from the British Standard 110&amp;nbsp;lb/yd rail section, which was unsuitable. Rail fastenings eventually converged onto a proprietary spring clip made by the [[Pandrol]] company which was the exclusive form of fastening in Britain for about 30 years.

The welded track was to be laid on six to twelve inches (15 to 30 centimetres) of crushed stone ballast, although this was not always achieved, and the [[bearing capacity]] of the formation was not always taken into account, leading to some spectacular formation failures.

A further enhancement to the rail profile produced the 113A section, which was the universal standard until about 1998; detail improvements to the sleepers and ballast profile completed the picture and the general form of the track had stabilised. This format is now in place over 99% of the first-class main lines in Britain, although the CEN60 (60&amp;nbsp;kg/m) rail section was introduced in the UK during the 1990s. This has a wider rail foot and is taller than the 113A section so is incompatible with standard sleepers.

[[Track renewal train]]s have now replaced labour-intensive permanent way gangs. Long welded rail was hard to install manually. An early demonstration of mechanised track-laying with two {{convert|600|ft|abbr=on}} lengths of long welded rail took place on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway|Fighting Cocks branch]] in 1958. The two lengths were loaded on ten wagons, attached to the existing track by a steel rope and drawn back at {{convert|30|ft|abbr=on}} a minute. As the train moved back, the old rails were levered out and the new ones dropped into the chairs. A hoist on the rear wagon dropped the last part of the rail into place.&lt;ref&gt;Railway Magazine March 1958 pp. 176-177 Laying Long Welded Rails in the N.E.R.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track gauge==
{{Main|Rail gauge}}
As stated, the general track gauge in Britain was {{RailGauge|ussg}}. In the later 1950s, general track maintenance standards deteriorated rapidly due to manning difficulties, and freight train speeds increased on some routes. Freight trains consisted almost entirely of short wheelbase (10&amp;nbsp;ft) four-wheeled wagons carried on a very stiff elliptical leaf spring suspension, and these wagons showed an alarmingly rapid rate of increase of derailment events. Anyone standing at the lineside could watch a freight train pass at speed and observe several of the wagons weaving and swaying alarmingly even on good track, and derailment occurred when any poor track was encountered.

The dynamic behaviour of the wagons was the problem, but the solution adopted was to reduce the permitted speed of the wagons to 45&amp;nbsp;mph, and to reduce the track gauge by one-eighth of an inch, to 4&amp;nbsp;ft 8⅜in (1432mm) for new installations of continuously welded track on concrete sleepers. Of course the long life cycle of the track meant that this conversion process would take 30 years or more to complete. However, the basis of the gauge narrowing was mistaken. The idea seems to have been to reduce the free space for lateral movement of the wagons, so that they would be "contained" to run in a straight line. In fact, railway vehicles are not contained by the flanges of the wheels except in ''very'' sharp curves, and in normal running the steering effect due to the conicity of the wheels is dominant. In reducing the track gauge, the effective conicity is increased – worsened – and the tendency of the wagons to yaw and roll was increased. Many derailments took place on relatively new continuously welded rail track, and often such a derailment destroyed about a mile of the new track, as the freight train might take that distance to stop; the concrete sleepers were not robust under a derailed wagon's wheels.

The effect reduced as the wagon fleet was modernised (and other effects took first place) and the track gauge for new track was quietly restored to {{RailGauge|ussg}}. Of course the vast majority of the track on main lines is still, as installed, at the tighter gauge, and it will be several decades before the gauge change is complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmrs.org.uk/technical/track3.html THE MODERN PERMANENT WAY (Part 3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Switches and crossings==
{{Main|Railroad switch}}
[[File:Railroad-Gyula-b.jpg|thumb|right|Railway turnouts]]
Terminology is difficult for "switches and crossings" (S&amp;C) previously "points and crossings", or "fittings".

Early S&amp;C allowed only a very slow speed on the subsidiary route (the "turnout"), so geometrical design was not too important. Many older s&amp;c units had a loose joint at the heel so that the switch rail could turn to close to the stock rail or open from it. When the switch rail was closed, a reasonable alignment was secured; when it was open, no wheel could run on it so it did not matter.

As speeds rose, this was no longer feasible and the switch rails were fixed at the heel end, and their flexibility enabled the toe end to open and close. Manufacture of the switch rails was a complex process, and that of the crossings even more so. Speeds on the subsidiary route were rarely higher than 20&amp;nbsp;mph except in very special designs, and great ingenuity was employed to give a good ride to vehicles passing through at speed on the main line. A difficulty was the common crossing where continuous support to wheels passing was difficult, and the point rail was planed to protect it from direct impact in the facing direction, so that a designed irregularity in support was introduced.

As faster speeds were required, more configurations of s&amp;c were designed, and a very large number of components, each specific to only one type of s&amp;c, was required. At faster speeds on the turnout road, the divergence from the main route is much more gradual, and therefore a very considerable length of planning of the switch rail is required.

About 1971, this trend was reversed with the so-called vertical s&amp;c, in which the rails were held vertical, rather than at the customary 1 in 20 inclination. With other simplifications, this considerably reduced the stockholding required for a wide range of s&amp;c speeds, although the vertical rail imposes a loss of the steering effect and the ride through new vertical s&amp;c is often irregular.

==Continuous welded rail==
[[File:Cwr at whitstable.jpg|thumb|right|Continuous welded track with conductor rail installed in the 1970s]]Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) was developed in response to the observation that the bulk of track maintenance work takes place at the joints. As steel production and manufacturing processes improved, the rail lengths installed were progressively increased, and the logical extension of this would be to eliminate the joints altogether.

A major obstacle to doing so is [[thermal expansion]]: the rails expand in higher temperatures. Without joints, there is no room for the rails to expand; as the rails get warmer, they will develop an enormous force in ''trying'' to expand. If prevented from expanding, they develop a force of 1.7 tonnes (17&amp;nbsp;kN) for every 1 degree Celsius of temperature change in a practical rail section.&lt;ref name="cwr"&gt;''General Instructions for the Installation and Maintenance of Continuous Welded Rail''; Civil Engineering Handbook No 11; British Railways; March 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a small cube of metal is compressed between the jaws of a press, it will contract—that is it will be squashed somewhat—and a very large force can be resisted by it without ultimate failure. However, if a long piece of metal of the same cross section is compressed, it will deform sideways into a bow shape; the process is called buckling, and the compressive force it can withstand is very much less.

If the long thin piece of metal could be constrained to prevent it from buckling (e.g. by being contained inside a tube) then it can resist a much higher compressive force. If the rails can be constrained in a similar way, they can be prevented from buckling. The weight of the track resists buckling upwards, so buckling is most likely to take place laterally. This is prevented by:

* providing heavy sleepers, that generate friction on the ballast bed
* ensuring that the sleepers are well supported on consolidated ballast to enable the generation of the friction
* providing consolidated ballast around the sides of the sleepers to provide additional friction
* heating the rails when they are installed and fastened in cool or cold weather, so that the expansion on the hottest days is less than otherwise
* making sure that any rail added if rail breaks during cold weather is removed before warm weather returns.
* making sure that curves do not line themselves inward during cold weather sufficiently to make buckling more likely when warm weather returns
* taking precautions when track maintenance work is performed in hot weather, and making sure ballast is sufficiently consolidated before full-speed operation is resumed.

If the rail is held so that it cannot expand at all, then there is no limit on the length of rail that can be handled. The expansive force in a one-foot length of rail at a certain temperature is the same as in a {{convert|100|mi}} length of rail. Early continuous welded rail was installed in limited lengths only because of technological limitations. However at the end of the CWR section where it abutted older, ordinary jointed track, that track would be unable to resist the expansive force and the jointed track might be forced to buckle. To prevent that, special expansion switches, sometimes called breathers, were installed. The expansion switches could accommodate a considerable expansive movement—typically four inches (100mm) or so—in the end section of the CWR without passing the movement on to the jointed track.

The CWR is installed and fastened down at an optimum temperature, to ensure that the highest possible expansive force is limited. This temperature is called the stress-free temperature, and in the UK it is {{convert|27|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="cwr"/&gt; It is in the upper range of ordinary outdoor temperatures, and the actual installation work tends to be done at cooler temperatures. Originally the rails were physically heated to the stress-free temperature with propane gas heaters; they were then rattled with hand bars to eliminate any binding, preventing even expansion, and then clipped down. Since about 1963 however hydraulic jacks are used to physically stretch the rails while they are supported on temporary rollers. By stretching the rails to the length they would be if they were at the stress-free temperature, then there is no need to heat them; they can just be clipped down before the jacks are released.

The CWR rails are made by welding ordinary rails together. For many years, rails could only be made in lengths of up to 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18m 288mm) in Britain, and the factory welding process made them into 600, 900 or 1200&amp;nbsp;ft lengths, depending on the factory. The process used was a [[Flash welding|flash-butt process]] in which high electrical currents are used to soften the rail end, and the ends are then forced together by rams. The flash-butt process is very reliable, providing that the factory ensured good geometry of the rail ends.

The long rails could be conveyed to site by a special train, and unloaded on to the ground (by chaining the end in position and pulling the train out from underneath the rails). The long rails had to be welded together (or to adjacent track) using a site welding process; and, after initial experimentation, the proprietary [[Thermit]] welding process was used. This was an alumino-thermic process in which a powder 'portion' was ignited; the [[aluminium]] was the fuel and a metallurgically appropriate composition of molten steel descended into the gap between the rail ends, contained in refractory moulds.

The original SmW process was very sensitive to operator skill, and as the welding was usually the final process before returning the track to traffic, time pressure was sometimes applied resulting in unwanted improper welds. The improved SkV process was less sensitive and over the years weld quality improved.&lt;ref&gt;Key, A. J., Frederick C. O. and Round D. J. (1983). "Thermit Rail Welding Development on British Rail". In: ''Rail Technology''. British Rail. {{ISBN|0-9508596-0-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst jointed track has suffered buckles in the past; the fish-plates need to be removed and greased annually (the requirement was relaxed to bi-annually in 1993) and where this was forgotten or where ballast conditions were especially weak, buckling took place in hot weather. In addition, if rails were allowed to creep, it was always possible that several successive joints closed up, so that the expansion gap was lost, with inevitable results at the onset of hot weather.

He is the founder and former chairman and CEO of [[Trulia]]. Formerly he was part of the founding team at [[lastminute.com]] where he was responsible for their highly successful growth and online marketing strategy. He is the most successful British entrepreneur based in the San Francisco Bay Area. He currently is a managing partner at NFX, the early stage venture capital fund focused on Network Effect Businesses.

==Education and early career==
Flint earned a first class bachelor’s degree and master's in physics from [[Oxford University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url =http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Floreat2014WEB.pdf |title= Trulia: US property search website|author= David Goldman|publisher=Floreat Magdalena |date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an MBA from the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.businessinsider.com/famous-stanford-business-school-students-2014-9?op=1|title= The 25 Most Successful Stanford Business School Graduates|author= Richard Feloni and Drake Baer|publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date = September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after graduating from Oxford University, Flint joined [[Brent Hoberman]] and [[Martha Lane Fox]] to start [[lastminute.com]]. He had previously worked alongside Hoberman at [[LineOne]], a joint venture between [[New International]] and [[British Telecom]], where Flint worked for less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_21811772/mercury-news-interview-trulia-ceo-peter-flint|title=Mercury News interview: Trulia CEO Peter Flint|date=19 October 2012|website=Mercurynews.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint spent five years at [[lastminute.com]] helping to scale the company from a business plan to a public company with 2,000 employees and operations in 11 countries. Flint left [[lastminute.com]] to attend [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] in 2003. lastminute.com was acquired by Sabre Group for $1.1 billion in cash in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/13/business/fi-sabre13 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Sabre to Buy British Online Travel Firm Lastminute.com | date=May 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trulia==
Flint conceived of [[Trulia]] in 2004 while he was between the first and second year of his MBA course at Stanford while looking for off campus housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9db12abc-3b09-11e3-87fa-00144feab7de|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that consumer usage to research real estate was growing rapidly, yet all the major websites in the category were not focused on delivering a compelling consumer experience and failed to provide compelling advertising products to tap into the billions of dollars that were being spent on real estate newspaper classified advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324263404578611782058012230 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sarah E. | last=Needleman | date=July 17, 2013 | title=Trulia CEO says aspiring entrepreneurs need to be customer-obsessed and the very best in their industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flint wrote the original business plan while at Stanford. Flint recruited a team of Stanford students to turn Flint’s concept into a company, of the original students that worked on the project, Sami Inkinen joined Flint to incorporate the company in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.trulia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251458&amp;p=irol-faq |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141212162321/http://ir.trulia.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251458&amp;p=irol-faq |archivedate=2014-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''playing card''' is a piece of specially prepared heavy paper, thin cardboard, [[plastic-coated paper]], cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic, marked with distinguishing motifs and used as one of a set for playing [[card game]]s. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and were first invented in [[China]] during the [[Science and technology of the Tang dynasty|Tang dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who invented playing cards? - Quatr.us|url=http://quatr.us/games/playingcards.htm|work=quatr.us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421003447/http://quatr.us/games/playingcards.htm|archivedate=2017-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===

[[Image:Ming Dynasty playing card, c. 1400.jpg|thumb|160px|A Chinese [[printing|printed]] playing card dated c. 1400 AD, [[Ming Dynasty]], found near [[Turpan]], measuring 9.5 by 3.5 cm.]]

{{further information|Chinese playing cards}}

Playing cards may have been invented during the [[Tang dynasty]] around the 9th century AD as a result of the usage of woodblock printing technology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|1986d|pp=131–132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkinson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkinson | first=W.H. | title=Chinese Origin of Playing Cards | journal=[[American Anthropologist]] | volume=VIII | issue=1 | year=1895 | pages=61–78 | doi=10.1525/aa.1895.8.1.02a00070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lo 2000 390"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2004|p=328}} "it is also now rather well-established that dominoes and playing-cards were originally Chinese developments from dice."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2004|p=334}} "Numbered dice, anciently widespread, were on a related line of development which gave rise to dominoes and playing-cards (+9th-century China)."&lt;/ref&gt; The first possible reference to card games comes from a 9th-century text known as the ''Collection of Miscellanea at Duyang'', written by Tang dynasty writer Su E. It describes Princess Tongchang, daughter of [[Emperor Yizong of Tang]], playing the "leaf game" in 868 with members of the Wei clan, the family of the [[Wei Baoheng|princess' husband]].&lt;ref name="lo 2000 390"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zhou 1997 18"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zhou, Songfang|title=On the Story of Late Tang Poet Li He|journal=Journal of the Graduates Sun Yat-sen University|year= 1997|volume= 18|issue= 3|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham vol5 pt1"&gt;[[Needham, Joseph]] and [[Tsien Tsuen-hsuin]]. (1985). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1, Paper and Printing''. Cambridge University Press., reprinted Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.(1986)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131|date=November 2012}} The first known book on the "leaf" game was called the ''Yezi Gexi'' and allegedly written by a Tang woman. It received commentary by writers of subsequent dynasties.&lt;ref name="needham 132"/&gt; The [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) scholar [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007–1072) asserts that the "leaf" game existed at least since the mid-Tang dynasty and associated its invention with the [[List of Chinese inventions#Printing|development of printed sheets]] as a writing medium.&lt;ref name="needham 132"&gt;{{Harvnb|Needham|2004|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lo 2000 390"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0041977X00008466| title = The game of leaves: An inquiry into the origin of Chinese playing cards| journal = Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies| volume = 63| issue = 3| pages = 389| year = 2009| last1 = Lo | first1 = A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ouyang also claims that the "leaves" were pages of a book used in a board game played with dice, and that the rules of the game were lost by 1067.&lt;ref name="Parlett"&gt;[[David Parlett|Parlett, David]], "[http://www.davpar.eu/histocs/leafgame.html The Chinese "Leaf" Game]", March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other games revolving around alcoholic drinking involved using playing cards of a sort from the Tang dynasty onward. However, these cards did not contain suits or numbers. Instead, they were printed with instructions or forfeits for whomever drew them.&lt;ref name="Parlett"/&gt;

The earliest dated instance of a game involving cards with suits and numerals occurred on 17 July 1294 when "Yan Sengzhu and Zheng Pig-Dog were caught playing cards [zhi pai] and that wood blocks for printing them had been impounded, together with nine of the actual cards."&lt;ref name="Parlett"/&gt;

[[William Henry Wilkinson]] suggests that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which doubled as both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for,&lt;ref name="wilkinson" /&gt; similar to [[trading card]] games. Using paper money was inconvenient and risky so they were substituted by [[play money]] known as "money cards". One of the earliest games in which we know the rules is [[Madiao|''madiao'']], a [[trick-taking game]], which dates to the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644). 15th-century scholar [[Lu Rong]] described it is as being played with 38 "money cards" divided into four [[suit (cards)|suits]]: 9 in [[Cash (Chinese coin)|coins]], 9 in strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), 9 in [[myriad]]s (of coins or of strings), and 11 in tens of myriads (a myriad is 10,000). The two latter suits had ''[[Water Margin]]'' characters instead of pips on them &lt;ref name="needham vol5 pt1"/&gt;{{rp|132|date=November 2012}} with Chinese characters to mark their rank and suit. The suit of coins is in reverse order with 9 of coins being the lowest going up to 1 of coins as the high card.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themahjongtileset.co.uk/money-suited-playing-cards/ Money-suited playing cards] at The Mahjong Tile Set&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persia and Arabia===

Despite the wide variety of patterns, the suits show a uniformity of structure. Every suit contains twelve cards with the top two usually being the [[Face card|court cards]] of king and [[vizier]] and the bottom ten being [[Pip (counting)|pip cards]]. Half the suits use reverse ranking for their pip cards. There are many motifs for the suit pips but some include coins, clubs, jugs, and swords which resemble later Mamluk and Latin suits. [[Michael Dummett]] speculated that Mamluk cards may have descended from an earlier deck which consisted of 48 cards divided into four suits each with ten pip cards and two court cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/faq/basics.php Playing card basics] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]] website&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Egypt===
[[File:Mamluk kanjifah cards.png|right|thumb|320px|Four Mamluk playing cards.]]
By the 11th century, playing cards were spreading throughout the Asian continent and later came into Egypt.&lt;ref name="needham vol5 pt1"/&gt;{{rp|309|date=November 2018}} The oldest surviving cards in the world are four fragments found in the [[Edmund de Unger|Keir Collection]] and one in the [[Benaki Museum]]. They are dated to the 12th and 13th centuries (late [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]], and early [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] periods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|page=41|isbn=0 7156 1014 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A near complete pack of [[Mamluk]] playing cards dating to the 15th century and of similar appearance to the fragments above was discovered by [[Leo Aryeh Mayer]] in the [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Istanbul]], in 1939.&lt;ref name="bifao38"&gt;{{Citation|title=Le Bulletin de l'Institut français d'archéologie orientale|last=Mayer|first=Leo Ary|url=http://www.ifao.egnet.net/bifao/38/|year=1939|volume=38|pages=113–118|accessdate=2008-09-08|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a complete set and is actually composed of three different packs, probably to replace missing cards.&lt;ref&gt;''International Playing Cards Society Journal'', 30-3, [http://www.i-p-c-s.org/publications.html#journal page 139]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Topkapı pack originally contained 52 cards comprising four suits: polo-sticks, coins, swords, and cups. Each suit contained ten pip cards and three court cards, called ''malik'' (king), ''nā'ib malik'' (viceroy or deputy king), and ''thānī nā'ib'' (second or under-deputy). The ''thānī nā'ib'' is a non-existent title so it may not have been in the earliest versions; without this rank, the Mamluk suits would structurally be the same as a Ganjifa suit. In fact, the word "Kanjifah" appears in Arabic on the king of swords and is still used in parts of the Middle East to describe modern playing cards. Influence from further east can explain why the Mamluks, most of whom were Central Asian Turkic [[Kipchaks]], called their cups ''[[Tumen (unit)|tuman]]'' which means myriad in Turkic, Mongolian and [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Pollett, Andrea "The Playing-Card", Vol. 31, No 1 pp. 34–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson postulated that the cups may have been derived from inverting the Chinese and Jurchen ideogram for myriad ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|万}}}}).

The Mamluk court cards showed abstract designs or calligraphy not depicting persons possibly due to [[Aniconism in Islam|religious proscription in Sunni Islam]], though they did bear the ranks on the cards. ''Nā'ib'' would be borrowed into French (''nahipi''), Italian (''naibi''), and Spanish (''naipes''), the latter word still in common usage. Panels on the pip cards in two suits show they had a reverse ranking, a feature found in madiao, ''ganjifa'', and old European card games like [[ombre]], [[Tarot card games|tarot]], and [[Spoil Five|maw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cards.old.no/1500-mamluk/ Mamluk cards]. Cards.old.no. Retrieved on 2015-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment of two uncut sheets of [[Moors|Moorish]]-styled cards of a similar but plainer style were found in Spain and dated to the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/spain/moorish/index Moorish playing cards] at The World of Playing Cards. Retrieved 22 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Export of these cards (from Cairo, Alexandria, and Damascus), ceased after the fall of the Mamluks in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://l-pollett.tripod.com/cards64.htm The Mamluk Cards]. L-pollett.tripod.com.

Four-suited playing cards are first attested in [[Southern Europe]] in 1365,&lt;ref name="Parlett"/&gt; and are likely derived from the Mamluk suits of cups, coins, swords, and polo-sticks, which are still used in traditional Latin decks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Laycock]] in ''Skeptical—a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; As [[polo]] was an obscure sport to Europeans then, the polo-sticks became batons or cudgels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://l-pollett.tripod.com/cards77.htm Andy's Playing Cards - The Tarot And Other Early Cards - page XVII - the moorish deck].

In the account books of [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Johanna, Duchess of Brabant]] and [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg]], an entry dated May 14, 1379 reads: "Given to Monsieur and Madame four peters, two forms, value eight and a half moutons, wherewith to buy a pack of cards". In his book of accounts for 1392 or 1393, Charles or Charbot Poupart, treasurer of the household of [[Charles VI of France]], records payment for the painting of three sets of cards.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.135. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1418 to 1450&lt;ref name="trionfi20"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trionfi.com/0/p/20/|title=Early Card painters and Printers in Germany, Austria and Flandern (14th and 15th century)|publisher=trionfi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; professional card makers in [[Ulm]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Augsburg]] created printed decks. Playing cards even competed with devotional images as the most common uses for [[woodcut]]s in this period. Most early woodcuts of all types were coloured after printing, either by hand or, from about 1450 onwards, [[stencil]]s. These 15th-century playing cards were probably painted. The [[Flemish Hunting Deck]], held by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] is the oldest complete set of ordinary playing cards made in Europe from the 15th century.&lt;ref name=label&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/475513?=&amp;imgno=0&amp;tabname=label |title=The Cloisters Playing Cards, ca. 1475–80 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |date= |accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As cards spread from Italy to Germanic countries, the Latin suits were replaced with the suits of leaves (or shields), hearts (or roses), bells, and acorns, and a combination of Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in the French suits of {{lang|fr|trèfles}} (clovers), {{lang|fr|carreaux}} (tiles), {{lang|fr|cœurs}} (hearts), and {{lang|fr|piques}} (pikes) around 1480. The ''trèfle'' (clover) was probably derived from the acorn and the {{lang|fr|pique}} (pike) from the leaf of the German suits. The names {{lang|fr|pique}} and ''spade'', however, may have derived from the sword ({{lang|fr|spade}}) of the Italian suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trionfi.com/0/p/16/|title=Early Playing Cards Research|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the French suits were eventually used, although the earliest packs circulating may have had Latin suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jducoeur.org/game-hist/seaan-cardhist.html|title=The Introduction of Playing-Cards to Europe|work=jducoeur.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may account for why the English called the clovers "clubs" and the pikes "spades".

In the late 14th century, Europeans changed the Mamluk court cards to represent European royalty and attendants. In a description from 1377, the earliest courts were originally a seated "[[King (playing card)|king]]", an upper [[marshal]] that held his suit symbol up, and a lower marshal that held it down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-c-s.org/history.html History of Playing-Cards] at [[International Playing-Card Society]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/history/earlyrefs Early references to Playing Cards] at World of Playing Cards.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter two correspond with the [[Ober (playing card)|''ober'']] and [[Unter (playing card)|''unter'']] cards found in [[German playing cards|German]] and [[Swiss playing cards]]. The Italians and Iberians replaced the {{lang|de|Ober}}/{{lang|de|Unter}} system with the "[[Knight (playing card)|Knight]]" and [[Jack (playing card)|"{{lang|it|Fante|nocat=y}}" or "{{lang|es|Sota|nocat=y}}"]] before 1390, perhaps to make the cards more visually distinguishable. In England, the lowest court card was called the "knave" which originally meant ''male child'' (compare German {{lang|de|Knabe}}), so in this context the character could represent the "prince", son to the king and queen; the meaning ''servant'' developed later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrington|first=Daines|authorlink=Daines Barrington|title=Archaeologia, or, Miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity|volume=8|year=1787|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|location=|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England |chapter=knave, n, 2|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen (playing card)|Queens]] appeared sporadically in packs as early as 1377, especially in Germany. Although the Germans abandoned the queen before the 1500s, the French permanently picked it up and placed it under the king. Packs of 56 cards containing in each suit a king, queen, knight, and knave (as in tarot) were once common in the 15th century.

During the mid 16th century, Portuguese traders introduced playing cards to Japan. The first indigenous Japanese deck was the {{lang|ja|[[Karuta#Early Karuta|Tenshō karuta]]}} named after the [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|{{lang|ja|Tenshō|nocat=y}} period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://l-pollett.tripod.com/cards9.htm Andy's Playing Cards - Japanese and Korean Cards].

===Later design changes===
[[Image:Imperial Bower.png|thumb|right|Imperial Bower, the earliest [[Joker_(playing_card)|Joker]], by Samuel Hart, c. 1863. Originally designed for use in a specific variant of [[euchre]], it contains instructions for unfamiliar players.]]
Packs with corner and edge indices (i.e. the value of the card printed at the corner(s) of the card) enabled players to hold their cards close together in a fan with one hand (instead of the two hands previously used{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}). The first such pack known with Latin suits was printed by Infirerra and dated 1693,&lt;ref&gt;''International Playing Cards Society Journal'' 30-1 [http://www.i-p-c-s.org/publications.html#journal page 34]&lt;/ref&gt; but this feature was commonly used only from the end of the 18th century. The first American-manufactured (French) deck with this innovation was the Saladee's Patent, printed by Samuel Hart in 1864. In 1870, he and his cousins at Lawrence &amp; Cohen followed up with the Squeezers, the first cards with indices that had a large diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Tom and Judy. (2014) ''Hochman Encyclopedia of American Playing Cards''. 2nd Ed. Ch 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was followed by the innovation of reversible court cards. This invention is attributed to a French card maker of [[Agen]] in 1745. But the French government, which controlled the design of playing cards, prohibited the printing of cards with this innovation. In central Europe ([[Trappola]] cards) and Italy ([[Tarocco Bolognese]]) the innovation was adopted during the second half of the 18th century. In Great Britain, the pack with reversible court cards was patented in 1799 by Edmund Ludlow and Ann Wilcox. The French pack with this design was printed around 1802 by Thomas Wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;''International Playing Cards Society Journal''. XXVII-5 [http://www.i-p-c-s.org/publications.html#journal p. 186]; and 31-1 p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharp corners wear out more quickly, and could possibly reveal the card's value, so they were replaced with rounded corners. Before the mid-19th century, British, American, and French players preferred blank backs. The need to hide wear and tear and to discourage writing on the back led cards to have designs, pictures, photos, or advertising on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Fryxell, David A. (2014-02-07) [http://www.familytreemagazine.com/Article/history-matters-playing-cards History Matters: Playing Cards].

The United States introduced the [[joker (playing card)|joker]] into the deck. It was devised for the game of [[euchre]], which spread from Europe to America beginning shortly after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In euchre, the highest trump card is the Jack of the trump suit, called the ''right bower'' (from the German ''[[:de:Bube (Spielkarte)|Bauer]]''); the second-highest trump, the ''left bower'', is the jack of the suit of the same color as trumps. The joker was invented c. 1860 as a third trump, the ''imperial'' or ''best bower'', which ranked higher than the other two ''bowers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Parlett |first=David | author-link=David Parlett |title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games |year= 1990 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-214165-1|page=190}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the card is believed to derive from ''juker'', a variant name for euchre.&lt;ref name="uspchist"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070826144858/http://www.usplayingcard.com/gamerules/briefhistory.html US Playing Card Co. – A Brief History of Playing Cards] (archive.org mirror)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beal_joker&gt;Beal, George (1975).

{{See also|Suit (cards)}}
Contemporary playing cards are grouped into three broad categories based on the suits they use: French, Latin, and Germanic. Latin suits are used in the closely related Spanish and Italian formats.  The Swiss-German suits are distinct enough to merit their subcategory. Excluding jokers and tarot trumps, the French 52-card deck preserves the number of cards in the original Mamluk deck, while Latin and Germanic decks average fewer. Latin decks usually drop the higher-valued pip cards, while Germanic decks drop the lower-valued ones.

Within suits, there are regional or national variations called "standard patterns." Because these patterns are in the [[public domain]], this allows multiple card manufacturers to recreate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/notes.html | title = Standard pattern notes | publisher = I-p-c-s.org | accessdate=2015-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattern differences are most easily found in the face cards but the number of cards per deck, the use of numeric indices, or even minor shape and arrangement differences of the pips can be used to distinguish them. Some patterns have been around for hundreds of years. Jokers are not part of any pattern as they are a relatively recent invention and lack any standardized appearance so each publisher usually puts their own trademarked illustration into their decks. The wide variation of jokers has turned them into collectible items. Any card that bore the [[stamp duty]] like the [[ace of spades]] in England or the ace of clubs in France are also collectible as that is where the manufacturer's logo is usually placed.

Usually the cards have their pips printed only in the upper left corner assuming holding them with right hand. Such design may be [[Bias against left-handed people|uncomfortable for left-handed people]] who may prefer all four corners of the card to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leftyslefthanded.com/Lefty_s_Left_Handed_Playing_Cards_p/607414.htm|title=Lefty's "Always right" double deck of playing cards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/craigertiger/sinister-deck-the-left-handed-card-deck-with-famou|title=Sinister Deck: The Left-Handed Card Deck With Famous Lefties|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Svg-cards-2.0.svg|left|thumb|52 French playing cards with jokers]]
French decks come in a variety of patterns and deck sizes. The [[Standard 52-card deck|52-card deck]] is the most popular deck and includes 13 ranks of each suit with reversible "court" or face cards. Each suit includes an [[Ace (playing card)|ace]], depicting a single symbol of its suit, a king, queen, and jack, each depicted with a symbol of their suit; and ranks two through ten, with each card depicting that number of pips of its suit. As well as these 52 cards, commercial packs often include between one and six jokers, most often two.

Decks with less than 52 cards are known as [[stripped deck]]s. The [[piquet pack]] has all values from 2 through 6 in each suit removed for a total of 32 cards. It is popular in France, the [[Low Countries]], Central Europe and Russia and is used to play [[piquet]], [[belote]], [[bezique]] and [[Skat (card game)|skat]]. It is also used in the Sri Lankan, whist-based game known as [[Omi|''omi'']]. Forty-card French suited packs are common in northwest Italy; these remove the 8s through 10s like Latin suited decks. 24 card decks, removing 2s through 8s are also sold in Austria and Bavaria to play [[schnapsen]].

A [[pinochle]] deck consists of two copies of each of the 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace cards of all four suits.  It thus comprises just 48 cards per deck.

The 78 card [[Tarot Nouveau|tarot nouveau]] adds the knight card between queens and jacks along with 21 numbered trumps and the unnumbered [[The Fool (Tarot card)|Fool]].

==Symbols in Unicode==
{{Main article|Playing cards in Unicode}}
The [[Unicode]] standard for text encoding on computers defines 8 characters for card suits in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block, at U+2660–2667. Unicode 7.0 added a unified pack for French-suited tarot nouveau's trump cards and the 52 cards of the modern French pack, with 4 knights, together with a character for "Playing Card Back" and black, red, and white jokers in the block U+1F0A0–1F0FF.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F0A0.pdf|title=Unicode – Playing Cards Block|accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Potassium nitrate''' is a [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] [[Potassium|K]][[Nitrogen|N]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is an [[ionic salt]] of [[potassium ion]]s K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[nitrate ion]]s NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, and is therefore an [[alkali metal nitrate]].

It occurs in nature as a mineral, [[niter]]. It is a source of [[nitrogen]], from which it derives its name. Potassium nitrate is one of several nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as '''saltpeter''' or '''saltpetre'''.

Major uses of potassium nitrate are in [[fertilizer]]s, [[tree stump]] removal, [[rocket propellant]]s and [[firework]]s. It is one of the major constituents of [[gunpowder]] (black powder) and has been used since the [[Middle Ages]] as a [[Food preservation|food preservative]].

==Etymology==
Potassium nitrate, because of its early and global use and production, has many names. Hebrew and Egyptian words for it had the consonants n-t-r, indicating likely [[cognate|cognation]] in the Greek ''nitron'', which was Latinised to ''nitrum'' or ''nitrium''. Thence Old French had ''niter'' and Middle English ''nitre''. By the 15th century, Europeans referred to it as ''saltpeter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=Dan|title=Saltpeter:The Mother of Gunpowder|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780199695751|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as ''nitrate of potash,'' as the chemistry of the compound was more fully understood.

The Arabs called it "Chinese snow" ({{lang-ar|ثلج الصين}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|thalj al-ṣīn}}''). It was called "Chinese salt" by the Iranians/Persians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Watson|title=Ideas: A History of Thought and Invention, from Fire to Freud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVNoJydnGAoC&amp;pg=PA304|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-093564-1|page=304|quote=The first use of a metal tube in this context was made around 1280 in the wars between the Song and the Mongols, where a new term, chong, was invented to describe the new horror...Like paper, it reached the West via the Muslims, in this case the writings of the Andalusian botanist Ibn al-Baytar, who died in Damascus in 1248.

==Properties==
Potassium nitrate has an [[orthorhombic]] crystal structure at room temperature, which transforms to a trigonal system at {{convert|129|C|F}}.

Potassium nitrate is moderately soluble in water, but its solubility increases with temperature (see infobox). The aqueous solution is almost neutral, exhibiting [[pH]] 6.2 at {{convert|14|C|F}} for a 10% solution of commercial powder. It is not very [[hygroscopic]], absorbing about 0.03% water in 80% [[relative humidity]] over 50 days. It is insoluble in alcohol and is not poisonous; it can react explosively with reducing agents, but it is not explosive on its own.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

===Thermal decomposition===
Between {{convert|550-790|C|F}}, potassium nitrate reaches a temperature dependent equilibrium with [[potassium nitrite]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Kinetics of the Thermal Decomposition of Potassium Nitrate and of the Reaction between Potassium Nitrite and Oxygen|author=Eli S. Freeman|journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc.|year=1957|volume=79|pages=838–842|doi=10.1021/ja01561a015|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of production==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gunpowder]] and from [[Urine]]--&gt;

===From mineral sources===
The earliest known complete purification process for potassium nitrate was outlined in 1270 by the [[chemist]] and engineer [[Hasan al-Rammah]] of [[Syria]] in his book ''al-Furusiyya wa al-Manasib al-Harbiyya'' (''The Book of [[furusiyya|Military Horsemanship]] and Ingenious War Devices''). In this book, al-Rammah describes first the purification of ''barud'' (crude saltpeter mineral) by boiling it with minimal water and using only the hot solution, then the use of [[potassium carbonate]] (in the form of [[wood ash]]es) to remove calcium and magnesium by precipitation of their carbonates from this solution, leaving a solution of purified potassium nitrate, which could then be dried.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%202.htm Potassium Nitrate in Arabic and Latin Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226105129/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%202.htm |date=2008-02-26 }}, ''History of Science and Technology in Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was used for the manufacture of gunpowder and explosive devices. The terminology used by al-Rammah indicated a Chinese origin for the gunpowder weapons about which he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Kelly|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA22|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-03722-3|page=22|quote=Around 1240 the Arabs acquired knowledge of saltpeter (“Chinese snow”) from the East, perhaps through India. They knew of gunpowder soon afterward. They also learned about fireworks (“Chinese flowers”) and rockets (“Chinese arrows”). Arab warriors had acquired fire lances by 1280. Around that same year, a Syrian named Hasan al-Rammah wrote a book that, as he put it, "treat of machines of fire to be used for amusement of for useful purposes." He talked of rockets, fireworks, fire lances, and other incendiaries, using terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from Chinese sources. He gave instructions for the purification of saltpeter and recipes for making different types of gunpowder.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511041453/https://books.google.com/books?id=8xfs8tC8Ow0C&amp;pg=PA22|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least as far back as 1845, [[Nitratite|Chilean saltpeter]] deposits were exploited in Chile and [[California]], USA.

===From caves===
A major natural source of potassium nitrate was the deposits crystallizing from cave walls and the accumulations of [[bat guano]] in caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Notes on Making Saltpetre from the Earth of the Caves |author=Major George Rains |year=1861 |page=14 |publisher=Daily Delta Job Office |location=New Orleans, LA |accessdate=September 13, 2012 |url=https://archive.org/stream/notesonmakingsal01rain |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729072115/http://archive.org/stream/notesonmakingsal01rain |archivedate=July 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extraction is accomplished by immersing the guano in water for a day, filtering, and harvesting the crystals in the filtered water. Traditionally, guano was the source used in [[Laos]] for the manufacture of gunpowder for [[Rocket Festival|''Bang Fai'']] rockets.

===LeConte===
Perhaps the most exhaustive discussion of the production of this material is the 1862 [[Joseph LeConte|LeConte]] text.&lt;ref name="LeConte"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/lecontesalt/leconte.html|title=Instructions for the Manufacture of Saltpeter|author=Joseph LeConte|publisher=South Carolina Military Department|location=Columbia, S.C.|page=14|year=1862|accessdate=2007-10-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013174033/http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/lecontesalt/leconte.html|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was writing with the express purpose of increasing production in the [[Confederate States]] to support their needs during the [[American Civil War]]. Since he was calling for the assistance of rural farming communities, the descriptions and instructions are both simple and explicit. He details the "French Method", along with several variations, as well as a "Swiss method". N.B. Many references have been made to a method using only straw and urine, but there is no such method in this work.

====French method====
Niter-beds are prepared by mixing [[manure]] with either [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or wood ashes, common earth and organic materials such as [[straw]] to give porosity to a compost pile typically {{convert|4|ft|m}} high, {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|15|ft|m}} long.&lt;ref name="LeConte"/&gt; The heap was usually under a cover from the rain, kept moist with [[urine]], turned often to accelerate the decomposition, then finally [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] with water after approximately one year, to remove the soluble [[calcium nitrate]] which was then converted to potassium nitrate by filtering through [[potash]].

====Swiss method====
LeConte describes a process using only urine and not dung, referring to it as the ''Swiss method''.  Urine is collected directly, in a sandpit under a stable. The sand itself is dug out and leached for nitrates which were then converted to potassium nitrate using potash, as above.

===From nitric acid===
From 1903 until the [[World War I]] era, potassium nitrate for black powder and fertilizer was produced on an industrial scale from nitric acid produced using the [[Birkeland–Eyde process]], which used an electric arc to oxidize nitrogen from the air. During World War I the newly industrialized [[Haber process]] (1913) was combined with the [[Ostwald process]] after 1915, allowing Germany to produce nitric acid for the war after being cut off from its supplies of mineral sodium nitrates from Chile (see [[nitratite]]).

==Production==
Potassium nitrate can be made by combining [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[potassium hydroxide]].

:NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + KOH (aq) → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

An alternative way of producing potassium nitrate without a by-product of ammonia is to combine ammonium nitrate, found in [[Ice pack#Instant ice packs|instant ice packs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://home.howstuffworks.com/refrigerator7.htm|title=How Refrigerators Work|date=2006-11-29|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[potassium chloride]], easily obtained as a sodium-free [[salt substitute]].

:NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + KCl (aq) → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl (aq) + KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

Potassium nitrate can also be produced by neutralizing [[nitric acid]] with potassium hydroxide. This reaction is highly exothermic.

:KOH (aq) + HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

On industrial scale it is prepared by the double displacement reaction between [[sodium nitrate]] and potassium chloride.
:NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + KCl (aq) → NaCl (aq) + KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

==Uses==
Potassium nitrate has a wide variety of uses, largely as a source of nitrate.

===Nitric acid production===
Historically, [[nitric acid]] was produced by combining sulfuric acid with nitrates such as saltpeter. In modern times this is reversed: nitrates are produced from nitric acid produced via the [[Ostwald process]].

===Oxidizer===
[[File:10. Оксидација на јагленче во стопен калиум нитрат.webm|thumb|right|280px|A demonstration of the oxidation of a piece of [[charcoal]] in molten potassium nitrate.]]
The most famous use of potassium nitrate is probably as the oxidizer in [[gunpowder|blackpowder]]. From the most ancient times through the late 1880s, blackpowder provided the explosive power for all the world's firearms. After that time, small arms and large artillery increasingly began to depend on [[cordite]], a [[smokeless powder]]. Blackpowder remains in use today in [[black powder rocket motor]]s, but also in combination with other fuels like sugars in "[[rocket candy]]". It is also used in fireworks such as [[smoke bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.com/minerals/carbonat/niter/niter.htm Amthyst Galleries, Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104110741/http://www.galleries.com/minerals/carbonat/niter/niter.htm |date=2008-11-04 }}. Galleries.com. Retrieved on 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also added to cigarettes to maintain an even burn of the tobacco&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobaccodocuments.org/product_design/00382055-2062.html Inorganic Additives for the Improvement of Tobacco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101110019/http://tobaccodocuments.org/product_design/00382055-2062.html |date=2007-11-01 }}, TobaccoDocuments.org&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to ensure complete combustion of [[paper cartridge]]s for cap and ball revolvers.&lt;ref name=Kirst&gt;{{cite book |author=Kirst, W.J. |title=Self Consuming Paper Cartridges for the Percussion Revolver |place=Minneapolis, Minnesota |publisher=Northwest Development Co. |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be heated to several hundred degrees to be used for [[Bluing (steel)#Niter bluing|niter bluing]], which is less durable than other forms of protective oxidation, but allows for specific and often beautiful coloration of steel parts, such as screws, pins, and other small parts of firearms.

===Food preservation===
In the process of [[food preservation]], potassium nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031223155710/http://www.uwex.edu/ces/flp/meatscience/sausage.html "Meat Science"], University of Wisconsin. uwex.edu.&lt;/ref&gt; but its use has been mostly discontinued because of inconsistent results compared to more modern nitrate and nitrite compounds. Even so, saltpeter is still used in some food applications, such as ''[[charcuterie]]'' and the [[brine]] used to make [[corned beef]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_36271,00.html Corned Beef] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319080839/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_36271,00.html |date=2008-03-19 }}, Food Network&lt;/ref&gt; When used as a food additive in the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007124435/http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |archivedate=2010-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the compound is referred to as [[E number|E252]]; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the United States&lt;ref&gt;US Food and Drug Administration: {{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm191033.htm#ftnT |title=Listing of Food Additives Status Part II |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108002304/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm191033.htm#ftnT |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 – Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IDaWXUlH?url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (where it is listed under its [[List of food additives, Codex Alimentarius|INS number]] 252).&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; Although nitrate salts have been suspected of producing the carcinogen [[nitrosamine]], in the United States both sodium and potassium nitrates and nitrites have been added to meats since 1925, though it is generally accepted that solid muscle products do not require the addition of nitrate for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Bee|title=Yes, bacon really is killing us|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/01/bacon-cancer-processed-meats-nitrates-nitrites-sausages|accessdate=1 March 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food preparation===
In West African cuisine, potassium nitrate (saltpetre) is widely used as a thickening agent in soups and stews such as [[okra soup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cookclean.net/ghanaian_recipe.htm|work=CookClean Ghana|title=Cook Clean Site Ghanaian Recipe|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828125505/http://cookclean.net/ghanaian_recipe.htm|archivedate=2013-08-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[isi ewu]]. It is also used to soften food and reduce cooking time when boiling [[beans]] and tough meat. Saltpetre is also an essential ingredient in making special porridges, such as ''kunun kanwa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcellina Ulunma Okehie-Offoha|title=Ethnic &amp; cultural diversity in Nigeria.|year=1996|publisher=Africa World Press|location=Trenton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally translated from the [[Hausa language]] as 'saltpetre porridge'.
In the Shetland Islands (UK) it is used in the curing of mutton to make "reestit" mutton, a local delicacy.

===Fertilizer===
Potassium nitrate is used in [[fertilizer]]s as a source of nitrogen and potassium – two of the [[Plant nutrition|macronutrients]] for plants. When used by itself, it has an [[NPK rating]] of 13-0-44.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fieldcrop.msu.edu/uploads/documents/e0896.pdf Michigan State University Extension Bulletin E-896: N-P-K Fertilizers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151224052500/http://fieldcrop.msu.edu/uploads/documents/e0896.pdf |date=2015-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental Impact of Fertilizer on Soil and Water|date=2004|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_PwAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780841238114|author1=Hall|first1=William L|last2=Robarge|first2=Wayne P|last3=Meeting|first3=American Chemical Society|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127195831/https://books.google.com/books?id=v_PwAAAAMAAJ|archivedate=2018-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process duct work''' conveys large volumes of hot, dusty air from [[Process engineering|processing equipment]] to mills, baghouses to other process equipment. Process [[Duct (industrial exhaust)|duct work]] may be round or rectangular. Although round duct work costs more to fabricate than rectangular duct work, it requires fewer stiffeners and is favored in many applications over rectangular ductwork.

The air in process duct work may be at ambient conditions or may operate at up to {{convert|900|°F}}. Process ductwork varies in size from 2&amp;nbsp;ft diameter to 20&amp;nbsp;ft diameter or to perhaps 20&amp;nbsp;ft by 40&amp;nbsp;ft rectangular.

Large process ductwork may fill with dust, depending on slope, to up to 30% of cross section, which can weigh 2 to 4 tons per linear foot.

Round ductwork is subject to duct suction collapse, and requires stiffeners to minimize this, but is more efficient in material than rectangular duct work.

There are no comprehensive, design references for process duct work design. The ASCE reference for the design of power plant duct design gives some general guidance on duct design, but does not specifically give designers sufficient information to design process duct work.

==Structural process ductwork==
Structural process ductwork carries large volumes of high temperature, dusty air, between pieces of process equipment. The design of this ductwork requires an understanding of the interaction of heat softening of [[metal]]s, potential effects of dust buildup in large ductwork, and [[structural design]] principles. There are two basic shapes for structural process ductwork: rectangular and round. Rectangular ductwork is covered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] "The Structural Design of Air &amp; Gas Ducts for Process Power Stations and Industrial Applications".

In the practical design of primarily round structural process ductwork in the [[cement]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[lead]] industries, the duct size involved ranges from 18&amp;nbsp;inches (45&amp;nbsp;cm) to 30&amp;nbsp;feet (10&amp;nbsp;m). The air temperature may vary from ambient to 1000&amp;nbsp;°F (515&amp;nbsp;°C). Process ductwork is subject to large loads due to dust buildup, fan suction pressure, wind, and [[earthquake]] forces. {{As of|2009}} 30&amp;nbsp;ft diameter process ductwork may cost $7,000 per ton. Failure to properly integrate design forces may lead to catastrophic duct collapse. Overdesign of ductwork is expensive.

===Round and rectangular duct structural design===
The structural design of ductwork plate is based on buckling of the plate element. Round ductwork plate design is based on diameter to duct plate thickness ratios, and the allowable stresses are contained in multiple references such as ''US Steel Plate'', ASME/ANSI STS-1,SMNACA, ''Tubular Steel Structures'', and other references. In actuality round ductwork bent in bending is approximately 30% stronger than a similar shape in compression, however one uses the same allowable stresses in bending as we do for compression.

Round ducts require typical stiffeners at roughly 3 diameter spacing, or roughly 20&amp;nbsp;ft. O.C. for wind ovaling and fabrication and truck shipping requirements. Round ducts, larger than {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in diameter (1/4" plate) require support ring stiffeners. Smaller-diameter ducts may not require support ring stiffeners, but may be designed with saddle supports. When stiffener rings are required they are traditionally designed based on "Roark", although this reference is quite conservative.

Round duct elbow allowable stresses are lower than the allowable stresses for straight duct  by a K factor = 1.65/(h 2/3power) where [h = t (duct) * R (elbow) /(r(duct)*r (duct). This equation, or similar equations is found in ''Tubular Steel Structures'' section 9.9.

Rectangular ductwork design properties is based on width-to-thickness ratios. This is simplified, normally to width=t/16, from corner elements or corner angle stiffeners, although in reality, the entire duct top &amp; side plate does participate, somewhat in duct section properties.

===Duct logic===

Duct logic is the process of planning for duct thermal movement, combined with planning to minimize duct dust dropout.

Ducts move with changes in internal temperature. Ducts are assumed to have the same temperature as their internal gasses, which may be up to 900&amp;nbsp;°F. If the internal duct temperature exceeds 1000&amp;nbsp;°F, refractory lining is used to minimize the duct surface temperature. At 1000&amp;nbsp;°F, ducts may grow approximately 5/8 inch per 10 feet of length. This movement must be carefully planned for, with cloth (or metal) expansion joints at each equipment flange, and one joint per each straight section of ductwork.

Sloping ductwork at or above the duct dust angle of repose will minimize dust buildup. Therefore many ducts carrying high dust loads slope at 30 degrees, or steeper.

===Duct elbow geometry===

To minimize pressure loss in duct elbows, the typical elbow radius is 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 times the duct diameter. In cases where this elbow radius is not feasible, turning vanes are added to the duct.

[[File:Stack Inlet Transition.jpg|thumbnail|Stack transition at concrete stack]]
===Duct transition and elbow layout===

Process ductwork is often large (6-foot diameter to 18-foot diameter), carrying large volumes of hot dirty gasses, at velocities of 3000 to 4500 feet per minute. The fans used to move these gasses are also large, 250 to 4000 horsepower. Therefor minimizing duct pressure drop by minimizing turbulence at elbows and transitions is of importance. Duct elbow radius is usually 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 to 2 times the duct size. The side slopes of transitions are typically 10 to 30 degrees.

Note: the duct gas velocity is chosen to minimize duct dust dropout. Cement and lime plant duct velocity at normal operations is 3000 to 3200 foot per minute, lead plant velocities are 4000 to 4500 foot per minute, as the dust is heavier. Other industries, such as grain have lower gas velocities. Higher duct gas velocity may require more powerful fans than lower duct velocities.

===Duct support types===
* Fixed supports typically are designed to resist lateral movement of the duct. Depending on the support geometry, fixed supports may also resist rotation of the duct art the support.
* Sliding supports are typically supported on Teflon, (or other material) pads, isolated from the duct so that temperature and dust does not damage the sliding surface.
* Link supports  are often "bents", or braced frames down from the duct support ring (frame) to a foundation or support plane. if the bent is long enough, hinges are not required to allow for duct thermal growth.
* Rod or hanger supports are similar to link supports, but due to the flexibility of the rod supports, that are easier to design and detail.
* Guide supports: Often rings inside a structural frame, with angle guides, that allow the duct to grow vertically while restraining the duct laterally for wind loads.
* Unusual "support" conditions (details):
** Hinges at expansion joints
** Tension ties across dual fixed supports
** Designs that allowing duct elbows to flex under unusual support conditions
** Other unusual design models.

===Duct design loads===

For cement plant and Lime plant process ductwork, duct loads are a combination of:
# Duct dead loads: are often simplified (in Cement plant usage) by using duct plate weight, multiplied by 1.15 as a stiffener allowance, as duct stiffeners usually weigh less than 15% times the duct plate weight. Duct stiffener allowance for rectangular power plants ductwork may be 50% to 100% of the duct plate weight.
# Duct internal dust loads (bottom of duct): which vary considerably with duct slope. These loads need to be approved by the client, but are often used as follows:
For duct sloping 0 degrees to 30 degrees, duct internal dust is 25% of duct cross section. For duct sloping 30 degrees to  45 degrees duct dust loads are reduced to 15% of cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping 45 degrees to 85 degrees,duct internal dust is 5% of duct cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping over 85 degrees.
Because of the potential for high dust loading, most process ductwork is run at a 30 to 45 degree slope.

2a) Duct dust loading in non-process ducts (2-foot diameter and smaller), such as conveyor venting ducts are sometimes run horizontally and can be filled to 100% of cross section.

2b) Power plant internal duct dust loads are coordinated with the client, and are sometimes used at 1 to 2 foot of internal ash loadings.

3) Duct internal, coating dust loads, which sometimes are used as a 2" (50&amp;nbsp;mm) coating of dust on the internal perimeter.

4) Duct suction pressure loads. Most process duct loads have design pressures of 25 inches (600&amp;nbsp;mm) to 40 inches (1000&amp;nbsp;mm) of water pressure. This suction pressure operates to cause suction pressure collapse on the duct side walls. Also this pressure operates perpendicular to the duct "expansion joints" to create an additional load on the duct supports that adds to dead, and live loads. Please note: duct pressure loads vary with temperature, as the gas density varies with temperature. A duct pressure of 25 inches of H2O, at room temperature may become 12 inches to 6 inches at duct operating pressures.

5) Duct wind loads

6) Duct Seismic loads

7) Duct Snow loads, normally inconsequential, as snow will melt quickly unless the plant is in shutdown mode.

8) Top of duct dust loads, often used as zero, since plant dust generation is much less now, than in the past.

9) Duct suction pressure loads, act perpendicular to end of duct cross section, and can be significant. For a duct designed for 25" of water at a startup temperature of 70 degree F, on an 8 foot in diameter duct, this is equal to 8000 pounds at each end of the duct.

[[File:Copy of Duct Fixed Suport.jpg|thumbnail|Duct fixed support]]

==Round ductwork==

The majority of cement plant process ductwork is round. This is because the round duct shape does not bend between circumferential stiffeners. Therefor bending stiffeners are not required, and round ductwork requires fewer and lighter intermediate stiffeners than rectangular ductwork. Round cement plant duct stiffeners are sometimes about 5% duct plate weight. Rectangular cement plant duct stiffeners are 15 to 20% times duct plate weight. Power plant ductwork is often larger. power plant ductwork is usually rectangular, with stiffener weights of 50% (or more) times duct plate weight. (this is based on personal experience, and my vary with loads, duct size, and industry standards)

Large, round process ductwork is usually [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from 1/4-inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) mild steel plate, with ovaling stiffening rings at 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;ft (5 to 6 M) on center, regardless of diameter. These lengths allow for resistance to wind ovaling and resistance to out of round when shipping by truck. This also works well with fabricator equipment.

The typical intermediate rings are designed for wind bending [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], reduced as required by the [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]] reduction at working temperatures. The typical rings are fabricated from rolled steel plate, angles or tees's welded together to create the ring cross section required. Rings are fabricated from any combination of plate, tee or W shape that the shop can roll. Rings are usually mild carbon steel, ASTM A36 plate, or equivalent. The location of ring butt welds should preferably be offset 15 degrees(+/-)from point of maximum stress to minimize the effect of weld porosity on weld allowable stress.

See [[U.S. Steel|US Steel]] Plate, volume II for empirical ring spacing, and wind bending stress:
Spacing = Ls = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)]
Section = p * L (spacing, ft) * Do (ft) * Do (ft)/Fb (20,000 at ambient T)
This reference is older, but a good starting point for duct design.

SMACNA, (2ND Edition) chapter 4 has many useful formulas for round ducts, allowable stresses, ring spacing, effect of dust, ice,and live loads. The basic factor of safety for SMACNA, 3, is larger than typically used on typical structural engineering projects, of 1.6.
Under SMACNA the critical ring spacing for rings is L = 1.25 * D (ft) sqrt (D(ft)/t(inches)), which is similar to tubular steel structures, L = 3.13 * R sqrt (R/t). In effect, using Spacing = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)] is conservative.

Allowable bending and compression stress in ducts can come from several sources.

See API 560 for design of wind ovaling stiffeners

See Tubular Steel structures, chapter 2, 9 &amp; 12 for the allowable stresses for thin, round ducts, their allowable stresses, elbows, elbow softening coefficients, and some procedures for the design of duct support rings. These allowable stresses can be verified with select review of chapters of US Steel Plate, Blodgett Design of plate structures, Roark &amp; Young, or API 650.

Round duct support rings are spaced, often at three diameters, or as require at up to about 50&amp;nbsp;ft centers (14 m). At this spacing the main support rings are designed for the sum of [[suction pressure]] stresses &amp; support bending moments.

Round ductwork allowable compressive stress is = 662 /(d/t) +339 * Fy (tubular steel structures, chapter 2). Other reference use similar equations.

Ductwork typical cement plant pressure drops are: 60% to 80% of high temperature process duct work [[pressure drop]] occurs in the process equipment, baghouses, mills and cyclones. Since motor 1 (one) horsepower cost roughly $1000/year (US$) (2005), duct efficiency is important. Minimizing duct pressure drop can reduce plan operating costs. most ductwork, non-equipment pressure drop occurs at transitions and changes of directions (elbows). The bests way to minimize duct pressure drop or to minimize plant operating costs, is to use elbows with an elbow radius to duct radius exceeding 1.5. (For a 15-foot duct, the elbow radius would therefore equal, or exceed, 22.5&amp;nbsp;ft.)

Process duct pressure drops (US practice) are usually measured in inches of water. A typical duct operates at about - 25 inches (160 psf.) total suction pressure, with roughly 75% of the pressure loss in the bag house, and 10% of pressure lost in duct friction, and 15% (nominal)lost in elbow turbulence. A major consideration of duct design is to minimize duct pressure losses, turbulence, as poor duct geometry, increases turbulence, and increases plant electrical usage.

Round duct work suction pressure collapse, in ducts over 6 feet in diameter, is prevented with rings at supports, and roughly 3 diameter centers.

Round duct support rings are traditionally designed from the formula's found in Roark &amp; Young. However this reference is based on point loads on rings, while actual duct ring loads are based on almost uniform bottom dust. Therefore these formulars can be shown with Ram, or other analysis methods to have conservatism factor of roughly 2 above the stresses given In Roark. The duct ring force dead, live and dust forces need to be combined with suction pressure stresses. Suction pressure forces concentrate on the rings, as they are the stiffest element present.

Round ductwork elbow allowable stresses are reduced due to the elbow curvature. Various references give similar results for this reduction. Tubular steel structures, Section 9.9 gives the (Beskin) reduction factor of K= 1.65/(h (2/3 power)) where h= t (plate) *R(elbow)/ r (duct) (where suction pressures are smaller). This K reduces the I factor of the duct  I effective = I/K.

Round duct rings are fabricated from rolled tees, angles, or plates, welded into the shape required. Typically these are designed with ASTM A-36 properties.

===Factors of safety===

Typical duct round plate factor of safety (traditional factor of safety) should be 1.6, because duct plate bending, and buckling is mostly controlled by typical intermediate ring design.

Typical intermediate ring factor of safety should be 1.6, because there is ample evidence in various codes, (API 360, etc.) that intermediate rings designed for wind ovaling and suction pressure combinations are safe.

Typical main support ring factor of safety, if designed by "Roark" formulas should be 1.6, (If constructed to the Roark normal 1% out of round standard tolerance) because it can be shown by various methods that these formulas are at least a factor of two, above three D duct ring analysis results etc..

Typical duct elbow factor of safety should be above 1.6, because it can be difficult to show that shipping out of round for elbows corresponds to the normal 1% out of round standard tolerance. (various code and reference notes).

==Round structural conveyor tubes==

Round structural tubes are sometimes used to support and contain conveyors transporting coal, lead concentrate, or other dusty material over county roads, plant access roads, or river barge loading facilities. When tubes are used for these purposes they may be 10'-6" to 12 foot diameter, and up to 250 foot long, using up to 1/2" plate and ovaling ring stiffeners at 8 foot (to 20 foot centers). On one such project My firm added L8x8x3/4  at the top 45 degree  location to stiffen the plate near the point of maximum stress for tubes (as per Timoshenko, and others).

Some vendor provide conveyor galleries for the same purpose.

==Rectangular ductwork==

Rectangular cement plant ductwork is often 1/4" (6&amp;nbsp;mm) duct plate, with stiffeners spaced at about 2'-6", depending on suction pressure and temperature. Thinner plate requires a closer stiffener spacing. The stiffeners are usually considered pinned end. Power plant ductwork can be 5/16" thick duct plate, with "fixed end" W stiffeners at roughly 2'-5" spacing. Because rectangular duct plate bends, stiffeners are required at reasonably close spacing. Duct plate 3/16", or thinner, may dishpan, or make noise, and should be avoided.

Rectangular duct section properties are calculated from the distance between the upper to lower duct corners of the ductwork The flanges areas are based on the size of corner angles plus duct plate width based on the plate thickness ratio of 16*t. (see AISC structural duct design below) For section properties the "web" plate is ignored.

The typical stiffener spacing for cement plant duct work is usually based on duct plate bending M = W * L * L / 8. This is because using a fixed-fixed condition requires difficult to design plate attachments. Power plant, and other larger ductwork,  usually goes thru the expense of creating "fixed End" corner moment. all stiffeners for rectangular ductwork requires consideration of lateral torsional bracing stiffeners.

==Effect of temperature on duct yield stress==
Ducts are usually designed as if the duct plate and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For mild carbon steels (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300°F is 84% of room temperature stress. At 500°F, the design yield stress ratio is 77% of room temperature stress. At 700°F, the design yield stress ratio is about 71% of room temperature stress. Temperatures above 800°F may cause mild carbon steel to warp. This is because, in this temperature range, the crystal lattice structure of mild carbon steel changes with temperatures above about 800 degrees F (reference, US Steel Plate, elevated temperature steel).

For ductwork operating above 800 degrees F, duct plate material should resist warping. Either Core-ten or ASTM A304 stainless steel may be used for duct plate between 800°F and 1200°F, Core-ten plate is less expensive than stainless steel.

Corten steels have essentially the same yield stress ratios as Corten through 700°F. At 900°F, the yield stress ratio is 63%. At 1100°F, the yield stress ratio is 58% (AISC tables). Corten steels should not be used above 1100°F.

Unless the duct and its stiffeners are insulated, the stiffeners can be designed in ASTM A36 steels, even at a duct temperature of 1000°F. This is because the stiffener temperature is cooler than the duct gas temperature by several hundred degrees (F). Duct stiffener temperatures are assumed to drop about 100°F per inch of depth (when uninsulated) (no reference available).

==Corrosion and wear resistance==

===Corrosion===
As reducing the loss of heat at plants has changed over the years, ductwork now connects more pieces of equipment than ever before. Care needs to be taken to avoid condensation of moisture in plant ductwork. Once condensation occurs, the condensation may absorb CO2, other components in the gas stream, and become corrosive on low carbon steel. Methods to avoid this problem may include
# Duct insulation
# specialty steels, such as COR-10 steels or A304 SS or A316L SS,
# Duct internal coatings. Duct internal coatings are expensive, and may cost more than the stack plate they protect. Uncoated stacks cement plant stacks, with condensation, have been noted to last less than two years.

Sulfuric acid attack may require stainless steel ducts, fiberglass ducts, etc.

===Wear resistance===
Many plant exhaust gasses contain dusts with high wear potential. Typically wear resistant steels are not useful in resisting duct wear, particularly at higher temperatures. Wear resistant steel ducts are hard to fabricate, and refractory coatings are usually less expensive than wear resistant steel ductwork. Each industry may have different approaches to resist duct wear.

Cement plant clinker dust is more abrasive than sand. In high temperature ducts, or ducts with wear potential, 2 1/2-inch refractory, is often anchored to the duct plate with V anchors at 6" O.C. (+/-) to resist a) temperature, or b) wear at elbows or a combination of these effects. Occasionally ceramic tiles or ceramic mortars are anchored to ductwork to resist temperature and wear.

Grain plant hulls are also very abrasive. Sometimes plastic liners are used to resist wear in grain facilities, where temperatures are lower than in mineral processing facilities.

==Expansion joint types==

Duct segments are typically separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen to separate the duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than metal joints. Also metal joints place an additional loads onto duct segments. Metal joints prefer axial movements, and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments.  fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of joint (2010). Metal joints can cost twice this amount.

fabric expansion duct forces are assumed to be 0 #/inch. Metal expansion joint forces for metal joints a 24-inch diameter duct are on the order of 850#/ inch of movement for axial spring rate, and 32,500 #/inch for lateral movement. These coefficients will vary with duct size, joint thickness, and becomes larger for rectangular ducts (based on one recent job).

Fabric expansion joint life is about 5 years under field conditions. Many plants prefer access platforms near the joints for replacing the joint fabric.

==Finite element software==

Currently software is available to model ductwork in 3D. This software needs to be used with care, as the design rules for width to thickness and elbow softening coefficients, etc., may not be input into the design program.

==Drawing presentation and dimensioning==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}

It is easy to draw ducts in 3D without correct dimensioning. Drawings should be laid out with:

* Work points, with elevations, and plan dimensioning.
* Elbow radius, duct diameters, or width and thickness dimensions, elbow tangent dimensions (true view and plan and elevation views)
* Column grids, dimensions between supports, showing work points
* Lack of dimensions in 3D generated drawings makes drawings hard to follow.
* supports need to be coordinated with elevations.

==Special duct loading conditions==

Special duct loading conditions may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, and to some extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5&amp;nbsp;ft. to 15&amp;nbsp;ft. in diameter, and 20&amp;nbsp;ft. to 30&amp;nbsp;ft. long. Therefore access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.

==Duct details==

Ducts are shipped from fabricating facility to job sites on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating the mode of transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. Flanges may be difficult to design for the duct plate forces. Flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that make their ability to carry forces problematic. Therefore, weld straps (short steel straps) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.

==Various duct photos==
A close look at the fixed duct support photo shows several properties or round ring supports. There are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from two rolled WTs, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4" bolts at 6" nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" or 3/8" angle thicknesses are common.    
  
See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius is from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo. 

The adjacent photo also shows several principles of process ductwork. It shows a large baghouse inlet ductwork. The inlet duct is tapered to minimize dust dropout. A shallow taper such at this also reduces pressure losses when changing duct diameters. Note the rectangular duct ring spacing is roughly 2'-6" on center. The round duct is stiffened near each branch duct.

== Resources ==
There are several references for process duct work. These references are worked together to review duct design processes. Other references are often used for duct design, but they give similar results. Finite element design of process duct work is possible, but a requirement of design theory and allowable stresses is required to properly interpret the finite element model.

Cement, lime and lead industry accepted dust loads (for structural loading) are:
Process ductwork is intended to convey large volumes of dust. some of this dust will settle to the bottom of the duct during power outages and normal operation.

The percentage of duct cross section filled with dust is often assumed to be as follows:

* Duct slopes level to 30 degrees, 25% of cross section.
* Duct slopes, 30 degrees to 45 degrees, 15% of cross section
* Duct Slopes, 45 degrees to 85 Degrees, 5%
* Above 85 degrees, a 2&amp;nbsp;in (50&amp;nbsp;mm) interior coating of dust.
* These loads are always confirmed with the client, before use, but the above in US common practice

To minimize the buildup of dust, each material has a minimum carrying velocity, lime = about 2800 fpm., cement about 3200 fpm, and lead dust about 4200 fpm.

Dust density depends on industry, Normally these are: cement dust density = 94 pcf, lime industry = 50 pcf, lead oxide dust = 200 pcf.

Duct Wear: High temperature ductwork often carries large volumes of hot abrasive dust. Often the design temperature of the duct, or the abrasiveness of the dust, prevents the use of abrasive resisting steels. In these cases refractory can be anchored inside the duct, or abrasive resisting tiles, with weld nuts, are welded to the inside of the ductwork.
 
Duct Thermal Movement

Duct steels expand with temperature. Each type of steel may have a different coefficient of thermal expansion, typical mild carbon steels expand with the coefficient of 0.0000065 (See AISC).

'''Robotic magnetic navigation''' ('''RMN''') (also called remote magnetic navigation) uses robotic technology to direct magnetic fields which control the movement of magnetic-tipped endovascular catheters into and through the chambers of the heart during [[cardiac catheterization]] procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Da Costa |first1=A |last2=Guichard |first2=JB |last3=Roméyer-Bouchard |first3=C |last4=Gerbay |first4=A |last5=Isaaz |first5=K |title=Robotic magnetic navigation for ablation of human arrhythmias. |journal=Medical devices (Auckland, N.Z.) |date=2016 |volume=9 |pages=331–339 |doi=10.2147/MDER.S96167 |pmid=27698569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devices==
Because the human heart beats during ablation procedures, catheter stability can be affected by navigation technique. Magnetic fields created by RMN technology guide the tip of a catheter using a “pull” mechanism of action (as opposed to “push” with manual catheter navigation). Magnetic catheter navigation has been associated with greater catheter stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=DR |last2=Tang |first2=AS |last3=Gollob |first3=MH |last4=Lemery |first4=R |last5=Green |first5=MS |last6=Birnie |first6=DH |title=Remote magnetic navigation-assisted catheter ablation enhances catheter stability and ablation success with lower catheter temperatures. |journal=Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE |date=July 2008 |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=893–8 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-8159.2008.01105.x |pmid=18684288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical use==
===Atrial fibrilation===
As of 2015 there were two robotic catherization systems on the market for [[atrial fibrilation]]; one of them used magnetic guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gerstenfeld |first1=EP |last2=Duggirala |first2=S |title=Atrial fibrillation ablation: indications, emerging techniques, and follow-up. |journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases |date=2015 |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=202–12 |doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2015.07.008 |pmid=26241304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After long-term follow up, RMN navigation has been associated with better procedural and clinical outcomes for AF ablation when compared with manual catheter navigation for cardiac ablation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yuan |first1=S |last2=Holmqvist |first2=F |last3=Kongstad |first3=O |last4=Jensen |first4=SM |last5=Wang |first5=L |last6=Ljungström |first6=E |last7=Hertervig |first7=E |last8=Borgquist |first8=R |title=Long-term outcomes of the current remote magnetic catheter navigation technique for ablation of atrial fibrillation. |journal=Scandinavian cardiovascular journal : SCJ |date=December 2017 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=308–315 |doi=10.1080/14017431.2017.1384566 |pmid=28958165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventricular tachyardia===
RMN has been shown to be safe and effective for cardiac catheter ablation in various patient populations with  [[ventricular tachycardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turagam |first1=MK |last2=Atkins |first2=D |last3=Tung |first3=R |last4=Mansour |first4=M |last5=Ruskin |first5=J |last6=Cheng |first6=J |last7=Di Biase |first7=L |last8=Natale |first8=A |last9=Lakkireddy |first9=D |title=A meta-analysis of manual versus remote magnetic navigation for ventricular tachycardia ablation. |journal=Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing |date=September 2017 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=227–235 |doi=10.1007/s10840-017-0257-3 |pmid=28624892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Akca |first1=F |last2=Önsesveren |first2=I |last3=Jordaens |first3=L |last4=Szili-Torok |first4=T |title=Safety and efficacy of the remote magnetic navigation for ablation of ventricular tachycardias--a systematic review. |journal=Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing |date=June 2012 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=65–71 |doi=10.1007/s10840-011-9645-2 |pmid=22180126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''rotary stage''' is a component of a [[motion system]] used to restrict an object to a single axis of rotation. The terms '''rotary table''' or '''rotation stage''' are often used interchangeably with '''rotary stage'''. All rotary stages consist of a platform and a base, joined by some form of guide in such a way that the platform is restricted to rotation about a single axis with respect to the base. In common usage, the term '''rotary stage''' may or may not also include the mechanism by which the angular position of the platform is controlled relative to the base.

== Principle of operation ==
In three-dimensional space, an object may either rotate about, or translate along, any of three axes. Thus, the object is said to have six degrees of freedom (3 rotational and 3 translational). A rotary stage exhibits only one degree of freedom (rotation about one axis). In other words, rotary stages operate by physically restricting 3 axes of translation and 2 axes of rotation.

== Bearing types ==
Rotary stages consist of a platform that moves relative to a base. The platform and base are joined by some form of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] which restricts motion of the platform to rotation about a single axis. A variety of different styles of bearings are used, each with benefits and drawbacks, making them more appropriate for some applications than for others.

=== Plain bearing ===
A [[plain bearing]] is simply two surfaces sliding against each other. Typically, a circular step on the platform mates snugly with a circular depression in the base allowing free rotation while minimizing side to side motion. A rotary stage built with this type of bearing is usually only used for coarse positioning and is adjusted manually simply by turning the platform. Index marks on either the base or the platform are often provided, allowing for somewhat repeatable positioning of the platform relative to the base.

=== Rolling-element bearing ===
This type of rotary stage includes ball bearing stages, crossed roller bearing stages, and possibly others. Any of a number of different [[rolling-element bearing]]s may be employed. Typically, a pair of bearings is used and they are preloaded to take up any slack which could result in the stage platform lifting relative to the base.

== Position control methods ==
=== Manual direct ===
Some rotary stages are operated simply by turning the platform by hand. The platform may have index marks for setting different angular positions relative to the base. A locking mechanism may be provided to fix the platform to the base at the desired position.

=== Manual worm drive ===
For more precise position control, a [[worm drive]] may be used. A worm wheel is fixed to the rotating platform and meshes with a worm in the base. Rotation of the worm via a manual control knob causes the platform to rotate with respect to the base. Index marks on both the control knob and the platform can be used to locate the platform very precisely and repeatably with respect to the base.

=== Stepper motor with worm drive ===
Replacing the manual control knob in the above manual worm drive scenario a [[stepper motor]] allows positioning of the rotary stage to be automated. A stepper motor rotates in fixed increments or steps. The number of steps moved is controlled by the stepper motor controller. In this sense, the stepper motor behaves much like an indexed control knob.

=== DC motor and encoder with worm drive ===
A DC motor may also be used in place of a manual control knob. A DC motor does not move in fixed increments. Therefore, an alternate means is required to determine stage position. An encoder may be attached to the DC motor and used to report the angular position of the motor to the motor controller, allowing a motion controller to reliably and repeatably move the stage to set positions.

=== Linear actuator ===
When precise angular positioning over only a small total angle is required, a [[linear actuator]] (either manual, or motorized) may be used. Typically, the range of motion possible is only 10° to 20° of rotation. The linear actuator presses against a contact surface fixed to the stage platform such that extension or retraction of the actuator causes the platform to rotate. The stage platform is sprung against the actuator tip so that the contact surface stays in contact with the actuator tip when the actuator retracts.

[[File:SOTA_Mapping_Project_(SMP)_logo.png|thumb|right|SOTA Mapping Project logo]]
'''SOTA Mapping Project (SMP)''' is a [[website]] ([http://www.sotamaps.org/ www.sotamaps.org]) offering [[map]]ping resources for [[radio amateur]]s participating in the [[Summits On The Air (SOTA)]] awards program. It aims to provide comprehensive mapping information in graphical form based on [[Google Maps]] on summits included in the program, for participants in the program as well as for the general user.

The site is built and maintained by a small group of radio amateurs with interests in SOTA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotamaps.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[hill walking]] and [[mountaineering]], mapping and [[open source programming]].  They also maintain&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iotamaps.org/about.php&lt;/ref&gt; a similar site ([http://www.iotamaps.org/ www.iotamaps.org]) for the [[Islands on the air]] (IOTA) award scheme.

==Features==
The site has five main mapping pages, each providing different sets of functionality.

===Main page===
This is the page most often used, since it is referenced directly by links from each of the SOTAWatch Summit pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sotawatch.org/summits.php |title=SOTAWatch Summit pages |publisher=Sotawatch.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being able to view various SOTA Associations, Regions and individual summits, the page offers the exporting or downloading of such data in [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] (for import into a [[GPS]] device) or [[KML]] (for importing into [[Google Earth]]) formats.

===Range page===
The Range page provides tools with which the user can perform various distance-measurement tasks. The most often used of these is the "range" facility itself, which will find summits within a certain distance of some reference point. The user can input a central location in one of several forms - [[latitude]]/[[longitude]], [[Maidenhead Locator System|Maidenhead ("Grid") Locator]], or an address or place-name - and can then choose one of three range-types within which the summits should be found:
* closed circle: summits within the entire circle will be found;
* open circle: by entering two different distances representing the radii of two concentric circles, summits will be found within the annulus formed by the two circles;
* road-route: the user enters a search radius, and defines the start- and end-positions of a route; then,by choosing one of possibly several routes found between those points, all summits within a corridor of width equal to the search-radius along the length of the route will be found.

All summits so found will be presented in a list and also on the map. Export of data for the summits found is also provided.

===Tracks page===
The Tracks Page allows the user to view, draw, or upload tracks or walking routes leading to SOTA summits. The three main sets of options are:
* View user-defined tracks on map - view tracks generated by users of the system. 
* Draw track on map - using custom drawing tools, the user can draw a favourite track leading to a SOTA summit.
* Import track from file - the user can import a track (in GPX format) to a SOTA summit which he/she has recorded with a GPS unit.
Export of tracks data for the summits is also provided.

===Alerts page===
Presents the latest SOTAWatch Alerts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sotawatch.org/alerts.php |title=SOTAWatch Alerts |publisher=Sotawatch.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; - data are refreshed once every minute. Each Alert as it arrives is presented in the listview on the right-hand side of the main map.

===Spots page===
Presents the latest SOTAWatch Spots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sotawatch.org/spots.php |title=SOTAWatch Spots |publisher=Sotawatch.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; - data are refreshed once every minute. Each Spot as it arrives is presented in the listview on the right-hand side of the main map. Clicking on an entry in the list will cause the map to navigate to the summit mentioned in the Spot and an information window will open, listing all Spots reported for that summit within the time-frame of the query.

== Mapping tools==
Each of the five mapping pages, in addition to their specific functionality, also feature a set of map tools common to all. These are situated at the top of the map area in each of the mapping pages.
* Position - shows latitude/longitude and Maidenhead Locator at the mouse-pointer; also features a full '''dynamic Locator grid''', showing greater detail as the user zooms into the map;
* Open Maps - allows the user to choose in addition to, and as replacements for, the standard mapping styles from Google Maps, one of two extra mapping styles provided by the open source mapping community: [[Open Street Map]], or Open Cycle Map Normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencyclemap.org |title=Open Cycle Maps |publisher=Opencyclemap.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Day/Night - shows day/night shading and sunrise/sunset [[Terminator (solar)#The Earth.27s terminator|terminator]] superimposed on the mapping area. This is experimental, and results cannot be 100% guaranteed, but give nonetheless a very good approximation of the sun/terminator position.

[[File:Valvole di sicurezza di grandi dimensioni.jpg|thumb|200px|ND250-safety valves]]

A '''safety valve''' is a [[valve]] that acts as a [[fail-safe]]. An example of safety valve is a pressure [[relief valve]] (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a [[boiler]], [[pressure vessel]], or other [[system]], when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. [[Pilot-operated relief valve]]s are a specialized type of pressure safety valve. A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a [[rupture disk]].

Safety valves were first developed for use on steam boilers during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Early boilers operating without them were prone to [[boiler explosion|explosion]] unless carefully operated.

Vacuum safety valves (or combined pressure/vacuum safety valves) are used to prevent a tank from collapsing while it is being emptied, or when cold rinse water is used after hot CIP (clean-in-place) or SIP (sterilization-in-place) procedures.
When sizing a vacuum safety valve, the calculation method is not defined in any norm, particularly in the hot CIP / cold water scenario, but some manufacturers &lt;ref&gt;[http://servinox.com/wordpress/index.php/event-autonome-ultra-propre-hsv/?lang=en Safety valve sized regarding hot CIP -&gt; Cold water conditions]&lt;/ref&gt; have developed sizing simulations.

==Function and design==
[[File:Proportional-Safety Valve.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A [[Multiview orthographic projection#Cross-section|cross-section]] of a proportional-safety valve]]
The earliest and simplest safety valve was used on a 1679 [[steam digester]] and utilized a weight to retain the steam pressure (this design is still commonly used on [[pressure cooker]]s); however, these were easily tampered with or accidentally released. On the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], the safety valve tended to go off when the engine hit a bump in the track. A valve less sensitive to sudden accelerations used a spring to contain the steam pressure, but these (based on a [[Richard Salter (inventor)|Salter]] [[spring balance]]) could still be screwed down to increase the pressure beyond design limits. This dangerous practice was sometimes used to marginally increase the performance of a steam engine. In 1856, [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof spring safety valve that became universal on railways. The Ramsbottom valve consisted of two plug-type valves connected to each other by a spring-laden pivoting arm, with one valve element on either side of the pivot. Any adjustment made to one of valves in an attempt to increase its operating pressure would cause the other valve to be lifted off its seat, regardless of how the adjustment was attempted. The pivot point on the arm was not symmetrically between the valves, so any tightening of the spring would cause one of the valves to lift. Only by removing and diassembling the entire valve assembly could its operating pressure be adjusted, making impromptu 'tying down' of the valve by locomotive crews in search of more power impossible. The pivoting arm was commonly extended into a handle shape lead back into the locomotive cab, allowing crews to 'rock' both valves off their seats to confirm they were set and operating correctly.

Safety valves also evolved to protect equipment such as [[pressure vessel]]s (fired or not) and [[heat exchanger]]s. The term '''safety valve''' should be limited to compressible fluid applications (gas, vapor, or steam).

The two general types of protection encountered in industry are ''thermal protection'' and ''flow protection''.

For liquid-packed vessels, thermal relief valves are generally characterized by the relatively small size of the valve necessary to provide protection from excess pressure caused by thermal expansion. In this case a small valve is adequate because most liquids are nearly incompressible, and so a relatively small amount of fluid discharged through the relief valve will produce a substantial reduction in pressure.

Flow protection is characterized by safety valves that are considerably larger than those mounted for thermal protection. They are generally sized for use in situations where significant quantities of gas or high volumes of liquid must be quickly discharged in order to protect the integrity of the vessel or pipeline. This protection can alternatively be achieved by installing a [[high integrity pressure protection system]] (HIPPS).

==Technical terms==
In the [[oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[petrochemical]], [[chemical plant|chemical manufacturing]], [[natural gas processing]], [[power station|power generation]], food, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, the term '''safety valve''' is associated with the terms '''pressure relief valve''' (PRV), '''pressure safety valve''' (PSV) and '''relief valve'''.
The generic term is [[Pressure relief valve]] (PRV) or '''pressure safety valve''' (PSV) It should be noted that PRVs and PSVs are not the same thing, despite what many people think; the difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to open the valve in case of emergency.
* [[Relief valve]] (RV): an automatic system that is actuated by the static pressure in a liquid-filled vessel. It specifically opens proportionally with increasing pressure{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.
* Safety valve (SV): an automatic system that relieves the static pressure on a gas. It usually opens completely, accompanied by a popping sound{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.
* '''Safety relief valve''' (SRV): an automatic system that relieves by static pressure on both gas and liquid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RhgYLnyTnOwC&amp;pg=6 The Safety Relief Valve Handbook], Hellemans, M. (2009), Elsevier Science, {{ISBN|9780080961187}}, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pilot-operated safety relief valve''' (POSRV): an automatic system that relieves on remote command from a pilot, to which the static pressure (from equipment to protect) is connected{{Clarify|date=October 2011|reason=pilot monitors?}}.
* '''Low pressure safety valve''' (LPSV): an automatic system that relieves static pressure on a gas. Used when the difference between the vessel pressure and the ambient [[atmospheric pressure]] is small.
* '''Vacuum pressure safety valve''' (VPSV): an automatic system that relieves static pressure on a gas. Used when the pressure difference between the vessel pressure and the ambient pressure is small, negative and near to atmospheric pressure.
* '''Low and vacuum pressure safety valve''' (LVPSV): an automatic system that relieves static pressure on a gas. Used when the pressure difference is small, negative or positive and near to atmospheric pressure.

RV, SV and SRV are spring-operated (even spring-loaded). LPSV and VPSV are spring-operated or weight-loaded.

==Legal and code requirements in industry==
In most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also, in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]], [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] and other organizations like ISO (ISO 4126) must be complied with. These codes include design standards for relief valves and schedules for periodic inspection and testing after valves have been removed by the company engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onetb.com/asme_code_countries.htm List of countries accepting the ASME Boiler &amp; Pressure Vessel Code]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/detail?product_id=235758 API 520-1, Sizing and Selection of Pressure-Relieving Devices]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the food, drinks, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals industries call for hygienic safety valves, fully drainable and Cleanable-In-Place. Most are made of stainless steel; the hygienic norms are mainly 3A in the USA and EHEDG in Europe.

=== Deadweight lever valves ===
[[File:Lever safety valve (Heat Engines, 1913).jpg|thumb|right|[[#Deadweight lever valves|lever arm safety valve]]]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weight acting through a lever held down a circular plug valve in the steam vessel. By using a "[[Steelyard balance|steelyard]]" lever a smaller weight was required, also the pressure could easily be regulated by sliding the same weight back and forth along the lever arm. Papin retained the same design for his 1707 steam pump.&lt;ref name="Hewison, p12" &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early safety valves were regarded as one of the engineman's controls and required continuous attention, according to the load on the engine. In a famous early explosion at [[Greenwich]] in 1803, one of [[Richard Trevithick|Trevithick]]'s high-pressure [[stationary engine]]s exploded when the boy trained to operate the engine left it to catch [[eel]]s in the river, without first releasing the safety valve from its working load.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hills|Power from Steam|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1806, Trevithick was fitting pairs of safety valves, one external valve for the driver's adjustment and one sealed inside the boiler with a fixed weight. This was unadjustable and released at a higher pressure, intended as a guarantee of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When used on locomotives, these valves would rattle and leak, releasing near-continuous puffs of waste steam.

==== Direct-acting deadweight valves ====
[[File:Deadweight safety valve section (Heat Engines, 1913).jpg|thumb|left|[[#Direct-acting deadweight valves|Deadweight safety valve]] (1909).]]

Although the lever safety valve was convenient, it was too sensitive to the motion of a steam locomotive. Early steam locomotives therefore used a simpler arrangement of weights stacked directly upon the valve. This required a smaller valve area, so as to keep the weight manageable, which sometimes proved inadequate to vent the pressure of an unattended boiler, leading to [[boiler explosion|explosion]]s. An even greater hazard was the ease with which such a valve could be tied down, so as to increase the pressure and thus power of the engine, at further risk of explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hills|Power from Steam| pages= 144,146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although deadweight safety valves had a short lifetime on steam locomotives, they remained in use on stationary boilers for as long as steam power remained.&lt;ref name="Hills, Power from Steam" &gt;{{cite book

=== Direct spring valves  ===
[[File:Planet replica.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive ''Planet'' (1830), with a brass-cased [[#Direct spring valves|direct spring valve]]]]
Weighted valves were sensitive to bouncing from the rough riding of early locomotives. One solution was to use a lightweight spring rather than a weight. This was the invention of [[Timothy Hackworth]] on his ''[[Royal George (locomotive)|Royal George]]'' of 1828.&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" &gt;{{cite book

These direct-acting spring valves could be adjusted by tightening the nuts retaining the spring. To avoid tampering, they were often shrouded in tall brass casings which also vented the steam away from the locomotive crew.

=== Salter spring balance valves {{anchor|Spring balance}} ===
[[File:Spring balance (Steam and the Steam Engine, Evers).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|Salter spring balance]]
The [[Richard Salter (inventor)|Salter]] [[coil spring]] [[spring balance]] for weighing, was first made in Britain by around 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This used the newly developed [[Crucible steel#History of production in England|spring steel]]s to make a powerful but compact spring in one piece. Once again by using the lever mechanism, such a spring balance could be applied to the considerable force of a boiler safety valve.

The spring balance valve also acted as a pressure gauge. This was useful as previous pressure gauges were unwieldy mercury [[manometer]]s and the [[Bourdon gauge]] had yet to be invented.&lt;ref name="Salter, Rattler" &gt;{{cite web
  |title=Trial of HMS Rattler and Alecto

  |quote=The very lowest pressure exhibited "when the screw was out of the water" (as the opponents of the principle term it) was 34 lb, ranging up to 60 lb., on Salter's balance.

==== Lockable valves ====
[[File:Phoenix 1840 locomotive.jpg|thumb|right|''Phoenix'' (1840) with two sets of [[#Salter spring balance valves|Salter spring balance valves]]]]
The risk of firemen tying down the safety valve remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was encouraged by them being fitted with easily adjustable wing nuts, the practice of adjusting the boiler's working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later common with Salter valves for them to be fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside a locked cover to prevent tampering.

==== Paired spring balance valves ====

[[File:252008 ČSD 5.jpg|thumb|left|Paired spring-balance safety valves of a ČSD Class 252.0, with hand adjustment wheels]]
Paired valves were often adjusted to slightly different pressures too, a small valve as a control measure and the lockable valve made larger and permanenently set to a higher pressure, as a safeguard.&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs, such as one by [[Robert Sinclair (locomotive engineer)|Sinclair]] for the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] in 1859, had the valve spring with pressure scale behind the dome, facing the cab, and the locked valve ahead of the dome, out of reach of interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahrons|British Steam Railway Locomotive|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ramsbottom safety valves ===
[[File:Burrell single crank compound, valvechest side, Abergavenny steam rally 2012.jpg|thumb|left| Ramsbottom valves on a model [[traction engine]]]]
[[File:Ramsbottom safety valve (side only) (Heat Engines, 1913).jpg|thumb|right|U-shaped Ramsbottom safety valve]]
In 1855, [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]], later locomotive superintendent of the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]], described a new form of safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat.&lt;ref name="Proc. IME, 1856" &gt;{{cite journal
  |title=An improved safety valve
  |journal=Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.
  |year=1856
  |issue=37
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hewison, p19" &gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of Ramsbottom valve were produced. Some were separate fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations.&lt;ref name="Hewison, p19" /&gt; Others were contained in a U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the boiler shell. As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the boiler shell, with the springs housed in a recess inside and only the valves and balance lever protruding outside.&lt;ref name="Hewison, p19" /&gt; These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.

: {{cite patent|GB|1299}} 1299: 7 June 1855: Safety valves, feeding apparatus for steam-boilers.

A drawback to the Ramsbottom type was its complexity. Poor maintenance or mis-assembly of the linkage between the spring and the valves could lead to a valve that no longer opened correctly under pressure. The valves could be held against their seats and fail to open or, even worse, to allow the valve to open but insufficiently to vent steam at an adequate rate and so not being an obvious and noticeable fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mis-assembly of just this nature led to a fatal boiler explosion in 1909 at Cardiff on the [[Rhymney Railway]], even though the boiler was almost new, at only eight months old.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=115–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{visible anchor|Naylor valve}}s were introduced around 1866. A [[bellcrank]] arrangement reduced the [[strain (mechanics)|strain]] (percentage extension) of the spring, thus maintaining a more constant force.&lt;ref group="note" &gt;See [[Young's modulus]]&lt;/ref&gt; They were used by the [[Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway|L&amp;Y]] &amp; [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|NER]].&lt;ref name="Ahrons, 176" &gt;{{cite book

=== "Pop" valves ===
[[File:Boiler safety valve of 60163 Tornado.jpg|thumb|left|Ross pop valve, from [[LNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado|''Tornado'']]]]
All of the preceding safety valve designs opened gradually and had a tendency to leak a "feather" of steam as they approached "blowing-off", even though this was below the pressure. When they opened they also did so partially at first and didn't vent steam quickly until the boiler was well over pressure.&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" /&gt;

[[File:FRB - The Pop Valve, item 1.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Pop Valve'', a self-published magazine by the American army [[Transportation Corps]] stationed in France in WWI]]
The quick-opening "pop" valve was a solution to this. Their construction was simple: the existing circular plug valve was changed to an inverted "top hat" shape, with an enlarged upper diameter. They fitted into a stepped seat of two matching diameters. When closed, the steam pressure acted only on the crown of the top hat, and was balanced by the spring force. Once the valve opened a little, steam could pass the lower seat and began to act on the larger brim.  This greater area overwhelmed the spring force and the valve flew completely open with a "pop". Escaping steam on this larger diameter also held the valve open until pressure had dropped ''below'' that at which it originally opened, providing [[hysteresis]].&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" /&gt;

These valves coincided with a change in firing behaviour. Rather than demonstrating their virility by always showing a feather at the valve, firemen now tried to ''avoid'' noisy blowing off, especially around stations or under the large roof of a major station. This was mostly at the behest of stationmasters, but firemen also realised that any blowing off through a pop valve wasted several pounds of boiler pressure; estimated at 20&amp;nbsp;psi lost and 16&amp;nbsp;lbs or more of shovelled coal.{{#tag:ref|These figures are based on two measurements, a drop from 225&amp;nbsp;psi to 205&amp;nbsp;psi for an [[LNER Class V2]] in 1952 and a smaller drop of 10&amp;nbsp;psi estimated in 1953 as 16&amp;nbsp;lbs of coal&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" /&gt;|group = note}}&lt;ref name="Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves" /&gt;

Pop valves derived from Adams's patent design of 1873, with an extended lip. R L Ross's valves were patented in 1902 &amp; 1904. They were more popular in America at first, but widespread from 1920s.&lt;ref name="Ahrons, p364" &gt;{{harvnb|Ahrons|British Steam Railway Locomotive|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GWR safety valve from Earl Bathurst.jpg|thumb|right|GWR safety valve cover]]
Although showy polished brass covers over safety valves had been a feature of steam locomotives since Stephenson's day, the only railway to maintain this tradition into the era of pop valves was the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]], with their distinctive tapered brass safety valve bonnets and copper-capped chimneys.

=== Marine and Cockburn high-lift safety valves ===
Developments in high-pressure [[water-tube boiler]]s for [[marine steam engine|marine use]] placed more demands on safety valves. Valves of greater capacity were required, to vent safely the high steam-generating capacity of these large boilers.&lt;ref name="Marine steam boilers, high-capacity" &gt;{{harvnb|Marine Steam Boilers|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the force on their valves increased, the issue of the spring's increasing stiffness as its load increased (like the [[#Naylor valve|Naylor valve]]) became more critical.&lt;ref name="Marine steam boilers" /&gt; The need to reduced valve feathering became even more important with high-pressure boilers, as this represented both a loss of [[evaporator (marine)|distilled feedwater]] and also a scouring of the valve seats, leading to wear.&lt;ref name="Marine steam boilers, high-capacity" /&gt;

High-lift safety valves are direct-loaded spring types, although the spring does not bear directly on the valve, but on a guide-rod valve stem. The valve is beneath the base of the stem, the spring rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat. This gives a steam flow through the valve equivalent to a valve one and a half or twice as large (depending on detail design).&lt;ref name="Marine steam boilers" &gt;{{cite book
  |title=Marine Steam Boilers
  |last=Milton  |first=J.H.
  |year=1953
  |publisher=Newnes
  |ref={{harvid|Marine Steam Boilers}}
  |pages=216–219
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cockburn Improved High Lift design has similar features to the Ross pop type. The exhaust steam is partially trapped on its way out and acts on the base of the spring seat, increasing the lift force on the valve and holding the valve further open.&lt;ref name="Marine steam boilers" /&gt;

To optimise the flow through a given diameter of valve, the full-bore design is used. This has a [[Servomechanism|servo]] action, where steam through a narrow control passage is allowed though if it passes a small control valve. This steam is then not exhausted, but is passed to a piston that is used to open the main valve.&lt;ref name="Marine steam boilers, high-capacity" /&gt;

There are safety valves known as PSV's and can be connected to pressure gauges (usually with a 1/2" BSP fitting). These allow a resistance of pressure to be applied to limit the pressure forced on the gauge tube, resulting in prevention of over pressurisation. the matter that has been injected into the gauge, if over pressurised, will be diverted through a pipe in the safety valve, and shall be driven away from the gauge.

There is a wide range of safety valves having many different applications and performance criteria in different areas. In addition, national standards are set for many kinds of safety valves.

==Water heaters==
[[File:WH safety valve.JPG|thumb|right|Temperature and Pressure safety valve on a water heater.]]
Safety valves are required on [[water heater]]s, where they prevent disaster in certain configurations in the event that a [[thermostat]] should fail. There are still occasional, spectacular failures of older water heaters that lack this equipment. Houses can be leveled by the force of the blast.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Porterfield, Paul Shukovsky, and Lewis Kamb (Saturday, July 28, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pressure cookers==
{{main|Pressure cooking}}
Pressure cookers are cooking pots with a pressure-proof lid. Cooking at pressure allows the temperature to rise above the normal boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius at [[sea level]]), which speeds up the cooking and makes it more thorough.

Pressure cookers usually have two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, one is a nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed rubber [[grommet]] which is ejected in a controlled explosion if the first valve gets blocked.  On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan.  Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]] which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which would happen if the lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).

The term ''safety valve'' is also used [[metaphor]]ically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10762">{{For|other simplified forms of English|Simple English (disambiguation){{!}}Simple English}}
'''ASD-STE100''' '''Simplified Technical English''', or '''Simplified English''', is the original name of a [[Controlled natural language|controlled language]] specification originally developed for [[aerospace]] industry maintenance manuals. It is a carefully limited and standardized subset of English. It is now officially known under its trademarked name as ''Simplified Technical English'' (STE). STE is regulated for use in the aerospace and defense industries, but other industries have used it as a basis for their own controlled English standards.

==History==
First attempts towards an STE specification were made as early as the 1930s and 1970s with Basic English and Caterpillar Fundamental English&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kaiser |first1=Herbert |title=A Close Look at STE |url=http://www.tcworld.info/e-magazine/technical-communication/article/a-close-look-at-simplified-technical-english/ |website=TC World |accessdate=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1979 aerospace documentation was written in American English ([[Boeing]], Douglas, Lockheed, etc.), in British English ([[Hawker Siddeley]], [[British Aircraft Corporation]], etc.) and by companies whose native language was not English ([[Fokker]], [[Aeritalia]], [[Aerospatiale]], and some of the companies that formed [[Airbus]] at the time). There were also European airlines that had to translate parts of their maintenance documentation into other languages for their local mechanics.

This led the European Airline industry to approach AECMA (European Association of Aerospace Industries) to ask manufacturers to investigate the possibility of using a controlled form of English.  In 1983, after an investigation into the different types of controlled languages that existed in other industries, the AECMA decided to produce its own controlled English.  The AIA (Aerospace Industries Association of America) was also invited to participate in this development.

The result of this collaborative work was a guide, known as the AECMA Simplified English Guide. After a merger of AECMA with two other associations to form ASD in 2004, the specification changed its name to become ASD Simplified Technical English, Specification [[ASD-STE100]].

==Benefits==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Simplified Technical English is claimed{{According to whom|date=January 2014}} to:
* Reduce [[ambiguity]]
* Improve the clarity of technical writing, especially procedural writing
* Improve comprehension for people whose first language is not English
* Make human translation easier, faster and more cost effective
* Facilitate [[computer-assisted translation]] and [[machine translation]]
* Improve [[Reliability engineering|Reliability concerns]] of maintenance and assembly by reducing their probability to introduce defects
However, these claims come mostly from those who have invested in developing it, implementing it or supporting it. In the absence of third-party endorsement or published scientific studies, such claims should be considered unconfirmed.
 
==Specification structure==
The Simplified Technical English specification consists of two parts:
# Writing Rules
# Dictionary

=== Writing Rules ===
The Writing Rules differentiate between two types of topics: procedure and description. The Writing Rules also specify restrictions on grammar and style usage.
For example, they require writers to:

* Restrict the length of noun clusters to no more than 3 words
* Restrict sentence length to no more than 20 words (procedural sentences) or 25 words (descriptive sentences)
* Restrict paragraphs to no more than 6 sentences (in descriptive text)
* Avoid slang and jargon while allowing for specific terminology
* Make instructions as specific as possible
* Use articles such as "a/an" and "the" wherever possible
* Use simple verb tenses (past, present, and future)
* Use active voice
* Not use present participles or gerunds (unless part of a Technical Name)
* Write sequential steps as separate sentences
* Put commands first in warnings and cautions, with the exception of conditions.

===Dictionary===
The dictionary includes entries of both approved and unapproved words.  The approved words can only be used according to their specified meaning. For example, the word "close" can only be used in one of two meanings:

# To move together, or to move to a position that stops or prevents materials from going in or out
# To operate a circuit breaker to make an electrical circuit

The verb can express ''close a door'' or ''close a circuit'', but cannot be used in other senses (for example ''to close the meeting'' or ''to close a business'').  The adjective "close" appears in the Dictionary as an unapproved word with the suggested approved alternative "near". So STE does not allow ''do not go close to the landing gear'', but it does allow ''do not go near the landing gear''. In addition to basic STE vocabulary listed in the Dictionary, Section 1, ''Words'', gives explicit guidelines for adding technical names and technical verbs that writers need to describe technical information.  For example, words or phrases such as ''overhead panel'', ''grease'', ''propeller'', ''to ream'', and ''to drill'' are not listed in the Dictionary, but qualify as approved terms under the guidelines in Part 1, Section 1 (specifically, Writing Rules 1.5 and 1.10).

==Aerospace and defense standard==
''Simplified English'' is sometimes used as a generic term for a [[controlled language]].  The aerospace and defense standard started as an industry-regulated writing standard for aerospace maintenance documentation, but has become mandatory for an increasing number of military land vehicle, sea vehicle and weapons programs as well.  Although it was not intended for use as a general writing standard, it has been successfully adopted by other industries and for a wide range of document types. The US government’s [[Plain English#United States|Plain English]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plainlanguage.gov Plain Language: Improving Communications from the Federal Government to the Public&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; lacks the strict vocabulary restrictions of the aerospace standard, but represents an attempt at a more general writing standard.

The regulated aerospace standard was formerly called ''AECMA Simplified English'', because AECMA originally created the standard in the 1980s. In 2005, AECMA was subsumed by the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD), which renamed its standard to ''ASD Simplified Technical English'' or ''STE''. STE is defined by the specification ''ASD-STE100'', which is maintained by the Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asd-ste100.org/ Simplified Technical English Maintenance Group (STEMG)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The specification contains a set of restrictions on the grammar and style of procedural and descriptive text.  It also contains a dictionary of approx. 875 approved general words.  Writers are given guidelines for adding technical names and technical verbs to their documentation.

STE is mandated by several commercial and military specifications that control the style and content of maintenance documentation, most notably [[S1000D|ASD S1000D]].

==Tools==
Boeing has developed a Simplified English Checker to assist during development. The linguistic-based checker uses a sophisticated 350-rule English grammar and parser, which is augmented with special functions that check for violations of the Simplified English standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoard |first1=James E. |title=An Automated Grammar and Style Checker for Writers of Simplified English.  Computers and Writing |date=1992 |pages=278-296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

HyperSTE is a plugin tool offered by Etteplan to check content for adherence to the rules and grammar of the specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Tom |title=Simplified Technical English and HyperSTE |url=https://idratherbewriting.com/2017/01/25/hyperste-simplified-technical-english-asd-ste100/#origin-of-simplified-technical-english |website=I'd Rather be Writing |accessdate=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A free copy of the official ASD-STE100 Specification can be downloaded through the [http://asd-ste100.org/request.html ASD-STE100 website]. Over 3,600 copies of Issue 6 of the specification were distributed.  Issue 7 of the ASD-STE100 specification was released in January 2017.  This standard is released every 3 years. The following is an extract from a page of the ASD-STE100 Dictionary:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Keyword (Part of speech) !! Approved meaning/ALTERNATIVES !! APPROVED EXAMPLE !! Not approved
|-
| Acceptance (n) || ACCEPT (v) || BEFORE YOU ACCEPT THE UNIT, YOU MUST DO THE SPECIFIED TEST PROCEDURE. || Before acceptance of unit, carry out the specified test procedure.
|-
| ACCESS (n) || The ability to go into or near. || GET ACCESS TO THE ACCUMULATOR FOR THE NO. 1 HYDRAULIC SYSTEM. || 
|-
| Accessible (adj) || ACCESS (n) || TURN THE COVER UNTIL YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE JACK THAT HAVE “+” AND “-“ MARKS. || Rotate the cover until the jack marked by + and - are accessible. 
|-
| ACCIDENT (n) || An occurrence that causes injury or damage. || MAKE SURE THAT THE PINS ARE INSTALLED TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS. || 
|}
An explanation of the four columns:
* Keyword (part of speech): This keyword has information on the type of word. Every permitted word in STE is only permitted as a specific word type. For example, “test” is only permitted as a noun (the test) but not as a verb (to test).
* Approved meaning/ALTERNATIVES: This contains the definition of the permitted word. In the example table, ACCESS and ACCIDENT are allowed. Rephrasing or alternatives that are not permitted are listed in small letters (acceptance and accessible).
* APPROVED EXAMPLE: When the text is written in capital letters, then it means that the entire text conforms to STE. If the keyword shown in column 1 is not permitted, then sample sentences in column 3 are provided with the alternatives listed in column 2. 
* Not approved: Small letters in this column indicate sentences that do not conform to STE. Column 4 will remain empty in the case of words that do conform to STE.

A '''solar-powered waste compactor''' is a [[smart device]] that reads a [[Waste container|waste bin]]'s fill-level in real-time and triggers an automatic [[Waste compaction|compaction]] of the [[waste]], effectively increasing the bin's capacity by up to 5-8 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/bigbelly-wi-fi-hotspot-solar-powered-recycling-garbage-bins/38561/|title=Bigbelly's Wi-Fi-enabled, solar-powered bins could lead to smarter cities|website=newatlas.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jun/14/internet-of-bins-smart-solar-powered-trashcans-in-colombian-cities|title=Internet of bins: smart, solar powered trashcans in Colombian cities|last=Ramirez|first=Elaine|date=2016-06-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compaction mechanism runs on a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], which is charged by the [[solar panel]]. Fully charged, the battery reserve lasts for approximately 3-4 weeks depending on the compaction frequency and usage patterns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecubelabs.com/support/|title=Ecube Labs - FAQ|last=Labs|first=Ecube|website=ecubelabs.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar-powered waste compactors are typically connected to a remote software platform through [[Wireless network|wireless 2G/3G networks]]. The platform enables waste collection managers to access real-time data analytics and route optimization.

Solar-powered compactors are primarily used in high foot traffic areas such as town centers, shopping malls, amusement parks, beaches, transit stations and sports stadiums.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Advantages ==
Some of the benefits of using solar-powered waste compactors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bigbelly.com/benefits/|title=Bigbelly   –  Benefits|website=bigbelly.com|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dorsey was born in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec, Canada]] on July 10, 1937 and is a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]-trained engineer.

His son Dan Dorsey, as part of his preparation to film a video about his father, made a March 2017 visit to an exhibit at The [[Personal Computer Museum]] by curator Syd Bolton that focused on [[Micom|MICOM]].&lt;ref name=PC.Museum/&gt;

==Career==
In 1967, Dorsey founded AES Data Inc. in Montreal, developing industrial remote-control applications. In 1972, AES launched the AES 90 computer, years before Microsoft and Apple were companies. Marketed as a "word processing system," the AES 90 was really the world's first general-purpose personal computer. AES went on to grow to more than $200 million in annual sales. The [[Word Processor]] was the precursor to Microsoft Word, Apple and other software based business applications.  

Dorsey launched his next venture, [[Micom|Micom Co.]], after selling his stake in AES in 1975, again selling word processing and office automation systems, but adding telecommunications equipment. Having directed Micom to $200 million in revenue, Dorsey sold it to [[Philips|Philips NV]] in 1984 and founded Voice &amp; Data Systems in 1991. 

Voice &amp; Data Systems (VDS) found success in deploying cutting-edge [[VoIP]]&lt;ref name=CaStudy/&gt; and fax-over-data network technology to phone companies internationally and in providing unified messaging solutions to some of the world's largest financial firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hamilton|first1=Geoff|title=New Kid On Line|url=http://www.seaboardgroup.com/main/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=154&amp;Itemid=2|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=Canadian Business|date=November 22, 2004|ref=www.canadianbusiness.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micom concentrators==
Micom became known for its ads, often run on the back pages of popular-in-their-day computer industry publications, with the slogan "Concentrate. Because it's cheaper!" The initial ads showed oranges and what resembled a can of frozen orange juice, with a "brand name" of Micom.&lt;ref name=BaCover&gt;{{cite magazine   |magazine=Hardcopy  |date=July 1983  |title=HARDCOPY (ISSN 0279-8123)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After adding variations, they began advertising on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The New York Times  |date=April 2, 1980  |page=D13 (Business &amp; Finance) |title=Advertising- Micom Plans TV Campaign
|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F07E4D91238E732A25751C0A9629C94619FD6CF
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of the ads, within their telecommunications products, was their line of [[Concentrator]]s.

&lt;!--The Micom Advertising NYTimes article came up via a search for Stephen Dorsey --&gt;
Their print ads included the [[trademark]]ed phrase "MICOM: MicroComputers for DataCommunications(tm)"&lt;ref name=BaCover/&gt;

[[Image:Illust passive solar d2 319pxW.gif|thumb|200px|right|Passive solar design using an unvented Trombe wall and summer shading]]

A '''Trombe wall''' is a [[passive solar building design]] where a wall is built on the winter sun side of a building with a glass external layer and a high heat capacity internal layer separated by a layer of air. Light close to UV in the electromagnetic spectrum passes through the glass almost unhindered then is absorbed by the wall that then re-radiates in the far infrared spectrum which does not pass back through the glass easily, hence heating the inside of the building. Trombe walls are commonly used to absorb heat during sunlit hours of winter then slowly release the heat over night. The essential idea was first explored by [[Edward S. Morse]] and patented by him in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Old Solar: 1881 | date = | year = | url =http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/05/17/335503/-Old-Solar:1881 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was fully developed as an architectural element by French engineer [[Félix Trombe]] and architect Jacques Michel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mazria | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Mazria | title = The Passive Solar Energy Book | publisher = Rodale Press | year = 1979 | location = Emmaus, PA | isbn = 0-87857-237-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denzerbook"&gt;{{cite book| last =Denzer| first =Anthony| authorlink =| title =The Solar House: Pioneering Sustainable Design| publisher =Rizzoli| series =| volume =| edition =| date =2013| location =| pages =| language =| url =http://solarhousehistory.com/book/| doi =| id =| isbn =978-0847840052| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130726200811/http://solarhousehistory.com/book/| archivedate =2013-07-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trombe walls work on the basic greenhouse principle that heat from the sun in the form of near-visible shorter-wavelength higher-energy ultraviolet radiation passes through glass largely unimpeded.

When this radiation strikes objects the energy is absorbed and then re-emitted  in the form of longer-wavelength infra-red radiation that does not pass through glass as readily. Hence heat becomes trapped and builds up in an enclosed structure with high internal heat capacity and glass surfaces that face the sun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourhome.gov.au/technical/fs45.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820101700/http://www.yourhome.gov.au/technical/fs45.html |archivedate=2013-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How effectively objects absorb and shed radiant heat depends on a number of factors; how dark they are in colour, how directly the surface of the object is opposed to the angle of the radiation striking it, how matte or reflective its surface is, the heat capacity of the object, and the surface conductivity of the object.
For Trombe walls to work effectively they are made from high heat capacity materials such as concrete or water, whose surface is dark and matte in colour and placed in direct opposition to the sun striking them.

The clearer the glass in front of a Trombe wall appears in the UV spectrum the more short wave radiation will penetrate and the more reflective or non transparent the glass appears in the infra-red spectrum, the less re-emitted heat will escape.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Infrared#Different regions in the infrared]]- Near-infrared exhibits low losses in SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; glass&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic design==
[[Image:Trombe wall.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A Northern hemisphere Trombe wall]]
[[Image:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rammed earth]] Trombe wall built by the [[Design Build Bluff]] organization]]
[[Image:Trombe Wall flow.png|thumb|300px|right|Air flow in a vented Trombe wall (Model by D. Bodine)]]

Trombe walls may be constructed with or without internal vents. Non-vented walls rely on conduction through the wall to heat the space behind the wall, while vented walls allow the user to actively or passively circulate room air past the heated side of the wall for more immediate heating. Vented Trombe walls may use passively or actively controllable flaps to prevent convection in the undesired direction, as when the wall cools at night in winter or heats during the day in summer. In climates that have higher summer temperatures Trombe walls may also be designed with external vents to improve the shedding of heat at night.
&lt;ref&gt;http://nmsea.org/lib/ThermalStorageWallDesignManual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Vented walls offer the advantage of being able to shed more heat earlier in the evening when it is more commonly required while higher heat capacity non-vented walls offer the advantage of improved overall diurnal stability. Views differ among the passive solar community as to which is more advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Passive Solar Design Guidelines for Northern New Mexico [http://www.nmsea.org/Curriculum/Courses/Passive_Solar_Design/Guidelines/Guidelines.htm#Indirect Gain (Trombe Wall) Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplistic rule of thumb that is often used when designing dense masonry walls is that heat will be absorbed and lost at around two hours per inch.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Common variations===
Common modifications to the Trombe wall include:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
* Exhaust vent near the top that is opened to vent to the outside during the summer. Such venting makes the Trombe wall act as a [[solar chimney]] pumping fresh air through the house during the day, even if there is no breeze.
* Windows in the Trombe wall. This lowers the efficiency but may be done for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons. If the outer glazing has high ultraviolet [[transmittance]], and the window in the Trombe wall is normal glass, this allows efficient use of the [[ultraviolet light]] for heating. At the same time, it protects people and furnishings from ultraviolet radiation more than do windows with high ultraviolet transmittance.
* Electric blowers controlled by thermostats, to improve air and heat flow.
* Fixed or movable shades, which can reduce night-time heat losses.
* [[Trellis (architecture)|Trellis]] to shade the solar collector during summer months.
* Insulating covering used at night on the glazing surface.
* Tubes or water tanks as part of a solar hot water system.
* Fish tanks as added heat capacity.
* Using a [[selective surface]] to increase the absorption of solar radiation by the wall.

===Half-height Trombe walls===
There is a misconception{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} that Trombe walls must be full height, completely blocking light and direct solar gain into the adjacent living space rather converting it into absorbed radiant heat that is then re-emitted as the room cools. In reality Trombe walls can be built to whatever height suits the needs of the home owner, their reduced height simply reducing the solar absorption area and increasing direct light and heat gain area. Half-height Trombe walls are a relatively simple solution that can greatly enhance the solar storage capacity of a passive solar home, whilst still allowing for views to the sun's winter direction.

Half-height Trombe walls function in the same way as a full height wall. They are commonly constructed around 4-6 inches (100-150&amp;nbsp;mm) from the inner window surface, allowing a gap large enough for curtains or blinds to reduce heat loss on winter nights and heat gain on summer days.

==Application in developing regions==
In [[Ladakh]], [[India]], the Ladakh Project is designing Trombe walls that complement [[Ladakh#Architecture|Ladakh's traditional architecture]] and has promoted building them in Ladakhi homes. This has shown Ladhakis a clean, reliable alternative to fire as a source of heat. The traditional fuel, [[feces|dung]], burns poorly and offers poor relief from the bitter winter temperatures. The smoldering dung produces significant amounts of smoke that fouls the air and causes many health problems. Trombe walls offer relief from both the cold and the smoke. Ladakh receives about 320 days of sun annually, and the traditional building materials&amp;nbsp;— stone and mud brick&amp;nbsp;— provide the heat capacity needed for heat storage in a Trombe wall.&lt;ref name="ladakhproject"&gt;Hales, Carolyn (1986).

A '''trompe''' is a water-powered [[air compressor]], commonly used before the advent of the electric-powered compressor.  A trompe is somewhat like an [[airlift pump]] working in reverse.

Trompes were used to provide compressed air for [[bloomery]] furnaces in [[Catalonia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicacions.iec.cat/repository/pdf/00000022/00000029.pdf The Catalan process for the direct production of malleable iron and its spread to Europe and the Americas PDF] by Estanislau Tomàs (retrieved March 23, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States of America|USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Trompes can be enormous.  At [[Canadian Hydro Developers]]' Ragged Chute facility in [[Temiskaming Shores|New Liskeard]], [[Ontario]], water falls down a shaft {{convert|351|ft}} deep and {{convert|9|ft|abbr=on}} across to generate compressed air for mining equipment and ventilation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cobalt.ca/index.php/ragged-chutes Ragged Chutes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324154749/http://www.cobalt.ca/index.php/ragged-chutes |date=2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
Trompes are very simple devices. They consist of four main parts: ''water-supply pipe'' or ''shaft'' with an ''air-inlet'' inside it, ''water outflow pipe'', ''separation chamber'' and ''takeoff'' ''air-pipe''. The vertical pipe or shaft goes down from higher point to a separation chamber, a pipe, that is typically narrower than previous one is coming away from that chamber allows the water to exit at a lower level, and another pipe (air-pipe) coming from the chamber allows the [[compressed air]] to exit as needed.

[[file:Hydraulic trompe sketch.svg|thumb|upright=1|lang=en|Sketch of a hydraulic trompe with the name of its different constituent elements.]]

Water rushing down the vertical pipe falls through a constriction.
The constriction produces a lower pressure because of the [[venturi effect]], and an external port allows air to be sucked in thus creating a constant air supply.  
The air forms bubbles in the pipe.
As the bubbles go down the pipe they are pressurized proportionally to the [[hydraulic head]], which is the height of the column of water in the pipe. 
The compressed air rises to the top of the separation chamber.
The separation chamber has a compressed-air takeoff pipe, and the compressed air can be used as a power source.

The energy of the falling water creates negative pressure inside the pipe that is compensated by the air from the outside atmosphere provided through inlet. The air is compressed by surrounding water pressure (which increases under a column due to the discharge to atmospheric pressure). The pressure of the air delivered cannot exceed the hydraulic head of the discharge pipe of the separation chamber. &lt;ref&gt;IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers),''Hydropower Developments: New Projects, Rehabilitation, and Power Recovery'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005 {{ISBN|1860584799}}, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Large trompes were often situated at high [[waterfall]]s so that ample head was available.
(However, trompes can raise the water, via siphon-effect, nearly to 70% of its initial elevation.) The Ragged Chute plant on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] near the town of [[Cobalt, Ontario]], is a trompe and tourist attraction. It is now owned by [[Canadian Hydro Developers|Canadian Hydro]] and exists beside a modern [[hydroelectric]] plant.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Compressed air from a trompe is at the temperature of the water, and its [[partial pressure]] of water vapor is that of the [[dewpoint]] of the water's temperature. If the water is cool, the compressed air can be made very dry by passing it through pipes that are warmer than the water. Often, ordinary outside air can warm the pipes enough to produce dry, cool compressed air.

Today, trompes constructed of plastic pipe are being used to provide aeration for mine drainage treatment. In this application, mine water is used to drive the trompe and the compressed air that is generated is used to oxygenate the mine water and to drive off excess dissolved carbon dioxide that may be present thus raising the pH of the water being treated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wvmdtaskforce.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/11-leavitt.doc Leavitt, Bruce R. (2011); Aeration of Mine Water Using a TROMPE; 2011 West Virginia Surface Mine Drainage Task Force Symposium (past symposium papers/2011 symposium papers/ at wvmdtaskforce.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ultra-large-scale system''' ('''ULSS''') is a term used in fields including [[Computer Science]], [[Software Engineering]] and [[Systems Engineering]] to refer to software intensive systems with unprecedented amounts of hardware, lines of source code, numbers of users, and volumes of data.  The scale of these systems gives rise to many problems: they will be developed and used by many stakeholders across multiple organizations, often with conflicting purposes and needs; they will be constructed from heterogeneous parts with complex dependencies and emergent properties; they will be continuously evolving; and software, hardware and human failures will be the norm, not the exception.  The term 'ultra-large-scale system' was introduced by Northrop and others&lt;ref name="ULSSreport"&gt;Northrop, L., et al. [http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/ULS_Book20062.pdf "Ultra-Large-Scale Systems: The Software Challenge of the Future"], Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, Ultra-Large-Scale Systems Study Report (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe challenges facing the [[United States Department of Defense]]. The term has subsequently been used to discuss challenges in many areas, including the computerization of financial markets.&lt;ref name="globalFinancialMarkets"&gt;Cliff, D., and Northrop, L. [http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/foresight/docs/computer-trading/11-1223-dr4-global-financial-markets-systems-perspective.pdf "The Global Financial Markets: An Ultra-Large Scale Systems Perspective"], Briefing paper for UK Government Office for Science Foresight project on The Future of Computer Trading in the Financial Markets (September 2011) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226070651/http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/bispartners/foresight/docs/computer-trading/11-1223-dr4-global-financial-markets-systems-perspective.pdf |date=26 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'ultra-large-scale system' (ULSS) is sometimes used interchangeably with the term 'large-scale complex IT system' (LSCITS).  These two terms were introduced at similar times to describe similar problems, the former being coined in the USA and the latter in the UK.

==Background==
The term ultra-large-scale system was introduced in a 2006 report from the [[Software Engineering Institute]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] authored by Linda Northrop and colleagues.&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/ Ultra Large Scale Systems Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The report explained that software intensive systems are reaching unprecedented scales (by measures including lines of code; numbers of users and stakeholders; purposes the system is put to; amounts of data stored, accessed, manipulated, and refined; numbers of connections and interdependencies among components; and numbers of hardware elements).  When systems become ultra-large-scale, traditional approaches to engineering and management will no longer be adequate.  The report argues that the problem is no longer of engineering [[systems engineering|systems]] or [[system of systems]], but of engineering "socio-technical ecosystems".

In 2013, Linda Northrop and her team conducted a talk to review outcome of the 2006 study and the reality of 2013. In summary, the talk concluded that (a) ULS systems are in the midst of society and the changes to current social fabric and institutions are significant; (b) The 2006 original research team was probably too conservative in their report; (c) Recent technologies have exacerbated the pace of scale growth; and (d) There are great opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Northrop|first=Linda|title=Does Scale Really Matter? Ultra-Large-Scale Systems Seven Years After the Study|url=http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2013_017_101_68602.pdf|work=Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a similar time to the publication of the report by Northrop and others, a research and training initiative was being initiated in the UK on [[Large-scale Complex IT Systems]].  Many of the challenges recognized in this initiative were the same as, or were similar to those recognized as the challenges of ultra-large-scale systems.&lt;ref name="sommerville"&gt;Sommerville I [http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ifs/Teaching/Sys%20Eng%20for%20LSCITS/L8-ULSS.pdf Ultra Large Scale Systems] Lecture Slides on Systems Engineering for LSCITS&lt;/ref&gt;  Greg Goth&lt;ref name="goth"&gt;Goth, G. "Ultralarge Systems: Refining Software Engineering?" IEEE Software, March/April 2008 {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; quotes [[Dave Cliff (professor)|Dave Cliff]], director of the UK initiative as saying "The ULSS proposal and the LSCITS proposal were written entirely independently, yet we came to very similar conclusions about what needs to be done and about how to do it".  A difference pointed out by [[Ian Sommerville (academic)|Ian Sommerville]]&lt;ref name="sommerville" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}} is that the UK initiative began with a 5 to 10 year vision, while that of Northrop and her co-authors was much longer term.  This seems to have led to there being two slightly different perspectives on ultra-large-scale systems.  For example, Richard Gabriel's perspective is that ultra-large-scale systems are desirable but currently impossible to build due to limitations in the fields of software design and systems engineering.&lt;ref name="gabriel"&gt;Gabriel, R.P., [http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignBeyondHumanAbilitiesSimp.pdf Design Beyond Human Abilities], Transcript of Wei Lun Public Lecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, 16 November 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423222544/http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignBeyondHumanAbilitiesSimp.pdf |date=23 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, [[Ian Sommerville (academic)|Ian Sommerville]]'s perspective is that ultra-large-scale systems are already emerging (for example in air traffic control), the key problem being not how to achieve them but how to ensure they are adequately engineered.&lt;ref name="sommerville" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}}

==Characteristics of an ultra-large-scale system==
Ultra-large-scale systems hold the characteristics of [[system of systems|systems of systems]] (systems that have: operationally independent sub-systems; managerially independent components and sub-systems; evolutionary development; emergent behavior; and geographic distribution).  But in addition to these, the Northrop report&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; argues that a ULSS will:
* Have decentralized data, development, evolution and operational control
* Address inherently conflicting, unknowable, and diverse requirements
* Evolve continuously while it is operating, with different capabilities being deployed and removed
* Contain heterogeneous, inconsistent and changing elements
* Erode the people system boundary. People will not just be users, but elements of the system and affecting its overall emergent behavior.
* Encounter failure as the norm, rather than the exception, with it being extremely unlikely that all components are functioning at any one time
* Require new paradigms for acquisition and policy, and new methods for control

The Northrop report&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; states that "the sheer scale of ULS systems will change everything. ULS systems will necessarily be decentralized in a variety of ways, developed and used by a wide variety of stakeholders with conflicting needs, evolving continuously, and constructed from heterogeneous parts. People will not just be users of a ULS system; they will be elements of the system. The realities of software and hardware failures will be fundamentally integrated into the design and operation of ULS systems. The acquisition of a ULS system will be simultaneous with its operation and will require new methods for control. In ULS systems, these characteristics will dominate. Consequently, ULS systems will place unprecedented demands on software acquisition, production, deployment, management, documentation, usage, and evolution practices."

==Domains in which ultra-large-scale systems are emerging==
The term ultra-large-scale system was introduced by Northrop and others&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; to discuss challenges faced by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in engineering software intensive systems.  In 2008 Greg Goth wrote that although Northrop’s report focused on the US military’s future requirements, "its description of how the fundamental principles of software design will change in a global economy … is finding wide appeal".&lt;ref name="goth" /&gt;  The term is now used to discuss problems in several domains.

===Defense===
The Northrop report argued that "the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has a goal of information dominance … this goal depends on increasingly complex systems characterized by thousands of platforms, sensors, decision nodes, weapons, and warfighters connected through heterogeneous wired and wireless networks.  … These systems will push far beyond the size of today's systems by every measure …  They will be ultra-large-scale systems."&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt;

===Financial trading===
Following the [[2010 Flash Crash|flash crash]], [[Dave Cliff (professor)|Cliff]] and Northrop&lt;ref name="globalFinancialMarkets" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}} have argued "The very high degree of interconnectedness in the global markets means that entire trading systems, implemented and managed separately by independent organizations, can rightfully be considered as significant constituent entities in the larger global super-system. … The sheer number of human agents and computer systems connected within the global financial-markets system-of-systems is so large that it is an instance of an ultra-large-scale system, and that largeness-of-scale has significant effects on the nature of the system".&lt;ref name="globalFinancialMarkets" /&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2015}}

===Healthcare===
Kevin Sullivan has stated that the US healthcare system is "clearly an ultra-large-scale system"&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;Sullivan, K. A Cyber-Social Systems Approach to the Engineering of Ultra-Large-Scale National Health Information Systems. National Institute of Medicine, 19 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and that building national scale cyber-infrastructure for healthcare "demands not just a rigorous, modern software and systems engineering effort, but an approach at the cutting edge of our understanding of information processing systems and their development and deployment in complex socio-technical environments".&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt;

===Others===
Other domains said to be seeing the rise of ultra-large-scale systems include government, transport systems (for example air traffic control systems), energy distribution systems (for example smart grids) and large enterprises.

==Research==
Fundamental gaps in our current understanding of software and software development at the scale of ULS systems present profound impediments to the technically and economically effective achievement of significant gains in core system functionality. These gaps are strategic, not tactical. They are unlikely to be addressed adequately by incremental research within established categories. Rather, we require a broad new conception of both the nature of such systems and new ideas for how to develop them. We will need to look at them differently, not just as systems or systems of systems, but as socio-technical ecosystems. We will face fundamental challenges in the design and evolution, orchestration and control, and monitoring and assessment of ULS systems. These challenges require breakthrough research.&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt;

===ULSS research in the United States===
The Northrop report&lt;ref name="ULSSreport" /&gt; proposed a ULS systems research agenda for an interdisciplinary portfolio of research in at least the following areas:

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/interaction/ Human interaction] – People are key participants in ULS systems. Many problems in complex systems today stem from failures at the individual and organizational level. Understanding ULS system behavior will depend on the view that humans are elements of a socially constituted computational process. This research involves anthropologists, sociologists, and social scientists conducting detailed socio-technical analyses of user interactions in the field, with the goal of understanding how to construct and evolve such socio-technical systems effectively.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/emergence/ Computational emergence] – ULS systems must satisfy the needs of participants at multiple levels of an organization. These participants will often behave opportunistically to meet their own objectives. Some aspects of ULS systems will be "programmed" by properly incentivizing and constraining behavior rather than by explicitly prescribing. This research area explores the use of methods and tools based on economics and game theory (e.g., mechanism design) to ensure globally optimal ULS system behavior by exploiting the strategic self-interests of the system’s constituencies. This research area also includes exploring metaheuristics and digital evolution to augment the cognitive limits of human designers, so they can manage ongoing ULS system adaptation more effectively.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/design/ Design] – Current design theory, methods, notations, tools, and practices and the acquisition methods that support them are inadequate to design ULS systems effectively. This research area broadens the traditional technology-centric definition of design to include people and organizations; social, cognitive, and economic considerations; and design structures such as design rules and government policies. It involves research in support of designing ULS systems from all of these points of view and at many levels of abstraction, from the hardware to the software to the people and organizations in which they work.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/engineering/ Computational engineering] – New approaches will be required to enable intellectual control at an entirely new level of scope and scale for system analysis, design, and operation.ULS systems will be defined in many languages, each with its own abstractions and semantic structures. This research area focuses on evolving the expressiveness of representations to accommodate this semantic diversity. Because the complexity of ULS systems will challenge human comprehension, this area also focuses on providing automated support for computing the behavior of components and their compositions in systems and for maintaining desired properties as ULS systems evolve.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/infrastructure/ Adaptive system infrastructure] – ULS systems require an infrastructure that permits organizations in distributed locations to work in parallel to develop, select, deploy, and evolve system components. This research area investigates integrated development environments and runtime platforms that support the decentralized nature of ULS systems. This research also focuses on technologies, methods, and theories that will enable ULS systems to be developed in their deployment environments.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/quality/ Adaptable and predictable system quality] – ULS systems will be long-running and must operate robustly in environments fraught with failures, overloads, and attacks. These systems must maintain robustness in the presence of adaptations that are not centrally controlled or authorized.

Managing traditional qualities such as security, performance, reliability, and usability is necessary but not sufficient to meet the challenges of ULS systems. This research area focuses on how to maintain quality in a ULS system in the face of continuous change, ongoing failures, and attacks. It also includes identifying, predicting, and controlling new indicators of system health (akin to the U. S. gross domestic product) that are needed because of the scale of ULS systems.

[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/research/policy/ Policy, acquisition, and management] – Policy and management frameworks for ULS systems must address organizational, technical, and operational policies at all levels. Rules and policies must be developed and automated to enable fast and effective local action while preserving global capabilities. This research area focuses on transforming acquisition policies and processes to accommodate the rapid and continuous evolution of ULS systems by treating suppliers and supply chains as intrinsic and essential components of a ULS system.

The proposed research does not supplant current, important software research but rather significantly expands its horizons. Moreover, because it is focused on systems of the future, the SEI team purposely avoided couching descriptions in terms of today’s technology. The envisioned outcome of the proposed research is a spectrum of technologies and methods for developing these systems of the future, with national-security, economic, and societal benefits that extend far beyond ULS systems themselves.

===ULSS research in the UK===
The UK’s research programme in [[Large-scale Complex IT Systems]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lscits.org]   {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103074220/http://www.lscits.org/ |date=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been concerned with issues around ULSS development and considers that an LSCITS (Large-scale complex IT system) shares many of the characteristics of a ULSS.
