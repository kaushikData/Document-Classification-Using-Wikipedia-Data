The '''American Security Council Foundation''' ('''ASCF''') is a non-profit organization founded by John M. Fisher that seeks to influence [[Foreign policy of the United States|United States foreign policy]] by "Promoting [[Peace Through Strength]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=american_security_council_1|title=Profile: American Security Council (ASC)|work=History Commons|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASCF's current president is Dr. Henry A. Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbb.org/south-east-florida/business-reviews/children-dentist/dr-henry-a-fischer-dds-in-sebastian-fl-23005375 | title=Dr. Henry A. Fischer, D.D.S. | date= | website=Council of Better Business Bureaus | accessdate=6 April 2018 | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASCF was formed in 1958, and was originally known as the Institute for American Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=American Security Council Foundation History Page |url=http://www.ascfusa.org/about/history |accessdate=June 15, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418193056/http://www.ascfusa.org/about/history |archivedate=April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For over 50 years the Foundation has been focused on a wide range of educational programs which address critical challenges to U.S. foreign policy, national security, economic security and moral leadership of the United States of America. The ASCF headquarters is at 1250 24th Street NW, Suite 300.

On June 4, 1997 the American Security Council, a separate organization initiated in September 1954 by [[Robert E. Wood]], retired chairman of [[Sears Roebuck and Company]], was merged into the American Security Council Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=John M.|title=HISTORY MILESTONES: AMERICAN SECURITY COUNCIL and AMERICAN SECURITY COUNCIL FOUNDATION|url=https://www.ascfusa.org/app/webroot/files/fckfiles/HISTORY%20MILESTONES.pdf|website=ascfusa.org|accessdate=24 March 2017|date=November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
The ASCF has received credit for developing programs and strategies that have been adopted as the foreign policy and national security strategy of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Context of 1978: Congress's Coalition of Peace Through Strength Opposes Arms Limitation Talks with Soviet Union|work=History Commons|url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a1978asccpts|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mission was mentioned in the ''Guidelines for Cold War Victory'', a 1963 publication of the ASCF, and was additionally praised by former President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] in his radio address to the nation that was recorded at the ASCF’s request.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 1978, the ASCF created the National Strategy for Peace Through Strength and the Peace Through Strength Coalition.

President [[Reagan|Ronald Reagan]] credited the ASCF numerous times for providing the overall theme for the administration of his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Reagan Speech|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VXXwyl5G0A|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President Reagan acknowledged the ASCF on multiple occasions and claimed America won the [[Cold War]] by adhering to this doctrine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} President Reagan remarked that, "One thing is certain. If we're to continue to advance world peace and human freedom, America must remain strong. If we have learned anything these last eight years, it's that peace through strength works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Reagan Speeches|work=University of Texas Archives|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1988/092488a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Laxalt, Chairman of the Reagan for President Campaign and Senate Co-Chairman of the CPTS, wrote to John Fisher that, "The Coalition's resolution calling for a national strategy for Peace through Strength became the defense strategy plank of the Republican Party Platform".{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} President Reagan said, "I am particularly pleased that you also plan to involve members of congress, key administration officials and a wide range of private institutions in the further development of a national strategy of Peace Through Strength. This will be essential as a guide on how to spread democracy throughout the world. My administration will cooperate fully with you in this project". While George H. W. Bush was vice president, President Reagan and John Fisher jointly presented Vice President Bush with the Gold Presidents Eagle Pin in recognition of strong support of the Peace Through Strength strategy. 

The ASCF worked to have the United States government publish an official [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This was first implemented by President Reagan in 1985. All of his successors are legally required to produce a similar document that analyzes the security priorities and concerns of the nation.

The '''Brianzola''' is a [[breed]] of [[sheep]] from [[Lombardy]] in northern Italy. It originates in the historical region of the [[Brianza]], from which it takes its name, and which coincides with the modern provinces of [[Province of Como|Como]], [[Province of Lecco|Lecco]] and [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]].&lt;ref name=dad/&gt;&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It is raised principally in the [[comuni]] of [[Brianza]], [[Civate]], [[Galbiate]], [[Proserpio]], [[Suello]] and [[Valmadrera]].&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; It is a heavy meat breed; the wool is not used.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; It is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt;

==History==

The origins of the breed are unknown, but are probably shared with those of other large lop-eared breeds of the Alps such as the [[Bergamasca (sheep)|Bergamasca]], the [[Biellese]] and the [[Lamon (sheep)|Lamon]].&lt;ref name=rare/&gt; The much-reported derivation of these breeds from Sudanese sheep is a hypothesis published in 1886 in the ''Traité de zootechnie'' of André Sanson, and is based on [[craniometry]]; it has no foundation in science. Breed numbers fell drastically in the period after the [[Second World War]], from about 4000 in the war years to 60–80 head in 1983; they have since recovered.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt; The conservation status of the breed was listed as "critical" by the [[FAO]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; A total population of 911 was reported in 2008,&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; and in 2013 the total number reported for the breed was 1464, of which all were in the province of Como.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

'''Center''' (or '''Tsentr''', Russian: '''Центр''') is a Russian-speaking band, which can be described as eclectic and experimental. The styles of their music are very different, starting with [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[Russian rock]] in the early years, crossing over to [[electronica]].

Center was founded by [[Vasily Shumov]] in [[Moscow]], Russia in the late 1970s. The first band name was "777". In the early 1980s Center became popular in the Soviet music underground. The band released over 25 albums, created music for films and TV, appeared on TV shows, and performed in Europe and America.&lt;ref name="official_en"&gt;[http://www.centromania.com/english/eng.html Official site - a brief story of Center in English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822181216/http://www.centromania.com/english/eng.html |date=2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Center is documented in numerous publications and books.

In the 1990s, the band leader [[Vasily Shumov|Shumov]] moved from [[Moscow]], Russia to [[Los Angeles]], United States where he continued his music and art work.

An album "Plastikozamenitel'" ("Plastic substitute") from 2000 is the first release of Center that features the new concept of so-called Centroborators. Centroborators are the artists from various locations, who contribute to the albums of Center, transferring their digital recordings to [[Vasily Shumov]]'s studio using internet. Several albums after "Plastikozamenitel" were created using the Centroborators concept.&lt;ref name="official_en" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centromania.com/cb.html Official site - a "Centroborators" page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927042925/http://www.centromania.com/cb.html |date=2007-09-27 }} (in russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous albums by Center and [[Vasily Shumov|Shumov]] are available on CDs and as MP3 files for free download from the band's [http://www.centromania.com official web site].

Since the mid-2000s, the band recommenced activities in Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1686">"'''Ceux de la Libération'''" ('''CDLL''') was a [[French resistance]] movement during the [[German occupation of France in World War II|German occupation of France]] in [[World War II]].

CDLL was one of the eight major resistance groups of the [[Conseil National de la Résistance]] (CNR).

==History==

Ceux de la Libération was formed in November 1940 by Maurice Ripoche, Henri Pascal and Jacques Ballet. The movement soon had several thousand members in the Northern occupation zone. 

In early 1942, Roger Coquoin, a demobilized Captain and the head of the Chemistry Laboratory at the [[Académie Nationale de Médecine]], met with the CDLL leader Maurice Ripoche. He became involved with the group and succeeded Ripoche as leader after the latter's arrest in March 1943. Under Coquoin's command, the CDLL expanded to [[Paris]] and the rest of France, gathering new volunteers in [[Normandy]], [[Champagne, France|Champagne]], [[Bourgogne]] and [[Vendée]]. Coquoin also made contact with other resistance movements in the occupied zone and even in the southern zone of Vichy. His capabilities in chemistry enabled him to develop [[detonators]] and abrasive pellets for destroying German trucks. After Coquoin was killed in an ambush in December 1943, Gilbert Védy, CDLL's delegate to the ''Assemblée consultative provisoire'' in Algiers, returned to Paris to head the movement. However, three days after his arrival, on 21 March 1944, Védy was arrested and poisoned himself during the interrogation rather than risk divulging any information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3076">'''Christian Aid Week''' is an annual door-to-door [[fundraising]] drive by the charity [[Christian Aid]]. The drive is held each year in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the second week of May, when thousands of volunteers post red collection envelopes to households around the country. Held each year since 1957 the event celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007, making it Britain’s longest running fundraising week.

Christian Aid works with 700 local organisations across 50 [[developing countries]]. Working with poor communities, it trains people to deal with the effects of [[climate change]] and prepares them for the threat of [[natural disasters]]. These local organisations – or ‘partners’ – also work on [[HIV]], training and education, health and sanitation and peace and reconciliation.

In 2007 the organisation encouraged people to plant trees in support of its overseas work on climate change projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gretta |last=Curtis |title=Christian Aid to Celebrate Golden Jubilee with Green Campaign |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/christian.aid.to.celebrate.golden.jubilee.with.green.campaign/10010.htm |publisher=Christian Today |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2007-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity aimed to raise £15.5 million from the annual fundraising week in 2007, and approximately 300,000 volunteers across the [[United Kingdom]] posted the well known red envelopes through millions of letterboxes.

In 2013, £12.6 million (or 13% percent of the total income) were raised during this week.&lt;ref name=annualreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianaid.org.uk/Images/2012-2013-christian-aid-annual-report.pdf|title=Annual Report 2012-2013|website=Christian Aid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1945 the British and Irish churches establish the Christian Reconstruction in Europe. Its purpose is to raise funds for the resettlement of some of the millions of people left homeless by the [[World War II|war]]. 

In 1948, it was renamed the Inter-Church Aid and Refugee Service, and became part of the [[British Council of Churches]]. During the next decade, the organisation began to move into worldwide development work. The overriding theme was the promotion of self-reliance.

In 1957, Janet Lacey, the organisation’s then director, decided to hold a “Christian Aid Week” to encourage public awareness. This first event mobilised residents in 200 towns and villages across Britain, collecting £26,000 for overseas development work.

In 1964 the agency changed its name to Christian Aid. During the 1960s, the threat of hunger, even famine, made agricultural development a priority in the poorest regions of the world, especially Africa and Asia. As well as overseas aid, Christian Aid began to tell Church supporters and schools about the causes of poverty and helped establish the [[World Development Movement]].

The [[film industry]] based in [[Switzerland]] dates to the 1930s. It is influenced by the neighboring countries of France, Germany and Italy, with which it shares languages. Before the mid-1960s Swiss films were often sentimental, but the [[French New Wave]] led to more experimental cinema.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2015/01/solothurn-festival&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Solothurn Film Festival]] was founded in 1966 with a declaration of showing the modern reality of Swiss Life. It is the most important festival for Swiss film productions.&lt;ref name=econ /&gt;

The [[Locarno Festival]] founded in 1946 is an annual film festival held every August in [[Locarno]], Switzerland. 

As of 2014, [[The Swissmakers]] (1978) (''Die Schweizermacher'') is the highest grossing Swiss movie of all time.&lt;ref name="Swiss government statistics"&gt;[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/16/02/01/dos/03/05.html Statistik Schweiz - Die erfolgreichsten Schweizer Filme]. Bfs.admin.ch (2014-04-30). Retrieved on 2014-05-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In German-speaking cantons, French-language films usually have German subtitles. Likewise, in French-speaking cantons, German-language films usually have French subtitles. Adult-oriented films in foreign languages are often screened with original audio and double subtitles in German and French. Children-oriented films in foreign languages are usually dubbed.

The '''Cotton Price Stabilization Board''' (French: ''Caisse de Stabilisation des Prix du Coton'', CSPC) was a [[Chad]]ian governative board created in 1968. Its task was to stabilize prices paid to peasant producers by funding operating losses incurred by [[Cotontchad]], the parastatal giant that bought, ginned and sold all the [[cotton]] produced in Chad. The CSPC also played an important role in the program to improve yields: it is estimated that between 1971 and 1983 57% of all payments by the CSPC were made in conjunction with the program to improve cotton production. As for the funding of the CSPC, between 1971 and 1983, virtually all income to the CSPC derived from rebates paid by Cotontchad into the system. After 1984 the sharply reduced income of Cotontchad made the system for paying the producers heavily dependent on external sources of funds (such as [[Stabex]]), while the government completely exempted Cotontchad from the rebates to the CSPC. The difficulties of the CSPC, whose staffs had already been considerably reduced in the late 1980s, came to a head with the great recession that hit the cotton market between 1991 and 1993, leading to the abolition of the board in 1993. It was decided to let the prices paid to the producers fluctuate freely, following the international price of cotton.

''The Global Cold War: Third World Interventions and the Making of Our Times'', 2005. Page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1966, Chipenda, then a member of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]), established the Eastern Front, significantly expanding the MPLA's reach in Angola. When the EF collapsed, Chipenda and MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] each blamed the other's factions. In 1972 the [[Soviet Union]] allied with Chipenda's faction, giving him aid. The Eastern Revolt also received aid from the governments of [[Zambia]]&lt;ref name="zambiaaid"/&gt; and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="split"&gt;Stewart Lloyd-Jones and António Costa Pinto. ''The Last Empire: Thirty Years of Portuguese Decolonisation'', 2003.

''The Cuban Intervention In Angola, 1965-1991: from Che Guevara to Cuito Cuanavale'', 2005. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed the MPLA's [[mestizo]]-leadership and was wary of the Soviet Union, despite its support.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;

In 1973, the Soviet Union invited Neto to [[Moscow]] and told him Chipenda planned to assassinate him.&lt;ref name="george"/&gt; Although Chipenda joined the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) in September 1974&lt;ref name="soviet"&gt;Bennett, Andrew.

'''Hellas Sat 2''' (previously called as '''Intelsat APR3''', '''Sinosat 1B''', '''NSS 6''', '''NSS K-TV''' and '''Intelsat K-TV''') is a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Hellas Sat]]. On 29 June 2017 the [[Hellas Sat 3]] satellite was launched to replace the Hellas Sat 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.protothema.gr/greece-cyprus-launch-hellas-sat-3-satellite/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launch ==
Hellas Sat 2 was launched by a [[Atlas V]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], at 22:10 UTC on May 13, 2003.&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2003-020A|title=Hellas Sat |work=NSSDC Master Catalog|accessdate=May 23, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capacity and coverage ==
The 3.45 tonne satellite carries 30 [[Ku band]] [[transponder]]s to provide direct-to-home voice and video transmissions to much of [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], after parking over 39 degrees east longitude. Also provided television broadcasting services for the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]], Greece.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6990">The '''Intermediate Region''' is an established [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] model set forth in the 1970s by the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], professor at the [[University of Ottawa]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Keyserlingk, Robert H., "Dimitri Kitsikis", pp. 125-130 in Royal Society of Canada, vol.52, Ottawa, 1999, 143 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, the [[Eurasia]]n continent is composed of three regions; in addition to [[Western Europe]] and the [[Far East]], a third region called the "Intermediate Region" found between the two constitutes a distinct civilization. It roughly covers [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Middle East and North Africa]].

== Description ==
[[Image:Intermediate Region FR.jpg|thumb|300px|The Intermediate Region]]
[[Image:Intermediate Region Western Boundary FR.JPG|thumb|200px|The western boundary of the Intermediate Region.]]
The lands between the [[Adriatic Sea]] and the [[Indus River]] form the Intermediate Region and are considered a bridge between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilisations]]. The vast area extends from the eastern half of [[Europe]] to the western half of [[Asia]]. Its significance is that there is neither a uniform Europe nor a uniform Asia. Europe and Asia denote geographical regions, not civilisations.

Demographically, the region's dominant religions are [[Orthodox Christianity]] and [[Sunni Islam]], and [[Shiite Islam]], with [[Alevism]] and [[Judaism]] to a lesser extent. In contrast, [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] dominate in the West, and [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] dominate in the East.

The Intermediate Region had, for 2500 years, been dominated by an ecumenical empire whose centre lay by the [[Turkish Straits]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. It was fundamentally the same empire throughout history, and its successive leaders sought to unify its respective peoples. From the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Darius the Great]], it fell into the hands of [[Alexander the Great]], then to the [[Hellenistic]] [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and finally the [[Sunni]] [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1923–1924, even though originally the Ottoman Dynasty was Alevo. That is why the [[Janissaries]] followed the [[Bektashism|Bektashi-Alevi]] religion. This Central Empire had been subject to attempts by other empires to seize succession, situated along its periphery, the [[Caliphate]], the [[Persian Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]] (until 1917).

The dynamic between the Central Empire and the Peripheral Empires constitutes an internal conflict in the Intermediate Region. Each of the main peoples in this area struggled to seize control of its centre of influence, that is, [[Byzantium]]-[[Constantinople]]-[[Istanbul]], which remained the undisputed focal point for nearly 2000 years. The [[Arab]]s, in the 8th century, and the [[Russia]]ns, in the 20th century, almost succeeded in doing so but were not able to take control of the ecumenical empire. Western intervention, since the 18th century, is considered to be an external conflict, which sought not succession but the destruction of the ecumenical empire and its dismemberment ([[Balkanization|Balkanisation]]) and its subjection to the stranglehold of [[Westernization|Westernisation]].

Kitsikis concludes that “due to historical events spanning thousands of years, the Eurasian continent, of which Europe is but one of its peninsulas, comprises three civilisational areas: a) the West, which today includes the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], as well as [[Western Europe]]; b) the East or “[[Far East]]”, which includes the peninsulas of [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]] (with [[Indonesia]]) and [[China]] (with [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]); c) the Intermediate Region, which is found both in the East and the West.”&lt;ref&gt;D. Kitsikis, ''L'Empire ottoman'', Paris, PUF, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jamaicans in Ethiopia''' comprise [[Jamaica]]n emigrants and expatriates residing in [[Ethiopia]] and their descendants born in Ethiopia.

==Migration history==
The settlement in Shashamane traces its roots to the 1948 Shashamane Land Grant by Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] to members of the [[Ethiopian World Federation]] in gratitude for their defence of Ethiopia during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Most of the initial settlers who took advantage of this offer were [[African American]], but Jamaicans began coming in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Giulia|last=Bonacci|title=An Interview in Zion: The Life-History of a Jamaican Rastafarian in Shashemene, Ethiopia|journal=Callaloo|volume=34|number=4|date=Summer 2011|doi=10.1353/cal.2011.0187}}&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly came to form a notable presence in the Shashamane settlement, earning it the nickname "Little Jamaica".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100618/news/news4.html|first=Patrina|last=Pink|title=Jamaican Rastas Bring Cultural Diversity To 'Promised Land'|work=Jamaica Gleaner|date=2010-06-18|accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, roughly 200 families of Rastafarians lived at Shashamane.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1639646.stm|first=Nita|last=Bhalla|title=The town that Rastafarians built|work=BBC News|date=2001-11-05|accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2011 fact-finding mission by Steven Golding of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]]'s [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] branch discovered that there has been ongoing confusion over land title among later migrants, particularly because Ethiopian policy no longer permits the [[alienation (property law)|alienation of land]] to foreign citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Ethiopia-land-dream-shattered_9779729|first=Basil|last=Walters|title=Ethiopia land dream shattered|work=Jamaica Observer|date=2011-10-02|accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as [[Ethiopian nationality law]] does not incorporate the concept of ''[[jus soli]]'', the children of Jamaicans living in Ethiopia are not citizens of the country and cannot access certain public services reserved for citizens. The Jamaican diaspora in Ethiopia have pressed the Jamaican government to establish an embassy in [[Addis Ababa]] in order to represent their concerns more effectively to the Ethiopian government; as of 2010, Jamaica was represented in Ethiopia solely by an honorary consul.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100312/news/news3.html|first=Edmond|last=Campbell|title=Rastafarians Want Embassy In Ethiopia|work=Jamaica Glenaer|date=2010-03-12|accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2416">The '''Kano Chronicle''' is a written account of the [[history]] of the [[Hausa people]] who inhabit northern [[Nigeria]]. Although it relates only to [[Kano]], it is typically drawn upon to explain the early history of the Hausa as a whole. This chronicle, a list of rulers of Kano stretching back to the tenth century AD, tells of eleven clans of animists (such as salt-extractors, brewers, or smiths) who were warned by their spiritual leader that a stranger would come and cut down their sacred tree and wrest their dominion from them: “If he comes not in your time, assuredly he will come in the time of your children, and will conquer all in this country” (Palmer 1928: III: 98). Indeed, a man named Bagauda allegedly arrived soon after, conquered, and became the first king of Kano (Palmer 1928: III: 97-100). The existing version was probably written in the 1890s but represents the amalgamation of earlier works. The original copy is still with the descendants of Malam Idris al-Khilawiy in Kano.

The '''Kompienga Dam''' is a large [[hydro-electric]] [[dam]] in [[Kompienga Province]] in southeastern [[Burkina Faso]]. Constructed between 1985 and 1988, it is the country's first hydro-electric dam and is responsible for much of [[Ouagadougou]]'s [[electricity]] supply. &lt;ref&gt; Manson, K., Knight, J. (2006), ''Burkina Faso'', p.194, Bradt Travel Guides, The Globe Pequot Press Inc., Retrieved on June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can obtain a permit to visit the control room of the dam from the state electricity parastatal.

In 1985, demographers predicted that the construction of the Kompienga dam would bring about 15% increase in immigration to area between 1985 and 1990, 15% between 1990 and 1995, and 8% between 1995 and 2000 for economic reasons. The entire Kompienga river basin did in fact experience a sudden, dramatic increase in agricultural immigration after 1985, particularly in the area immediately adjacent to the dam construction site, which became [[Kompienga]] town. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food2/uin08e/uin08e0g.htm Burkina Faso Case Study], UNU, Retrieved on June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1989, virtually the entire area within a ten kilometre radius of the town of Kompienga had been occupied. Despite the growth of Kompienga however, the dam had consequences on some villages along the basin which were either totally or partially flooded by the [[Lake Kompienga|dam-created lake]].

The '''March to Modernity''', coined by [[Kishore Mahbubani]] in his book, "The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East", refers to Asia's modernization using and adapting the seven pillars of Western ideology to cause Asia’s rise to become the new global power. Asia’s [[modernity]] was first achieved by Japan and India. Japan's success was emulated by the four economic tigers: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. China followed soon after by launching it’s "Four Modernizations" program. China's past three decades success in turn inspired the rise of India. Asians are marching to modernity.

== Overview ==
Kishore Mahbubani used the term in his book, ''The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East''. March to Modernity indicates the first and most likely of the three possible scenarios of Asia's modernization in the globalization era. Mahbubani discusses how the rise of Asia will alter the world between the East and the West in the next fifty years. He argues that the modernizing Asia will be good for the whole world in ethical as well as political terms. The West (primarily America), a pioneer of the [[globalization]] and [[Modernization theory|modernization]], has triggered Asian modernization.  The desire of Asian states are simply to follow, not to dominate West, which refers to rather the triumph of the West. However, many Western leaders made remarks defining the coming world of rising Asia as dangerous or challenging. (President Bush in 2006, French minister of foreign affairs Barnier in 2005 etc.) This conception is out-dated. The Asian March to Modernity represents a new opportunity both for the West and for the world.

== Scenario 1: March to Modernity ==
Kishore Mahububani’s main argument and first scenario is when the March to Modernity succeeds, the world would become more peaceful, stable and prosperous.

Mahbubani’s first argument is that the  March to Modernity will have a positive co-relational relationship in which modernization of material gains will cause Asia to experience a positive psychological boost. By gaining access to the modernization of these three basic human basic needs (shelter, water, electricity), the poor of the Asian hemisphere will experience a boost in hope for a better life. Mahbubani uses the example of India’s recent liberalization and shows that in the past decade poor, rural Indians feel more hopeful due to the increase in modernization. The satisfied people will also as stated by Mahbubani have a greater sense of self-dignity. Taking South Korea for example, people feel more liberated and full of hope for the future because they have numerous choices and several possibilities to choose from.

Second, entering the modern universe inevitably leads to a greater adherence to the rule of law will occur. Muhbani argues this point by explaining that through increase of material wealth a greater presence of law will occur, thus creating a sense of ownership and certainty. Through democratization, empowered humans will become responsible in setting world history in a positive direction due to the belief that they have the ability to control their destiny. Lastly Mahbubani explains that the March to Modernity will also lead to a more ethical universe. More population will be out of absolute poverty followed by social benefits such as improvements in health and education standards and decrease in crime rates. For instance, ideas of Western secular education that emphasizes economy and society are taught in China while the pages of socialism ideas are reduced. According to Mahbubani, the Chinese government spends more money and effort on child education with a heavy bias towards science and technology. However a decade ago, previous education focused on Chinese dynasties and communist revolution rather than globalization. Adopting [[free-market]] economy not only gave China progression in economic activity as well as liberated the minds of Chinese people. Muhbubani believes that the success of North America and the European Union was caused by the middle class who are reluctant to sacrifice their comfortable life due to warfare. When disputes between individuals and societies emerge, they would be settled on the basis of agreed rules and procedures, not by warfare. According to [[Larry Summers]], “there can be no personal freedom without personal security”. Therefore, the March to Modernity creates a more secure world due to adherence to rules and order.

'"Examples of Economic Prosperity in Asia"'

•	Modernization of China and India has succeeded in reducing the number of people in absolute poverty.

•	Spread of Cell phone users in India has changed Indian mindset on modern instruments. This “mobile miracle” empowered the less fortunate to fight [[poverty]] and to be connected to global economy. Cell phones are now connecting the World’s poor to the global economy, which leads to higher productivity.

Examples of Political Stability in Asia

•	China has responded actively to the call of World Bank to become a "responsible stakeholder" of international order (Sept. 2005)

•	Most Asian countries want to take responsible parts in the open multilateral international order.

== Other Two Possible Scenarios ==

Scenario 2: The Retreat into Fortresses

In the second scenario, Mubuhbani believes that the Western hemisphere, will become threatened by Asia's success. Thus, the West will engaged in rigid [[protectionism]] to halt Asia’s rising status. However Muhbani explains that Europe has engaged in protectionist techniques since the end of the Cold War. These strategies includes massive subsidies to the wealthy few in Europe and using tax payers’ dollars on unnecessary language translations. Although the European Union’s protectionist policies has not hindered the overall growth of the global economy, according to [[David Hale (economist)|David Hale]], a Wall Street Journalist,“the greatest threat to this [global] boom is that the United States will lose confidence in the free market ideology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hale|first=David|title=The Best Economy Ever|publisher=New York Times|location=New York|date=31 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protectionism is also happening in the investment sector of global politics.  The United States has backed out of foreign investment due to the concern of national security issues. [[Paul Krugman]], one of America’s leading economist acknowledges that free trade is not universally benefit in that there will be some winners and some losers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=The Trade Tightrope|publisher=New York Times|location=New York|date=27 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[World Bank|the World Bank]], states that countries that engaged in free trade will actually see a rise in their economies as well due to the laws of comparative advantage.

Scenario 3: The Triumph of the West
The Triumph of the West is the last scenario presented by Muhbani. The West, having positioned itself as a superpower after the Cold War, [[westernization]] will increase thus causing all other nations to adopt Western values and become "cultural clones of the West.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument was elaborated by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his book "[[The End of History]]" arguing for the "end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahbubani contends that three fundamental flaws exists in this scenario.

The first flaw is the belief that the West had triumphed over the Soviet Union because of its values and political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahbubani illustrates it was the economic system that led to Western triumph, and the success of China and the failure of Soviet Union reveal the flaw of the argument. Deng Xiaoping focused on introducing free-market economics to China by correctly understanding the source of Western strength, while Gorbachev focused on [[glasnost]] (political openness) over [[perestroika]] (economic restructuring).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Gorbachev's failure to realise the power of Western economic system led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The belief that "any society anywhere in the world at any state of social and economic development could be immediately transformed overnight into a liberal democracy" is the second flaw of the Western triumphalist thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author points out that everywhere else apart from the East European countries, which shared common history and culture with Western Europe, [[democratization]] failed. He offers the example of Balkans to argue that "without the right institutions and political culture, long-smoldering ethnic, religious, and nationalistic sentiments in many countries can be whipped up my opportunistic damagogues", leading to failure in transition to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although democratic elections were held in Croatia and Serbia, instead of liberal democrats, nationalist demagogues were elected. The leaders then appealed to visceral nationalist sentiments to retain their power, which led to war. Unprepared democratisation can also lead to ethnic conflicts, as the examples of ethnic cleansing of Croats in parts of the former Yugoslavia, the attacks on the Chinese minority in Indonesia, and the Tutsi slaughter in Rwanda illustrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, disregarding cultural differences because of the belief that Western liberal democratic society is universally applicable to all societies is another flaw in the triumphant post-Cold War thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahbubani claims cultures are different and failing to see this shows generosity but also arrogance of the West. The author asserts that there is nothing superior about the Western values, rather, other dormant cultures simply underwent revival of cultural confidence and dynamism when the West was experiencing one of its most triumphant moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the flaws, Kishore Mahbubani argues that this scenario is least likely to happen in the future.

== Reasons For Asia's Rise ==
In his book, ''[http://www.mahbubani.net/book3.html The New Asian Hemisphere],'' [[Kishore Mahbubani]] explains seven pillars of Western wisdom that have contributed to Asia's march to modernity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahbubani|first=Kishore|title=The New Asian Hemisphere: The Irresistible Shift of Global Power to the East|year=2008|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58648-466-8|pages=51–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Free-market economics
# Science and technology
# Meritocracy
# Pragmatism
# Culture of peace
# Rule of law
# Education

== Cases of Asia's Modernity ==
[[Kishore Mahbubani]] suggests two significant cases of Asia's modernity; China and India.

* China
According to 'The China Modernization Report', China measures its modernization level with two assessment criteria; first stage, "industrialization and urbanization" and second stage, a "knowledge-driven and information-driven" society. The 2007 China Modernization Report predicts that by 2015, China will have reached modernization "to the level of developed nations in 1960".

*India
The mobile phone revolution in India shows how "just one modern instrument" impact modernization. It is not just spread of mobile but spread of communication and information.

'''Morgenklubben med Loven &amp; Co''' ''(The Morning Show with Loven &amp; Co)'' is a popular Norwegian radio show, airing weekdays from 5:58 am to 10:00 am on [[Radio Norge]]. It is currently hosted by [[comedian]] Øyvind Loven, comedian Geir Schau, Annette Walther Numme, Helene Husvik and Thea Hope. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kampanje.com/jobb/article5865558.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

On the air since 2009, the show has grown to immense popularity in Norway, and is one of the most popular radio shows in the country, and has often been credited as being a great part of the channels success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kampanje.com/reklame/article5869761.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has however suffered from some controversy, most stemming from the Friday segment '''Geirs Grovis''' ''(Geirs' dirty joke)'', where every week, host Geir Schau tells a dirty joke on the air at exactly 9:10 am.

The song '''"Mrs. Caroline Robinson"''' was the [[Austria]]n representative at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978]], performed in [[German Language|German]] by [[Springtime (band)|Springtime]].

The song was performed nineteenth on the night (following [[Israel]]'s [[Izhar Cohen]] and [[Alphabeta]] with "[[A-Ba-Ni-Bi]]" and preceding [[Sweden]]'s [[Björn Skifs]] with "[[Det blir alltid värre framåt natten]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 14 points, placing 15th in a field of 20.

The song is about the titular Caroline Robinson, the "top-witch of this town", who has considerable sex appeal now that she doesn't use her broomstick.

The song was succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|1979 Contest]] by [[Christina Simon]] singing "[[Heute in Jerusalem]]".

The '''Party for Renewal and Development''' ({{lang-pt|Partido para Renovação e Desenvolvimento}}, PRD) was a political party in [[Guinea-Bissau]].

==History==
The PRD was established on 12 February 1992 by dissidents from the Group of 121 who had been urging reform of the ruling [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde|PAIGC]], and was initially led by [[João da Costa]].&lt;ref name=HD&gt;Peter Karibe Mendy (2013) ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau'', Scarecrow Press, p319&lt;/ref&gt; It joined the [[Union for Change]] alliance prior to the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1994|1994 general elections]], with the Alliance winning six seats in the [[National People's Assembly (Guinea-Bissau)|National People's Assembly]], of which the PRD took one.&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

Following the death of da Costa, [[Manuel Rambout Barcellos]] became party leader.&lt;ref name=HD/&gt; The Union was reduced to three seats in the [[Guinea-Bissau general election, 1999–2000|1999–2000 general elections]], and lost them all in the [[Guinea-Bissau legislative election, 2004|2004 parliamentary elections]], after which the PRD became inactive.&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

Formerly known as '''Entreprise des Postes et Télécommunications''', '''POST Luxembourg''' is a [[mail]] and [[telecommunications]] company based in [[Luxembourg]].  The company is a [[government-owned corporation]] that went through [[corporatization]]. It also sells [[financial services]] and holds a monopoly on issuing [[postage stamps]] in the Grand Duchy.&lt;ref name="Turnover Earnings"/&gt;

It comes under the remit of the [[Minister for Communications of Luxembourg|Minister for Communications]], who reports to the [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg|Prime Minister]] in the latter's capacity as [[Minister of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/ministeres/mini_etat/index.html |title=Ministère d'Etat |accessdate=2008-03-28 |last= |first= |publisher=Service Information et Presse |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320044648/http://www.gouvernement.lu/ministeres/mini_etat/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-20|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P&amp;T owns shares in sixteen other companies, including controlling stakes in [[eBRC]] (100%), [[Editus.lu]] (100%), [[Eltrona]], [[HotCity]], [[Infomail]] (45%), Intech, [[Michel Greco]] (60%), [[Netcore]] (100%), [[POST Telecom]] (100%), [[POST PSF Consulting]] (100%), [[Victor Buck Services]] (Majority), [[Visual Online]] (51%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pt.lu/portal/lang/en/Entreprise/about-us/pid/6 |title=Subsidiaries |accessdate=2012-07-13 |last= |first= |publisher=Entreprise des Postes et Télécommunications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705121514/http://www.pt.lu/portal/lang/en/Entreprise/about-us/pid/6 |archivedate=2012-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2013, P&amp;TLuxembourg and [[LuxGSM]] merged into a single brand, POST Luxembourg. The LUXGSM network was therefore renamed POST.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postgroup.lu/fr/actualites/news-et-communiques/-/asset_publisher/OH6oMcVms00q/blog/ab-heute-hei%C3%9Fen-p-tluxembourg-und-luxgsm-post-post-bietet-zudem-neue-dienstleistungen-und-produkte-an-&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Sawa''' ({{lang-ar|راديو سوا}}) is a 24-hour 7-day-a-week [[Arabic language]] radio station broadcasting in the [[Arab world]]. The station is a service of the [[Middle East Broadcasting Networks]], Inc., which also operates [[Alhurra]] Television and is publicly funded by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] and the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="Radio Sawa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Sawa|url=http://www.radiosawa.com/p/409.html|work=About Us|publisher=Radio Sawa|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "sawa" ({{lang|ar|سوا}}, {{IPA-ar|ˈsæwæ, ˈsawa|IPA}}) means "together" in many [[varieties of Arabic|spoken Arabic]] dialects.

Preexisting attitudes and concurrent reality of opinions towards the United States led to the creation of Radio Sawa. It seeks to effectively communicate with the youthful population of Arabic-speakers in the Middle East. The station's goal is to promote pro-American attitudes to [[youth in the Arab world]]. Radio Sawa's first broadcast was on March 23, 2002. Its newscasts are broadcast live on air from its studios in [[Washington, DC]] and [[Dubai, United Arab Emirates]]. Radio Sawa also has news bureaus and reporters throughout the Middle East.

==History==
Radio Sawa and its sister-network, [[Al Hurra TV]], are part of a larger [[Public Diplomacy (U.S.)|U.S. Public Diplomacy]] effort in the [[Middle East]]. Their stated mission is to "improve America's image in the Middle East and win the hearts and minds of the [[Arab people]]."&lt;ref name=gmc&gt;{{cite journal|last=el Nawawy|first=Mohammed|title=US public diplomacy in the Arab world: The news credibility of Radio Sawa and Television Alhurra in five countries|journal=Global Media and Communication|year=2006|volume=2|issue=2|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Sawa was first launched on 23 March 2002,&lt;ref name=gmc/&gt; initially in [[Jordan]], [[West Bank]], [[Kuwait]], [[UAE]] ([[Abu Dhabi (emirate)|Abu Dhabi]]), [[Qatar]] and [[Bahrain]] and eventually in the rest of the Arab World (see below for full list).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Filtering the propaganda|url=http://www.hermes-press.com/sawa_propaganda.htm|newspaper=Al-Ahram weekly|date=16–22 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Sawa replaced [[Voice of America]]'s Arabic service, which had not been successful in attracting large audiences. The initiator of Radio Sawa is American media mogul [[Norman Pattiz]]. He found that more than 60% of the Arab population was under the age of 30, which is why he decided to develop programming that would target the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilmy|first=Sam|title=Radio Sawa: America's new adventure in radio broadcasting|journal=Arab Media and Society|year=2007|page=2|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20070514225410_AMS2_Salman_Hilmy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattiz believed that the best way to reach the young people was with music. This is why the majority of the radio's programming consists of American and Arab [[pop music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gedda|first=George|title=Radio Sawa: Music as a tool|journal=Foreign Service Journal|year=2002|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:uK0zq2FK0PEJ:ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/pmt/exhibits/973/radio.pdf+RADIO+SAWA:+MUSIC+AS+A+TOOL&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiOCGdoDE72IZtGfeYYWSPNW8LmbNvNz2Tm08NbtN_ecdSai-8erIfVgn6oiYgDImz0F6TaJBdAdm_x7tw7_k2l4vYhZf26hdaN7tT553xlWlSsNB0qqNXulMZ8WUY2rLcNiRN8&amp;sig=AHIEtbRuMWpB4M3NBF1xTAZfeu5sKYwb_Q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Sawa is controlled by the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), the Federal agency responsible for all U.S. international civilian broadcasting. The BBG founded the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN), a non-profit news and information organization, to run Radio Sawa and Al Hurra TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilmy|first=Sam|title=Radio Sawa: America's new adventure in radio broadcasting|journal=Arab Media and Society|year=2007|pages=1–2|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20070514225410_AMS2_Salman_Hilmy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
Radio Sawa is a United States Congress-funded public relations endeavor that has enjoyed significant recent popularity in the Middle East.

==Programming==
In contrast to the [[Voice of America]] radio broadcasts in the region which it replaced, Radio Sawa blends news with contemporary music, arts and lifestyle and other light programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/21/television/index.html |title=Propaganda or journalism?|author=Anthony York|date=April 21, 2003|publisher=[[salon.com]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210164003/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/04/21/television/index.html |archivedate = February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Sawa's programming consists of roughly 20–25% news and 75–80% pop songs.

===News===
Apart from songs, most other content is presented in the rubric "The World Now," which includes news, interviews, sports, etc.

===Songs===
The station's playlist includes popular [[Arabic music|Arabic]] (Middle Eastern), [[English language|English]] (mostly American hits) and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (mostly Latin American) songs so as to attract the Arabic listener.

===Special programming===
There are also occasional specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilmy|first=Sam|title=Radio Sawa: America's new adventure in radio broadcasting|journal=Arab Media and Society|year=2007|page=3|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20070514225410_AMS2_Salman_Hilmy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=July 2011}}

Radio Sawa has been subject to criticism from various observers, who question its effectiveness in conveying America's message to the Arab world. Radio Sawa is commonly seen as terms of a solution to public relations crisis during the time of its launch as a form of public diplomacy, 'suggesting by implication that American media efforts do have the power to transform opinion if only implemented in a different form'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner|first=Michael|title=Radio Sawa in Jordan: Different Perceptions, Together?|url=http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=isp_collection|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arab World===
A study published in 2006, which surveyed college students at universities in five Arab countries, found that the students' attitudes towards U.S. foreign policy had actually worsened since they started listening to Radio Sawa and watching Al Hurra TV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=el-Nawawy|first=Mohammed|title=US public diplomacy in the Arab world : the news credibility of Radio Sawa and Television Alhurra in five countries|journal=Global Media and Communication|year=2006|volume=2|issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Sawa has also been criticized for its poor quality control and for its resistance to any outside review of its programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilmy|first=Sam|title=Radio Sawa: America's new adventure in radio broadcasting|journal=Arab Media and Society|year=2007|page=13|url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20070514225410_AMS2_Salman_Hilmy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
A 2004 draft report prepared by the [[State Department]]'s [[inspector general]] was severely critical of the station. Experts cited in the report concluded that "Radio Sawa failed to present America to its audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kessler|first=Glenn|title=The Role of Radio Sawa In Mideast Questioned|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28031-2004Oct12?language=printer|accessdate=2011-04-24|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2004-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station's emphasis on popular music has led critics to question if music alone is enough to convey America's message. Some critics point out that what matters is "not just how many people are tuning in, but how many people are affected by a broadcast's content."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Kasie|title=Are U.S. Arabic Programs Being Heard?|journal=National Journal|date=2005-07-16|page=2300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
Radio Sawa is broadcast free across the region, using a combination of:
* [[Medium wave]] ([[Amplitude modulation|AM]]) transmitters
* [[FM broadcast band|FM]] transmitters
* Digital [[Satellite radio|audio satellite broadcasting]] ([[Eutelsat]], [[Nilesat]], [[Arabsat]])

He was responsible at Geostar for the development, design, implementation and operation of the Radio Determination Satellite Service provided by Geostar, which allowed positioning and message [[communications]] between mobile users nationwide and their dispatch centers. Briskman directed the construction of Geostar’s space segment, the control and operations center and the development of the mobile terminals used on land, sea and airborne vehicles built by the [[SONY]], [[Hughes Network Systems]] and [[Kenwood Corporation]]s. He was responsible for the development of a miniaturized handheld transceiver by Motorola, which was the world’s smallest satellite earth terminal. Briskman served as Senior Vice President, Engineering.

===COMSAT===
Briskman was employed by the [[Communications Satellite Corporation]] (COMSAT) in January 1964, and was responsible initially for satellite command and control activities, including those involved with the launching of [[Intelsat I]] (Early Bird). He was later a Department Manager in the Transmission Systems Division, where he was involved with the development and implementation of the [[Intelsat]] global communications system. Among his efforts, early work in demand assigned single carrier per channel, radio frequency interference minimization and terrestrial interconnection was accomplished. Briskman was responsible from 1967-1973 for the technical planning involved with the provision of domestic communications services via satellites, including AT&amp;T’s satellite systems.

Briskman joined COMSAT General Corporation on its founding in 1973 and was Assistant Vice President, Space and Information Systems. He was responsible for the [[Comstar]] satellite system,{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} the development of Earth resource and information systems, and the implementation of the first remote satellite data collection system in conjunction with the [[United States]] Geological Survey and [[Telesat]] [[Canada]]. He directed the construction of the Southbury and Santa Paula earth stations which were used for command and control of both [[Marisat]] and Comstar satellites and for shore communications to the Atlantic and Pacific Marisat satellites. Briskman joined Satellite Business Systems in mid-1977 where he was responsible for the Pre-Operational Program which provided voice and data communications services to many [[IBM]] facilities in the United States using the first demand-assigned, time division multiple access system ever placed in commercial operations.

Briskman returned to COMSAT General in 1980 where he was responsible as Vice President, Systems Implementation for the engineering of satellites, earth stations and communications technical facilities of COMSAT General and of clients, both within and external to COMSAT. His organization provided a complete range of technical services nationally and internationally, including those involved with software, spectrum engineering and teleconferencing. Briskman was responsible for Indonesia’s domestic satellite system [[Palapa]], Mexico’s [[Morelos (satellite)|Morelos]], [[Arab Satellite Communications Organization|Arabsat]], and [[Italsat]] programs, as well as for providing support to the Inmarsat, Intelsat, STC (Direct broadcast), Telstar-3, Alascom, Satcol, Unisat, Intelmet, Nordsat, Chinasat, and Cameroon programs.

The '''Second Tarnovo uprising''' ({{lang-bg|Второ търновско въстание}}, ''Vtoro tarnovsko vastanie''), according to a unique Russian source published in 1847, is thought to be a [[Bulgaria]]n uprising against  [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]] based in the former Bulgarian capital, [[Tarnovo]], that broke out in 1686 and was severely crushed by the Ottoman authorities.

In 1686 [[Russian Tsardom|Russia]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] joined the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] against the Ottoman Turkish Empire. [[Rostislav Stratimirovic]]&amp;nbsp;— a descendant of the medieval [[Shishman dynasty]] decided to exploit the international situation, established relations with the Russian [[Patriarch Joachim of Moscow|Patriarch Joachim]] and visited [[Moscow]]  in preparation for the uprising. In his absence the uprising burst prematurely and was doomed. He quickly returned to Tarnovo where he was proclaimed [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Prince of Bulgaria]] after the city was briefly liberated, with about 4,000 people gathering.

However, the Ottoman authorities reacted immediately and quickly recaptured the city using regular army, brutally suppressing the uprising.  Rostislav Stratimirovic fled the Ottoman territory and settled in Russia where he married the niece of the patriarch – Maria Dubrovska.

The only source about the uprising (and the very existence of Rostislav Statimirovic) is the family chronicles of Rostislavich-Dubrovsky clan, now missing. Its legendary character makes many historians doubt its authenticity and consider it "a beautiful legend" which served the political interests in 19th century Russia. The ostensible owner of the chronicles, the amateur Russian historian Nikolay Savelyev who called himself Savelyev-Rostislavich (1815-1854) pretended to be a descendant of Rostislav of Bulgaria and the Patriarch's niece. However no independent sources corroborating such a genealogy of his rather modest family exist, and the whole story is presumed to be concocted by him.&lt;ref&gt;''Шишманов И. Д.'' Априлов и Н. В. Савельев-Ростиславич // Сборникъ на БАН. Книга 21: Нови студии изъ областьта на българското възраждане: В. Е. Априлов, Неофит Рилски, Неофит Бозвели. София: Печатница и букволеярница П. Глушков, 1926. С. 5-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Ottoman archives do indeed speak of insurgent activities in Tarnovo region during this period, centred on [[Arbanasi, Bulgaria|Arbanasi]] village.
