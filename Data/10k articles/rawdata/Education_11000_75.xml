==History==
The first Kazakh institute of higher learning, which was named [[Kazakh State University]], on September 1, 1928. It had one unique faculty - [[pedagogical]] with three separations:
*physico-mathematic
*natural studies
*linguistic studies

It was assumed to create other three faculties: pedagogical, agricultural and medical. They were supposed to work from 1932-1933. On behalf of intensive development of folk education newly opened institute of higher education  decided to develop as an independent pedagogical college. Therefore, in 1930 the university was renamed as Kazakh State Pedagogical College (KAZPI), and in 1935 it was renamed as Abai State University and when expanded its fields of studies in 1989 it was named just Abai University as there were more courses than technical education.
Today's Abai University started its work in a small one-story building of Vernenskoy as a Women's School.

==List of Faculties==
* Philological faculty
* Faculty of Physics and Maths
* Faculty of History

* Faculty of Arts
* Faculty of Economic Sciences
* Faculty of International Relations

'''''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon''''' is an [[Ocean|underwater]] [[City-building game|city-building simulation game]] in which the player acts as a [[tycoon]] to simulate the [[Real-time game|real-time]] design and management of an [[Ocean colonization|underwater civilization]]. It was developed and published by [[Activision Value]], and released on March 21, 2003 for [[Microsoft Windows]] on the PC.

''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon'' was the first building sim to be set underwater.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
In ''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon'', the player can choose to play in missions or in a sandbox-environment map to start building their underwater colony. The player chooses a tycoon character to play as who comes with their own positive and negative traits, such as providing bonus starting money, or having a disreputable attitude towards [[sea life]].

The player starts on the [[ocean floor]] with a home base and a set amount of money. The player then expands the [[Ocean colonization|underwater colony]] by constructing various residential, utility, commercial, industrial, tourist, and military buildings that extend outward from the home base in a design conducive to the ocean floor, linking them with air tubes, and [[terraforming]] the seabed if needed.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt; The player is able to collect and store items produced by commercial and industrial buildings in warehouses and sell them off in a market. The player can also breed new wildlife to live in the city's waters, such as [[dolphin]]s or [[shark]]s, as well as create [[Submarine|underwater vehicles]] to roam around the city.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt; As the city grows, a wider range of buildings and residents become available. Such buildings include [[Blue whale|whale]] sanctuaries, [[sea turtle]] aquariums, shopping malls, [[Deepwater drilling|oil drills]], and prison facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109232346/http://pc.ign.com/objects/613/613977.html |url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/613/613977.html |archive-date=2007-01-09 |title=IGN: Atlantis Underwater Tycoon |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; New and better buildings bring in more citizens and tourists, generating more income for the city. Over time, buildings nearing their life expectancies can be demolished to make room for new buildings.&lt;ref name="mobygames"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mobygames.com/game/atlantis-underwater-tycoon |title=Atlantis Underwater Tycoon (Windows) |work=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late stages of the game, the player can unlock the ability to build Atlantean structures.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;

In addition to having to manage the economic aspects of the game, the player must also contend with attacks from enemy [[pirates]] and from enemy Atlanteans, as well as deal with underwater [[natural disaster]]s. Military vessels and friendly Atlantean defenders can be recruited to defend against such attacks.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_new"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/atlantis-underwater-tycoon-review/10393 |title=Atlantis Underwater Tycoon Review |date=October 28, 2003 |accessdate=2018-08-18 |author=Chris |work=Gamewatcher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military buildings, such as [[Sonic weapon|sonic cannons]] and [[missile turret]]s, can be manned by the player to shoot projectiles at hostile vessels and destructive debris to destroy them.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_new"/&gt;

On the whole, the player prevents the city from falling into harm by keeping a watchful eye out for enemy invaders and natural disasters, while managing the city's businesses so that population happiness, tourism, and sea life can prosper, all the while avoiding the city plunging into financial trouble.

''Atlantis Underwater Tycoon'' has been praised for its well-done visuals and its snappy underwater music track.&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_new"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt; The ability to see into buildings and view the people within nightclubs and movie theaters is also a nice plus.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt; The visual depiction of night and day from the rays of light shining down on the city also provides for a nice ambiance effect.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt; The top moments in the game can be attributed to the times when a player's prospering city "[comes] under attack from enemy subs, and the player reacts to mount a counter-attack to avoid all the player's hard work from being obliterated."&lt;ref name="gamewatcher_review_archived"/&gt;

One reviewer says that the game's biggest weakness lay in its lack of variety in building models and resources.&lt;ref name="worthplaying"/&gt;

Boeing Frontiers, May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]], similar in nature to the [[IBM Fellow]]s program.  Established in 1989, the role of the engineers and scientists serving as Technical Fellows is to set technical direction for Boeing, and to resolve issues that arise when the company creates new products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20100523/BIZ/705209664/1005 "Crucial Boeing talent nearing retirement"]. Everett Herald&lt;/ref&gt; There are three levels in the Boeing Technical Fellowship program, each level reflecting varying degrees of impact within the company and in the industry at large: Associate Technical Fellow, Technical Fellow, and Senior Technical Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2004/april/mainfeature.html "Good Fellows"]. Boeing Frontiers, April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Election into the Technical Fellowship follows a formal process.  Prospective Technical Fellows are nominated by management, and evaluated by the program based on five criteria:&lt;ref name=Go_To_Gang/&gt;
#technical knowledge and judgment
#creative problem solving and innovation
#technical leadership, advising and consulting
#capability as a teacher and mentor
#technical vision.
If the candidate shows strength in these areas, the candidate is then interviewed by a board.  If the results of the interview are positive, the candidate advances to the [[Chief technology officer]]'s office, for review and approval. As a result of the vetting process, the program includes only approximately 1.5% of Boeing’s workforce and represents “some of the best engineering and scientific minds at Boeing and in the industry.”&lt;ref name=Go_To_Gang/&gt;

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

'''Colin Rowe''' (27 March 1920 &amp;ndash; 5 November 1999), was a British-born, American-naturalised architectural historian, critic, theoretician, and teacher; acknowledged as a major intellectual influence on world architecture and [[urbanism]] in the second half of the twentieth century and beyond, particularly in the fields of city planning, regeneration, and urban design. During his life he taught briefly at the University of Texas at Austin and, for one year, at the University of Cambridge in England. For the majority of his life he taught as a Professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In 1995 he was awarded the Gold Medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the professional group's highest honor.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Early life==
Colin Frederick Rowe was born in [[Rotherham]], England in 1920 to Frederick W. and Helena (neé Beaumount)Rowe. Rowe's father was a school teacher and his only sibling David was born in October 1928. Rowe was a clever child winning scholarships to the local Grammar School and later to the University of Liverpool to study architecture. He was called up in December 1942 and was enlisted in the British Royal Airforce. He badly injured his spine in a practice jump and was left hospitalised for more than six months. One of the first letters from Rowe published in ''[https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=the+letters+of+colin+rowe The Letters of Colin Rowe: Five Decades of Correspondence]'' was written from his hospital bed to his friend and colleague at the University Ursula Mercer.&lt;ref&gt;Naegele, Daniel ed., The Letters of Colin Rowe: Five Decades of Correspondence, Artifice Press, St. James Press, London, 2016 p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theoretical approach==
[[File:Larotonda2009.JPG|thumb|left|350px|Villa Capra "La Rotonda" was compared directly by Colin Rowe to the "Villa Savoye" by Le Corbusier.]]
His 1945 MA thesis for [[Rudolf Wittkower]] at the [[Warburg Institute]], London, was a theoretical speculation that [[Inigo Jones]] may have intended to publish a theoretical treatise on architecture, analogous to [[Palladio]]'s ''Four Books of Architecture''. Although this idea was not supported by any hard evidence and could not ever be proven, encouraged by Wittkower it established Rowe's way of speculating and imagining what ''might'' have happened: an approach to the history of architecture that was largely imaginary and factually questionable, but which he gradually built into a vastly erudite, coherently argued way of thinking and seeing that exasperated conventional historians, but became the inspiration for a generation of practising architects to consider history imaginatively, as an active component in their design process.
[[File:VillaSavoye.jpg|thumb|Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye was compared in studies by Colin Rowe directly to Palladio's neoclassical Villa Rotonda.]]

Rowe's original approach was based on making comparisons between cultural events that conventional history kept widely separated and categorised, but which he unearthed from his vast personal erudition (in constant development) and placed together for comparison. His unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical speculations such as his famous essay "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa" (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional "rules" in Palladio’s villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar "rules" in Le Corbusier’s villas at Poissy and Garches. Although like his MA thesis, this proposal was impossible to support with any evidence, as a speculation it enabled Rowe to elaborate an astonishingly fresh and provocative trans-historical critique of both Palladio and Le Corbusier, in which the architecture of both was assessed not in chronological time, but side by side in the present moment.

The originality of this approach had the effect of re-situating the assessment of modern architecture within history and acknowledged history as an active influence. Many years later when Rowe's influence had spread worldwide, this approach had become a key element in the process of architectural and urban design: if "the presence of the past" was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th. century, from [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] to [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Oswald Matthias Ungers]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Michael Graves]] and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. More recently, theorists and critics of the digital turn in architecture stressed the need to update Rowe's method for the present.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, Stylianos, Calling Rowe: After-lives of Formalism in the Digital Age, Footprint 22 (Spring/Summer 2018), pp. 89-102. https://doi.org/10.7480/footprint.12.1.1760&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Teaching and writings==
Between 1950-52, as a tutor at the Liverpool School of Architecture, he inculcated this original approach to modern architecture into the malleable 24-year-old architecture student [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]], only six years his junior. In Rowe’s view, by that time modernism in architecture was already finished;  what was intended to be a revolution had failed, but in Stirling he had found the means to create a new type of "modernist neo-classicist" architect; the two became lifelong friends, and all of Stirling's work in architectural practice was deeply indebted to Rowe's more or less continuous critical input. It has often been said that Stirling was "Rowe's draughtsman".
[[File:Villa Foscari 20070710-1.jpg|thumb|Villa Foscari by Palladio was studied by Colin Rowe in his essay on "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa".]]

Between the 1950s and his death, Rowe published a number of widely influential papers that influenced architecture by further developing the theory that there is a conceptual relationship between modernity and tradition, specifically [[Classicism]] in its various manifestations, and [[Modern Movement]] "white architecture" of the 1920s - a viewpoint first put forward by [[Emil Kaufmann]] in his classic book "Von Ledoux bis Le Courbusier" (1933). Although he remained an admirer of the achievements of the 1920s modernists, chiefly in the work of [[Le Corbusier]], Rowe also subjected the modern movement, which he considered a failure, to subversive modes of criticism and interpretation.

Rowe was among the first to openly denounce the failures of modernist urban planning and its destructive effects on the historic city; many of his most important books and essays are in fact more concerned with urban form than with architectural language. This early work, led to the [[contextualism]] school of thought which was likewise critical of modern [[urban design]] and [[architectural theory]] of [[design]] wherein modern building types are harmonized with urban forms usual to a traditional city.&lt;ref&gt;New Paradigm In Architecture by Charles Jencks, Yale University Press; 7th Edition (1 August 2002), {{ISBN|0-300-09512-0}}, p. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowe was the Andrew Dickson White Professor of Architecture at Cornell University, where he taught from 1962 until his retirement in 1990.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muschamp|first1=Herbert|title=Colin Rowe, Architecture Professor, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/08/arts/colin-rowe-architecture-professor-dies-at-79.html|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of his brilliant and very influential academic career he focused on developing an alternative method of urban design derived in part from the earlier work of [[Camillo Sitte]] but largely original, and based on the making of cities through a process of collaged, superimposed pieces; the ideal model for this pragmatic, anti-doctrinaire approach was the ruined villa of the Roman Emperor Hadrian at Tivoli, outside Rome.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book

1n 1981 he started the [[Cornell Journal of Architecture]] and contributed to issue 1 with "The Present Urban Predicament" and to issue 2 with "Program vs. Paradigm."

His chief significance was as a teacher and writer on these subjects, which greatly influenced architectural thinking. His book ''Collage City'' (with [[Fred Koetter]]) is his theoretical treatise that sets out various analyses of urban form in a number of existing cities known to be aesthetically successful, examining their actually existing urban structure as found, revealing it to be the end product of a ceaseless process of fragmentation, the collision/superimposition/contamination of many diverse ideas imposed on it by successive generations, each with its own idea. In architecture his thinking paralleled his ideas about the city: he was nostalgic for nineteenth-century eclecticism, advocating that architecture in the modern age should abandon its purist abstraction and allow itself to be influenced by influxes of historical references.

Philosophically, Rowe's conviction that pragmatic, discrete, and episodic ideas are more meaningful and useful than totalising, overarching, all-inclusive concepts led him towards the political right, and to such philosophers as [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Karl Popper]]; but paradoxically this also situated his thinking in the same general zone as left-leaning philosophers like [[Gianni Vattimo]].
As he continued to publish ground-breaking, intellectually rich, unconventional essays on the history and theory of architecture, and became a permanent resident of the United States (becoming a US citizen towards the end of his life) he went on to influence many other architects, students, and architectural educators during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (in 1966 he served as a fellow at the Graham Foundation in Chicago) at a time when there was a move towards [[Postmodern architecture]] with which he may be partly associated - though only to a very limited extent, and only in a philosophical sense, since his intellectual range, and his all-inclusive interest in every movement and style of architecture, placed him far outside any particular stylistic category. Rowe died at the age of 79 on 5 November 1999 in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. A memorial program was held in his honor on 6 February 2000 at The Carnegie Institution of Washington, Washington, DC.

=="The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa"==
[[File:VillaFoscari20070710-06.jpg|thumb|left|Villa Foscari was compared to Le Corbusier's work in studies by Colin Rowe.]]
Colin Rowe's seminal essay went through five printings in four years and was titled "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa." The text was printed both in essay form and in book form under the same title along with eight other comparably supportive essays. In this essay, Rowe presented his original view of the direct comparative reading of modern architecture alongside neo-Classical architecture. This approach was not generally done or accepted in the architectural literature of the time when the essay was first published in 1976. Rowe asserted the basis of a direct comparison of a villa by [[Le Corbusier]] and a villa by [[Andrea Palladio]] from the 16th century. Rowe's choice was to place Palladio's masterpiece from the 1550s called the Malcontenta ([[Villa Foscari]]) into direct comparison with Le Corbusier's villa at [[Garches]] for Mr. and Mrs. Michael Stein. Rowe's argument began by asserting that both Garches and the Malcontenta are conceived of as single blocks of roughly identical volumes measuring "8 units in length, by 5 1/2 in breadth, by 5 in height."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Rowe. ''The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa''. MIT Press, 1976, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe then observes that "Each house exhibits an alternative rhythm of double and single intervals; and each house ... displays a comparable tripartite distribution of line of support." As Rowe summarizes: "Palladio is concerned with a logical disposition of motifs dogmatically accepted ... while Le Corbusier ... contrasts the new system with the old and is a little more comprehensive."

Rowe continues on in the essay to conclude that, "If Le Corbusier's facades are for him the primary demonstrations of the virtues of a mathematical discipline, with Palladio it would seem that the ultimate proof of his theory lies in his plan ... (At Malcontenta) [t]he facades become complicated, their strict Platonic rationale may be ultimately vitiated by the traditional presence ... of the Ionic order which possesses its own rationale and which inevitable introduces an alternative system of measurement."&lt;ref&gt;Rowe (1976), ''The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa,'' p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end of his essay, Rowe transfers his approach to the shared sympathy of Le Corbusier and Palladio for the mathematical description of the ideal villa by discussing the [[Villa Savoye]] in comparison to Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]], which he sees as analogous. In his famous closing quote, Rowe gives his highest compliment to both Palladio and Le Corbusier together stating that Palladio and Le Corbusier had "become the source of innumerable pastiches and of tediously amusing exhibition techniques; but it is the magnificently realized quality of the originals which one rarely finds in the works of neo-Palladians and exponents of 'le style Corbu'". For Rowe, in the end these two master architects would have the more enduring word on the mathematics of the ideal villa than the majority of their followers.

'''Dava J. Newman''' (born 1964) is a former [[List of Administrators and Deputy Administrators of NASA|Deputy Administrator]] of [[NASA]],.&lt;ref name=sharkey&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharkey|first1=Jim|title=Dava Newman Starts Work as NASA's Deputy Administrator|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/nasa/dava-newman-starts-work-nasas-deputy-administrator/|accessdate=19 May 2015|work=Spaceflight Insider|date=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman earned her Ph.D. in aerospace biomedical engineering, and Master of Science degrees in aerospace engineering and technology and policy all from MIT, and her Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Notre Dame. Newman is the Apollo Program Professor of [[Aeronautics]] and [[Astronautics]] and Engineering Systems at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and a Harvard–MIT Health, Sciences, and Technology faculty member in Cambridge, MA. She is also a MacVicar Faculty Fellow (awarded for contributions to undergraduate education), former Director of the Technology and Policy Program at MIT (2003–2015), and former Director of the MIT–Portugal Program (2011–2015). As the Director of MIT’s Technology and Policy Program (TPP), she led the Institute’s largest multidisciplinary graduate research program, with over 1,200 alumni. She has been a faculty member in her home department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and MIT’s School of Engineering since 1993.

==Research==
Newman’s research expertise is in aerospace biomedical engineering, investigating human performance in varying gravity environments. Newman was the principal investigator on four spaceflight missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/dava-newman|title=Dava Newman|date=2017-11-06|work=Ann and H.J.

The Enhanced Dynamic Load Sensors experiment flew on board the Mir Space Station from 1996–1998. Newman was a Co-Investigator on the Mental Workload and Performance Experiment (MWPE) that flew on STS-42 to measure astronaut mental workload and fine motor control in microgravity. She also developed the MICR0-G space flight experiment to provide a sensor suite and study human adaptation in extreme environments.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} She was the MIT Principal Investigator on the Gravity Loading Countermeasure Suit, or Skinsuit, which flew the International Space Station as an ESA technology demonstration from 2015 to 2017.

Newman is best known for promoting the development of [[space activity suit]]s, namely the [[Space activity suit#MIT Bio-Suit|BioSuit]], which would provide pressure through compression directly on the skin via the suit's textile weave, patterning, and materials rather than with pressurized gas. The suit is designed to help astronauts move around more easily than gas-filled suits allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=W.|first=William|title=MIT Professor Has Created a Safer, Skin Tight Space Suit That Will Make It Easier to Work on Mars|url=http://spaceindustrynews.com/mits-next-mars-space-suit/|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Space Industry News|date=2 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227002524/http://spaceindustrynews.com/mits-next-mars-space-suit/|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Tariq|title=MIT Develops Sleeker, Slimmed-Down Spacesuit|url=http://spaceindustrynews.com/mits-next-mars-space-suit/|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=18 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227002524/http://spaceindustrynews.com/mits-next-mars-space-suit/|archivedate=27 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bettex|first=Morgan|title=Safeguarding astronauts’ hands|url=http://www.rdmag.com/News/2010/10/General-Science-Space-Safeguarding-Astronauts-Hands/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309015300/http://www.rdmag.com/News/2010/10/General-Science-Space-Safeguarding-Astronauts-Hands/|archivedate=2012-03-09|accessdate=22 February 2014|newspaper=R&amp;D Daily|date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spacesuit technologies are now{{when|date=October 2017}} being applied to "soft suits" to study and enhance locomotion on Earth.

'''Duisenberg School of Finance (DSF)''' was an educational organization in [[the Netherlands]] which offered [[Master's degree|Master's level education]] in [[finance]] between 2008 and 2015. The school was initiated as a collaborative initiative of Dutch the financial sector with local and international academic institutions. Amongst others, the founders of the initiative were [[Nout Wellink]] and Minister of the Economic Affairs,  [[Maria van der Hoeven]]. The name was chosen by the founders to honor [[Wim Duisenberg]], the first President of the European Central Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dnb.nl/over-dnb/samenwerking/duisenberg-school-of-finance/index.jsp|title = Duisenberg School of Finance|date = 2015-02-28|accessdate = 2015-02-28|website = Dutch Central Bank / Collaboration|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The annual enrollment accounted for around one hundred students. An administrative staff of eighteen faculty members was created with the support of the partnering institutions, amongst others [[De Nederlandsche Bank|Dutch Central Bank]], [[ING Group|ING]] and [[Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP|APG]]. The university is located in the Symphony offices in the Amsterdam financial district [[Amsterdam-Zuid|Zuid]]as. The campus of the school is in the Symphony Offices building. The board of directors and the executive fellowship at DSF are also executive board directors at largest financial institutions in Netherlands. In 2015, Dutch Center for Higher Education Information (Dutch: Centrum Hoger Onderwijs Informatie) has ranked LLM Finance and Law programme as the highest ranking professional program in Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mastervergelijker {{!}} Keuzegids Masters 2015 Online|url = http://www.keuzegids.org/ol/gidsen/ma15/mastervergelijker?vergelijk=644|website = www.keuzegids.org|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of fall 2015, the program of Duisenberg School of Financed is integrated into the school programs of [[VU University Amsterdam|Vrije Universiteit]] and [[University of Amsterdam]]. The program has been named Duisenberg Honors Program at VU and UVA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Duisenberg Honours Programme {{!}} Euronext|url = https://www.euronext.com/nl/blog/gongslag-lanceert-duisenberg-honours-programme|website = www.euronext.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:DSF and ING partnership.jpg|thumb|DSF and industry partners. ING director Nick Jue and dean Dirk Schoenmaker|211x211px|left]]On September 7, 2008 several major Dutch financial services companies signed an agreement to partner in financing the operation of DSF. Executive management, including the governmental officials, have seats on the board of DSF or act as the executive fellows. DSF was founded as a collaborative effort of academic researchers, financial companies, legal firms and governmental organizations.

=== Academic profile ===
Courses are typically taught by visiting faculty. Academics from, amongst others, [[University of Amsterdam]] (UvA), [[Vrije Universiteit]] (VU), work on collaborative research projects with financial practitioners.
Periodically the lectures are taught by executive management of the partnering financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dsf.nl/community/board/|title = DSF Board|date = 2015-03-01|accessdate = 2015-03-01|website = 'DSF Board'|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; DSF Policy Briefs are designed together with regulators, professionals from the industry and policymakers. Articles that meet the school research criteria are published in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/01/03/fed-investigating-cyclical-loan-to-value-mortgage-rules-bernanke-says/|title = Fed investigating cyclical loan-to-value mortgage rules, Bernanke says|last = Mantell|first = Ruth|date = 2014-03-01|work = 'Marter Watch'|access-date = 2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students and faculty publish research papers aimed at critically reassessing the contemporary regulatory environment and efficiency of the financial sector. The [[Tinbergen Institute]] cooperates with DSF to work on collaborative research projects.&lt;ref&gt;de Groot Ruiz, Adrian, Theodorus Johannes Servatius Offerman, and Sander Onderstal.

The '''James H. Dunn Memorial Fellowship Program''', often referred to as the Dunn Fellow Program or the Dunn Fellowship, is a year-long governmental honors [[fellow]]ship program in [[Illinois]]. The fellowship affords recent college graduates from every state the opportunity to experience and gain first-hand knowledge of Illinois [[State government]] and general governmental structure at the [[Executive (government)|executive]] level. Successful candidates are offered fellowships with the Illinois [[Governor of Illinois|Office of the Governor]] in both Chicago and Springfield, Illinois and in Washington, D.C.

Dunn Fellows work directly with management staff in the Office of the Governor and generally gain a broad perspective of the operation of state government. Many fellows upon completion of their year will move on to careers in state government as administrators or other management roles.

==Program history and background==
The Governor's Yearlong Fellowship Program was established in 1979, which was later renamed the James H. Dunn Memorial Fellowship Program in 1981 by Executive Order 7. This change honored James H. Dunn, a Rockford, Illinois citizen for his outstanding commitment to public service.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;2008 Dunn Fellowship application: http://www.illinois.gov/gov/pdfdocs/2008_dunn.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 3 in 1986 brought all fellowship and [[intern]]ship programs administered by the Office of the Governor under the aegis of the Prescott E. Bloom Internships in Government Program. According to the Dunn Fellowship application, "No one understood the benefit of government internship programs to both the State and the individual better than State Senator [[Prescott E. Bloom]]. From 1976 until his premature death in 1986, Senator Bloom sponsored his own annual internships, which successfully introduced hundreds of high school and college students to the inside of state government." &lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

The fellowship's purpose is to develop college graduates who have demonstrated a commitment to academic excellence and community involvement into capable leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Internship Opportunities, Office of Governor Rod R. Blagojevich: http://www.illinois.gov/gov/intopportunities.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are given the opportunity to develop skills in program budgeting, legislation, communication, and research, all of which are strongly demonstrated by successful public administrators. The program addresses the public sector's future need of competent and committed administrators by training these young adults in the operations of state government. Over the course of the fellowship year, the program provides a [[public sector]] management training program encouraging fellows to remain in a career oriented toward public service.

In addition, the program enables college graduates to supplement their academic backgrounds, providing them with an opportunity to develop their professional and leadership skills. Also, the program helps to achieve state [[affirmative action]] goals through the nomination of qualified minorities, women, and persons with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

The Dunn Fellowship Program is now administered by the Illinois Department of Central Management Services. Dunn Fellows, however, receive placements as fellows in the Office of the Governor and they are assigned Governor's Office supervisors and represent the Governor's Office as full-time staff during their fellowship.

On July 15, 2009 the Dunn Fellowship was cut from the Fiscal Year 2010 budget by Governor Pat Quinn. After an outpouring of support, the program was restored in August 2009.

==Eligibility and selection process==
Selection of each incoming class of Dunn Fellows is highly competitive. Applicants typically demonstrate strong performance in areas of academic achievement, community leadership and involvement, extracurricular activities, and career development. While there is no minimum [[Grade (education)|GPA]] to apply, successful candidates normally appear in the upper percentiles of their graduating classes.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

Minimum criteria for applying to the Dunn Fellowship Program are as follows:
*Have completed at least a bachelor's degree from an accredited university by the time of the start of the program (August 1 of each year).
*Be a recent college graduate (or have recently completed graduate school). While there is no time limit defining "recent," the program is designed for graduates who have recently finished their college education.
*Be legally allowed to work in the State of Illinois.
*Complete the application packet.

There are no preferences to academic majors or programs of study when considering candidates for fellowships. However, certain programs tend to offer training and experience in areas valuable to fellows. Successful candidates usually have participated in programs that encourage academic rigor, analytical skills, public policy research, and critical thinking.

After the application deadline has passed, senior members of the Governor's Office and Illinois Department of Central Management Services, Personnel Division will review applications and select approximately 50 candidates for in-person interviews. Fellowships will be awarded shortly after interviews are completed. Approximately 19 fellowships are awarded each year.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

==Program composition and activities==
Fellows are classified as full-time employees with the Illinois State Government. Fellows work in a variety of policy areas and administrative teams, directly assisting with the day-to-day operations of the State. Throughout the program history, fellows have either been assigned a work post for an entire year, allowing the fellow to specialize in one specific area of government administration, or fellows have cycled through a variety of posts throughout their fellowship (i.e. changing posts after each 3-month period to receive a broad view of governance.) {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Fellows have typically worked in all departments and teams of the Office of the Governor, including press, policy development, staff support, outreach programs, legislative affairs, and budget. It is the goal of the program to give fellows the necessary experience to become competent public sector administrators, which is accomplished in part by giving fellows a broad perspective in state government to help achieve this goal.

Throughout the program's history, Dunn Fellows have also done a variety of activities together including participation in leadership and career development seminars, community service projects and volunteerism, and tours and group outings. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Alumni==
Many Dunn Fellow alumni are promoted within state government to posts involving management of staff and individual projects. In addition, a good portion of Dunn Fellows return to graduate school or pursue training programs immediately following the fellowship to assist their career development. The Fellowship is represented throughout the public and private sectors, with many former fellows working at the management level in their respective fields of interest. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

An alumni association is in the formation stage. Its mission will be to connect Dunn Fellow classes, provide networking opportunities, and promote community service among past and current Dunn Fellows.

The '''Education Act 1902''' (''[[2 Edw. VII]]''), also known as the '''Balfour Act''', was a highly controversial Act of Parliament that set the pattern of elementary education in [[England and Wales]] for four decades.  It was brought to Parliament by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government and was supported by the [[Church of England]], opposed many by [[Nonconformists]] and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The Act provided funds for denominational religious instruction in voluntary elementary schools, most of which were owned by the Church of England and the Roman Catholics. It reduced the divide between voluntary schools, which were largely administered by the Church of England, and schools provided and run by elected school boards, and reflected the influence of the [[Efficiency Movement]] in Britain. It was extended in 1903 to cover London.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cooter, ''In the name of the child: health and welfare, 1880-1940'' (1992) Page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was a short-term political disaster for the Conservatives, who lost massively at the 1906 general election. However, [[G. R. Searle]] has argued that it was long-term success. It standardized and upgraded the educational systems of England and Wales and led to a rapid growth of secondary schools, with over 1,000 opening by 1914, including 349 for girls only. The Church schools had financing from local ratepayers and had to meet uniform standards. Eventually, in the [[Education Act 1944|Butler Act of 1944]], the Anglican schools were brought largely under the control of [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[G. R. Searle]]|title=A New England?: Peace and War, 1886-1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfy9JDd6OP4C|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=333–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The "[[Cockerton Judgment]]" of 1901 caused a crisis by undermining the lawfulness of "higher grade schools" for children over the age of twelve. A temporary fix allowed the schools to operate one more year. A second issue involved the 14,000 church schools, called [[Voluntary aided school|"voluntary schools"]], run chiefly by the Church of England and including some Roman Catholic schools. They were poorly funded and did not receive a share of local taxes, but they educated a third of school children.

Under the 1902 Act the existing overlapping jurisdictions, with 2,568 school boards set up by the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], as well as all existing School Attendance Committees, were abolished. Their duties were handed over to county councils or county borough councils, as [[local education authority|local education authorities]] (LEAs). The 328 LEAs fixed local tax rates. The LEAs could establish new secondary and technical schools as well as developing the existing system of elementary schools. These LEAs were in charge of paying schoolteachers, ensuring they were properly qualified, and providing necessary books and equipment. They paid the teachers in the church schools, with the churches providing and maintaining the school buildings and providing the religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Russell Searle|title=The Quest for National Efficiency: a Study in British Politics and Political Thought, 1899-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-7yrffS-oC&amp;pg=PA208|year=1971|publisher=U. of California Press|pages=208–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church Party==
The Church Party, a Conservative faction strongly supportive of the Church of England, largely shaped Conservative educational policy. Under the leadership of [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], it was determined to stop the spread of secularism in education. With [[John Gilbert Talbot]], Cranborne organized opposition to the Education Department and the radical spokesman [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|Arthur Acland]] from 1894. They blocked the Education Department's attempts to slow the growth of Anglican schools. They successfully passed the Voluntary Schools Act, an interim measure, in 1897. They demanded long-term legislation in 1897-1901, and scored their great victory in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Taylor, "Lord Cranborne, The Church Party and Anglican Education 1893-1902: From Politics to Pressure," ''History of Education,'' (1993) 22#2 pp 125-146&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and drafting of the Bill was the work of [[Robert Laurie Morant]], a civil servant in the Education Department. He worked closely with Balfour and Church leaders in 1901 .&lt;ref&gt;Dugdale, ''Balfour'' 1:237-39. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Chamberlain==
[[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s support base was threatened by Balfour's introduction into Parliament of the Education Bill. This Bill was framed with the intention of promoting [[Efficiency Movement#Britain|National Efficiency]], a cause which Chamberlain thought worthy. However, the Education Bill proposed to abolish Britain's 2,568 school boards established under [[William Edward Forster|W. E. Forster]]'s [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], bodies that were popular with Nonconformists and Radicals. Liberals opposed the Act, arguing that the board schools had outperformed the voluntary Anglican schools. In their place, Balfour proposed to establish [[local education authority|local education authorities]], which would administer a state-centred system of primary, secondary and technical schools. Furthermore, the Bill would grant ratepayers' money to voluntary Church of England schools. Chamberlain was anxious about the Bill's proposals, aware that they would estrange Nonconformists, Radicals and many Liberal Unionists from the government.

However, as Colonial Secretary in the coalition government, Chamberlain could not openly oppose the Bill. Chamberlain warned [[Robert Laurie Morant]] about the probability of Nonconformist dissent, asking why voluntary schools could not receive funds from the state rather than from the rates (local property taxes). In response, Morant argued that the [[Second Boer War]] had drained the Exchequer of finances.

The furore over the Education Bill imperilled the Liberal Unionist wing of the government, with the prospect of Nonconformist voters switching allegiance to the Liberal Party. Chamberlain sought to stem the feared exodus by securing a major concession: local authorities would be given discretion over the issue of rate aid to voluntary schools; yet even this was renounced before the guillotining of the Bill and its passage through Parliament in December 1902. Thus Chamberlain had to make the best of a hopeless situation, writing fatalistically that "I consider the Unionist cause is hopeless at the next election, and we shall certainly lose the majority of the Liberal Unionists once and for all." Chamberlain already regarded tariff reform as an issue that could revitalise support for Unionism.

== Opposition ==
Opposition to the Act came especially from Methodists, Baptists and other [[nonconformist]]s outraged at support for Anglican and Catholic schools, and angry at losing their powerful role on school boards.  Historian Standish Meacham explores their position:
:the act put an end to the broad-based expansion of secondary education that had originated in the so-called higher grade schools established by progressive, popularly elected local boards. Instead, secondary education was [to be] administered by county council committees and occurred in specifically designated "secondary" schools, admission to which was strictly controlled so as to exclude all but a very few working-class children. This important issue [was] a matter of major concern to working-class reformers anxious to provide a democratic "highway" rather than an exclusionary "ladder" to secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;Standish Meacham, "Looking for the Left," ''Journal of British Studies'' (1989) 28#2 pp 191-199 at p. 92 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1898753 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] led the opposition and made it a major issue especially in the election of 1906; the [[Labour Movement]] was mostly opposed. Nonconformist opposition was championed by [[John Clifford (minister)|John Clifford]]. Clifford formed the National Passive Resistance Committee, which hoped to convince more nonconformists to resist the Act and stop paying their [[rates (tax)|rates]] until it was repealed. By 1904 over 37,000 summonses for unpaid school taxes were issued, with thousands having their property seized and 80 protesters going to prison. It operated for another decade but had no impact on the school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Read|title=The age of urban democracy, England, 1868-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEcTAQAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Longman|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.

Gullifer, "Opposition to the 1902 Education Act," ''Oxford Review of Education'' (1982) 8#1 pp. 83-98 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1050168 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Searle, G.R.  |title=The Quest for National Efficiency: a Study in British Politics and Political Thought, 1899-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-7yrffS-oC|year=1971|publisher=University of California Press|pages=207–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act developed into a major political issue, which contributed significantly to the Liberal Party defeating the Conservatives in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|General Election in 1906]]. The Liberals made a major effort in 1906 to pass the [[Augustine Birrell|Birrell]] Educational Bill; it would have ended public support of religious schools. It passed the Commons but was blocked by the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Jones|title=Liberalism and the House of Lords, the story of the veto Battle 1832-1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8dgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA107|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Education in the United Kingdom''' is a [[devolution|devolved matter]] with each of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]] having separate systems under separate governments: the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] is responsible for [[England]]; whilst the [[Scottish Government]], the [[Welsh Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] are responsible for [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/ The Scottish Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127063939/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/ |date=27 November 2008 }} scotland.gov.uk, accessed 6 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/about/;jsessionid=8chVKqtQ4xpYp4Z1215SL63X291txx2Td9Tp2244SnclXGsZTT9L!918342478?lang=en About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218104105/http://wales.gov.uk/about/;jsessionid=8chVKqtQ4xpYp4Z1215SL63X291txx2Td9Tp2244SnclXGsZTT9L!918342478?lang=en |date=18 February 2012 }} wales.gov.uk, accessed 6 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Northern Ireland]], respectively.

==Stages==

In each country there are five stages of education: early years, primary, secondary, [[further education]] (FE) and [[higher education]] (HE)..&lt;ref name="gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=EDUCATION SYSTEM IN THE UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/219167/v01-2012ukes.pdf|publisher=British Government|accessdate=3 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206192006/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/219167/v01-2012ukes.pdf|archivedate=6 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law states that full time education is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 (4 in Northern Ireland) and 16, the compulsory school age (CSA).&lt;ref name="gov.uk" /&gt; In England, compulsory education or training has been extended to 18 for those born on or after 1 September 1997. This full-time education does not need to be at a school and some parents choose to [[Home education in the United Kingdom|home educate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/home-education|title=Home education - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725214444/https://www.gov.uk/home-education|archivedate=25 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they reach compulsory school age, children can be educated at [[nursery school|nursery]] if parents wish though there is only limited government funding for such places.&lt;ref name=bcouncil /&gt; Further Education is non-compulsory, and covers non-advanced education which can be taken at further (including tertiary) education colleges and Higher Education institutions (HEIs). The fifth stage, Higher Education, is study beyond [[GCE Advanced Level (United Kingdom)|A levels]] or [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTECs]] (and their equivalent) which, for most full-time students, takes place in universities and other Higher Education institutions and colleges.

The [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] (NC), established in 1988, provides a framework for education in England and Wales between the ages of 5 and 18. Though the National Curriculum is not compulsory it is followed by most state schools, but some private schools, [[Academy (English school)|academies]], [[Free school (England)|free schools]] and [[Home education in the United Kingdom|home educators]] design their own curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationotherwise.net/|title=Education Otherwise|website=www.educationotherwise.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430161710/http://www.educationotherwise.net/|archivedate=30 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland the nearest equivalent is the Curriculum for Excellence programme, and in Northern Ireland there is something known as the common curriculum.&lt;ref name=bcouncil&gt;{{cite web|title=THE EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF ENGLAND &amp; WALES, SCOTLAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/flasonline-uk-education-system.pdf|publisher=British Council|accessdate=3 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215231442/http://www.britishcouncil.org/flasonline-uk-education-system.pdf|archivedate=15 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish qualifications the National 4/5s, Highers and Advanced Highers are highly similar to the English Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced Level (A2) courses.&lt;ref name=hmc&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Education System|url=http://www.hmc.org.uk/about-hmc/projects/the-british-education-system/|publisher=HMC Projects|accessdate=3 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206231701/http://www.hmc.org.uk/about-hmc/projects/the-british-education-system/|archivedate=6 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachers==
Research by [[Education Support Partnership]] suggests that 75% of school teachers and college lecturers suffer from work related stress. Increased work pressure from marking and exam targets lead some teachers to work 12 hours a day. Many are leaving the profession due to stress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41280360 Job stress is 'overwhelming' teachers across the UK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918085049/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41280360 |date=18 September 2017 }} ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inequality==
Successful schools tend to choose pupils from high achieving backgrounds. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and challenging pupils tend to get concentrated in schools that do less well in inspections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/30/coalition-education-reform-academies-fuelling-inequality Coalition education reforms ‘fuelled inequality in schools’] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Children from prosperous backgrounds are more likely to be in good or outstanding schools while disadvantaged children are more likely to be in inadequate schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/aug/21/poorer-pupils-far-more-likely-to-be-in-failing-schools-finds-research Poorer pupils far more likely to be in failing schools, finds research] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Children with special needs who in theory have a statutory right to have their needs met, are frequently excluded from school and denied their statutory rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/oct/23/send-special-educational-needs-children-excluded-from-schools Thousands of children with special needs excluded from schools] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==
Traditionally a high-performing country in international rankings of education, the UK has stagnated in recent years in such rankings as the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) tests; in 2013 for reading and maths the country as a whole stood in the middle-rankings, a position broadly similar to three years before.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|title=UK makes no progress in Pisa tests|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-25187998|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203193305/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-25187998|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UK Scotland performed marginally better than England; both were slightly ahead of Northern Ireland and markedly ahead of Wales.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;{{cite web|title=Pisa ranks Wales' education the worst in the UK|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25196974|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203193310/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-25196974|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However these results contradict those of the education and publishing firm [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] published in 2014, which placed the UK in second place across European countries and sixth worldwide; these rankings took account of higher-education graduate rates, which may have accounted for the higher ranking than in PISA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|title=UK 'second best education in Europe'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27314075|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508153456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27314075|archivedate=8 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In 2015/16, the UK spent £3.2 billion on under-5s education, £27.7 billion on primary education, £38.2 billion on secondary education and £5.9 billion on tertiary education. In total, the UK spent £83.4 billion on education (includes £8.4 billion on other categories).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567061/SR54_2016_Tables.xlsx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425110443/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567061/SR54_2016_Tables.xlsx |archivedate=25 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|funding cuts]] very many local authorities are unable to provide the specialist education that disabled children with special needs require. [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]], [[Damian Hinds]] has been called on to provide funding for this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/councils-letter-damian-hinds-school-funding-children-special-needs-places-unions-a8403326.html Councils call on government to increase funding after thousands of children with special needs left without school places] ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
Mental health problems among youngsters in UK schools are increasing; social media, pressure from schools, [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] and gender expectations are blamed. Teachers' leaders say they feel overwhelmed and cannot cope. Sarah Hannafin of the headteachers' union NAHT, said, "There is a crisis and children are under increasing amount of pressure … Schools have a key role to play and we are doing what can, but we need more funding." Louise Regan of the [[National Education Union]] stated, "Teachers are overwhelmed by the sheer number of students showing signs of mental health problems." She added counsellor and pastoral support had been seriously reduced, though money for children's wellbeing was desperately needed, she said, "There is more focus on attainment measures rather than overall concern about the wellbeing of a child." [[Norman Lamb]] said the UK was in an "intolerable crisis", children had just one childhood and one education. "When it's gone, it's gone, and that will leave a lifetime of damage … We are failing an entire generation of young people." There were calls for a change in school culture with a switch of focus from exams to wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/31/calls-for-action-over-uks-intolerable-child-mental-health-crisis Calls for action over UK's 'intolerable' child mental health crisis] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''environmental control device''' is a form of electronic [[assistive technology]] which enables people with significant disabilities to independently access equipment in their environment e.g. home or hospital.

An environmental control controller is the device that controls the equipment – like a remote control.  You can use the controller to select a range of different options.  Each option will control a piece of equipment in a certain way – for example: play on a video recorder.

Environmental control is a general term for environmental control systems and controllers and is sometimes abbreviated as EC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actwmids.nhs.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental control devices may be assessed for and provided by the [[National Health Service]].  The team involved in the assessment for such technologies may consist of an [[occupational therapist]].&lt;ref&gt;BMJ 1997;315:409-412 (16 August)

'''EUROMOBIL''' is an interactive [[multimedia]] [[language learning]] and information programme for nine European target languages. The EUROMOBIL project was launched in 1999 with the aim to support [[Student exchange|student mobility]]. EUROMOBIL has been designed with the support of the [[European Commission]] [[SOCRATES programme|(Socrates/Lingua2)]]. EUROMOBIL can be used for self-study as well as for tutor-based language teaching sessions. With the help of the Offline programmes (with links to the web) students can prepare themselves for [[Study abroad|studying abroad]] and coping with everyday situations in the host country.

== EUROMOBIL programmes and language levels ==
Target languages are Czech, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese and Romanian. The EUROMOBIL programmes have been designed on the basis of a needs analysis and in close collaboration with students. Consequently, the programmes for different languages differ in their levels, contents and target skills according to the specific needs of exchange students in the target country.

=== Programmes for beginner level ===
*''Languages:'' Czech, Finnish, Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian
*''Aims:'' information about target language and country, preparation for studying abroad and tools for coping with everyday situations
*''Country-specific contents:'' studies, services, leisure, library, (Finnish programme), travel book (Hungarian programme)
*''Activities:'' training in vocabulary and phrases, listening and reading comprehension, writing and speaking (Finnish programme), discussion exercises at the EUROMOBIL forum
*English as supportive language

=== Programmes for advanced language learners ===
*''Languages:'' English, French, German (activities for beginner and intermediate language learners in the French programme)
*''Aims:'' tools for following university courses  in the language of the country with ease
*''Country-specific contents:'' study advice, lecture, seminar, exam (German and English programme); arrival at university, during your stay, exams and departure (French programme)
*''Activities:'' listening comprehension, training in vocabulary and interaction strategies, evaluation of oral communication and discussion (at the EUROMOBIL forum), writing and speaking
*Unilingual

Programmes for beginner level include a variety of audio and short video recordings. The activities for advanced language learners are based on authentic and semi-authentic video recordings that focus on the training of oral communication skills.

The '''First Kindergarten''' in [[Watertown, Wisconsin]] is the building that housed the first [[kindergarten]] in the [[United States]], opened in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=35450|title=First Kindergarten|publisher=Historical Marker Database.org|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landmarkhunter.com/131961-first-kindergarten/|title=First Kindergarten|publisher=Landmark Hunter.com|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whs_nrhp/&gt; for its significance to the history of education.&lt;ref name=whs_hi&gt;{{cite web|title=First Kindergarten|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Property/HI7126|work=Architecture and History Inventory|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Margarethe Schurz|Margarethe Schurz (née Meyer)]] was born in [[Hamburg, Germany]], and at age sixteen listened to a series of lectures from the German educator [[Friedrich Froebel]].&lt;ref name=whs_nrhp/&gt; In that time and place, young children were often viewed as little beasts to be tamed so that they could become productive workers. Froebel instead saw natural curiosity in children, which he encouraged with play, [[Froebel gifts|carefully chosen toys]], music, stories, and nature study. He compared children to plants and a teacher to the gardener who helps them grow and bloom - hence the "garden of children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Passe|first1=Angele Sancho|title=Kindergarten in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Redleaf Press|location=St. Paul, MN|page=42|url=http://www.redleafpress.org/assets/clientdocs/social_media/IsEverybodyReadyForKindergarten.pdf|accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Margarethe Schurz.jpg|thumb|upright|Margarethe Meyer Schurz]]
Margarethe's family was prosperous and socially progressive, favoring the unification of the many small German states into one democratic nation. After losing in the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|revolutions of 1848-49]], some of the family left Germany. In London, Margarethe's sister started a kindergarten, and Margarethe helped, gaining experience.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; There she married [[Carl Schurz]], a fellow exile who fled Germany after serving as an officer on the losing side in the revolutions.&lt;ref name=miss_hist/&gt; They immigrated to the U.S. in 1852, and in 1856 moved to Watertown.&lt;ref name=jwa&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Susan|title=Margarethe Meyer Schurz|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/schurz-margarethe-meyer|website=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time Margarethe had a three-year-old daughter Agathe, and she started a kindergarten in her home for her daughter and four cousins,&lt;ref name=whs_nrhp&gt;{{cite web|title=First Kindergarten|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/NationalRegister/NR167|work=National or State Register|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducting classes in [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=Watertown_hist/&gt; Soon others wanted the same for their children, so she expanded and moved her kindergarten to a small building in town. That building is the subject of this article, and it housed the first kindergarten in the U.S.&lt;ref name=whs_hi/&gt; Margarethe directed the kindergarten until 1858, when the Schurzes moved to Milwaukee.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; Carl became a lawyer, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], a key supporter of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] among German-Americans, a [[Major general#United States|Major General]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;ref name=miss_hist&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnett|first1=Todd|title=Carl Schurz (1829-1906)|url=http://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/s/schurz/|website=Historic Missourians|publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri|accessdate=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Schurzes left, the Watertown kindergarten operated sporadically until [[World War I|WWI]], when it closed due to suspicion of all things German.&lt;ref name=jwa/&gt; The school building is a simple 1.5 stories with [[Cornice#Box cornice|boxed cornices]] and clapboard siding, 18 by 24 feet. In the years after it was a school, it served various uses:&lt;ref name=nrhp_nom/&gt; cigar factory, fish store, and religious book store.&lt;ref name=Watertown_hist&gt;{{cite web|title=America's First Kindergarten|url=http://www.watertownhistory.org/articles/kindergardenfirst.htm|website=History of Watertown, Wisconsin|publisher=Watertown Historical Society|accessdate=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was a store, the front was substantially altered.  In 1956 it was threatened with demolition, and the Watertown Historical Society moved the structure from its original location on North Second St. to its current site alongside the [[Octagon House (Watertown, Wisconsin)|Octagon House]] and began to restore it as the kindergarten building. The building now serves as a [[museum]].&lt;ref name=nrhp_nom&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=72000055}}|title=NRHP Inventory/Nomination: First Kindergarten|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=Donald N. Anderson|date=1971-10-15|accessdate=2017-10-23}} With {{NRHP url|id=72000055|photos=y|title=one photo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schurz home, in which Margarethe began her kindergarten, burned and no longer exists, so this schoolhouse is the best representative of that first kindergarten. Because this building was moved from its original location and substantially changed, the National Register doesn't consider it of great architectural significance. It does consider it significant to the history of education at a ''national'' level, because Schurz's school in Watertown was the first kindergarten in the U.S.&lt;ref name=whs_hi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">'''Gifted pull-outs''' (also called "send-out" or "resource" programs) are an educational approach in which gifted students are removed (or "pulled-out") from a heterogeneous (mixed-ability) classroom to spend a portion of their time with academic peers.  Pull-outs tend to meet one to two hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''Re-forming Gifted Education'' (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The students meet with a teacher to engage in enrichment or extension activities that may or may not be related to the curriculum being taught in the regular classroom. Pull-out teachers in some states are not required to have any formal background in gifted education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/StatePolicy.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Research has suggested that there are benefits to grouping gifted children together for the majority of the school day,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., ''The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner'', (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991 ) p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the limited meeting times and durations of gifted pull-out groups may have limited benefits for the gifted children. A 1993 U.S. Government report found up to 72% of school districts using the pull-out approach despite this method being generally unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;"Part II. The Current Status of Education for the Nation's Most Talented Students," in ''National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent (online). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  This lack of effectiveness has been echoed in more recent literature.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Jan and Bob, with Vanderkam, Laura (Simon &amp; Schuster Paperbacks, NY, NY, 2004) ''Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Borland (2003) concludes that pull-out programming is generally unproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Borland, James, ed., "The Death of Giftedness", ''Rethinking Gifted Education'' (New York: Teachers College Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, this is because pull-outs are composed of a hodge-podge of critical thinking, logic puzzles, and random subjects (like mythology) which are unlikely to result in any significant academic progress because they are not tied directly to the core curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  Winebrenner (2001) recommends those same ineffective practices, including creative problem solving, chess, logic puzzles, and academic competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, Susan, Teaching Gifted Kids in the Regular Classroom (Free Spirit Publishing, Inc, Minneapolis, MN, 2001), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oddly, Winebrenner also recommends that students selected for pull-out should be those who are capable in the areas the pull-out will address.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is exactly the opposite of the approach recommended by most gifted literature, which argues for matching the instruction ''to the student,'' not vice versa.  Jan and Bob Davidson of the [[Davidson Institute for Talent Development]] criticize pull-outs in their book, ''Genius Denied: How to Stop Wasting Our Brightest Young Minds.''  On page 47, they say, "Most pull-out programs provide little beyond a creative outlet--and since districts that offer such programs claim they are helping gifted children when they aren't, they are often worse than no programs at all." Matthews and Foster also criticize pull-out gifted classes. They claim that the learning needs of advanced students are too important to be restricted to the day(s) on which their gifted class is scheduled. Furthermore, as they also point out, students can be penalized for missing their regular class (for example, by missing a class field trip), and sometimes teachers resent the pull-out teacher taking the strongest students out of their class. And perhaps most worrisome, the work in withdrawal gifted classes is often not differentiated for learning needs or properly integrated into children’s other studies.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, D. and Foster, J. (2009). ''[http://beyondintelligence.net/books/being-smart/ Being Smart about Gifted Education]''. &lt;/ref&gt; However, pull-out programs, when properly implemented, can be used to complement [[cluster grouping]]&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, Susan, and Devlin, Barbara, ''Cluster Grouping Fact Sheet: How to Provide Full-Time Services for Gifted Students on Limited Budgets''&lt;/ref&gt; and other in-class [[differentiated instruction|differentiation]].

==Success Factors/Recommendations==
* The content covered in gifted pull-outs should be academically beyond the ability of the students' regular classmates.  If other students could do the work, they should be allowed to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The regular class should be informed that pull-out participation does not make another student a better person.  Similarly, participants should be discouraged from bragging.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular classroom teachers should not schedule tests, special events, or new topics during the pull-out.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pull-out students can prove their mastery of the regular classroom material by answering a small subset of the problems containing the most challenging material.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A single, larger block of time is preferable to two or more smaller blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The gifted specialist needs time to communicate with other teachers to map the extension and enrichment work to the core curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J., Daniel, N., &amp; Boston, B., (1985). ''Educating able learners: Programs and promising practices.'' Austin, TX: University of Texas&lt;/ref&gt;  Research shows that such systematic extension can result in substantial academic gains.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, V.L., Feldhusen, J.F., &amp; Asher, J.W. (1991).  Meta-analyses and review of research on pull-out programs in gifted education.  ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 35'', pp. 92-98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar gains in critical and creative thinking can be made in annual programs for those topics.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 90-minute one-size-fits-all solution for every gifted child is inappropriate. Pull-outs must be part of a larger context including in-class [[differentiated instruction|differentiation]], [[independent study]], subject and whole-grade [[Academic acceleration|acceleration]] (grade skipping), [[Distance education|distance learning]], [[dual enrollment]], [[Advanced Placement|AP]] courses, and [[mentorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Davidsons, pp. 164-165.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gifted specialist should work with the regular classroom teacher to design these accommodations.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pull-outs should encourage struggling to learn, facing challenges, and learning from mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assigning pull-out homework is advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pull-outs are an effective venue for working on social and emotional issues and interpersonal skill deficits encountered by gifted children.&lt;ref&gt;Winebrenner, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pull-outs are generally more successful in elementary school because middle and high school scheduling becomes problematic and the higher grades typically offer more options for advanced work and extracurriculars than the lower grades.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==
* Pull-outs may be perceived erroneously by parents, teachers, and administrators as the entire solution to gifted education, while they should actually play a supplementary role to daily differentiated work in the regular classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, ''Re-forming...'', p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Children are often expected to make up work that was missed during pull-out,&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; which frequently is not challenging to them to begin with.
* Communication with the regular classroom teacher can break down.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular educators may resent the specialist and the program.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The pull-out curriculum may be viewed as ''fluff,''&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps justifiably so.
* Regular educators may resent the missing of important classwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Regular educators may feel that they could teach the gifted children as well as the specialist.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase|title=i2hub}}
'''i2hub''' was a [[peer-to-peer]] file sharing service and [[Computer software|program]] designed and intended primarily for use by university and college students. 

==History==
The program was created by [[Wayne Chang]], a student at [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts, Amherst]].&lt;ref name="dailyfree1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyfreepress.com/2.5500/wayne-s-world-1.926414|title=Wayne's World|author=Anita Davis|date=2005-10-21|publisher=The Daily Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

i2hub used [[Internet2]], which was a special network that connected universities around the world. It allowed faster data transfer rates than typical Internet connections. Because of this, download speeds through i2hub were usually much faster than through other [[peer-to-peer networks]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The service was launched in March 2004 and ultimately expanded to over 400 universities and colleges both in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref name="cnet1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNET News|url=http://news.cnet.com/File-swapping-gets-supercharged-on-student-network/2100-1027_3-5202107.html|date=2004-04-29| title=File-swapping gets supercharged on student network|author=John Borland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="furdlog1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=MIT FurdLog|url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/?p=2439|date=2004-08-19| title=The Rise of i2hub|author=Frank Field}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj2"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/0,,SB108915422509256693,00?mod=mm_hs_entertainment|date=2004-07-07| title=New on Campus: Faster Network For File-Sharers|author=Hope Glassberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chron1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Chronicle|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Students-Use-Internet2-s/8726|date=2004-05-14| title=Students Use Internet2's High-Speed Research Network to Swap Songs and Movies|author=Brock Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Competition from Facebook==
In August 2004, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], [[Andrew McCollum]], [[Adam D'Angelo]], and [[Sean Parker]] of Facebook launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called [[Wirehog]].&lt;ref name=mdodoo1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Martey Dodoo|url=http://www.marteydodoo.com/2004/08/16/wirehog/|date=2004-08-16| title=Wirehog?|author=Martey Dodoo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hcrimson1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Harvard Crimson|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/8/13/zuckerberg-programs-new-website-having-seemingly/|date=2004-08-13| title=Zuckerberg Programs New Website|author=Alan J. Tabak}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traction was low compared to i2hub, and Facebook ultimately shut it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/26/wirehog/|title=Wirehog, Zuckerberg's Side Project That Almost Killed Facebook – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Winklevoss Chang Group==
As its user-base expanded, it attracted the attention of [[ConnectU]]. A partnership allegedly formed between i2hub and ConnectU.  The partnership, called The Winklevoss Chang Group, jointly advertised their properties through bus advertisements as well as press releases.  i2hub integrated its popular software with ConnectU's website, as part of the partnership.  The team also jointly launched several projects and initiatives, including:&lt;ref name=gesmer1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/25379721/Chang-v-Winklevoss-Complaint|date=2010-01-18| title=Chang v.

* Jungalu.com, an internet-based book exchange
* StallScribbles.com, an online "anonymous confessions" board
* Digital Flyers, a portal for purchasing advertisements to be placed on the various WCG websites and on i2hub
* ConnectHi (also known as ConnectHigh and theyearbook.org), an effort to penetrate the high school social networking market
* ConnectGroups, an initiative to provide clubs and organizations with a means for their members to communicate online with each other about their organizations
* The Winklevoss Chang Representative Program, a sales representative program which WCG used to establish a presence on college campuses and to promote ConnectU and the other WCG properties
* The Rep Center, an internet-based portal, accessible through ConnectU.com, providing a centralized location for the representatives of The Winklevoss Chang Representative Program to communicate and earn points (redeemable for prizes) by recruiting and signing up new users for all of WCG's properties
* Social Butterfly, a feature added to ConnectU to enable users to consolidate their accounts at various social networking sites, such as Facebook, and make that information accessible through ConnectU

==Legal pressure==
The network was criticized by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for its ability to share copyrighted materials through a faster medium. On October 5, 2004, [[Cary Sherman]], the president of the RIAA, talked about i2hub in a statement to the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=house1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United States House of Representatives|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/sherman100504.htm|date=2004-10-05|title=STATEMENT OF CARY SHERMAN, PRESIDENT, RECORDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, BEFORE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COURTS, THE INTERNET, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) PIRACY ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES: AN UPDATE|author=Cary Sherman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806070027/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/sherman100504.htm|archivedate=2010-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2005, the RIAA announced it was suing 405 i2hub users, students at 18 colleges and universities, for [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref name=riaa1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=RIAA|url=https://www.riaa.com/newsitem.php?news_year_filter=2005&amp;resultpage=9&amp;id=C7FEB5DE-3869-77B7-2206-FD6E197C0B69l|date=2005-04-12| title=RIAA TARGETS NEW PIRACY EPIDEMIC ON SPECIAL HIGH-SPEED CAMPUS NETWORK|author=Recording Industry Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2005, the [[United States House of Representatives]] had another hearing to discuss i2hub.&lt;ref name=house2&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United States House of Representatives|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju23572.000/hju23572_0.htm|date=2005-09-22| title=REDUCING PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) PIRACY ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES: A PROGRESS UPDATE|author1=Subcommittee on Courts |author2=the Internet |author3=Intellectual Property }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 14, 2005, i2hub was shut down with the message "RIP 11/14/2005. It was a good run. Forced to shut down by the industry."&lt;ref name=cnet2&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNET News|url=http://news.cnet.com/Supercharged-college-P2P-network-closes/2100-1027_3-5952060.html|date=2005-11-04| title=Supercharged college P2P network closes|author=John Borland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slyck1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Slyck|url=http://www.slyck.com/story994_i2hub_Shuts_Down|date=2005-11-15| title=i2hub Shuts Down|author=Thomas Mennecke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allbiz1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=All Business|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4382006-1.html|date=2005-11-15| title=File-Trading Network i2Hub Shuts Down|author=Antony Bruno}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2006, the ''Wall Street Journal''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB113751573975848680-4Gpxpk1YN_MDTFwowDU5rHUsleM_20070117.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that UMASS students that were sued for using i2hub wanted founder Wayne Chang to pay for their lawsuits.  Wayne Chang and his attorney, Charles Baker, who also represented StreamCast Networks (makers of the [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] P2P software), responded saying that i2hub has no liability in the matter and is protected by the [[EULA]].  The lawsuit was never filed by the UMASS students.&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/public/article/SB113751573975848680-4Gpxpk1YN_MDTFwowDU5rHUsleM_20070117.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top|date=2006-01-17| title=Students Want File-Sharing Site To Pay for RIAA Settlements|author=Vauhini Vara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facebook lawsuits==
ConnectU had sued Facebook in early 2004.&lt;ref name=crimson2&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/9/13/lawsuit-threatens-to-close-facebook-mark/|date=2004-09-13| title=Lawsuit Threatens To Close Facebook|author=Timothy J. McGinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook countersued in regards to the team's Social Butterfly project, and named among the defendants ConnectU, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], [[Divya Narendra]], and [[Wayne Chang]].&lt;ref name=justia1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Justia|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/california/candce/5:2007cv01389/189975/|date=2007-03-09| title=The Facebook, Inc. v.

If the settlement were adjusted to match, the total value would be over $466 million.&lt;ref name=venturebeat2 &gt;{{cite news|publisher=VentureBeat|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/05/19/facebook-connectu-securities-fraud/|date=May 19, 2010|author=Owen Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Winklevoss Chang Group lawsuit==
On December 21, 2009, i2hub founder [[Wayne Chang]] and The i2hub Organization launched a lawsuit against ConnectU and its founders, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], seeking 50% of the settlement. The complaint says&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/25379721/Chang-v-Winklevoss-Complaint Chang v. Winklevoss Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Winklevosses and Howard Winklevoss filed [a] patent application, U.S. Patent Application No 20060212395, on or around March 15, 2005, but did not list Chang as a co-inventor."  It also states "Through this litigation, Chang asserts his ownership interest in The Winklevoss Chang Group and [[ConnectU]], including the settlement proceeds."&lt;ref name="cnet3"/&gt;  Lee Gesmer (of prominent law firm Gesmer Updegrove, LLP) posted the [https://www.scribd.com/doc/25379721/Chang-v-Winklevoss-Complaint detailed 33-page complaint] online.&lt;ref name="gesmer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=masslawblog1&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Mass Law Blog|url=http://masslawblog.com/business-lit-session/connectu-and-facebook-goes-on-forever/|date=2010-01-18| title=The Road Goes on Forever, But the Lawsuits Never End: ConnectU, Facebook, Their Entourages|author=Lee Gesmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2011, Judge Peter Lauriat made a ruling against the Winklevosses. Chang's case against them could proceed. The Winklevosses had argued that the court lacks jurisdiction because the settlement with Facebook has not been distributed and therefore Chang hasn't suffered any injury. Judge Lauriat wrote, "The flaw in this argument is that defendants appear to conflate loss of the settlement proceed with loss of rights. Chang alleges that he has received nothing in return for the substantial benefits he provided to ConnectU, including the value of his work, as well as i2hub's users and goodwill." Lauriat also wrote that, although Chang's claims to the settlement are "too speculative to confer standing, his claims with respect to an ownership in ConnectU are not. They constitute an injury separate and distinct from his possible share of the settlement proceeds. The court concludes that Chang has plead sufficient facts to confer standing with respect to his claims against the Winklevoss defendants."&lt;ref name=hp051311&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/13/wayne-chang-winklevoss-twins-facebook-settlement_n_861484.html|date=2011-05-13|title=Wayne Chang's Suit Against Winklevoss Twins Can Proceed, Judge Rules|author=Bianca Bosker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=law05132011&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The National Law Journal|date=2011-05-13|title=Winklevoss Twins Loses Again in Court|author=Sheri Qualters|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202493848503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox051311&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/05/13/winklevoss-twins-sued-facebook-fortunes/|publisher=Fox News|date=2011-05-13|title=Winklevoss Twins Sued For Part Of Their Facebook Fortunes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allfacebook051311&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allfacebook.com/developer-sues-winklevoss-twins-everybody-cheers-2011-05 |publisher=AllFacebook |date=2011-05-13 |author=Nick O'Neill |title=Developer Sues Winklevoss Twins, Everybody Cheers |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108050044/http://www.allfacebook.com/developer-sues-winklevoss-twins-everybody-cheers-2011-05 |archivedate=2012-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcmag051311&gt;{{cite news|publisher=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2385383,00.asp|date=2011-05-13|author=Chloe Albanesius|title=Winklevoss Twins Face Lawsuit Over Facebook Funds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg051311&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bloomberg|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-13/winklevoss-twins-face-suit-over-failed-alliance.html|author=Sophia Pearson|date=2011-05-13|title=Winklevoss Twins Face Suit Over Failed Alliance, Judge Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''Institutional research''' is a broad category of work done at schools, colleges and universities to inform campus decision-making and planning in areas such as admissions, financial aid, curriculum assessment, enrollment management, staffing, student life, finance, facilities, athletics, and alumni relations.

Institutional researchers collect, analyze, report, and warehouse quantitative and qualitative data about their institution's students, faculty, staff, curriculum, course offerings, and learning outcomes. They are involved in collecting and reporting information to government bodies (for example, in the USA, the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]]), to the public (e.g., [[Common Data Set]], the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]]'s  [http://www.ucan-network.org/ University-College Accountability Network]), and various college guide publishers (e.g., [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] and [[College Board]]). On occasion, institutional researchers share data with one another to compare their own practices and outcomes against those of similar institutions. Institutional research is the source of much of the information provided to regional and national accreditation bodies to document how institutions fulfill the standards for accreditation.

In addition to reporting, institutional researchers often engage in data analysis, ranging from simply testing whether differences in reported data are statistically significant to developing and using causal and predictive statistical models.  Such models are often used in support of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and [[Strategic Enrollment Management|strategic enrollment management]].

== Becoming an Institutional Researcher ==
Due to the need to provide data to the federal government and other entities, nearly every post-secondary institution has offices that fulfill the institutional research function. At some colleges and universities this function is centralized in a single office of institutional research, while at others it is more de-centralized. There is no single academic degree that qualifies one to be an institutional researcher, but suggested strengths include a knowledge of [[statistics]], [[research methods]] (e.g., [[survey research]] and [[focus groups]]), and computer-based reporting and data visualization tools (e.g., [[SPSS]], [[SAS System|SAS]], [[R_(programming_language)|R]], [[STATA]], [[Microsoft Access]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[MicroStrategy]], and [[SQL]]). Other important assets are strong written and oral communications skills, attention to detail, and knowledge about how institutions of higher education operate. Several American universities offer graduate certificate programs in institutional research,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airweb.org/Careers/GraduateEducation/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; including Ball State University, Florida State University, Humboldt State University,&lt;ref&gt;http://humboldt.edu/dee/ircertificate/&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota State University, Penn State University, Indiana University, University of Missouri, University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin - Stout &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwstout.edu/programs/pdc/es.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;, and the University of California San Diego Extension. &lt;ref&gt;https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/institutional-research,&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2676">'''James Greenwood''' (c.1683 – 1737) was an English [[Linguist|grammarian]].

==Life==
Greenwood was for some time usher to Benjamin Morland (1657-?) at [[Hackney Academy]], but soon after 1711 opened a boarding-school at [[Woodford, Essex]]. At midsummer 1721, when Morland became [[High Master (academic)|high-master]], he was appointed surmaster of [[St. Paul's School, London]], a post which he held until his death on 12 September 1737.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gentleman's Magazine]]; 1737, p. 574&lt;/ref&gt; He left a widow, Susannah.

==Works==
He is mostly known as the author of ''An Essay towards a practical English Grammar. Describing the Genius and Nature of the English Tongue'', &amp;c., 12mo, London, 1711 ; 2nd edit. 1722; 3rd edit. 1729; 5th edit. 1753 (reprinted by the [[University of Michigan Library]], 2009). It received the praises of Andrew Ross, Professor of Humanity at the [[University of Glasgow]], Dr. [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], [[John Chamberlayne]], and [[Isaac Watts]], who in his ''Art of Reading and Writing English'' considered that Greenwood had shown in his book "the deep Knowledge, without the haughty Airs of a Critick". At Watts's suggestion Greenwood afterwards published an abridgment under the title of ''The Royal English Grammar'', which he dedicated to the [[Caroline of Ansbach|Princess of Wales]]; the fourth edition of this appeared in 1750, an eighth in 1770.

The appearance of two other English grammars by John Brightland (d. 1717) and [[Michael Mattaire]] at about the same time called forth an anonymous attack on all three books, entitled ''Bellum Grammatical; or the Grammatical Battel Royal. In Reflections on the three English Grammars publish'd in about a year last past'', 8vo, London, 1712.

Greenwood also wrote ''The London Vocabulary, English and Latin: put into a new Method proper to acquaint the Learner with Things, as well as Pure Latin Words. Adorn'd with Twenty Six Pictures'', &amp;c., 3rd edition, 12mo, London 1713 (many editions, both English and American). It is, however, nothing more than an abridgment of [[Comenius|Jan Amos Komensky]]'s ''Orbis Pictura''. Greenwood's last work was ''The Virgin Muse. Being a Collection of Poems from our most celebrated English Poets … To which are added some Copies of Verses never before printed; with notes'' &amp;c., 12mo, London, 1717; 2nd edition, 1722. It does not appear that Greenwood himself was a contributor.

== History ==
''Boys' and Girls' Bureau of the Eastern States League'' was founded in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in 1919 to help educate young people moving from rural America to the country's booming cities about the means of production and free enterprise. The following year, the organization's name was changed to the Junior Achievement Bureau. The name was modified in 1926 to Junior Achievement, Inc.&lt;ref name=IU&gt;{{cite web|title=Junior Achievement Records, 1916-2002, Ruth Lilly Special Collections &amp; Archives|url=http://www.ulib.iupui.edu/special/collections/philanthropy/mss048|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II, the organization grew from a regional into a national organization.&lt;ref name=francomano&gt;{{cite book|last=Francomano|first=Joe|title=Junior Achievement: A History|year=1988|publisher=Junior Achievement Inc.|location=Colorado Springs, CO|pages=|url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/aboutja/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, JA began its growth into an international organization.&lt;ref name=francomano/&gt;

For more than 50 years, the organization was known mostly for the JA Company Program, an after-school program through which students form companies, sell stocks, produce and market a product, and sell it in their communities and globally. The student companies are mentored by volunteer advisers from the business and tech communities. In 1975, Junior Achievement introduced its first in-school program, Project Business, featuring volunteers from the local business community teaching middle school students about business and personal finance.&lt;ref name=francomano/&gt;

Today, JA Worldwide is one of the world's largest organization youth-serving organizations, dedicated to giving young people the knowledge and skills they need for employment and entrepreneurship. JA programs are delivered by corporate and community volunteers and provide relevant, hands-on experiences that give students knowledge and skills in financial literacy, work readiness, and entrepreneurship. JA annually reaches more than 10 million students in more than 100 countries around the world. Programs are delivered by more than 450,000 JA volunteers.&lt;ref name="JA Worldwide18"&gt;{{cite web|title=JA Worldwide Locations|url=https://www.jaworldwide.org/locations/

'''Kathleen Lyttelton''' (born '''Mary Kathleen Clive'''), 1856{{snd}}12 January 1907, was a women's activist, editor and writer. She devoted much of her life to fighting for women's suffrage and for the improvement of women's lives in general.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; After a period of 11 years in Cambridge, as wife of [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College]]'s first Master [[Arthur Lyttelton]], she concentrated on her writing and women's committee work. In her 1901 book ''Women and Their Work'' she argued that education for women was "essential to their true progress", with the franchise being a necessary part of that education. 

==Early life==

Kathleen was born in 1856. Her father was the judge and Liberal politician [[George Clive (Liberal politician)|George Clive]], her mother Ann Sybella Martha Farquhar.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/50712 |title=Lyttelton [née Clive], Mary Kathleen (1856–1907), women's activist |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peerage"/&gt;

In spite of the initial misgivings of her father, in 1880 she married the Hon [[Arthur Lyttelton]],{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}} then a tutor at [[Keble College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="TimesObit"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/archive/article/1907-01-15/9/7.html#start%3D1906-12-01%26end%3D1908-09-29%26terms%3Darthur%20lyttelton%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/arthur+lyttelton/w:1906-12-01%7E1908-09-29/o:date/1%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/arthur+lyttelton/w:1906-12-01%7E1908-09-29/o:date/9%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/arthur+lyttelton/w:1906-12-01%7E1908-09-29/o:date/11 |title=Obituary |date=15 January 1907 |work=The Times |access-date=27 November 2018 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately the marriage proved strong and the couple went on to have three children: Margaret Lucy (1882){{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}}, Archer Geoffrey (1884){{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}}, and Stephen Clive (1887){{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}}.&lt;ref name="peerage"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p1436.htm#i14351 |editor1-last=Mosley |editor1-first=Charles |title=Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage |edition=107th |volume=1 |location=[[Wilmington, Delaware]] |publisher=Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd |year=2003 |page=839}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Cambridge==

In 1882 Kathleen and Arthur took up residence in the newly-founded [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]], where Arthur had been appointed Master-designate. When they moved in, the college was still a building site with only the West front completed. Initially, they made do with a suite of adapted student rooms until the Master's Lodge was built.{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}}

Kathleen founded The Cambridge Association For Women's Suffrage (CAWS) along with [[Millicent Fawcett]] in 1884,{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}} and Fawcett encouraged her to join the Executive of The Central Society For Women’s Suffrage.{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}. She was also active with the Cambridge Women's Refuge, helping to raise funds for what would become the Cambridge Association for the Care of Girls which aimed to help girls of the streets and to give them practical help with domestic economy and literacy.{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

In 1890, with her close friend [[Louise Creighton]], Kathleen founded the Cambridge Ladies Dining Society, a group of believers in women's education who actively campaigned for the University to grant degrees to women; most were also strong supporters of female suffrage. Members of the society included [[Caroline Jebb]], [[Eleanor Sidgwick]], [[Mary Augusta Ward]], and [[Mary Paley Marshall]].{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

During their years at Selwyn, the Lyttletons also helped develop the College Music Society, and they supported the Boat Club (whose colours were chosen by Kathleen).{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=60}}

==Lancashire==
In 1893 after 11 years in Cambridge, Arthur left Selwyn to take up the post of [[vicar]] of [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] Parish Church in [[Lancashire]]. In 1895, along with Arthur, she founded and later became chair of the executive committee of the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade Union Council, an organisation whose aim was to investigate working conditions and organise low-paid workers into unions. Members of the council included [[Christabel Pankhurst]] and [[CP Scott]].{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

She launched the Eccles branch of the [[Co-operative Women's Guild|Cooperative Women's Guild]], and became a vice president of the [[National Council of Women of Great Britain|National Union of Women Workers]], as well as joining the committee of the Manchester National Society for Women's Suffrage. As an active [[Board of guardians|Poor Law Guardian]], she complained that [[Manchester]] city officials "winked at the pollution of the atmosphere".{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

Kathleen's course of lectures for the Manchester School of Domestic Economy entitled ''Common Sense For Housewives: Girls’ Life after Leaving School'' was published by the school in 1896.&lt;ref name="BLcat002297038"/&gt;{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

==Hampshire==

After Arthur was appointed [[Suffragan bishop|Suffragan Bishop]] of [[Southampton]] in 1898 the family moved back south,{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}} to [[Petersfield|Petersfield, Hampsire]].

Kathleen was elected president of the National Union of Women's Workers, and she chaired their conference in [[Brighton]] in 1900.{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

Kathleen's book ''Women and Their Work,''&lt;ref name="BLcat002297040"/&gt; published in 1901, was permeated with her deep religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; In it, she insisted on the importance of education for women and the necessity of ‘commitment’ and ‘conviction’; she argued that while the difficult lives of working class women would naturally lead to the formation of definite opinions, the sheltered, easy lives of middle and upper-class women did not naturally lead to such ‘conviction’. She wrote that "the withholding of the franchise is very prejudicial to the right development of women, and that the education given by the vote is essential to their true progress",&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; foreseeing that “the bewilderment will pass as the years go on, and the very magnitude of the task will in time arise and awaken those women who are as yet indifferent to it".{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=61}}

Following Arthur's death in February 1903, Kathleen edited a collection of his essays entitled ''Modern Poets of Faith, Doubt and Paganism'' (1904).&lt;ref name="BLcat002296898" /&gt;{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=62}}

In June 1903 she became editor of the women's section of an Anglican weekly publication called ''[[The Guardian (Anglican newspaper)|The Guardian]]'', in which role she was the first to review and publish the early writings of Virginia Stephen (later [[Virginia Woolf]]). Virginia was initially hesitant and grateful, but by late 1905 had become sufficiently confident to complain that Mrs L "sticks her broad thumb into the middle of my sentences and improves the moral tone".{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=62}}

==London==

Kathleen moved to a house in [[Gower Street, London|Gower Street]], London, near that of [[Millicent Fawcett]] with whom she published ''Why Women Want the Vote'' in 1906.{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=62}}
==Death==

Kathleen died at the age of 51 on 12 January 1907, at the Clives’ family seat at at Perrystone Court, [[Herefordshire]].&lt;ref name="TimesObit"/&gt; Her obituary in [[The Times]]  made no mention of her suffrage and TUC work, and concentrated on her role as a scholarly translator, "a considerable student of literature" and a "diligent critic”.&lt;ref name="TimesObit"/&gt;{{sfn|Chothia|2018|p=62}} There were also obituaries in ''The Englishwoman's Review''&lt;ref name="EWR"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3vDiDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT99&amp;lpg=PT99&amp;dq=%22Mrs+Arthur+Lyttelton%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ngLdnvd_s&amp;sig=kxyo-Xok7zNMiRYrV35EHBEASv8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi3uoTYxPXeAhUpJ8AKHXk1BpM4ChDoATAEegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mrs%20Arthur%20Lyttelton%22&amp;f=false |title=Sorrowful News.

The first of the International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs) was held in [[Romania]] in 1959. The oldest of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s, the [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] has since been held annually, except in 1980. That year the competition initially planned to hold in [[Mongolia]] was canceled due to soviet invasion of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Mongolia/&gt; Because the competition was initially founded for [[Eastern Europe]]an countries participating in the [[Warsaw Pact]], under the influence of the [[Eastern Bloc]],&lt;ref name="more"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imo.wolfram.com/morefacts.html|title=More IMO Facts|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; the earlier IMOs were hosted only in Eastern European countries, gradually spreading to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sms.math.nus.edu.sg/Simo/Simo.aspx|title=Singapore International Mathematical Olympiad (SIMO) Home Page|accessdate=2008-02-04|publisher=Singapore Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs and the exact dates when they took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.medallia.com/2006/07/norwegian_students_in_internat.html|title=Norwegian Students in International Mathematical Olympiad|accessdate=2008-03-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020100605/http://blog.medallia.com/2006/07/norwegian_students_in_internat.html|archivedate=2006-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first IMO was held in [[Romania]] in 1959. Seven countries entered &amp;ndash; [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], Romania and the [[Soviet Union]] &amp;ndash; with the hosts finishing as the top-ranked nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=1959|title=1st IMO 1959|accessdate=2011-06-20|publisher=International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of participating countries has since risen: 14 countries took part in 1969, 50 in 1989, and 104 in 2009.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/organizers.aspx|title=Timeline|accessdate=2011-06-20|publisher=International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]] is the only country to have been caught cheating, resulting in its disqualification at the 32nd IMO in 1991 and the 51st IMO in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=PRK|title=International Mathematical Olympiad: Democratic People's Republic of Korea|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, [[Google]] gave €1 million to the IMO organization to help cover the costs of the events from 2011–2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2011/01/giving-young-mathematicians-chance-to.html Google Europe Blog: Giving young mathematicians the chance to shine].

In 2011, [[Foreign Policy Magazine]] in Spanish named him the most influential intellectual of Latin America and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Los 10 nuevos rostros del pensiamento iberoamericano|url=http://www.fp-es.org/los-10-nuevos-rostros-del-pensamiento-iberoamericano|accessdate=14 August 2015|work=FP|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529100941/http://www.fp-es.org/los-10-nuevos-rostros-del-pensamiento-iberoamericano|archivedate=29 May 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Ahn's early research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luis von Ahn|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=luis+von+ahn|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was in the field of [[cryptography]]. With Nicholas J. Hopper and [[John Langford (computer scientist)|John Langford]], he was the first to provide rigorous definitions of [[steganography]] and to prove that private-key steganography is possible.

In 2000, he did early pioneering work with [[Manuel Blum]] on CAPTCHAs,&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis; Blum, Manuel; Hopper, Nicholas J.; Langford, John (May 2003). "CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security". Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; computer-generated tests that humans are routinely able to pass but that computers have not yet mastered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | last2 = Blum | first2 = M. | last3 = Langford | first3 = J. | doi = 10.1145/966389.966390 | title = Telling humans and computers apart automatically | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 56–60 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices are used by web sites to prevent automated programs, or bots, from perpetrating large-scale abuse, such as automatically registering for large numbers of accounts or purchasing huge numbers of tickets for resale by scalpers. CAPTCHAs brought von Ahn his first widespread fame among the general public due to their coverage in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' and on the [[Discovery Channel]], [[NOVA scienceNOW]], and other mainstream outlets.

Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis, completed in 2005, was the first publication to use the term "[[Human-based computation|human computation]]" that he had coined, referring to methods that combine human brainpower with computers to solve problems that neither could solve alone. Von Ahn's Ph.D. thesis is also the first work on [[Game with a purpose|Games With A Purpose]], or GWAPs, which are games played by humans that produce useful computation as a side effect. The most famous example is the [[ESP Game]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | last2 = Dabbish | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1145/985692.985733 | chapter = Labeling images with a computer game | title = Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '04 | pages = 319–326 | year = 2004 | isbn = 1581137028 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; an online game&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Von Ahn | first1 = L. | title = Games with a Purpose | doi = 10.1109/MC.2006.196 | journal = Computer | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 92–94 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which two randomly paired people are simultaneously shown the same picture, with no way to communicate. Each then lists a number of words or phrases that describe the picture within a time limit, and are rewarded with points for a match. This match turns out to be an accurate description of the picture, and can be successfully used in a database for more accurate image search technology. The ESP Game was licensed by Google in the form of the [[Google Image Labeler]], and is used to improve the accuracy of the [[Google Image Search]]. Von Ahn's games brought him further coverage in the mainstream media. His thesis won the Best Doctoral Dissertation Award from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science.
In July 2006, von Ahn gave a tech talk at Google on "Human Computation" (i.e., crowdsourcing) which was watched by over one million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx082gDwGcM Google Tech Talk on human computation by Luis von Ahn]. youtube.com (2006-07-26). Retrieved on 2015-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, von Ahn invented [[reCAPTCHA]], a new form of [[CAPTCHA]] that also helps digitize books. In reCAPTCHA, the images of words displayed to the user come directly from old books that are being digitized; they are words that [[optical character recognition]] could not identify and are sent to people throughout the web to be identified. ReCAPTCHA is currently in use by over 100,000 web sites and is transcribing over 40 million words per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/techtonicshifts/archive/2009/11/13/recaptcha-a-k-a-those-infernal-squiggly-words-almost-done-digitizing-the-new-york-times-archive.aspx reCAPTCHA (a.k.a.

'''Montfort Agricultural Secondary School''' is a [[Tanzania]]n [[secondary school]] in [[Rujewa]], [[Mbeya Region]].

==History and operations==
It was founded in 1988 by the Indian branch of the [[Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel]], on 538 acres (2.15 km²) of land provided by the government.

As of 2005, the school teaches up to [[O-Level]] standard. There are 318 students, of whom 30% are girls, and 30% Muslims. There are boarding facilities for boys, accommodating 87 students, but none for girls. There are 24 teachers. 

The main income for the school is provided by the school farm. The farm includes orchards, [[paddy field]]s, livestock (cows, oxen, pigs and chickens) and fish ponds. Irrigation is provided from the neighbouring village of [[Ubaruku]] by Mbarali Rice Farms, a branch of the [[National Food Corporation]] (NAFCO).

'''New Visions: Law &amp; Government''' is an academic career-exploration program for high school seniors from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The program is located at the [[New York State Education Department Building]] in [[Albany, New York]]. Offered through the [[Capital Region BOCES|Capital Region Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES)]], New Visions: Law &amp; Government integrates [[Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics]] with English, Law and Economics. The program offers college credit through the [[University at Albany, SUNY]]'s University in the High School Program (UHS) and is the only high school program to offer college credit in Criminal Justice through UHS.&lt;ref&gt;http://capitalregionboces.org/CareerTech/Programs/NVLG.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UHS"&gt;http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/university_in_high_school.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the program, students are also placed in internships in places such as the [[New York Attorney General]]'s office, various state courts, the [[New York State Legislature]], and various public and private interest or advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="UHS"/&gt; Students participate in mock trials, mock congressional hearings and visit with many judges and lawyers over the course of the year. The Advanced Placement United States Government and Politics component emphasizes critical thinking, analysis and writing.&lt;ref name="School board"/&gt; The works read include: ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', ''[[Democracy in America]]'', ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', ''[[The Brethren (non-fiction)|The Brethren]]'', ''[[All the President's Men]]'', and ''[[One L]]'', as well as many works of short fiction and newspaper and magazine articles. The program culminates with a week in [[Washington, D.C.]] where the class typically attends a session of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], meet with a Justice or his or her law clerks, meet with the students' [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]], [[United States Senate|Senators]], and [[Congressional staff]], and attend a [[White House]] Press Briefing.&lt;ref name="School board"&gt;http://www.nyssba.org/index.php?src=news&amp;submenu=on_board&amp;srctype=detail&amp;category=On%20Board%20Online%20June%209%202008&amp;refno=380&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bocescareertech.org/Programs/NVLawGovt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2015, the New Visions Law &amp; Government class won the New York "We The People: The Citizen and the Constitution” State Finals and advanced to the National championship, marking the first time in the "We The People" program's 28-year history that an upstate team has won the State championship.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capregboces.org/CareerTech/news/2014-15/Feb_15/02.12.15_Gazette_NVLG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalregionboces.org/CareerTech/news/2014-15/Feb_15/01.10.15_NewVisionsWinStates.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civiced.org/national-finals-2015-students&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2015  "We The People: The Citizen and the Constitution” National Finals, the New Visions Law &amp; Government class won an  award for the highest score in Unit 3 (of six units), “How has the Constitution been changed to further the ideals contained in the Declaration of Independence?" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailymail.net/news/article_087695fe-eefe-11e4-95a5-2f2ba2e89530.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.civiced.org/2015-top-10&lt;/ref&gt;On February 27, 2016, the New Visions Law &amp; Government class won the New York "We The People: The Citizen and the Constitution” State Finals and advanced to the National championship for a second consecutive year. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.troyrecord.com/social-affairs/20160229/boces-team-repeats-as-state-champs-in-constitution-competition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/BOCES-New-Visions-group-advances-to-national-6867099.php&lt;/ref&gt;"We the People: The Citizen and Constitution" is an intensive curriculum that provides students with a fundamental understanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Competing students act as experts testifying on constitutional issues in a simulated congressional hearing, demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have opportunities to evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Constitutional scholars, lawyers and government leaders from throughout the state, acting as congressional committee members, judge the student performances.&lt;ref&gt;[[We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority''', previously called '''Ngwao Boswa jwa Kapa Bokone''' (seTswana for 'Heritage Northern Cape'), and commonly known as 'Boswa', is a [[provincial heritage resources authority]] established in 2003 by the [[Executive Council (South Africa)|MEC]] for Sport, Arts and Culture in the [[Northern Cape]] Province of South Africa, and reconstituted in terms of the Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, Act No 9 of 2013, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No 1784, 5 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an institution set up under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It is mandated to care for that part of South Africa's national estate that is of provincial and local significance in the [[Northern Cape]].

The Heritage Authority is best known as the custodian of the approximately 130 provincial heritage sites in the province,&lt;ref&gt;[[List of heritage sites in Northern Cape]]&lt;/ref&gt; but is also responsible for administration of other forms of protection of heritage established under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.

== History ==
The Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority (sometimes referred to as 'Ngwao Boswa') is the successor body to the former [[National Monuments Council (South Africa and Namibia)|National Monuments Council]] in the [[Northern Cape]] Province of South Africa. Under the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]] cultural matters are a competency shared between national and provincial government.&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 4, Part A, Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act. 108 of 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This necessitated the creation of a system whereby many of the responsibilities of the former National Monuments Council were devolved to provincial level via the National Heritage Resources Act.

The Northern Cape Provincial Government elected initially to use provisions of the National Heritage Resources Act which allowed it to establish a provincial heritage resources authority (PHRA): 'Ngwao Boswa' was established by regulation on 28 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Official Notice 5 of 2003, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette No. 744, Kimberley: 28 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 October 2003 the Council appointed by the MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture met for the first time and has since met regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of the First Meeting of the Council of Ngao Boswa Kapa Bokoni, 11 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Council established a sub-committee known as the 'Permits Committee' which met monthly to consider applications under the terms of the National Heritage Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.5, Ngwao-Boswa ya Kapa Bokone Annual Report 2009-2010, Kimberley, 2010, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council also established an Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.2, Ngwao-Boswa ya Kapa Bokone Annual Report 2009-2010, Kimberley, 2010, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, 2013, reconstitutes the Council and provides for the governance of the authority, determining its objects, functions and operation, and regulating staff and financial matters.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority Act, Act No 9 of 2013, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette Extraordinary, No 1784, 5 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authority inherited responsibility for approximately 130 former national monuments, now known as [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|‘provincial heritage sites’]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of heritage sites in Northern Cape]]&lt;/ref&gt; The National Heritage Resources Act provides for a greater variety of protection than did its predecessor and the organisation has continued to institute protections of various forms under its terms. A large part of this work is dedicated to transforming the heritage landscape of the [[Northern Cape]] Province to ensure that the heritage of all its people enjoys equal recognition and appropriate protection.

The Logo of the organisation is based on a rock engraving of an [[Eland antelope|eland]] from the [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|Wildebeest Kuil rock art site]], the first new provincial heritage site to be declared by the organisation following its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;General Notice 82 of 2008, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette No. 1234, Kimberley: 19 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The initial name of the organisation was a rendition of 'Heritage Northern Cape' in the seTswana language, also translated as 'Erfenis Noord-Kaap' in Afrikaans and 'Amafa Asemntla Koloni' in isiXhosa, English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa being the other three official languages of the province.

From its inception there was controversy over the correct translation of the term 'Heritage Northern Cape' into seTswana, the regulation establishing the organisation spelling it 'Taolo Ya Ngoa Boshwa Kapa Bokoni'.&lt;ref&gt;Official Notice 5 of 2003, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette No. 744, Kimberley: 28 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also frequently referred to, more correctly, as 'Ngwao-Boshwa [or Boswa] ya [or jwa] Kapa Bokone'.&lt;ref&gt;http://glosbe.com/en/tn/of&lt;/ref&gt;

New legislation, published in March 2014, gives the name of the organisation as Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority.

== SAHRA and the Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority's Mandate ==
The Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority is subject to a biennial assessment of competency by the [[South African Heritage Resources Agency]], SAHRA, in terms of which it is determined which aspects of the National Heritage Resources Act it is qualified to implement.&lt;ref&gt;Section 8(6), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assessed as competent to deal with all areas over which a provincial heritage resources authority is permitted to act, aside from Sections 35 and 36 of the Act which cover certain aspects relating to archaeology, palaeontology, graves and burials.

== Categories of heritage resource for which Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority is responsible ==
The Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority is responsible for sites that fall within the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;Section3(2), National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Government Notice 506, Republic of South Africa Government Gazette, Vol. 406, No 19974, Cape Town, 28 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

* Buildings and structures of architectural, historical, technical and aesthetic value
* Places to which oral traditions intangible values are attached
* Historical settlements and towns
* Landscapes and natural features
* Geological sites
* Battlefields
* Sites associated with slavery

== Staff Complement ==
The Council of the Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority employs the staff of the organisation, although up to 2011 staff were employees of the Northern Cape Department of Sport, Arts and Culture.

== Formally Protected Sites ==
[[File:Richtersveld World Heritage Site, Sunset at Rooiberg.JPG|240px|thumb|Sunset near Rooiberg, [[Richtersveld]] World Heritage Site.]]
Approximately 130 sites in the Northern Cape are formally protected as [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of heritage sites in Northern Cape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these were declared under legislation that predates the National Heritage Resources Act and were previously known as 'national monuments'. One new provincial heritage site has been declared by the Northern Cape Heritage Resources Authority, that being the [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|Wildebeest Kuil rock art site]] which was gazetted on 19 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;General Notice 82 of 2008, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette No. 1234, Kimberley: 19 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The organisation is also responsible for the [[Richtersveld|Richtersveld World Heritage Site]] which was gazetted as a heritage area on 18 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;General Notice 64 of 2007, Province of the Northern Cape Provincial Gazette No. 1123, Kimberley: 18 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  In cooperation with municipalities, several other heritage areas have been established in terms of Section 31 of the National Heritage Resources Act and municipal spatial development frameworks.  These are in the following towns:

* [[Calvinia]] and [[Nieuwoudtville]] in the [[Hantam Local Municipality]]&lt;ref&gt;Spatial Development Framework, Hantam Municipality, Calvinia, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''''' ({{lang-pt|Pedagogia do Oprimido}}), written by educator [[Paulo Freire]], proposes a [[pedagogy]] with a new relationship between teacher, student, and society. It was first published in Portuguese in 1968, and was translated by Myra Ramos into English and published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pedagogyoftheoppressed.com/about/|title=About Pedagogy of the Oppressed|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012165910/http://www.pedagogyoftheoppressed.com/about/|archivedate=2011-10-12|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered one of the foundational texts of [[critical pedagogy]].

Dedicated to the oppressed and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults to read and write, Freire includes a detailed [[Marxist analysis|Marxist]] [[class analysis]] in his exploration of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized.

In the book Freire calls traditional pedagogy the "[[banking model of education]]" because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge, like a [[piggy bank]]. However, he argues for pedagogy to treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.

The book has sold over 750,000 copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Publisher's Foreword in Freire, Paulo (2000). ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Translated into several languages, most editions of ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' contain at least one introduction/foreword, a preface, and four chapters.

The first chapter explores how [[oppression]] has been justified and how it is reproduced through a mutual process between the "oppressor" and the "oppressed" ([[oppressors–oppressed distinction]]). Examining how the balance of power between the colonizer and the colonized remains relatively stable, Freire admits that the powerless in society can be frightened of freedom. He writes, "Freedom is acquired by conquest, not by gift. It must be pursued constantly and responsibly. Freedom is not an ideal located outside of man; nor is it an idea which becomes myth. It is rather the indispensable condition for the quest for human completion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43929806|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780826412768|edition=30th anniversary|location=New York|pages=47|oclc=43929806}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freire, freedom will be the result of ''[[praxis (process)|praxis]]''—informed action—when a balance between theory and practice is achieved.

The second chapter examines the "banking" approach to education—a metaphor used by Freire that suggests students are considered empty bank accounts that should remain open to deposits made by the teacher. Freire rejects the "banking" approach, claiming it results in the [[dehumanization]] of both the students and the teachers. In addition, he argues the banking approach stimulates oppressive attitudes and practices in society. Instead, Freire advocates for a more world-mediated, mutual approach to education that encourages the co-creation of knowledge. According to Freire, this "authentic" approach to education must allow people to be aware of their incompleteness and strive to be more fully human. This attempt to use education as a means of consciously shaping the person and the society is called [[conscientization]], a term first coined by Freire in this book.

The third chapter discusses the idea that "to speak the true word is to transform the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43929806|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780826412768|edition=30th anniversary|location=New York|pages=87|oclc=43929806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freire developed the use of the term [[limit situation]] with regards to dimensions of human praxis. This is in line with [[:pt:Álvaro Vieira Pinto|Álvaro Vieira Pinto]]'s use of the word/idea in his "[[:pt:Consciência e Realidade Nacional |Consciência e Realidade Nacional]]", which Freire contends is "using the concept without the pessimistic character originally found in Jaspers" (Note 15, Chapter 3), in reference to [[Karl Jaspers]]'s notion of ''Grenzsituationen''.

The last chapter proposes [[dialogic]]s as an instrument to free the colonized, through the use of cooperation, unity, organization and cultural synthesis (overcoming problems in society to liberate human beings). This is in contrast to antidialogics, which use conquest, manipulation, cultural invasion, and the concept of divide and rule. Freire suggests that populist dialogue is a necessity to revolution; that impeding dialogue dehumanizes and supports the status quo. This is but one example of the [[dichotomies]] Freire identifies in the book; others include the student-teacher dichotomy and the colonizer-colonized dichotomy.

==Spread==
Since the publication of the English edition in 1970, ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' has been widely adopted in America's teacher-training programs. A 2003 study by David Steiner and Susan Rozen determined that ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' was frequently assigned at top education schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://educationnext.org/skewedperspective/|title=Skewed Perspective - Education Next|date=2009-10-20|work=Education Next|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
The work was strongly influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Karl Marx]]. One of Freire's dictums is that "there neither is, nor has ever been, an educational practice in zero space-time—neutral in the sense of being committed only to preponderantly abstract, intangible ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Freire, Paolo (2014) Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed, New York: Bloomsbury, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donaldo Macedo]], a former colleague of Freire and [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] professor, calls ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' a revolutionary text, and people in [[totalitarian]] states risk punishment reading it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43929806|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9780826412768|edition=30th anniversary|location=New York|pages=16|oclc=43929806}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|South African anti-apartheid struggle]], ad-hoc copies of ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' were distributed underground as part of the "ideological weaponry" of various revolutionary groups like the [[Black Consciousness Movement]]. In the 1970s and 1980s the book was banned and kept clandestine.&lt;ref&gt;Archie Dick (2010) "Librarians and Readers in the South African Anti-Apartheid Struggle", public lecture given in Tampere Main Library, August 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

In his article for the conservative ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'', [[Sol Stern]] asserts that ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' ignores the traditional touchstones of Western education (''e.g.'', [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[John Dewey]], or [[Maria Montessori]]) and contains virtually none of the information typically found in traditional teacher education (''e.g.'', no discussion of [[curriculum]], [[Test (assessment)|testing]], or age-appropriate learning). To the contrary, Freire rejects traditional education as "official knowledge" that intends to oppress.&lt;ref name="sol"&gt;Stern, Sol. [http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_2_freirian-pedagogy.html "Pedagogy of the Oppressor"], ''City Journal'', Spring 2009, Vol. 19, no. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern also suggests that heirs to Freire's ideas have taken them to mean that since all education is political, "leftist math teachers who care about the oppressed have a right, indeed a duty, to use a pedagogy that, in Freire's words, 'does not conceal—in fact, which proclaims—its own political character.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Sol. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_ed_school.html "'The Ed Schools' Latest—and Worst—Humbug"], ''City Journal'', Spring 2006, Vol. 16, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay is similar to ''[[Myst]]'', in which players traverse through a series of computer generated static screens''.'' Players can investigate physical locations, manipulate items, and complete puzzles. to progress through the game.

The educational content covered four areas: Optics, Mechanics, Acoustics, and Electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physikus.de/main.htm|title=Wayback Machine|date=2000-06-06|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000606161136/http://www.physikus.de/main.htm|archivedate=2000-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
When a meteorite collides with Earth, its planetary rotation ceases causing one hemisphere to be plunged into heat and the other into coldness. The player is tasked with using science to save the planet.

== Critical reception ==
''Tap Repeatedly'' thought the game was made in the same vein as Myst, and complimented its "charming...lighthearted" design philosophy that effectively taught players in an engaging manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Physicus/Physicus.shtml|title=Four Fat Chicks -- Physicus Review|date=2015-11-20|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120134943/http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Physicus/Physicus.shtml|archivedate=2015-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allgame noted that the game's use of the metric system and British accent of the narrator could act as barriers to North American players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=28772&amp;tab=review|title=Physicus - Review - allgame|date=2014-11-16|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116222954/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=28772&amp;tab=review|archivedate=2014-11-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=28772|title=Physicus - Overview - allgame|date=2014-11-15|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115090041/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=28772|archivedate=2014-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure Spiele wrote that the game would be able to teach some physics concepts to even the uninitiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventurespiele.net/reviews-req-showcontent-id-151.htm|title=avsn.de Heureka - Physikus 1 - Und Physik wird zum Abenteuer Review|date=2016-03-09|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309081954/http://www.adventurespiele.net/reviews-req-showcontent-id-151.htm|archivedate=2016-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quandaryland thought it would be a shame if the game's educational nature turned people off an experience as enjoyable as many non-educational titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=483|title=Physicus Review by Quandary|date=2006-01-09|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109081618/http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=483|archivedate=2006-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure Gamers noted the game's potential application within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/display.php?id=250|title=Adventure Gamers : Physicus|date=2006-01-03|access-date=2017-12-23|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103201654/http://www.adventuregamers.com/display.php?id=250|archivedate=2006-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Pausch became Associate Professor of Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction, and Design at Carnegie Mellon University. In 1998, he was a co-founder, along with Don Marinelli, of CMU's [[Entertainment Technology Center]] (ETC), and he started the Building Virtual Worlds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://www.etc.cmu.edu/bvw/|title=Building Virtual Worlds: A Carnegie Mellon Project Course |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University }}&lt;/ref&gt; course at CMU, which he taught for 10 years. He consulted with [[Google]] on [[user interface]] design and also consulted with [[PARC (company)|PARC]], Imagineering, and [[comScore|Media Metrix]].&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; Pausch is also the founder of the [[Alice (software)|Alice]] software project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-08|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12470|title=Carnegie Mellon's ETC Opens In Silicon Valley  |publisher=Gamasutra|date=2007-01-25|author=Dillon, Beth A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[National Science Foundation]] [[Presidential Young Investigator Award]] and was a Lilly Foundation Teaching Fellow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-05|url=http://www.thetartan.org/2008/4/28/news/pausch|title=Randy Pausch, beloved professor and worldwide inspiration, dies at age 47 |work=The Tartan|date=2008-04-28|author=Porter, Sabrina }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pausch was the author or co-author of five books and over 70 articles.

Pausch received two awards from [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] in 2007 for his achievements in computing education: the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award and the ACM [[SIGCSE|Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education]] Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3279411&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=142&amp;ao=KARLSTRM|title=ACM Award Citation / Randy&amp;nbsp;Pausch|publisher=Association for Computing Machinery|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802172130/http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3279411&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=142&amp;ao=KARLSTRM|archivedate=2008-08-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also inducted as a Fellow of the ACM in 2007.

==Cancer and death==

Pausch was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]&lt;ref name=postgazetteSeptember/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119024238402033039?mod=loomia&amp;loomia_si=1|title=A Beloved Professor Delivers The Lecture of a Lifetime |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=2007-09-20 | first=Jeffrey | last=Zaslow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and underwent a [[Pancreaticoduodenectomy|Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy)]] on September 19, 2006, in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/shortsummary.html|title=Short Summary |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|date=December 2007|author=Pausch, Randy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was told in August 2007 to expect a remaining three to six months of good health. He soon moved his family to [[Chesapeake, Virginia]],  to be close to his wife's family. On March 13, 2008, Pausch advocated for greater federal funding for pancreatic cancer before the [[United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/4138/dying-professor-famous-for-his-last-lecture-testifies-before-congress|title=Dying Professor, Famous for His Last Lecture, Testifies Before Congress |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2008-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the week prior to this, he had been hospitalized in order to have needle aspiration of [[pleural effusion]] in his right lung.&lt;ref name=lastlecture&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Lecture|author1=Pausch, Randy |author2=Zaslow, Jeffrey |publisher=Hyperion|date=2008-04-08|isbn=1-4013-2325-1|url=http://www.thelastlecture.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2008, a [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scan showed that he had very tiny ({{convert|5|mm}} or less) [[metastases]] in his lungs and in some of the [[lymph node]]s in his chest. He also had metastases in his [[peritoneum|peritoneal]] and [[retroperitoneum|retroperitoneal]] cavities. On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse side effects. He was, however, considering some [[Cancer immunotherapy|immuno-therapy-based]] approaches.&lt;ref name=updatepage&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/news/index.html|title= Randy Pausch's Update page  |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|date=2008-07-25|author=Pausch, Randy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, on behalf of Pausch, a friend anonymously posted a message on Pausch's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the cancer had progressed farther than had been indicated by recent PET scans and that Pausch had "taken a step down" and was "much sicker than he had been". The friend also stated that Pausch had then enrolled in a [[hospice]] program designed to provide [[palliative care]] to those at the end of life.&lt;ref name=updatepage /&gt;

{{wikinews|"Last Lecture" Professor Randy Pausch dies at age 47}}

Pausch died from [[pancreatic cancer]] at his family's home in [[Chesapeake, Virginia]], on July 25, 2008, at the age of 47. He is survived by his wife, Jai, and their three children, Dylan, Logan, and Chloe.&lt;ref name=plushnick&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080725/D9252UGG0.html|title=Prof whose 'last lecture' became a sensation dies |agency=Associated Press|date=2008-07-25|author=Plushnick-Masti, Ramit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams"==
{{Main|Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams}}
Pausch delivered his "Last Lecture", titled "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams", at CMU on September 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://cmu.edu/uls/journeys/randy-pausch/index.html|title=Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave an abridged version of his speech on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8577255250907450469&amp;hl=en-GB|title=Randy Pausch reprising his "Last Lecture" |publisher=Google Video|date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=confrontingdeath&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow/slideshow1_ss_oz_20071022_350/6|title=Confronting Death |publisher=Oprah }}&lt;/ref&gt; The talk was modeled after an ongoing series of lectures where top academics are asked to think deeply about what matters to them, and then give a hypothetical "final talk", with a topic such as "what wisdom would you try to impart to the world if you knew it was your last chance?" Before speaking, Pausch received a long standing ovation from a large crowd of over 400 colleagues and students.  When he motioned them to sit down, saying, "Make me earn it", someone in the audience shouted back, "You did!"&lt;ref name="postgazetteSeptember"&gt;{{cite news|date=September 19, 2007| title=CMU professor gives his last lesson on life |url=http://www.postgazette.com/pg/07262/818671-298.stm |first=Mark |last=Roth |publisher= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-08|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/GMA/TenWays/story?id=3675954&amp;page=1|title=Professor's Full Lecture: Part 1 |publisher=ABC|date=2007-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the lecture, Pausch offered inspirational life lessons, and performed push-ups on stage. He also commented on the irony that the "Last Lecture" series had recently been renamed as "Journeys", saying, "I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it."&lt;ref name="plushnick" /&gt; After Pausch finished his lecture, Steve Seabolt, on behalf of [[Electronic Arts]]—which is now collaborating with CMU in the development of Alice 3.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/extra/060310_alice.html|title=Carnegie Mellon Collaborates With EA to Revolutionize Computer Science Education  |publisher=Carnegie Mellon Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;—pledged to honor Pausch by creating a memorial scholarship for women in computer science, in recognition of Pausch's support and mentoring of women in CS and engineering.&lt;ref name="postgazetteSeptember" /&gt;

CMU president [[Jared Cohon]] spoke emotionally of Pausch's humanity and called his contributions to the university and to education "remarkable and stunning".&lt;ref name="cs.virginia" /&gt; He then announced that CMU will celebrate Pausch's impact on the world by building and naming after Pausch a raised pedestrian bridge&lt;ref name=bridgecohen&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_528186.html|title=Professor diagnosed with cancer offers his final words for the CMU community|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|date=2007-09-19|author=Heinrichs, Allison M.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114034719/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_528186.html|archivedate=2007-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to connect CMU's new Computer Science building and the Center for the Arts, symbolizing the way Pausch linked those two disciplines. Brown University professor [[Andries van Dam]] followed Pausch's last lecture with a tearful and impassioned speech praising him for his courage and leadership, calling him a role model.&lt;ref name=cs.virginia&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11 |url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/csnews/show.php?artID=315 |title=Randy Pausch's Last Lecture |publisher=University of Virginia |date=2007-09-20 |author=Robins, Gabriel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312125300/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/csnews/show.php?artID=315 |archivedate=March 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119024238402033039 A Beloved Professor Delivers The Lecture of a Lifetime] at ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119084081673940375 The Professor's Manifesto: What It Meant to Readers], September 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Last Lecture''===
{{main|The Last Lecture}}

The [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned publisher [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] paid $6.7&amp;nbsp;million for the rights to publish a book about Pausch called ''[[The Last Lecture]]'', co-authored by Pausch and ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Jeffrey Zaslow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-11|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071120/FREE/71120006/1084|title=Hyperion wins auction for The Last Lecture |publisher=Crain's New York Business|date=2007-11-20|author=Flamm, Matthew }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book became a ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller on April 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-10-05|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/books/bestseller/0622besthardadvice.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|title=Hardcover Advice  |work=The New York Times|date=2008-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Last Lecture'' expands on Pausch's speech.

It has spent more than 85 weeks on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list, and there are now more than 4.5 million copies in print in the U.S. alone. Despite speculation that the book would be made into a movie, Pausch had denied these rumors, stating that "there's a reason to do the book, but if it's telling the story of the lecture in the medium of film, we already have that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-10-05|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-04-07-pausch_N.htm|title=Professor Pausch's life, 'Lecture' go from Web to book |work=USA Today|date=2008-04-08|author=Wilson, Craig }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Reconstructivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that societies should continually reform themselves in order to establish more perfect governments or [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Reconstructivism |title=Articleworld.org |accessdate=2008-04-26 |format=php |work=Reconstructivism }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology involves recombining or [[Recontextualisation|recontextualizing]] the ideas arrived at by the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], in which an existing system or medium is broken into its smallest meaningful elements and in which these elements are used to build a new system or medium  free from the strictures of the original.

Some thinkers have attempted to ascribe the term Reconstructivism to the post-postmodern art movement. In an essay by Chris Sunami, ([http://kitoba.com/pedia/Reconstructivist+Art.html Art Essays: Reconstructivist Art]) "reconstructivist art" is described as follows:

{{quote|A reconstructivist art work builds upon prior, [[deconstructionist]] artworks and techniques, but adapts them to classic themes and structures, with the goal of creating works of genuine emotion and significance. In this way, reconstructivism (when it works) combines the vitality and originality of deconstructionism with the comforts, pleasures and rewards of [[classicism]]. The overall purpose of reconstructivism is to reawaken a sense of the Real in a world where everything has been demonstrated to be an illusion.}}

One of the examples Sunami provides of this technique is the way some modern music incorporates deconstructed samples of older music and combines and arranges the samples in a new way as part of a new composition.

The '''Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League''' ('''UNIA-ACL''') is a [[black nationalist]] [[fraternal organization]] founded in 1914 in the United States by [[Marcus Mosiah Garvey]], a Jamaican immigrant. The Pan-African organization enjoyed its greatest strength in the 1920s, and was influential in the United States prior to Garvey's deportation to Jamaica in 1927. After that its prestige and influence declined, but it had a strong influence on African-American history and development. The UNIA was said to be "unquestionably, the most influential anticolonial organization in Jamaica prior to 1938." ([[Honor Ford-Smith]])

The organization was founded to work for the advancement of people of African ancestry around the world. Its motto is "One God! One Aim! One Destiny!" and its slogan is "Africa for the Africans, at home and abroad!" The broad mission of the UNIA-ACL led to the establishment of numerous auxiliary components, among them the [[Universal African Legion]], a [[paramilitary]] group; the African [[Black Cross Nurses]]; [[African Black Cross Society]]; the Universal African Motor Corps; the Black Eagle Flying Corps; and businesses such as the [[Black Star Steamship Line]], the [[Black Cross Trading and Navigation Corporation]], and the [[Negro Factories Corporation]].

==Name==
In an article entitled "The Negro's Greatest Enemy",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/sample01 "The Negro's Greatest Enemy"], American Series Sample Documents, Volume I: 1826--August 1919. UCLA African Studies Center.&lt;/ref&gt; published in ''[[Current History]]'' (September 1923), Garvey explained the origin of the organization's name:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Where did the name of the organization come from? It was while speaking to a [[West Indian]] [[Negro]] who was a passenger with me from [[Southampton]], who was returning home to the [[East Indies]] from [[Basutoland]] with his [[Basuto]] wife, I further learned of the horrors of native life in Africa. He related to me in conversation such horrible and pitiable tales that my heart bled within me. Retiring from the conversation to my cabin, all day and the following night I pondered over the subject matter of that conversation, and at midnight, lying flat on my back, the vision and thought came to me that I should name the organization the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities (Imperial) League. Such a name I thought would embrace the purpose of all black humanity. Thus to the world a name was born, a movement created, and a man became known.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early history==
Originally from [[Saint Ann's Bay]], [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], Marcus Garvey left at 23 and traveled throughout Central America and moved for a time to [[England]].  During his travels he became convinced that uniting Blacks was the only way to improve their condition. Towards that end, he departed England on June 14, 1914, aboard the [[SS Trent|SS ''Trent'']], returning to Jamaica on July 15, 1914. He traveled to the United States, where he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in August 1914 in [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Akron's Black History Timeline|url=http://www.akronohio.gov/cms/site/0b144cf2a61a53e3/index.html|website=akronohio.gov|publisher=City of Akron|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giffin|first1=William|title=African Americans and the Color Line in Ohio, 1915-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2MCDFaRcD0C&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=United+Negro+Improvement+Association+(UNIA)+was+founded+in+Akron&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tGpo-RTRO1&amp;sig=MGIF3AD_mJULcTrUHWoJdXwwk1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY5J7smr3RAhVDuhQKHYl0BWUQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=United%20Negro%20Improvement%20Association%20(UNIA)%20was%20founded%20in%20Akron&amp;f=false|website=google|publisher=Thompson Shore, Inc.|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended it to unite all of Africa and its diaspora into "one grand racial hierarchy." After traveling through the United States beginning in March 1916, Garvey inaugurated the New York Division of the UNIA in 1917 with 13 members. After  three months, the organization's dues-paying membership reached 3,500.

''[[Negro World|The Negro World]]'' was founded on August 17, 1918, as a weekly newspaper to express the ideas of the organization. Garvey contributed a front-page editorial each week in which he developed the organization's position on different issues related to people of African ancestry around the world, in general, and the UNIA, in particular. Eventually claiming a circulation of 500,000, the newspaper was printed in several languages. It contained a page specifically for women readers, documented international events related to people of African ancestry, and was distributed throughout the African diaspora until publication ceased in 1933.

In 1919, the UNIA purchased the first of what would be numerous [[Liberty Hall (Harlem)|Liberty Halls]]. Located at 114 West 138th Street, in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]], the building had a seating capacity of 6,000. The single-level hall with low ceilings had previously been home to the Metropolitan Baptist Tabernacle. It was dedicated on July 27, 1919. On Sunday evenings, it was the site of the weekly UNIA meeting; it also housed a restaurant.&lt;ref name=Robertson&gt;Stephen Robertson, [http://digitalharlemblog.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/unia-harlem/ "The Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in Harlem"], ''Digital Harlem Blog'', April 26, 2011. Retrieved August 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the Association organized the first of its two steamship companies and a separate business corporation.

Incorporated in [[Delaware]] as a domestic corporation on June 27, 1919, the [[Black Star Line|Black Star Line, Inc.]] (BSL) was capitalized at 10 million dollars. It sold shares individually valued at five dollars to both UNIA members and non-members alike. Proceeds from stock sales were used to purchase first the [[SS Yarmouth|SS ''Yarmouth'']] and then the [[Shady Side (steamboat)|SS ''Shady Side'']]. The ''Shady Side'' was used by the association for summer outings and excursions, as well as rented out on charter to other organizations. The BSL later purchased the ''[[Kanawha (1899)|Kanawha]]'' as its third vessel. This small yacht was intended for inter-island transportation in the West Indies and was rechristened the [[SS Antonio Maceo|SS ''Antonio Maceo'']].

Also established in 1919 was the [[Negro Factories Corporation]], with a capitalization of one million dollars. It generated income and provided around 700 jobs by its numerous enterprises: three grocery stores, two restaurants, a laundry, a tailor shop, a dressmaking shop, a millinery store, a printing company, and doll factory. However, most went out of business by 1922.&lt;ref name=Robertson/&gt;

With the growth of its membership from 1918 through 1924, as well as income from its various economic enterprises, UNIA purchased additional Liberty Halls in the USA, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Edwards, "Black history looms large at busy corner".  ''[[Toronto Star]]'', January 26, 1998, p. B3, with reference to the importance of the hall located at 355 [[College Street (Toronto)|College Street]] in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Costa Rica, Belize, Panama, Java, and other countries. UNIA also purchased farms in Ohio and other states. It purchased land in [[Claremont, Virginia]] with the intention of founding Liberty University.

==First international convention==
By 1920 the association had over 1,900 divisions in more than 40 countries. Most of the divisions were located in the United States, which had become the UNIA's base of operations. There were, however, offices in several Caribbean countries, with [[Cuba]] having the most. Divisions also existed in Central and South America: [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Venezuela]]; in Africa: [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]), [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]), and the [[Union of South Africa|Union]] of [[South Africa]]; and in [[British India|India]] and [[Australia]]. [[Image:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marcus Garvey]]]]

For the entire month of August 1920, the [[UNIA-ACL]] held its first international convention at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]]. The 20,000 attending members promulgated [[The Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World|"The Declaration of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World"]]&lt;ref&gt;Wikisource contributors, "The Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World," Wikisource, The Free Library, [http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=The_Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_the_Negro_Peoples_of_the_World&amp;oldid=189864 "The Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World"]. Retrieved October 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on August 13, 1920, and elected the leaders of the UNIA as "leaders for the Negro people of the world".
{{Listen|filename=Marcus Garvey, speech, 1921.ogg|title="Explanation of the Objects of the Universal Negro Improvement Association"|description=Complete 1921 speech|format=[[Ogg]]}}

The organization put forth a program based on this declaration, marking the evolution of the movement as one promoting black nationalism. It sought the uplift of the black race and encouraged self-reliance and nationhood. Among the declarations was one proclaiming the [[Pan-African flag|red, black and green flag]] as the official banner of the African race. (Beginning in the 1960s, [[black nationalism|black nationalists]] and [[Pan-African]]ists adopted the same flag as the Black Liberation Flag.) UNIA-ACL officially designated the song "[[Ethiopia]], Thou Land of Our Fathers" as the official anthem of "Africa and the Africans, at home and Abroad".

Under the provisions of the UNIA constitution, [[Gabriel Johnson]] was elected Supreme Potentate; G. O. Marke, Supreme Deputy Potentate; J. W. [H]. Eason, leader of the fifteen million "Negroes" of the United States of America; and [[Henrietta Vinton Davis]], International Organizer. Garvey was elected "Provisional President of Africa", a mostly ceremonial title. [[George Alexander McGuire]], an Episcopal priest, was elected as the first chaplain-general of the UNIA. 

McGuire wrote two important documents for the organization: "Universal Negro Ritual" and "Universal Negro Catechism". For these he drew from his interest and knowledge of religion and race history. In [[Philadelphia]], where he had earlier been the rector of [[African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas|St. Thomas Episcopal Church]], McGuire had been an early member of the American Negro Historical Society.&lt;ref name=MARTIN&gt;Tony Martin.

''Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance''. Volume 2. Cary D. Wintz, Paul Finkelman (Eds.). Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p.776.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The opening parade was one of the most striking features of the 1920 convention. It began outside the UNIA headquarters on West 135th Street, went uptown as far as 145th and downtown as far as 125th Street, taking it beyond the boundaries of black residence into white areas. Four mounted policemen, and the heads of Black Star Line and Negro Factories Corporation, led the parade, followed by cars carrying Garvey and Mayor of Monrovia, capital of Liberia, and other UNIA officials, then the Black Star Line Choir, on foot, and contingents from throughout US and Caribbean, Canada, Nigeria, carrying banners, and including 12 bands, with about 500 cars bringing up the rear.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Robertson, [http://digitalharlemblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/parades-in-1920s-harlem/ "Parades in 1920s Harlem"], ''Digital Harlem Blog'', February 1, 2011. Retrieved August 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar dramatic parades were featured in the 1922 and 1924 conventions. Many photographs survive of the 1924 Convention Parade, as Garvey employed noted photographer [[James Van Der Zee]] to record the event.

Even after Garvey had left Harlem (he was imprisoned in 1925 and deported to Jamaica in 1927), the UNIA paraded each August throughout the 1920s, with the place of honour given to portraits of their absent leader.  The crowds were transfixed by the spectacle of uniformed UNIA members, particularly the African Legion and Black Cross Nurses.&lt;ref name=Robertson/&gt; 

According to the preamble of the 1929 constitution as amended, the UNIA is a 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[social]], friendly, [[humanitarian]], charitable, educational, [[institutional]], constructive and expansive [[society]], and is founded by persons desiring to do the utmost to work for the general uplift of the people of [[Africa]]n [[ancestry]] of the world. And the members pledge themselves to do all in their power to conserve the rights of their noble race and to respect the rights of all mankind, believing always in the Brotherhood of Man and the Fatherhood of God. The motto of the organization is 'One God! One Aim! One Destiny!' Therefore, let justice be done to all mankind, realizing that if the strong oppresses the weak, confusion and discontent will ever mark the path of man but with love, faith and charity towards all the reign of peace and plenty will be heralded into the world and the generations of men shall be called Blessed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Liberian program==
Although UNIA was not solely a "Back to Africa" movement, the organization did work to arrange for emigration for [[African Americans]] who wanted to go there. In late 1923, an official UNIA delegation that included [[Robert Lincoln Poston]] and [[Henrietta Vinton Davis]] traveled to [[Liberia]] to survey potential land sites for possible purchase. They also assessed the general condition of the country from the standpoint of UNIA members interested in living in [[Africa]].

By 1924 the Chief Justice [[J. J. Dossen]] of Liberia wrote to UNIA conveying the government's support: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The President directs me to say in reply to your letter of June 8 setting forth the objects and purposes of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, that the Government of Liberia, appreciating as they do the aims of your organization as outlined by you, have no hesitancy in assuring you that they will afford the Association every facility legally possible in effectuating in Liberia its industrial, agricultural and business projects."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About two months later, however, the Liberian President unexpectedly ordered all Liberian ports to refuse entry to any member of the "Garvey Movement". This action closely followed the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Rubber Company's agreement with Liberia for a 99-year lease of one million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land. It was extracting and processing rubber for the world market. This land deal had been assisted by American and European governments. Originally Liberia had intended to lease the land to UNIA at an unprecedented dollar an acre ($247/km²). The commercial agreement with Firestone Tire dealt a severe blow to the UNIA's African repatriation program and inspired speculation that the actions were linked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.ucla.edu/africa/mgpp/sample06 Editorial by Marcus Garvey in the ''Negro World''], September 2, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Flag of the UNIA.svg|thumb|right|The [[Pan-African flag|UNIA flag]] (also known as the [[Black nationalism|Black Nationalist Flag]]) uses three colors: red, black and green.]]

==Post-Garvey era==
After Garvey's conviction and imprisonment on mail fraud charges in 1925 and deportation to Jamaica in 1927, the organization began to take on a different character. In 1926, [[George Weston]] succeeded Garvey in a UNIA Convention Election, becoming the second elected President-General of the UNIA, Inc. Many Garvey supporters were angered, and split off into rival entities such as the "Garvey Clubs" and other organizations, based on members' differing interpretation of the original aims and objects of the UNIA.

But the UNIA continued to be officially recognized as the "Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League". A rival "UNIA-ACL August 1929 of the World" emerged, headed by Marcus Garvey after his deportation to Jamaica.

Garvey appointed [[Maymie de Mena]] as his official representative to head the American field after his ouster to Jamaica. She was a fiery orator and spoke both Spanish and English, helping with the spread of the organization through [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castillo-Garsow|first1=Melissa|editor-last1=Knight|editor-first1=Franklin W.|editor-last2=Gates, Jr.|editor-first2=Henry Louis|title=Dictionary of Caribbean and Afro–Latin American Biography|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/search?source=%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780199935796.001.0001%2Facref-9780199935796&amp;q=maymie+aiken|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-199-93579-6|chapter=Aiken, Maymie "Madame De Mena" (1891–1953)}} {{subscription needed|via=[http://www.oxfordreference.com/ Oxford University Press]'s Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The UNIA Inc===

The UNIA, Inc., after Garvey's departure, continued to operate out of New York until 1941. After Weston's 1926 election to President-General, he was succeeded by Frederick Augustus Toote (1929), Clifford Bourne (1930), Lionel Antonio Francis (1931–34), [[Henrietta Vinton Davis]] (1934–40), [[Lionel Antonio Francis]] (1940–61), Captain [[A. L. King]] (1961–81) and [[Milton Kelly, Jr.]] (1981–2007).

In a historic 1939 [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|British Supreme Court]] decision, President-General Francis was recognized as the rightful administrative heir to the huge Sir [[Isaiah Emmanuel Morter]] (DSOE) Estate in [[Belize]]. The organization's administrative headquarters were shifted to Belize in 1941 when the President-General relocated there from New York.

Upon Francis's death in 1961 during [[Hurricane Hattie]], the presidency shifted back to New York under the leadership of Captain A. L. King, formerly president of the Central Division of the UNIA in New York. After his death in the early 1980s, longtime Garveyite organizer Milton Kelly, Jr. assumed the administrative reins and continued to head the association until 2007.

===The UNIA-ACL 1929 of the World===

The UNIA 1929 headed by Garvey continued operating in Jamaica until he moved to [[England]] in 1935. There he set up office for the parent body of the UNIA 1929 and maintained contact with all its divisions. UNIA 1929 conventions were held in [[Canada]] in 1936, 1937, and 1938. The 1937 sessions were highlighted by the introduction of the first course of African philosophy conducted by Garvey.

Garvey became ill in January 1940, and died on June 10, 1940. UNIA members worldwide participated in eulogies, memorial services and processions in his honor. Secretary-General Ethel Collins briefly managed the affairs of the UNIA from New York until a successor to Garvey could be formally installed to complete his term as President-General.

During an emergency commissioners' conference in June 1940, [[James R. Stewart]], a commissioner from [[Ohio]] and graduate of the course of African philosophy, was named the successor. In the months to follow, the Parent Body of the UNIA was moved from its temporary headquarters in New York to [[Cleveland]]. In October 1940 the ''New Negro World'' started publishing out of Cleveland. After the 1942 International Convention in Cleveland, a rehabilitating committee of disgruntled members was held in New York during September.

===Parent Body in Monrovia===
Stewart moved to [[Monrovia]], Liberia, in 1949. He took Liberian citizenship and moved the Parent Body of the UNIA there.  He continued to lead the Association as President-General until his death in 1964.  Stewart and his entire family relocated deeper into the interior of the country, establishing themselves in [[Gbandela]], [[Liberia]].  There they established a hospital, school and farm.

When Stewart died from cancer in 1964, the Parent Body was moved from Monrovia to [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], Ohio, where James A. Bennett took the reins.  In 1968 Bennett was succeeded by Vernon Wilson.

After President-General Wilson's death in 1975, [[Mason Harvgrave]] became next President General.  Hargrave testified during United States congressional hearings in August 1987 in relation to the proposed exoneration of Marcus Garvey on charges of mail fraud.  The findings of the Judiciary Committee were: Garvey was innocent of the charges against him.  Although the Committee determined he had been found guilty earlier due to the social climate of America at the time, they had no legal basis upon which to exonerate a person who had died. 

After President General Hargrave died in 1988, all his papers and other Parent Body material were turned over to the [[Western Reserve Historical Society]] in Cleveland, Ohio, for safe-keeping. From 1988 until the present, [[Cleo Miller]], Jr. has held the title of President General.

'''William S. Gray''' (1885–1960) was an [[United States|American]] educator and [[literacy]] advocate.

==Life and career==
Gray was born in the town of [[Coatsburg, Illinois]] on June 5, 1885.  He graduated from high school in 1904 and began teaching in a one-room school house in [[Adams County, Illinois]]. After four years of teaching and being a principal he went to [[Illinois State University|Illinois State Normal University]] for a two-year teacher training course. His studies were influenced by the North American [[Johann Friedrich Herbart|Herbartian]] movement that emphasized starting with what the child knows and proceeding with an inductive instructional approach.

Gray proceeded to advance his education at the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] in 1913.

He then spent a year (1913–1914) at Teachers College of Columbia University, the only other teachers' college in the country besides Chicago. There, he came under the influence of [[Edward Thorndike]] and [[Charles Hubbard Judd|Charles Judd]], both of whom had been influenced by pragmatists [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]]. Thorndike and Judd were also among the first to apply the new statistical methods of [[applied psychology]] to education, considered the most significant development in the whole history of education in the United States, and would later move their work to Chicago.

At Columbia, Gray "turned toward objective measurement, mathematical precision, a critical attitude, efficiency in schools, diagnosis based on results, and the use of research results which supported the economy of silent reading, and the importance of a sequential program of reading instruction&amp;nbsp;... the very basis of reading instruction in this country for almost the next half century."&lt;ref name="Stevensen"&gt;Stevensen, Jennifer A., ed. 1985. ''William S. Gray: Teacher, Scholar, Leader.'' Newark, Delaware: International Reading Association. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of his year in Columbia, he earned a [[Master of Arts]] degree and a Teachers College diploma, "Instructor in Education in Normal School."

Gray returned to the University of Chicago to earn a Ph.D. in 1916 for one of the first three doctoral dissertations on reading.  His was titled "Studies of Elementary School Reading Through Standardized Tests."  Gray's academic career at the University of Chicago lasted from 1916–1945. He served as Director of Research in Reading at the Graduate School of Education, at the University of Chicago and became the first president of the [[International Reading Association]]. [[Jeanne S. Chall]] called him "the acknowledged leader of, and spokesman for, reading experts for four decades." During his lifetime, he was known as one of the most influential persons and researchers in the field. His contemporaries included [[Arthur Irving Gates]] (1890–1972); [[Ernest Horn]] (1882–1967); and [[Ruth Strang]] (1896–1971).

In 1929, Gray began his affiliation with the publisher [[Scott Foresman]].  He was a co-author, along with [[Zerna Sharp]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagnwag.com/dick_jane/]&lt;/ref&gt; on the series that gave us the Dick, Jane, Sally, Spot and Puff early readers. From 1927 to 1960, these books were used to teach millions of Americans how to read. Today [[Dick and Jane]] are cultural icons for many from the [[baby boom]] generation.

Gray's study of worldwide literacy for [[UNESCO]] took four years of research and resulted in the book, ''The teaching of reading and writing: An international survey.'' Gray was the leading expert on reading in the first half of the 20th century. He promoted the [[whole word]] method of teaching reading supported by attention to context, configuration, structural and graphophonemic cues. Educators like Helen Huus found Gray's method comprehensive, because first children memorized a few words by sight, then developed the sight-word correspondence by using these known words as reference points.

Gray was also author of over 500 studies, reviews, articles, and books on reading and instruction, including ''On Their Own in Reading: How to Give Children Independence in Analyzing New Words''.&lt;ref name="theirown"&gt;Gray, William S. 1960. ''On Their Own in Reading: How to Give Children Independence in Analyzing New Words.'' New York: Scott Foresman.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was Reading Director of the Curriculum Foundation Series Scott, Foresman &amp; Company.

In 1935, Gray teamed up with Bernice Leary of [[St. Xavier College, Chicago]], to publish their landmark work in [[readability]], ''What Makes a Book Readable''. It attempted to discover what makes a book readable for adults of limited reading ability.&lt;ref name="grayleary"&gt;Gray, William S. &amp; Bernice E Leary. 1935. ''What Makes a Book Readable''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Adult Literacy Survey==

The first part of the study consisted of a literacy survey of adults between 15 and 50, one of the first survey of adult civilians in the U.S.

The sample consisted of 1,690 adults from a variety of institutions and areas around the country. The testing consisted of two parts. The first used a number of fiction and non-fiction passages taken from [[magazines]], [[books]], and [[newspapers]]. The second part used the Monroe Standardized Reading Test, which gave the results in grade scores.

The results showed a mean grade score of 7.81. This meant that the adults tested were able to read with an average proficiency equal to that of pupils in the eighth month of the seventh grade. Some 44 percent reached or surpassed the reading level of eighth-grade students of the elementary school.

About one-third fell in grades 2 to 6, another third from 7 to 12, and the remainder from 13 to 17. These results roughly mark the elementary, secondary, and college levels.

The authors stressed that half the adult population is lacking suitable materials written at their level. “For them,” they wrote, “the enriching values of reading are denied, unless materials reflecting adult interests be adapted to meet their needs.”

One third of the population needs materials written at the 4th, 5th, and 6th-grade levels.  The poorest readers—one sixth of the adult population—need “still simpler materials for use in promoting functioning literacy and in establishing fundamental reading habits”. (p.&amp;nbsp;95)

The criterion used by Gray and Leary included 48 selections of about 100 words each, half of them fiction, taken from the books, magazines, and newspapers most widely read by adults. They established the difficulty of these selections by a reading-comprehension test given to about 800 adults designed to test their ability to get the main idea of the passage.

==The readability variables==

The second part of ''What Makes a Book Readable'' was an extensive examination of the elements of writing style that affects readability (reading ease). Until the studies of John Bormuth in the 1970s, no one studied readability so thoroughly or investigated so many style elements or the relationships between them. The authors first identified 289 elements that affect readability and grouped them under these four headings:

1. Content&lt;br /&gt;
2. Style&lt;br /&gt;
3. Format&lt;br /&gt;
4. Features of Organization

The authors found that content, with a slight margin over style, was most important. Third in importance was format, and almost equal to it, “features of organization,” referring to the chapters, sections, headings, and paragraphs that show the relationship of ideas. (p.&amp;nbsp;31)

They found they could not measure content, format, or organization statistically, though many would later try. While not ignoring the other three causes, Gray and Leary concentrated on 82 variables of style, 64 of which they could reliably count. They gave several tests to about a thousand people. Each test included several passages and questions to show how well the subjects understood them.

Having a measure, now, of the difficulty of each passage, they were able to see what style variables changed as the pas-sage got harder. They used correlation coefficients to show those relationships.

Of the 64 countable variables related to reading difficulty, those with correlations of .35 or above were the following (p.&amp;nbsp;115):

{|
|+ Elements with correlations ≥ .35 &lt;ref name="KlareBuck"&gt;Klare, George R. &amp; Byron Buck. 1954. ''Know Your Reader: The Scientific Approach to Readability.'' New York: Hermitage House, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;
! Number !! Description !! Correlation !! Notes
|-
| 1 || Average sentence length in words ||  −.52 || a negative correlation, that is, the longer the sentence the more difficult it is
|-
| 2 || Percentage of easy words ||  .52 || the larger the number of easy words the easier the material
|-
| 3 || Number of words not known to 90% of sixth-grade students ||  −.51 ||
|-
| 4 || Number of “easy” words ||  .51 ||
|-
| 5 || Number of different “hard” words ||  −.50 ||
|-
| 6 || Minimum syllabic sentence length ||  −.49 ||
|-
| 7 || Number of explicit sentences ||  .48 ||
|-
| 8 || Number of first, second, and third-person pronouns ||  .48 ||
|-
| 9 || Maximum syllabic sentence length ||  −.47 ||
|-
| 10 || Average sentence length in syllables ||  −.47 ||
|-
| 11 || Percentage of monosyllables ||  .43 ||
|-
| 12 || Number of sentences per paragraph ||  .43 ||
|-
| 13 || Percentage of different words not known to 90% of sixth-grade students ||  −.40 ||
|-
| 14 || Number of simple sentences ||  .39 ||
|-
| 15 || Percentage of different words ||  −.38 ||
|-
| 16 || Percentage of polysyllables ||  −.38 ||
|-
| 17 || Number of prepositional phrases ||  −.35 ||
|}

Although none of the variables studied had a higher correlation than .52, the authors knew by combining variables, they could reach higher levels of correlation. Because combining variables that were tightly related to each other did not raise the correlation coefficient, they needed to find which elements were highly predictive but not related to each other.

Gray and Leary used five of the above variables, numbers 1, 5, 8, 15, and 17, to create a formula, which has a correlation of .645 with reading-difficulty scores. An important characteristic of readability formulas is that one that uses more variables may be only minutely more accurate but much more difficult to measure and apply. Later formulas that use fewer variables may have higher correlations (pp.&amp;nbsp;137–139).

Gray and Leary’s work stimulated an enormous effort to find the perfect formula, using different combinations of the style variables. In 1954, Klare and Buck listed 25 formulas for children and another 14 for adult readers. By 1981, George Klare noted there were over 200 published formulas.

Research eventually established that the two variables commonly used in readability formulas–a semantic (meaning) measure such as difficulty of vocabulary and a syntactic (sentence structure) measure such as average sentence length—are the best predictors of textual difficulty.
