'''''Ab initio''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|b|ᵻ|ˈ|n|ɪ|ʃ|i|.|oʊ}} {{respell|AB|i|NISH|ee-oh}})&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Latin term meaning "from the beginning" and is derived from the Latin ''ab'' ("from") + ''initio'', [[ablative case|ablative]] [[grammatical number|singular]] of ''initium'' ("beginning").

==Etymology==
{{circa|1600}}, from L., lit. "from the beginning", from ablative case of ''initium'' "entrance, beginning", related to verb ''inire'' "to go into, enter upon, begin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology for ab initio|publisher="etymonline.com"|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ab+initio|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
''Ab initio'' (abbreviation: ''ab init.'') is used in several contexts, including the following:

===Law===

In [[law]], ''ab initio'' refers to something being the case from the start or from the instant of the act rather than from when the court declared it so. For instance, the term "void ''ab initio''" means "to be treated as invalid from the outset." E.g., in many jurisdictions, if a person signs a contract under duress, that contract is treated as being "void ''ab initio''".

Typically, documents or acts which are [[void (law)|void]] ''ab initio'' cannot be fixed and if a jurisdiction, a document or an act is so declared at law to be void ''ab initio'', the parties are returned to their respective positions that they were at the beginning of the event.

"Void ''ab initio''" is often contrasted with "voidable", such documents which become void only as of the date of the judicial declaration to that effect.

An insurer facing a claim from an insured who had deceived the insurer on a material fact would claim that the insurance contract was void ''ab initio''; it was null and void from the beginning and that since there was no legally enforceable contract, the insurer ought not to have to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Legal definition at Duhaime.org|publisher="duhaime.org"|url=http://duhaime.org/legaldictionary/a/abinitio.aspx |accessdate=7 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100214123816/http://duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/AbInitio.aspx| archivedate= 14 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and engineering===

* [[Documentation]] of a process is said to be ''ab initio'' (or ''[[:wikt:from scratch|from scratch]]'', or ''[[:wikt:from the ground up|from the ground up]]'') if the documentation shows how to set up and complete the process from basic materials (to which a competent practitioner is expected to have access) without prior special preparation.
* A calculation is said to be ''ab initio'' (or "from [[First principle#In physics|first principles]]") if it relies on basic and established laws of nature without additional assumptions or special models. For example, an ''ab initio'' calculation of the properties of liquid water might start with the properties of the constituent hydrogen and oxygen atoms and the laws of electrostatics and quantum mechanics. From these basics, the properties of isolated individual water molecules would be derived, followed by computations of the interactions of larger and larger groups of water molecules, until the bulk properties of water had been determined.
* In chemistry, an abbreviation referring to [[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' quantum chemistry methods]].
* [[Ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|Ab initio methods]] in [[nuclear physics]].
* In biophysics, a method for the prediction of protein structures in protein folding.
* In [[aviation]], the very first stage of flight training.
* In [[bioinformatics]], ''ab initio'' is a method for making predictions about biological features using only a computational model without extrinsic comparison to existing data. In this context, it may be sometimes interchangeable with the Latin term ''[[:wikt:de novo|de novo]]''.

===Other uses===

* when describing literature, it is told from the beginning as opposed to ''[[in medias res]]'' (meaning starting in the middle of the story)
* when describing a subject or a module, say when a person is learning French from the beginning, they are said to be a student of French ''ab initio''
* in language didactics, foreign languages may be studied ''ab initio'', meaning that the course is designed for students with no previous knowledge.

[[Common (rapper)|Common]] served as the executive producer in the film.&lt;ref name="Kile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petski"/&gt;

==Plot==
Set in 1963, the film revolves around Melody Ellison, an African-American girl living in Detroit, Michigan with her mother Frances and her grandfather Frank. Early on she and her family faced racial inequality in their hometown, whether being bullied at school with a white student named Donald along with his friends for her ethnicity, or be wrongfully accused of [[shoplifting]] at a clothing store where Melody's mother works.

A turning point for Melody was when a fellow student expressed her intention of moving to another school out of fear for being discriminated, and when news about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] was aired on television, making her question the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] and consider moving to a school at her neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Petski"/&gt; Fearing that a similar bombing would happen at the chapel where Melody's family attend mass in, Melody tries to convince her mother not to perform at a fundraising concert for the Birmingham victims; Frances reassures her, and sees hope in her daughter. Melody puts her creative skill at clothing design to good use, upcycling an old garment into a shawl for her mother to wear at her piano performance.

At church she meets her teacher Miss Abbot, who brought the other students along as part of a field trip. Donald walks out as he refuses to take Melody along; Melody's best friend Tricia volunteers to accompany her instead. The concert takes place as planned, and Melody and the rest of the churchgoers then perform ''[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]''. The film ends with Melody and her mother being given an applause for their performance. A short tribute to the four young victims of the Birmingham bombing appears in a post-credits sequence.

==Early life==
[[File:Asia Argento et Dario Argento Cannes 1993.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Asia Argento and her father [[Dario Argento|Dario]] at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Her father is [[Dario Argento]], an Italian film director, producer and screenwriter, well known for his work in the Italian [[giallo]] genre and for his influence on modern [[Horror film|horror]] and [[Slasher film|slasher movies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jean|last=Noh|url=https://www.screendaily.com/comment/asia-argento-discusses-her-father-/5078292.article|title=Asia Argento discusses her father|magazine=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]|publisher=Media Business Insight|location=London, England|date=5 October 2014|access-date=27 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother is actress [[Daria Nicolodi]] and her maternal great-grandfather was composer [[Alfredo Casella]].&lt;ref name="filmier" /&gt;

When Argento was born in Rome, the city registry office refused to acknowledge "Asia" as an appropriate name, and instead officially inscribed her as "Aria" (a name accepted by the city registry). She nonetheless always went by the name Asia, which she later used professionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1997/10/12/cosi-la-mia-piccola-divento-aria.html?refresh_ce|title='E COSI' LA MIA PICCOLA DIVENTO' ARIA ARGENTO ... '|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|publisher= GEDI Gruppo Editorial|location=Rome, Italy|date=10 December 1997|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argento has said that as a child she was lonely and depressed, owing in part to her parents' work.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Rose|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1523446,00.html|title=Wild Child|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father used to read her his horror scripts as bedtime stories.&lt;ref name="swindle"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Caroline|last=Ryder|url=http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/asia-argento/|title=Asia Argento|magazine=[[Swindle (magazine)|Swindle]]|publisher=Shepard Fairey's Studio Number-One|location=Los Angeles, California|date=August 8, 2007|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808123020/http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/asia-argento/|archive-date=8 August 2007|accessdate=August 20, 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age eight, Argento published a book of poems.&lt;ref name="swindle"/&gt; At the age of 14, she ran away from home.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Argento has mentioned in interviews that she does not have a close relationship with her father.&lt;ref name="index"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Bruce|last=Labruce|url=http://www.indexmagazine.com/interviews/asia_argento.shtml|title=Interview with Asia Argento|magazine=[[Index Magazine]]|date=2001|accessdate=February 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sgirls"&gt;Daniel Robert Epstein. [http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Asia+Argento/ ''Interview with Asia Argento''.] SuicideGirls.com. 7 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She has mentioned that he was absent when she was a child, and has also mentioned that, because of this, she did not have a happy childhood.&lt;ref name="Filmmaker"/&gt; Regarding her relationship with her father and her reason for acting, she has stated that:

{{Quote|I never acted out of ambition; I acted to gain my father's attention. It took a long time for him to notice me – I started when I was nine, and he only cast me when I was 16. And he only became my father when he was my director. I always thought it was sick to choose looking at yourself on a big screen as your job. There has to be something crooked in your mind to want to be loved by everybody. It's like being a prostitute, to share that intimacy with all those people.}}

In an interview with ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]'' magazine, she stated that, at one time, "I was sick for a while; I was agoraphobic. I was afraid to go out of my apartment for a long time, I could only go out to work." &lt;ref name="Filmmaker"/&gt;

=== Harvey Weinstein scandal ===
Argento alleged in an October 2017 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article by [[Ronan Farrow]] that she had been [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|sexually assaulted]] by [[Harvey Weinstein]] in the 1990s. She also said that she had consensual sexual relations with him multiple times over the course of the next five years.

After being criticised for her account in Italian media and politics, Argento moved to Germany to escape what she described as a culture of "[[victim blaming]]" in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riley-Smith|first1=Ben|title=Italian actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of rape leaves country over hostile reaction|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/21/italian-actress-accused-harvey-weinstein-rape-leaves-country/|accessdate=21 October 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Argento delivered a speech on 20 May 2018, following the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]], calling the festival Weinstein's "hunting ground", alleging that she was raped by Weinstein in Cannes when she was 21.

===Alleged sexual assault of Jimmy Bennett===
On 19 August 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published allegations that Argento sexually assaulted actor [[Jimmy Bennett]], then 17, in a California hotel suite in 2013; she was 37 at the time.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_2018.08.19" /&gt; Argento had first met Bennett when he played Argento's son in the 2004 film ''[[The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things]]'' when Bennett was seven years old.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_2018.08.19" /&gt; According to Bennett, in their 2013 encounter Argento gave him alcohol, performed [[oral sex]] on him and engaged him in [[sexual intercourse]];&lt;ref name="NYTimes_2018.08.19" /&gt; she later paid him $380,000 as a settlement.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_2018.08.19" /&gt;

Argento denied the allegation of sexual assault. She said that she never had a sexual encounter with Bennett, and that when he made a request for money to her, her partner [[Anthony Bourdain]] paid him to avoid negative publicity.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 21 August 2018" /&gt; Following Argento's denials, a photograph of her topless in bed with Bennett was published, as well as her alleged admission of sex with him in text messages to [[Rain Dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arkin |first1=Daniel |title=Photo, text messages appear to contradict Asia Argento's denial of relationship |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/photo-text-messages-appear-contradict-asia-argento-s-denial-relationship-n902876 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |publisher=NBC News |date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter published online in September 2018, Argento's attorney admits there was a sexual encounter, but claims that Bennett "sexually attacked" Argento.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chloe|last=Melas|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/entertainment/asia-argento-jimmy-bennett-sexually-assaulted-her/index.html|title=Asia Argento’s attorney says 17-year-old sexually ‘attacked’ her|website=[[CNN]]|date=September 5, 2018|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the allegations, it was announced Argento has been dropped as a judge on ''[[X Factor (Italian TV series)|X-Factor Italy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Slingerland |first1=Calum |title=Asia Argento Dropped from 'X Factor Italy' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations |url=https://exclaim.ca/film/article/asia_argento_removed_from_x_factor_italy_after_sexual_misconduct_allegations |publisher=Exclaim!

==Recognition==
In 2012, Argento was highlighted in the retrospective ''Argento: Il Cinema Nel Sangue'' at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmuseum.org|title=The Museum of Arts and Design|author=|date=|website=Madmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retrospective celebrated the influence of the Argento family on filmmaking in Italy and around the world. It highlighted Asia's contribution as well as that of her and mother ([[Daria Nicolodi]]), [[Dario Argento|father]], grandfather (Salvatore), and uncle (Claudio).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argento: Il Cinema Nel Sangue|url=http://madmuseum.org/series/argento-il-cinema-nel-sangue|website=Museum of Arts and Design|publisher=Museum of Arts and Design|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dollar|first1=Steve|title=Importing Cinema of Great Import|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304444604577338071983627842|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones Inc|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kasman|first1=Daniel|title=The Design and Architecture of Terror: Dario Argento's "Deep Red"|url=https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/the-design-and-architecture-of-terror-dario-argentos-deep-red|website=Notebook|publisher=MUBI|date=3 August 2015|access-date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:A Cellier, H J Leslie, B C Stephenson.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Alfred Cellier]], H. J. Leslie and Stephenson, creators of ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'']]
'''Benjamin Charles Stephenson''' or '''B. C. Stephenson''' (1839 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1906) was an English dramatist, lyricist and librettist.  After beginning a career in the civil service, he started to write for the theatre, using the pen name "Bolton Rowe".  He was author or co-author of several long-running shows of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatre. His biggest hit was the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', which set records for the length of its original run.

His writing collaborators included [[Clement Scott]] and [[Brandon Thomas]], and composers with whom he worked included [[Frederic Clay]], [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] with whom he wrote ''[[The Zoo]]'', which continues to be revived today.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Stephenson, the son of Sir William Henry Stephenson, came from a family with a history of public service, both civil and military. His grandfather, also named [[Benjamin C. Stephenson|Benjamin Charles Stephenson]], was a [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]] and later one of the [[Commissioners of Woods and Forests]].&lt;ref name=general&gt;"Obituary, Major-Gen. Sir B. C. Stephenson", ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', Volume 12, July – December 1839, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The general had two sons, one of whom, Frederick, followed him into the army and rose to be a general.  See "Obituary, General Sir F. C. A. Stephenson", ''The Times'', 11 March 1911, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's father became a civil servant, rising to become chairman of the [[Inland Revenue|Board of Inland Revenue]].&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary, Sir William Henry Stephenson", ''The Times'', 2 March 1898, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The young Stephenson was commissioned into the Middlesex Militia&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Morning Post]]'', 31 October 1857, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and later entered the civil service.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;"Obituary, Mr. B. C. Stephenson", ''The Times'', 24 January 1906, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a civil servant, Stephenson began writing theatrical pieces. His grandfather, General B. C. Stephenson, had lived and died at a house in Bolton Row, [[Mayfair]], and the young Stephenson adopted "Bolton Rowe" as his pen name.&lt;ref name=general/&gt; Stephenson's first works were collaborations with the composer [[Frederic Clay]] in three pieces played by amateurs, ''The Pirate's Isle'', ''Out of Sight'' and ''The Bold Recruit'' (1868).  The last of these was repeated at a benefit, produced by [[Thomas German Reed]], at the [[Gallery of Illustration]] in 1870 as a companion piece to Clay and [[W.S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Ages Ago]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 24 July 1870, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson's first professional success came at the same venue, two years later, with a short [[operetta]], written with the composer [[Alfred Cellier]], ''Charity Begins at Home''.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was in the company's repertory for most of 1872, and was played more than 200 times.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', 16 November 1872, p. 1; and "Dramatic and Musical Chronology for 1872", ''The Era'', 5 January 1873, supplement.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson was still using the pseudonym "Bolton Rowe" when he wrote the libretto for [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s one-act [[comic opera]] ''[[The Zoo]]'' in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 6 June 1875, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; This work is still played today with some frequency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e. g., [http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/archive/archive_agilbertandsullivandoublebill.htm this information about a 2007 Finborough production]; and Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine vol. 66, Winter 2007 p. 5 about the Charles Court Opera production first performed the same year.&lt;/ref&gt; He then began a writing partnership with [[Clement Scott]], who adopted the matching pen name, "Saville Rowe" (after [[Savile Row]], another Mayfair street).&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 24 September 1876, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Together, for the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]], they wrote English versions of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s plays, ''Nos intimes'' (as ''Peril'') and ''Dora'' (1878 as ''Diplomacy''). The latter was described by the theatrical paper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "the great dramatic hit of the season".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 23 June 1878, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also played with success at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 7 April 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Scott wrote an English version of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]] and [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]]'s libretto for [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s operette, ''Le Petit Duc''. Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 28 April 1878, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===West End and Broadway success===
In 1880, Stephenson's work again featured in New York.  The reopened Broadway Opera House was inaugurated with a double bill of ''Ages Ago'' and ''Charity Begins at Home''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 28 March 1880, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson also supplied the libretto for a three-act [[grand opera]] version of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''The Masque of Pandora'', composed by Alfred Cellier, and presented in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 1 August 1880, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The next year in London, Stephenson collaborated with [[Brandon Thomas]] on a "new and critical comedy", ''Comrades'', for the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]], with a cast including [[Arthur Cecil]], [[Dion Boucicault Jr.|D. G. Boucicault]] and [[Marion Terry]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 19 December 1882, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Writing under his real name for the first time, Stephenson had a great success in 1882–83 with his play ''Impulse'', based on ''La Maison du mari'' by [[Xavier de Montépin]], which opened in December 1882 and ran through most of the next year.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 1 December 1882, p. 6; and 18 September 1883, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he adapted ''Der Probepfeil'' by [[Oscar Blumenthal]] as ''A Woman of the World'', which was staged at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], starring [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Helen Barry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le Follet: Journal du Grand Monde'', 1 February 1886, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Stephenson had his greatest success. He and Cellier wrote the [[comic opera]] ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]''.  The piece opened at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] on 25 September 1886, receiving lukewarm notices.  Much of Cellier's score was reused material from an earlier failure, and neither the music nor the libretto attracted critical praise. ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, "Gentility reigns supreme, and with it unfortunately also a good deal of the refined feebleness and the ineptitude which are the defects of that quality."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 September 1886, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Cellier revised the work, and it transferred in December to the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] with new stars, including [[Marie Tempest]].   ''Dorothy'' became a great success at the box office and transferred in 1888 to the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], where it ran until 1889.  Its initial run of a total of 931 performances was the longest of any piece of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;Gillan, Don.  [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html Longest Running Plays in London and New York, 1875 to 1920] at the Stage Beauty website (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics reconsidered their earlier condemnation, the work became regarded as a classic Victorian piece,&lt;ref&gt;"Dorothy", ''The Times'', 22 December 1908, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and the initially despised plot was traced seriously back to the Restoration playwrights [[David Garrick]] and [[Aphra Behn]], and to [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and even [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', 23 July 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Stephenson and Cellier later collaborated on another comic opera, ''[[Doris (opera)|Doris]]'' (1888), which, without rivalling ''Dorothy'', had a good run of more than 200 performances.

Stephenson's later work in musical theatre was less successful. For the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] he rewrote the libretto for ''The Golden Web'', an [[opera bouffe]] by the composer [[Arthur Goring Thomas]], which was first heard in 1893.  In spite of some positive critical attention, interest in the piece was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;"The Golden Web", ''[[The Musical Times]]'' March 1893, p. 152; and "Facts, Rumours, and Remarks", ''The Musical Times'', January 1893, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, two short operettas with music by [[Edward Jakobowski]], ''The Improvisatore'' and ''A Venetian Singer'', made little impact.&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', September 1893, p. 549 and "Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 11 November 1893, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ranch'', a musical farce with music by [[Edward Solomon]], failed to find a theatre to stage it. A libretto for [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], ''Christopher Patch, The Barber of Bath'', was set by Stanford but has never been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Frederick. "C. V. Stanford: Nova Bibliographica", ''The Musical Times'', October 1963, pp. 728–31&lt;/ref&gt; A libretto for [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]] remained, as McKenzie put it in 1898, "still in my desk".&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Campbell Mackenzie", ''The Musical Times'', June 1898, pp. 369–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In the non-musical theatre, Stephenson continued to prosper. By the 1890s he was sufficiently well known that his name as author of a play lent cachet.  In 1892 one British newspaper protested that a new play, advertised as the work of Stephenson and [[Augustus Harris]], was in fact the work of less-known writers.&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 5 March 1892, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Stephenson produced one of his more enduring works, ''Faithful James'', a one act comedy. It supplanted Gilbert's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'' in a triple bill running at the Court Theatre. The cast included [[Weedon Grossmith]], Brandon Thomas, [[Ellaline Terriss]] and [[Sybil Grey]].&lt;ref&gt;"Things Theatrical", ''The Sporting Times'', 23 July 1892, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among later revivals of the play was one in 1907 with [[Rutland Barrington]] in the title role of the bumbling butler.&lt;ref&gt;"Coronet Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 July 1907, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, Stephenson co-wrote a melodrama with [[Charles Haddon Chambers|Haddon Chambers]], ''The Fatal Card'', which was well received.&lt;ref&gt;"Adelphi Theatre: ''The Fatal Card''", ''The Sporting Times'', 8 September 1894, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Asked how he and his collaborator worked together, he said, "We divide the labour. I write all the vowels and Mr Chambers all the consonants."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sporting Times'', 15 September 1894, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Among revivals of Stephenson's works, during his life and after, were ''Dorothy'' (on several occasions, notably in 1908, when the critic of ''The Times'' called it "one of the most tuneful, most charming, and most shapely of English comic operas") and ''Diplomacy'', which was given in command performances for [[Queen Victoria]] in 1893 and [[George V]] in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres: The Command Performance of ''Diplomacy'', " ''The Times'', 24 January 1914 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and was revived again in 1924, starring [[Gladys Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Theatres: Miss Gladys Cooper's New Part: Revival of ''Diplomacy''", ''The Times'', 11 February 1924, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson died in [[Taplow]], [[Berkshire]], at the age of 66.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The '''Ballets Russes''' ({{IPA-fr|balɛ ʁys|lang}}) was an itinerant [[ballet]] company based in Paris that performed between 1909 and 1929 throughout Europe and on tours to North and South America. The company never performed in Russia, where the [[Russian Revolution|Revolution]] disrupted society. After its initial Paris season, the company had no formal ties there.&lt;ref&gt;Garafola (1998), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally conceived by [[impresario]] [[Sergei Diaghilev]], the Ballets Russes is widely regarded as the most influential ballet company of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/ART309940 |title=Diaghilev's Golden Age of the Ballets Russes dazzles London with V&amp;A display |publisher=Culture24 |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it promoted ground-breaking artistic collaborations among young choreographers, composers, designers, and dancers, all at the forefront of their several fields. Diaghilev commissioned works from composers such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], and [[Sergei Prokofiev]], artists such as [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Henri Matisse]], and costume designers [[Léon Bakst]] and [[Coco Chanel]].

The company's productions created a huge sensation, &lt;!-- around the world --&gt;completely reinvigorating the art of performing dance, bringing many visual artists to public attention, and significantly affecting the course of musical composition.&lt;!-- Its ballets have been variously interpreted as Classical, Neo-Classical, Romantic, Neo-Romantic, Avant-Garde, Expressionist, Abstract, and Orientalist.--&gt; It also introduced European and American audiences to tales, music, and design motifs drawn from Russian folklore. The influence of the Ballets Russes lasts to the present day.

==Nomenclature==
The French plural form of the name, ''“Ballets Russes,”'' specifically refers to the company founded by Sergei Diaghilev and active during his lifetime.  (In some publicity the company was advertised as ''Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghileff.'')  In English, the company is now commonly referred to as "the Ballets Russes" (plural, without italics), although in the early part of the 20th century, it was sometimes referred to as “The Russian Ballet” or “Diaghilev’s Russian Ballet.”  To add to the confusion, some publicity material spelled the name in the singular&lt;!-- , as in this programme of the company's last season at Covent Garden in 1929--&gt;.

The names “[[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]]” and “The [[Original Ballet Russe]]” (using the singular) refer to companies that formed after Diaghilev's death in 1929.

==History and productions==
[[File:Sergei Diaghilev 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sergei Diaghilev]], founder of the Ballets Russes ]]

=== Background ===
[[Sergei Diaghilev]], the company's [[impresario]] (or "[[artistic director]]" in modern terms), was chiefly responsible for its success. He was uniquely prepared for the role; born into a wealthy Russian family of vodka distillers (though they went bankrupt when he was 18), he was accustomed to moving in the upper-class circles that provided the company's patrons and benefactors.

In 1890, he enrolled at the Faculty of Law, St. Petersburg, to prepare for a career in the civil service like many Russian young men of his class.&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt;  There he was introduced (through his cousin [[Dmitry Filosofov]]) to a student clique of artists and intellectuals calling themselves [[Nevsky Pickwickians|The Nevsky Pickwickians]] whose most influential member was [[Alexandre Benois]]; others included [[Léon Bakst]], [[Walter Nouvel]], and [[Konstantin Somov]].&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Although Diaghilev was at first considered to be ... under the tutelage of Benois, he became one of the most savvy critics of Russian art. They believed that "art is free, life is paralyzed."--&gt;From childhood, Diaghilev had been passionately interested in music. However, his ambition to become a composer was dashed in 1894 when [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] told him he had no talent.&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;438, n.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, several members of [[Nevsky Pickwickians|The Pickwickians]] founded the journal ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' (''World of Art'') under the editorship of Diaghilev.&lt;ref&gt;Garofala (1998), p.&amp;nbsp;151.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1902, ''Mir iskusstva'' included reviews of concerts, operas, and ballets in Russia. The latter were chiefly written by Benois, who exerted considerable influence on Diaghilev's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Simon.  "The 'World of Art' and Music," in ''[Mir Iskusstva]:  Russia's Age of Elegance.'' Palace Editions.  Omaha, Minneapolis, and Princeton, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;38.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mir iskusstva'' also sponsored exhibitions of Russian art in St. Petersburg, culminating in Diaghilev's important 1905 show of Russian portraiture at the [[Tauride Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Guroff, Greg.  "Introduction" in ''[Mir Iskusstva]:  Russia's Age of Elegance.'' Palace Editions.  Omaha, Minneapolis, and Princeton, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Macke Russisches Ballett 1.jpg|alt=painting of a ballet performance on stage|thumb|''Ballet Russes'' by [[August Macke]], 1912]]

Frustrated by the extreme conservatism of the Russian art world, Diaghilev organized the groundbreaking ''Exhibition of Russian Art'' at the [[Petit Palais]] in Paris in 1906, the first major showing of Russian art in the West. Its enormous success created a Parisian fascination with all things Russian. Diaghilev organized a 1907 season of Russian music at the [[Paris Opera|Paris Opéra]]. In 1908, Diaghilev returned to the Paris Opéra with six performances of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]],'' starring basso [[Fyodor Chaliapin]]. This was [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s 1908 version (with additional cuts and re-arrangement of the scenes). The performances were a sensation, though the costs of producing grand opera were crippling. 

===Debut===
In 1909, Diaghilev presented his first Paris "Saison Russe" devoted exclusively to ballet (although the company did not use the name "Ballets Russes" until the following year). Most of this original company were resident performers at the [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[Saint Petersburg]], hired by Diaghilev to perform in Paris during the Imperial Ballet's summer holidays. The first season's repertory featured a variety of works chiefly choreographed by [[Michel Fokine]], including ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'', the ''[[Polovtsian Dances]]'' (from ''[[Prince Igor]]''), ''[[Les Sylphides]]'', and ''[[Cléopâtre (ballet)|Cléopâtre]]''. The season also included ''Le Festin'', a pastiche set by several choreographers (including Fokine) to music by several Russian composers. 

&lt;!--
===Paris Seasons to 1914===
;1910
The 1910 Ballets Russes season featured the debut of ''[[The Firebird]]'' with music by [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], choreography by [[Michel Fokine|Fokine]], stage sets by [[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Golovin]], and costumes by Golovin and [[Leon Bakst|Bakst]].  It was the first of Diaghilev's productions whose score was expressly composed for the Ballets Russes, and it made Stravinsky famous overnight.  Other 1910 productions included:  ''Scheherezade'' (choreographed to the symphonic poem by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]); ''Carnaval'' (choreographed by Fokine to the piano work by [[Robert Schumann]], orchestrated by several Russian composers);  [MORE]; and a revival of the classical Russian ballet ''[[Giselle]]'' (choreography by xx).

;1911
The 1911 season is best remembered for [[Igor Stravinsky|Igor Stravinsky's]] second commissioned score:  ''[[Petrushka]]'' (with choreography by Fokine, stage sets and costumes by Bakst). Although the ballet received only four performances at the end of the season, it was soon hailed as one of the great collaborations of the early 20th century.  Another sensation was created with ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'', to [[Carl Maria von Weber|Carl Maria von Weber's]] ''[[Invitation to the Dance]]'' as orchestrated by [[Hector Berlioz]] (choreography by Fokine, sets and costumes by Bakst).  The work featured the dancing of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Tamara Karsavina]].

When Sergei Diaghilev died of diabetes in Venice on 19 August 1929, the Ballets Russes was left with substantial debts. As the [[Great Depression]] began, its property was claimed by its creditors and the company of dancers dispersed.

In 1931, Colonel [[Wassily de Basil]] (a Russian émigré entrepreneur from Paris) and [[René Blum (ballet)|René Blum]] (ballet director at the [[Monte Carlo Opera]]) founded the [[Original Ballet Russe|Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], giving its first performances there in 1932.&lt;ref name="Amanda"&gt;Amanda. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/ballets-russes/2005/07/16/1121455937588.html "Ballets Russes"], ''[[The Age]]'' (17 July 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Diaghilev alumni [[Léonide Massine]] and [[George Balanchine]] worked as choreographers with the company and [[Tamara Toumanova]] was a principal dancer.

Artistic differences led to a split between Blum and de Basil,&lt;ref name="Homans"&gt;Homans, Jennifer. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/books/review/book-review-rene-blum-and-the-ballets-russes-by-judith-chazin-bennahum.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "René Blum: Life of a Dance Master,"] ''New York Times'' (July 8, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; after which de Basil renamed his company initially "Ballets Russes de Colonel W. de Basil".&lt;ref name="Answers"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=2010-03-28 | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/les-ballets-russes-de-monte-carlo | title=Les Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo | publisher=The Oxford Dictionary of Dance | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blum retained the name "Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo", while de Basil created a new company. In 1938, he called it "The Covent Garden Russian Ballet"&lt;ref name="Answers" /&gt; and then renamed it the "[[Original Ballet Russe]]" in 1939.&lt;ref name="Answers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tennant, Victoria|title=Irina Baronova and the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I64bBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=14 June 2016|year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-16716-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]] began, the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]] left Europe and toured extensively in the United States and South America. As dancers retired and left the company, they often founded dance studios in the United States or South America or taught at other former company dancers' studios.  With Balanchine's founding of the [[School of American Ballet]], and later the [[New York City Ballet]], many outstanding former Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo dancers went to New York to teach in his school. When they toured the United States, [[Cyd Charisse]], the film actress and dancer, was taken into the cast.

The [[Original Ballet Russe]] toured mostly in Europe. Its alumni were influential in teaching classical Russian ballet technique in European schools.

The successor companies were the subject of the 2005 documentary film ''[[Ballets Russes (film)|Ballets Russes]]''.

==The dancers==
[[File:Ballets Russes Apollon 1928.jpg|alt=ballet dancers posing in a montage|thumb|Scene from ''[[Apollon musagète]]'', 1928. Dancers: [[Serge Lifar]], [[Alexandra Danilova|Danilova]], Chernysheva, [[Felia Doubrovska|Dubrovska]], Petrova|left]]
The Ballets Russes was noted for the high standard of its dancers, most of whom had been classically trained at the great Imperial schools in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Their high technical standards contributed a great deal to the company's success in Paris, where dance technique had declined markedly since the 1830s.

Principal female dancers included: [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Tamara Karsavina]], [[Olga Spessivtseva]], [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], [[Ida Rubinstein]], [[Bronislava Nijinska]], [[Lydia Lopokova]], [[Diana Gould (dancer)|Diana Gould]] and [[Alicia Markova]], among others; many earned international renown with the company. Prima ballerina [[Xenia Makletzova]] was dismissed from the company in 1916 and sued by Diaghilev; she countersued for breach of contract, and won $4500 in a Massachusetts court.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Banni-Viñas, [https://doi.org/10.1093/ajlh/53.3.353 "Correcting a Ballerina's Story: The Truth behind Makletzova v. Diaghileff"] ''American Journal of Legal History'' 53(3)(July 2013): 353-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/227/227mass100.html Xenia P. Makletzova v. Sergei Diaghileff], 227 Mass. 100, March 13 1917 — May 25 1917, Suffolk County MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ballets Russes was even more remarkable for raising the status of the male dancer, largely ignored by choreographers and ballet audiences since the early 19th century. Among the male dancers were [[Michel Fokine]], [[Serge Lifar]], [[Léonide Massine]], [[Anton Dolin]], [[George Balanchine]], [[Valentin Zeglovsky]], [[Theodore Kosloff]], [[Adolph Bolm]], and the legendary [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], considered the most popular and talented dancer in the company's history.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], in later years, younger dancers were taken from those trained in Paris by former Imperial dancers, within the large community of Russian exiles. Recruits were even accepted from America and included a young [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]] who joined the troupe in Monte Carlo during 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/page_essay_meglin.pdf ''Ruth Page - Early Architect of the American Ballet''  a biographical essay by Joellen A.

==The choreographers==
The company featured and premiered now-famous (and sometimes notorious) works by the great [[choreography|choreographers]] [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Michel Fokine]], as well as new works by [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], [[Bronislava Nijinska]], [[Léonide Massine]], and the young [[George Balanchine]] at the start of his career.

===Michel Fokine===
The choreography of [[Michel Fokine]] was of paramount importance in the initial success of the Ballets Russes.  Fokine had graduated from the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg in 1898, and eventually become First Soloist at the [[Mariinsky Theater]].  In 1907, Fokine choreographed his first work for the Imperial Russian Ballet, ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]''. In the same year, he created ''Chopiniana'' to piano music by the composer [[Frédéric Chopin]] as orchestrated by [[Alexander Glazunov]]. This was an early example of creating choreography to an existing score rather than to music specifically written for the ballet, a departure from the normal practice at the time.

Fokine established an international reputation with his works choreographed during the first four seasons (1909–1912) of the Ballets Russes. These included the ''[[Polovtsian Dances]]'' (from ''[[Prince Igor]]''), ''Le Pavillon d'Armide'' (a revival of his 1907 production for the Imperial Russian Ballet), ''[[Les Sylphides]]'' (a reworking of his earlier ''Chopiniana''), ''[[The Firebird]]'', ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'', ''[[Petrushka]]'', and ''[[Daphnis and Chloé]]'' . After a longstanding tumultuous relationship with Diaghilev, Fokine left the Ballets Russes at the end of the 1912 season.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (2000), p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaslav Nijinsky===
[[File:Nijinsky in Scheherazade2.jpg|thumb|Vaslav Nijinsky in ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]''

|315x315px]]&lt;!--Nijinsky's performance with Tamara Karsavina in the "Bluebird" pas de deux ..."when those two came on, good Lord! I have never seen such a public. You would have thought their seats were on fire."&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Richard, ''Diaghilev'', 1979, ISBN 0-297-775065, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

[[Vaslav Nijinsky]] had attended the [[Imperial Ballet School]], St. Petersburg since the age of eight.  He graduated in 1907 and joined the Imperial Ballet where he immediately began to take starring roles. Diaghilev invited him to join the Ballets Russes for its first Paris season.

In 1912, Diaghilev gave Nijinsky his first opportunity as a choreographer, for his production of ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'Après-midi d'un faune]]'' to [[Claude Debussy]]'s symphonic poem ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]''.  Featuring Nijinsky himself as the Faun, the ballet's frankly erotic nature caused a sensation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The following year, Nijinsky choreographed a new work by Debussy composed expressly for the Ballets Russes, ''[[Jeux]]''. Indifferently received by the public, ''Jeux'' was eclipsed two weeks later by the premiere of [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (''Le Sacre du printemps''), also choreographed by Nijinsky.

&lt;!--as well as the set designer [[Roerich]]. In Nijinsky's time, the work was shocking and controversial, both for the music and wildness of the dance. As a result, many people in the theater on opening night created a near riot. Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer have since reconstructed the piece, including sets and costumes, and set it on the Joffrey Ballet. --&gt; 
Because of mental illness, Nijinsky eventually retired from dance; he was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].
===Léonide Massine===
[[Léonide Massine]] was born in Moscow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Leonide Massine|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/choreographers/massine_l.html|publisher=[[American Ballet Theatre]]|accessdate=17 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213084747/http://abt.org/education/archive/choreographers/massine_l.html| archivedate= 13 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied both acting and dancing at the Imperial School.  On the verge of becoming an actor, Massine was invited by Sergei Diaghilev to join the Ballets Russes, as he was seeking a replacement for Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev encouraged Massine's creativity and his entry into choreography.

Massine's most famous creations for the Ballets Russes were ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'', and ''[[Pulcinella]]''.  In all three of these works, he collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso]], who designed the sets and costumes.
 
Massine extended Fokine's choreographic innovations, especially those relating to narrative and character.  His ballets incorporated both folk dance and ''demi-charactère'' dance, a style using classical technique to perform [[character dance]]. Massine created contrasts in his choreography, such as synchronized yet individual movement, or small-group dance patterns within the ''[[corps de ballet]]''.[[File:Harvard Theatre Collection - Saison Russe 1913, Petrouchka, MS Thr 965 (7) retouched.jpg|thumb|[[Bronislava Nijinska]] in ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''|left|246x246px]]
===Bronislava Nijinska===
[[Bronislava Nijinska]] was the younger sister of [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. She trained at the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, joining the Imperial Ballet company in 1908. From 1909, she (like her brother) was a member of Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.

In 1915, Nijinska and her husband fled to Kiev to escape World War I.  There, she founded the École de movement, where she trained Ukrainian artists in modern dance.  Her most prominent pupil was [[Serge Lifar]] (who later joined the Ballets Russes in 1923).

Following the Russian Revolution, Nijinska fled again to Poland, and then, in 1921, re-joined the Ballets Russes in Paris.  In 1923, Diaghilev assigned her the choreography of Stravinsky's ''[[Les Noces]].''  The result combines elements of her brother's choreography for ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with more traditional aspects of ballet, such as dancing ''[[Pointe technique|en pointe.]]'' The following year, she choreographed three new works for the company: ''[[Les biches]]'', ''Les Fâcheux'', and ''[[Le Train Bleu (ballet)|Le train bleu]]''.

{{Clear}}

===George Balanchine===
Born Giorgi Melitonovitch Balanchivadze in Saint Petersburg, [[George Balanchine]] was trained at the Imperial School of Ballet.  His education there was interrupted by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].  Balanchine graduated in 1921, after the school reopened.  He subsequently studied music theory, composition, and advanced piano at the [[Petrograd Conservatory]], graduating in 1923. During this time, he worked with the ''corps de ballet'' of the [[Mariinsky Theater]].  In 1924, Balanchine (and his first wife, ballerina [[Tamara Geva]]) fled to Paris while on tour of Germany with the Soviet State Dancers.  He was invited by Sergei Diaghilev to join the Ballets Russes as a choreographer.&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Joseph. ''Artists in Exile: How Refugees from Twentieth-Century War and Revolution Transformed the American Performing Arts'', New York: Harper Collins, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Balanchine choreographed ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollon musagète]]'' and ''[[The Prodigal Son (ballet)|Le fils prodigue]]'' for the company. 
--&gt;

==The designers==
Diaghilev invited the collaboration of contemporary fine artists in the design of sets and costumes.  These included [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Léon Bakst]], [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Natalia Goncharova]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Coco Chanel]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Pavel Tchelitchev]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], and [[Georges Rouault]].

Their designs contributed to the groundbreaking excitement of the company's productions. The scandal caused by the premiere performance in Paris of Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' has been partly attributed to the provocative aesthetic of the costumes of the Ballets Russes.&lt;ref name="Albert 2010"&gt;{{cite news | title=Inside the dress circle | author=Albert, Jane | date=2010-12-11 | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald, "Spectrum" section | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexandre Benois===
[[Alexandre Benois]] had been the most influential member of The [[Nevsky Pickwickians]] and was one of the original founders (with Bakst and Diaghilev) of ''[[Mir iskusstva]]''. His particular interest in ballet as an art form strongly influenced Diaghilev and was seminal in the formation of the Ballets Russes. In addition, Benois contributed scenic and costume designs to several of the company's earlier productions: ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'', portions of ''Le Festin'', and ''[[Giselle]]''. Benois also participated with [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Michel Fokine]] in the creation of ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', to which he contributed much of the scenario as well as the stage sets and costumes.

===Léon Bakst===
[[File:Pablo Picasso and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for Parade (Ballets Russes) at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris, 1917, Lachmann photographer.jpg|thumb|320x320px|[[Pablo Picasso]] (wearing a beret) and scene painters sitting on the front cloth for the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'']]
[[Léon Bakst]] was also an original member of both The [[Nevsky Pickwickians]] and ''[[Mir iskusstva]]''. He participated as designer in productions of the Ballets Russes from its beginning in 1909 until 1921, creating sets and costumes for ''[[Scheherazade (ballet)|Scheherazade]]'', ''[[The Firebird]]'', [["Les Orientales"|''Les Orientales'']], ''[[Le Spectre de la rose]]'', ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'Après-midi d'une faune]]'', and ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'', among other productions.

===Pablo Picasso===
{{main article|Picasso and the Ballets Russes}}
In 1917, [[Pablo Picasso]] designed sets and costumes in the [[Cubist]] style for three Diaghilev ballets, all with choreography by [[Léonide Massine]]:  ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'', and ''[[Pulcinella]]''.

===Natalia Goncharova===
[[Natalia Goncharova]] was born in 1881 near [[Tula, Russia]]. Her art was inspired by Russian folk art, [[Fauvism]], and cubism. She began designing for the Ballets Russes in 1921.

Although the Ballets Russes firmly established the 20th-century tradition of fine art theatre design, the company was not unique in its employment of fine artists.  For instance, [[Savva Mamontov]]'s Private Opera Company had made a policy of employing fine artists, such as [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Aleksandr Golovin (artist)|Golovin]], who went on to work for the Ballets Russes.

==The composers and conductors==
[[File:Stravinsky-Nijinsky-Petrouchka.jpg|left|thumb|350x350px|[[Igor Stravinsky]] with [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] in costume for ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''.]]
For his new productions, Diaghilev commissioned the foremost composers of the 20th century, including: [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Erik Satie|Satie]], [[Ottorino Respighi|Respighi]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Manuel de Falla|de Falla]], and [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]]. He was also responsible for commissioning the first two significant British-composed ballets: ''Romeo and Juliet'' (composed in 1925 by nineteen-year-old [[Constant Lambert]]) and ''The Triumph of Neptune'' (composed in 1926 by [[Lord Berners]]).

The impresario also engaged conductors who were or became eminent in their field during the 20th century, including [[Pierre Monteux]] (1911–16 and 1924), [[Ernest Ansermet]] (1915–23), [[Edward Clark (conductor)|Edward Clark]] (1919–20) and [[Roger Désormière]] (1925–29).&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Buckle|Buckle, Richard]]. Diaghilev. Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igor Stravinsky===
Diaghilev hired the young Stravinsky at a time when he was virtually unknown to compose the music for ''[[The Firebird]]'', after the composer [[Anatoly Lyadov]] proved unreliable, and this was instrumental in launching Stravinsky's career in Europe and the United States of America.

Stravinsky's early ballet scores were the subject of much discussion. ''The Firebird'' (1910) was seen as an astonishingly accomplished work for such a young artist ([[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] is said to have remarked drily: "Well, you've got to start somewhere!"). Many contemporary audiences found ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) to be almost unbearably dissonant and confused. ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913) nearly caused an audience riot. It stunned people because of its willful rhythms and aggressive dynamics. The audience's negative reaction to it is now regarded as a theatrical scandal as notorious as the failed runs of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'' at Paris in 1861 and [[Jean-Georges Noverre]]'s ''[[Les Fêtes Chinoises]]'' in London on the eve of the [[Seven Years' War]]. However, Stravinsky's early ballet scores are now widely considered masterpieces of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/milestones/991110.motm.riteofspring.html|title=Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring"|author=Thomas Kelly|year=1999|publisher=National Public Radio|location=Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Clear}}

==Film of a performance==
Diaghilev always maintained that no camera could ever do justice to the artistry of his dancers, and it was long believed there was no film legacy of the Ballets Russes.  However, in 2011 a 30-second newsreel film of a performance in [[Montreux, Switzerland]], in June 1928 came to light.  The ballet was ''[[Les Sylphides]]'' and the lead dancer was identified as [[Serge Lifar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/jan/31/ballet-russes-captured-on-film Maev Kennedy, "Ballets Russes brought back to life on film", ''The Guardian'', 1 February 2011].Retrieved 10 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centennial exhibitions and celebrations==
[[File:Russia-2000-stamp-Sergei Diaghilev.jpg|alt=Stamp with drawings of Diaghilev and several ballet dancers|thumb|Russian stamp: [[Sergei Diaghilev]]]]
'''Paris, 2008''': In September 2008, on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Ballets Russes, [[Sotheby's]] announced the staging of an exceptional exhibition of works lent mainly by French, British and Russian private collectors, museums and foundations. Some 150 paintings, designs, costumes, theatre decors, drawings, sculptures, photographs, manuscripts, and programs were exhibited in Paris, retracing the key moments in the history of the Ballets Russes. On display were costumes designed by [[André Derain]] (''[[La Boutique fantasque]]'', 1919) and [[Henri Matisse]] (''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', 1920), and [[Léon Bakst]].

Posters recalling the surge of creativity that surrounded the Ballets Russes included [[Pablo Picasso]]'s iconic image of the Chinese Conjuror for the audacious production of ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' and [[Jean Cocteau]]'s poster for ''[[Le Spectre de la rose]]''. Costumes and stage designs presented included works by [[Alexandre Benois|Alexander Benois]], for ''[[Le Pavillon d'Armide]]'' and ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]''; Léon Bakst, for ''[[La Péri (Dukas)|La Péri]]'' and ''[[Le Dieu bleu]]''; [[Mikhail Larionov]], for ''Le Soleil à Minuit''; and [[Natalia Goncharova]], for ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1925 version). The exhibition also included important contemporary artists, whose works reflected the visual heritage of the Ballets Russes – notably an installation made of colorfully painted paper by the renowned Belgian artist [[Isabelle de Borchgrave]], and items from the [[Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg|Imperial Porcelain Factory]] in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ballets-russes.com/paris.html| title=Dancing into Glory: The Golden Age of the Ballets Russes |publisher=''Ballets-Russes.com'' |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin Wintergarten Potsdamer Straße 2010.jpg|right|thumb|Wintergarten, Potsdamer Strasse, 2010]]
The '''Berlin Wintergarten theatre''' was a large [[Music hall|variety theatre]] in [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.berlin.de/tickets/theater/tipps/buehnen/2225303-2903274-wintergarten-variete.html Berlin.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened in 1887 and was destroyed by bombs in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/the-wintergarten-theatre-in-berlin-germany-circa-1926-it-news-photo/152448311 Getty Images]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was taken on by a theatre in Potsdamer Strasse in 1992.

The [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] showcased the first short movie presentation ever at the theatre in 1895, making it the first [[movie theater]] in history. But it was a multi-use variety theatre, not a true kino.  As Erwin Panofsky recalls, in about 1905 "there was only one obscure and faintly disreputable ''kino'' in the whole city of Berlin, bearing, for some unfathomable reason, the English name of 'The Meeting Room'".&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky,E, "Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures", &lt;u&gt;Transition&lt;/u&gt;, 26, (1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is assigned to them in honour of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], founder of the [[Great Western Railway]], and designer of the giant ship {{SS|Great Eastern}}.

== History ==

The ''Brunel Awards'' were first awarded in 1985, during the celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the [[Great Western Railway]].

Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] presented the inaugural awards, at a ceremony in [[Bristol]], England.

'''Chinsō''' 頂相 (alternatively pronounced Chinzō) are commemorative portraits of [[Zen master|Zen masters]], a traditional form of East Asian art, specifically Zen art. They can be painted or sculpted and usually present a Zen master ceremonially dressed and seated upright in chair&lt;ref name="''baroni''"&gt;Baroni, Helen Josephine. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism. The Rosen Publishing, Group Inc, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. Chinsō include realistic portraits of prominent Zen monks, possibly commissioned by them and painted while they were alive or shortly after they died, as well as depictions of famous Zen patriarchs from the past&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;commissioned by his disciples&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sherman E. Reflections of Reality in Japanese Art. The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Chinsō were believed to have been passed down by Zen masters to their disciples as a symbol of [[Dharma transmission|dharma transmission]], and known to have been meant for use in rituals, especially to represent the deceased during memorial services, and as an icon for their followers&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;. Before monks would die, they would sometimes write a simple poem in the upper part of their portrait called [[Eulogy|eulogy]], or have another author or monk write an inscription at the top. In Japan many remaining sculptural Buddhist chinsō are made out of wood, which may explain why so few remain in China and Korea on account of the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|Huichang persecution]] when most wooden sculptures perished&lt;ref&gt;Pat, Youngsook. Handbook of Korean Art Buddhist Sculpture. Yekyong Publishing Co, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the oldest surviving chinsō of Chan masters were brought from China to Japan; about 12 of those are extant&lt;ref name="''folk''"&gt;Foulk T. Griffith, Sharf Robert H. On the Ritual Use of Ch'an Portraiture in Medieval China. In: Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie, Vol. 7, 1993. pp. 149-219.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Background and History ==
[[File:Zhongfeng Mingben.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Chinese Monk Zhongfeng Mingben|332x332px]]Chinsō flourished during the [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1279-1368) dynasties in China, and were introduced in Japan during the Kamakura period (1185-1333). They are considered historically significant because of their antiquity, preservation and artistic quality&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. There are about 70 known surviving chinsō from China and Japan from the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries that are designated “national treasures,” but about ten times that number have survived in Japanese museums and temple collections&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;.

=== In China ===
[[File:Portrait of the Monk Zhongfeng Mingben, 14th century.jpg|thumb|Another portrait of Monk Zhongfeng Mingben|363x363px]]Chinsō emerged from mainstream traditions of Chinese portraiture during the Song dynasty (960-1279)&lt;ref name="''lippit''"&gt;Lippit, Yukio. “Negative Verisimilitude: The Zen Portrait in Medieval Japan.” In Asian Art History in the Twenty-First Century, edited by Vishaka Desai, 64-95. Williamstown: Sterling and Francine Clari Art Institute, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;. Nothing visually distinguished them from other portraits done at the time of Chinese elite; the formal qualities were all the same&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Chinsō are mainly understood to follow this basic formula: the monk is seated cross legged in a chair, feet hidden, with his shoes on a footstool in front of him, in a three quarter view, and ceremonially dressed with inner and outer robes and a kasaya or surplice draped over his left shoulder&lt;ref name="''baroni''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The surplice is can be held together with an ornamental ring right over the monk’s heart&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. He usually holds something in his right hand, like a whisk, scepter, staff or bamboo&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. They follow the highest standard for painting at the time&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. As well as following the same basic formula of Chinese portraiture, chinsō assumed the characteristics of Chinese portraiture in general. These included private ownership, verse inscriptions, their role in social networks&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Surviving chinsō also include many works created in Japan once Zen Buddhism was brought there from China&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;.
[[File:Portrait of Zen Monk Ikkyū Sōjun (1394-1481).jpg|left|thumb|Portrait of Japanese Monk Ikkyū Sōjun(1394-1481)|360x360px]]
[[File:Portrait of Ikkyū Sōjun.jpg|left|thumb|Another Portrait of Ikkyū Sōjun|160x160px]]
=== In Japan ===
When Zen Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese style of portraiture as well as these traditions surrounding chinsō, were brought with them. This realistic style was not typical in Japan and set chinsō apart from other portraits at the time in Japan because of their high degree of verisimilitude&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Although most easily identifiable chinsō have the subject seated in a chair, in three quarter profile against a black background, with an inscription at the top, not all chinsō followed this rigid formula&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The portraits of Japanese monks Mokuan Shuyu and [[Ikkyū|Ikkyu Sojun]] represent this identifiable formula, but the alternative version of Ikkyu Sojun does not. Instead of being seated in three quarter view, the monk or patriarch could be shown frontally, or as a full figure, and could be in a circular frame instead of simply as a figure against a blank background. Less common are chinsō showing a monk in meditation in a landscape setting, where he could be either walking or sitting. Chinsō are usually inscribed at the top with a eulogy written in free verse, describing who the patriarch was, why it was made and possibly who wrote the eulogy and why. Some scholars distinguish chinsō from the soshizō 祖師像 category, which includes portraits of legendary patriarchs from the distant past, by checking whether or not the portrait is inscribed. It’s also important to note that the soshizō were not as realistic as the chinsō.
== Origin of the term chinsō ==
Chinsō, or dingxiang in Chinese, is a Chinese Buddhist neologism, and was originally a translation for the Sanskrit term [[Usnisa|uṣṇīṣa]]&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The usnisa is the term coined for the fleshy protuberance on top of the Buddha’s head&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. In India it was said to be invisible because it is unable to be seen by living beings&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. During the Song dynasty in China, the term chinsō began being used for portraits of Zen monks as we know the term today&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. The existence of a protuberance on top of a Buddha’s head represented the fact he had reached enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj. The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development. Munshiram Manoharial Publishers, New Delhi, 1996. &lt;/ref&gt;, similar to how chinsō were thought to prove enlightenment when passed down from a monk to his disciple. 

== Functions of chinsō ==
Chinsō have been known to serve many purposes throughout their history. The category includes portraits commissioned by the Zen monks themselves and painted while they are alive or shortly after they had died, and portraits commissioned by famous Zen patriarchs’ disciples to be used for worship. Scholars have also concluded that they could have been used as certificates or proof of dharma transmission&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. By proof of dharma transmission, it is meant that the portraits were thought to have been passed down from Zen master to their disciples when they became enlightened, since dharma transmission is the recognition of the enlightenment in a monk’s successor and the passing down of lineage. This theory has since been questioned by scholars&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Since the category of chinsō is so broad and includes portraits used for worship as well as portraits used to represent dharma transmission, the category could use stricter guidelines for classifying portrait as chinsō. The true function of chinsō is under questions by scholars for the purpose of clarifying the category&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;.

More recently (since about 1994) it has come to the attention of scholars that chinsō were used in a mortuary context, rather than used to certify or authenticate dharma transmission. This was particularly the case in China.  They were used after monks had died, meaning that they were used like other icons are: as a receptacle for a deity in a ritual context&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;, like objects of worship in temples. An article by T. Griffith Foulk and Robert Sharf published in 1994 attempted to demystify this part of Zen culture by clarifying that chinsō did not serve as evidence of dharma transmission but are simply a category of Buddhist portraiture used in a mortuary context&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. Their inscriptions provide possible legitimization to lineage of transmission and possible affiliation, but are said to not have been given for the sole purpose of certifying enlightenment. This argument is supported by their claims that chinsō, unlike more important items for representing transmission like a monk’s robes, were passed out freely in China to “laymen, novices, merchants, and the like”&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Their argument goes on to say chinsō could have just been part of the regular gift giving tradition. Different recipients of chinsō include designated dharma heirs associated with specific linages, another meaningful relation to the monk, who received the portrait as a gift or an anonymous person who received the portrait at a fundraiser (a “hauzshu” in Chinese)&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The purpose and usage of chinsō is still in question by scholars. 
[[File:Statue of the monk Chikotsu Dai'e.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Monk Chikotsu Dai'e]]
Some dharma lineages have been heavily influenced by portraiture&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. For example, the Portrait of Chikotsu Dai’e established Chikotsu Dai’e 癡兀大慧 (1229-1312) as a disciple of the Chan monk Enni Ben’e 円爾弁円(1202-1280) because the inscription of the chinsō is similar to that of Enni Ben’en’s on his own portrait, and Enni’s is similar to that of his predecessor [[Wuzhun Shifan|Wuzun Shifan]] 無準師範 (1178-1249), a Chinese Chan monk&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The portrait of Wuzun Shih-fan was brought by his disciple Enni Ben’en to Japan in 1241 and is one of the oldest surviving chinsō&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Chikotsu Dai’e’s portrait thus establishes the genealogical sequence of Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni and then to Chikotsu&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''folk''" /&gt;. Even though it is unclear if chinsō served as certificates of dharma transmission, throughout history they have been used to show a direct line of dharma transmission and lineage&lt;ref name="''lippit''" /&gt;. The portraits of these three monks show a clear acknowledgment of enlightenment from one monk to his disciple, from Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni Ben’en to Chikotsu Dai’e. Although each monk may not have passed down their chinsō to his disciple as proof of transmission, we can undertsand the history of lineage as being shown through the passing down of the portraits.

An '''order''' in architecture is a certain assemblage of parts subject to uniform established proportions, regulated by the office that each part has to perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=6-1LAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=%22An%20order%20in%20architecture%20is%20a%20certain%20assemblage%20of%20parts%20subject%20to%20uniform%20established%20proportions,%20regulated%20by%20the%20office%20that%20each%20part%20has%20to%20perform%22&amp;f=false|title=An Encyclopædia of Architecture: Historical, Theoretical, and Practical|last=Gwilt|first=Joseph|date=1842|publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Coming down to the present from [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman]] civilization, the '''architectural orders''' are the styles of [[classical architecture]], each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable by the type of [[column]] employed. The three orders of architecture—the [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], which they made simpler than Doric, and the [[Composite order|Composite]], which was more ornamental than the Corinthian.  The architectural order of a classical building is akin to the [[Musical mode|mode]] or [[Key (music)|key]] of [[classical music]], the [[grammar]] or [[rhetoric]] of a written composition.  It is established by certain ''modules'' like the [[Interval (music)|intervals]] of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 7-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the orders were essentially structural in [[Ancient Greek architecture]], which made little use of the arch until its late period, in [[Roman architecture]] where the arch was often dominant, the orders became increasingly decorative elements except in [[portico]]s and similar uses.  Columns shrank into half-columns emerging from walls or turned into [[pilaster]]s.  This treatment continued after the conscious and "correct" use of the orders, initially following exclusively Roman models, returned in the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Greek Revival architecture]], inspired by increasing knowledge of Greek originals, returned to more authentic models, including ones from relatively early periods.

== Elements ==
[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

Each style has distinctive [[capital (architecture)|capital]]s at the top of columns and horizontal [[entablature]]s which it supports, while the rest of the building does not in itself vary between the orders.  The column shaft and base also varies with the order, and is sometimes articulated with vertical hollow grooves known as [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]].  The shaft is wider at the bottom than at the top, because its [[entasis]], beginning a third of the way up, imperceptibly makes the column slightly more slender at the top, although some Doric columns, especially early Greek ones, are visibly "flared", with straight profiles that narrow going up the shaft.

The capital rests on the shaft. It has a load-bearing function, which concentrates the weight of the entablature on the supportive column, but it primarily serves an aesthetic purpose.  The necking is the continuation of the shaft, but is visually separated by one or many grooves. The [[Molding (decorative)|echinus]] lies atop the necking.  It is a circular block that bulges outwards towards the top to support the [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]], which is a square or shaped block that in turn supports the entablature.  The entablature consists of three horizontal layers, all of which are visually separated from each other using moldings or bands.  In Roman and post-Renaissance work, the entablature may be carried from column to column in the form of an [[arch]] that springs from the column that bears its weight, retaining its divisions and sculptural enrichment, if any.  There are names for all the many parts of the orders.

== Measurement ==
[[File:Schema Saeulenordnungen.jpg|thumb|left|Greek orders with full height]] 
The height of columns are calculated in terms of a ratio between the diameter of the shaft at its base and the height of the column. A Doric column can be described as seven diameters high, an Ionic column as eight diameters high and a Corinthian column nine diameters high, although the actual ratios used vary considerably in both ancient and revived examples, but keeping to the trend of increasing slimness between the orders. Sometimes this is phrased as "lower diameters high", to establish which part of the shaft has been measured.

== Greek orders ==
There are three distinct orders in Ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. These three were adopted by the Romans, who modified their capitals. The Roman adoption of the Greek orders took place in the 1st century BC. The three Ancient Greek orders have since been consistently used in neo-classical European architecture.

Sometimes the Doric order is considered the earliest order, but there is no evidence to support this.  Rather, the Doric and Ionic orders seem to have appeared at around the same time, the Ionic in eastern Greece and the Doric in the west and mainland.

Both the Doric and the Ionic order appear to have originated in wood. The [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] in Olympia is the oldest well-preserved temple of Doric architecture. It was built just after 600 BC. The Doric order later spread across Greece and into [[Sicily]] where it was the chief order for [[monumental architecture]] for 800 years.  Early Greeks were no doubt aware of the use of stone columns with bases and capitals in [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]], and that of other Near Eastern cultures, although there they were mostly used in interiors, rather than as a dominant feature of all or part of exteriors, in the Greek style.  
[[File:DoricParthenon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Doric order of the [[Parthenon]]]]

=== Doric order===
{{Main|Doric order}}
The Doric order originated on the mainland and western [[Greece]]. It is the simplest of the orders, characterized by short, organized, heavy columns with plain, round [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s (tops) and no base. With a height that is only four to eight times its diameter, the columns are the most squat of all orders. The shaft of the Doric order is channeled with 16 flutes. The capital consists of a necking or Annulet which is a simple ring. The echinus is convex, or circular cushion like stone, and the abacus is square slab of stone.

Above the capital is a square [[Abacus (architecture)|abacus]] connecting the capital to the entablature.  The Entablature is divided into three horizontal registers, the lower part of which is either smooth or divided by horizontal lines.  The upper half is distinctive for the Doric order. The frieze of the Doric entablature is divided into [[triglyph]]s and [[metope (architecture)|metopes]]. A triglyph is a unit consisting of three vertical bands which are separated by grooves. Metopes are the plain or carved reliefs between two triglyphs.

The Greek forms of the Doric order come without an individual base. They instead are placed directly on the [[stylobate]]. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.

[[File:IonicCapitalPriene.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ionic order]]

=== Ionic order ===
{{Main|Ionic order}}
The Ionic order came from eastern Greece, where its origins are entwined with the similar but little known [[Aeolic order]]. It is distinguished by slender, fluted [[column|pillar]]s with a large base and two opposed ''volutes'' (also called ''scrolls'') in the echinus of the capital. The echinus itself is decorated with an [[egg-and-dart]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]. The Ionic shaft comes with four more flutes than the Doric counterpart (totalling 24). The Ionic base has two convex moldings called ''tori'' which are separated by a scotia.

The Ionic order is also marked by an [[entasis]], a curved tapering in the column shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped bands (''fasciae''). The frieze comes without the Doric ''triglyph'' and ''metope''. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.

[[File:CorinthianOrderPantheon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Corinthian order]]

=== Corinthian order ===
{{Main|Corinthian order}}
The Corinthian order is the most ornate of the Greek orders, characterized by a slender fluted column having an ornate capital decorated with two rows of acanthus leaves and four scrolls. It is commonly regarded as the most elegant of the three orders.  The shaft of the Corinthian order has 24 flutes. The column is commonly ten diameters high.

The Roman writer [[Vitruvius]] [[Callimachus (sculptor)#Architecture|credited]] the invention of the Corinthian order to [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], a Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] of the 5th century BC. The oldest known building built according to this order is the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, constructed from 335 to 334 BC. The Corinthian order was raised to rank by the writings of Vitruvius in the 1st century BC.

== Roman orders ==
The Romans adapted all the Greek orders and also developed two orders of their own, basically modifications of Greek orders. However, it was not until the Renaissance that these were named and formalized as the [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]] and [[Composite order|Composite]], respectively the plainest and most ornate of the orders.  The Romans also invented the [[superposed order]]. A superposed order is when successive stories of a building have different orders. The heaviest orders were at the bottom, whilst the lightest came at the top. This means that the Doric order was the order of the ground floor, the Ionic order was used for the middle story, while the Corinthian or the Composite order was used for the top story.

The [[Colossal order]] was invented by [[Renaissance architecture|architects in the Renaissance]]. The Colossal order is characterized by columns that extend the height of two or more stories.
[[File:PalladioTuscan.jpg|thumb|150px|The Tuscan order in [[Andrea Palladio]], ''Quattro Libri di Architettura,'' 1570]]

=== Tuscan order ===
{{Main|Tuscan order}}
The Tuscan order has a very plain design, with a plain shaft, and a simple capital, base, and frieze. It is a simplified adaptation of the Doric order by the Greeks. The Tuscan order is characterized by an unfluted shaft and a capital that only consists of an echinus and an abacus. In proportions it is similar to the Doric order, but overall it is significantly plainer. The column is normally seven diameters high. Compared to the other orders, the Tuscan order looks the most solid.

[[File:Komposita1.png|right|thumb|150px|Composite order]]

=== Composite order ===
{{Main|Composite order}}
The Composite order is a mixed order, combining the volutes of the Ionic with the leaves of the Corinthian order. Until the [[Renaissance]] it was not ranked as a separate order. Instead it was considered as a late Roman form of the Corinthian order. The column of the Composite order is typically ten diameters high.

== Historical development of the orders ==
[[File:StGervais Fassade.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]] in Paris presents columns of the three orders : Doric at the ground floor, Ionic at the second floor, Corinthian at the third floor]]
[[File:Bodleian Library 2 (5650412310).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Tower of The Five Orders at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]], completed in 1619, includes Tuscan through Composite orders.]]
The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period saw renewed interest in the literary sources of the ancient cultures of Greece and Rome, and the fertile development of a new architecture based on classical principles. The treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by Roman theoretician, architect and engineer [[Vitruvius]], is the only architectural writing that survived from Antiquity. Rediscovered in the 15th century, Vitruvius was instantly hailed as the authority on architecture. However, in his text the word ''order'' is not to be found. To describe the four species of columns (he only mentions: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic and Corinthian) he uses, in fact, various words such as: ''genus'' (gender), ''mos'' (habit, fashion, manner), ''opera'' (work).

The term ''order'', as well as the idea of redefining the ''canon'' started circulating in Rome, at the beginning of the 16th century, probably during the studies of Vitruvius' text conducted and shared by Peruzzi, Raphael and Sangallo.&lt;ref&gt;H. Burns and H. Gunthers, ''24éme Colloque International d'Etude Humanistes'', Tours 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
Ever since, the definition of the ''canon'' has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules for the use of the Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of them down to the most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Small, [http://sites.scran.ac.uk/ada/documents/general/orders/classical_orders.htm "The five orders of classical architecture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vignola defining the concept of "order" ==
{{Main|The Five Orders of Architecture}}
 
Following the examples of Vitruvius and the five books of the ''Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]], published from 1537 onwards, [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] produced an architecture rule book that was not only more practical than the previous two treatises, but also was systematically and consistently adopting, for the first time,  the term '''order''' to define each of the five different species of columns inherited from Antiquity. A first publication of the various plates, as separate sheets, appeared in Rome in 1562, with the title: ''Regola delli Cinque Ordini di Architettura'' (''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture ''&lt;ref&gt;The most recent English translation is the one, with an introduction and commentary by Branko Mitrovic, N.Y. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;). As David Watkin has pointed out, Vignola's book "was to have an astonishing publishing history of over 500 editions in 400 years in ten languages, Italian, Dutch, English, Flemish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, during which it became perhaps the most influential book of all times".&lt;ref&gt;David Watkin, Introduction to the ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture'', translated by John Leeke, reprint of the 1699 edition, N.Y., 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
The book consisted simply of an introduction followed by 32 annotated plates, highlighting the proportional system with all the minute details of the Five Architectural Orders. According to Christof Thoenes, the main expert of Renaissance architectural treatises,  "in accordance with Vitruvius’s example, Vignola chose a “module” equal to a half-diameter which is the base of the system. All the other measurements are expressed in fractions or in multiples of this module. The result is an arithmetical model, and with its help each order, harmoniously proportioned, can easily be adapted to any given height, of a façade or an interior. From this point of view, Vignola's Regola is a remarkable intellectual achievement".[http://architectura.cesr.univ-tours.fr/traite/Notice/ENSBA_LES64.asp?param=en]

In America, ''The American Builder's Companion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Benjamin| first = Asher| title = The American Builder's Companion: Or, a System of Architecture Particularly Adapted to the Present Style of Building| year = 1827| publisher = Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-22236-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; written in the early 19th century by the architect [[Asher Benjamin]], influenced many builders in the eastern states, particularly those who developed what became known as the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. The last American re-interpretation of Vignola's ''Regola'', was edited in 1904 by William Robert Ware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ware| first = William R.| title = The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC| year = 1994| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-28310-4| pages = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break from the classical mode came first with the [[Gothic revival]], then the development of modernism during the 19th century. The [[Bauhaus]] promoted pure functionalism, stripped of superfluous ornament, and that has become one of the defining characteristics of modern architecture. There are some exceptions. [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] introduced an ironic use of the orders as a cultural reference, divorced from the strict rules of composition. On the other hand, a few practitioners e.g. [[Quinlan Terry]] and Stuart Martin still work in a traditional classical idiom.

== Nonce orders ==
Several orders, usually based upon the composite order and only varying in the design of the capitals, have been invented under the inspiration of specific occasions, but have not been used again. They are termed "''nonce orders''" by analogy to ''[[nonce word]]s''; several examples follow below. 
These nonce orders all express the “speaking architecture” (''[[architecture parlante]]'') that was taught in the Paris courses, most explicitly by [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], in which sculptural details of classical architecture could be enlisted to speak symbolically, the better to express the purpose of the structure and enrich its visual meaning with specific appropriateness. This idea was taken up strongly in the training of [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], ca 1875–1915. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

;British Order
[[Robert Adam]]'s brother [[James Adam (architect)|James]] was in Rome in 1762, drawing antiquities under the direction of [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau|Clérisseau]]; he invented a '''British Order''' and published an engraving of it. Its capital the heraldic lion and unicorn take the place of the Composite's volutes, a Byzantine or Romanesque conception, but expressed in terms of neoclassical realism. Adam's ink-and-wash rendering with red highlighting is at the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library|Avery Library]], [[Columbia University]].

;Ammonite order and Agricultural order
In 1789 [[George Dance the Elder|George Dance]] invented an '''[[Ammonite Order]]''', a variant of Ionic substituting volutes in the form of [[fossil]] [[ammonite]]s for [[John Boydell]]'s [[Boydell Shakespeare Gallery|Shakespeare Gallery]] in [[Pall Mall, London]].&lt;ref name="oxford22"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Curl |first1=James Stevens |last2=Wilson |first2=Susan |title=Oxford Dictionary of Architecture |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-967499-2 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptation of the Corinthian order by [[William Donthorne]] that used turnip leaves and [[mangelwurzel]] is termed the '''Agricultural order'''.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curl, p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corn-capital-litchfield.jpg|thumb|upright|Corn capital at the [[Litchfield Villa]] [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)]] ([[Alexander Jackson Davis|A.J. Davis]], architect)]]
;American orders
In the United States [[Benjamin Latrobe]], the architect of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in Washington&amp;nbsp;DC, designed a series of botanically '''American orders'''. Most famous is the order substituting corncobs and their husks, which was executed by [[Giuseppe Franzoni]] and employed in the small domed Vestibule of the Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court survived the fire of 24&amp;nbsp;August 1814, nearly intact. With peace restored, Latrobe designed an American order that substituted for the acanthus tobacco leaves, of which he sent a sketch to [[Thomas Jefferson]] in a letter, 5&amp;nbsp;November 1816. He was encouraged to send a model of it, which remains at [[Monticello]]. In the 1830s [[Alexander Jackson Davis]] admired it enough to make a drawing of it. In 1809 Latrobe invented a second American order, employing [[magnolia]] flowers constrained within the profile of classical mouldings, as his drawing demonstrates. It was intended for "the Upper Columns in the Gallery of the Entrance of the Chamber of the Senate" ({{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/us.capitol/s4.html |title=United States Capitol exhibit}}).

The '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Dominican Republic]]''' features a shield in similarly quartered colors as the flag, supported by a [[bay laurel]] branch (left) and a [[Palm tree|palm]] frond (right); above the shield, a blue ribbon displays the national [[motto]]: ''Dios, Patria, Libertad'' (God, Homeland, Liberty). Below the shield, the words ''República Dominicana'' appear on a red ribbon. In the center of the shield, flanked by six spears (three on each side), the front four holding the national flag, is a [[Catholic Bible]] with a small golden [[Latin cross|cross]] above it

The constitution dictates that the Bible be opened to the book of [[the New Testament]], [[John 8]]:32, which reads "conocerán la verdad, y la verdad los hará libres", literal translation: '''"know the truth and the truth will set you free"'''.

The coat of arms appears in the center of the [[flag of the Dominican Republic]].

{{Costume}}

'''Costume coordination''' is a method of dressing actors, employees or a person or group for theatrical productions and any venue requiring a fully realized character. It consists of pulling or renting existing stock clothing and [[costume]]s, altering them as needed to be used as [[stage clothes]] in a theatrical production, oversee their use, cleaning and eventual return to storage or rental company.&lt;ref name="Amateur"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Amateur Theatricals | publisher=Alpha | author=Kenrick, John | date=September 5, 2006 | pages=109 | isbn=978-1592575060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as with [[costume design]], the costume creates the over all appearance of the characters, but with the use of on hand items, including accessories. Sometimes coordinators may have a small budget to augment the existing stock or alter it for production needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=ShowSmarts: A Volunteer's Guide to Putting on Shows with Kids | publisher=iUniverse, Inc. | author=Koerpel, Terra | date=October 20, 2004 | pages=35 | isbn=978-0595318834}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many theatres with smaller budgets regularly reuse existing stock, especially older companies with large costume warehouses. It is also a staple of community theatre positions because it entails less time and effort and is the usual manner for schools to costume student performers from stored costumes donated or previously purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=For Love of Drama: How to Create School Plays that Show a Profit and Erupt with Life and Love | publisher=Trafford Publishing | author=McEwen, Rolf | date=July 19, 2004 | isbn=978-1412031653}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordination of costumes is also required at theme parks and festivals which require performers and dancers to have a consistent appearance, or maintained as originally designed.

==Celebrity Costumes==
There are costumes made for film and theater, but it is also made show off popular looks to fans and friends on the red carpet or other fancy places. 
Discovered by INSIDER articles, celebrity women tend to dress or half dress for that manner, when they are not filming or doing production. These specific locations are places like, the Red Carpet, Engagement photos, Music Awards, VMA's, Venice Film Festival, and the Grammy's. This isn't a bashing statement, it is an honoring one. Celebrity women are constantly recognized for what they are wearing outside of the professional/ business atmosphere. These celebrity women are praised by their glam and style. They become more iconic for their stunning appearances at these elegant events. These outfits and designs are still in some way a costume because it's making up a certain character. As mentioned in Jorgensen book, famous designer Edith Head says, a celebrity wears different costumes to become someone different. The clothing chosen by designers for celebrities are the gifts of celebration, style and beauty.(Pantazi, Chloe 2017)

==Costume Trends==
The fashion and costumes that are used in movies and theater actually have an effect on fashion shows and fans. These examples are seen on social media and common blogs. Some films are enjoyable by genres but others are memorable because of costumes. There are many specific designs and costumes that are used in production that valued and inspiring to most people today. Designers such as Keira Knightley and Audrey Hepburn have made many designs for films that are or have been in high fashion in reality. A few movies to think about and idealize are, Cinderella where there were much patients and dedication with the amounts of fabric used and the number of designers that worked on the dress. A few others, Mad Max Fury World, the designer received an Oscar for creating the costume for the character who Imperator Furiosa,; Atonement, where the green dress worn in the film was to illustrate jealousy and temptation. One other film would be Kill Bill, where the character The Bride played a strong roll and needed an even stronger costume to go with it. There are plenty of other movies and famous designers to read into along with different awards won for the costumes. (Fearn, Rebecca; 2016) Movie costumes can definitely become a trend in reality. For an example, the film where, Marilyn Monroe wore a white halterneck dress standing over a subway vent and how it became so popular because how beautiful it was or how correctly it was worn. It also left a message telling women "how to really wear it." Costumes in film or stage have the ability to have some sort of an effect on fashion in society. To go through the list of top designs more, ''The Matrix'' where they wore trench coats and shades to build a serious character. ''Factory Girl'' being another film which shows exaggeration in the costumes for that time frame. One famous and popular film mentioned would be ''Cleopatra'', where the designer Renle made very creative and unique costumes. The designer didn't use accurate costumes to tell the story but what made the film interesting was the fun that the designers and directors put into it. (Clough, Rebecca 2014)

==Famous Designers==
There are many famous designers that are left behind the scene and aren't always recognized for their work but some have significantly made it into the spotlight. Many designers began sewing when they are young and they would start off with small creations. Edith Head for an example is now as "The Greastest Costume Designer". In much news there are plenty of designers that have books written about them and their own websites of their designs. Edith Head had designed not only for herself but many other top celebrities like Grace Kelly. Sandy Powell is another known designer who talks about the particular work of a designer and the pressure. There are a lot of designs for a  designer to complete and there isn't always enough time and sketches that need to be made for actors and directors preferences. In Head's words actors and actresses uses their fashion/costumes as a "camouflage" to indicate that they are a different person every time they are seen (Jorgensen 2010). Another designer is Kate Carin who does much work in South Africa. She has her own website that features her designs in films like, ''Saints and Strangers, Cape Town, The 51st State, Strongbow, The book of Negroes'' and the list goes on. This website talks about Carin's designs along with her relationships with directors; this is numerously stated in other research, mentioning the connection between the two. It also talks about her versatile style with being about to design costumes for commercials and also for period movies that takes research (Carin).

==Reading Costumes==
There is a lot of production and preparation used in a film so it's important to know how to read these costumes. There are popular costumes used in the 1300-1500s and also modern day costumes. These costumes discuss what certain costumes have and what does it mean. It also point out specific ways to educate oneself on the way costumes are used. There's a director of a costume organization  named, Deborah Landis that who suggest helping students and teachers to appreciate costume designs more. The article digs in a little deeper, particularly focusing on media literacy and observation. It talks  about the collaborations between costume designers, directors, and cinematographer. The article is similar to "Role of Importance" by differentiating between fashion and costume designers but this article has more depth. It begins with saying fashion designers have labels to sell their designs while costume designers have no label and they simply make characters. Again there's a lot of research costume designers done to make a perfect character; visiting places that are still standing, learning habits of the culture, collecting photos and so on. Costume designers use portraits to match their sketches. She continues after each section of telling what costume designer does along with providing assignments to teachers for students (Landis 2018).

For many people, costumes have importance. Costumes are made to make and invent a character in a film or play. Popular movies like "Romeo and Juliet" , "Hamlet" , and so on; are very collaborative movies that people constantly describe each significant style and fabric that a character is wearing throughout the film. These films are known for their heavy leather, lacquer red silk and all other things that were embedded into a costume, and other things made to represent those ages. There's a lot that goes into a costume according to this book, you have to select the fabric, cut out the costume, make sure it fits, and aging the costume which is making it look older by spraying it down with different things or painting over it. After the end of designing the costumes, it is then presented to the director for approval. Along with most costumes there are props to finish off a personality like knives, pistols, crowns, etc. depending on a character's role. These decisions are made by both the director and costume designer to give characters purposes in stories.(Motley 1965)
 
There's a book that highly discuss renaissance costumes called,  "Settings and Costumes of the Modern Stage". This book doesn't just give information and photos about Costumes but also the stage and the setup to help with bringing characters to life. This information will be helpful because it gives costume designers their credit for their designs. The article discusses stage and costume connection, to help readers understand how costumes match the story/plot. This book has more pictures than words but it helps to create the understanding of a scene, story, and character. The book shows many photos and descriptions of plays like: Hamlet, Marriage, Resurrection, and so on. Authors, Simonson and Komisarjevsky also briefly mention the way New York Stage has made its changes in certain settings to a more glamorous fairy-tales (Simonson, Lee 1966). As mentioned above, there should be more appreciation for the work put into costumes. Even the simplest costumes that are in different genres affects a costume and tell a story. In science fiction it makes sense for directors and designers to dress up characters to create a fantasy and make it less compromising to relate. The film ''Tron Legacy'' where the colors of their costumes play big roles in the film and within the characters. These colors are specifically used to distinguish between the protagonist and antagonist. In ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'', costumes indicate the enemy characters in this film that are called the seven villains. The costumes used in ''Robin Hood'', was to connect to a certain time period of heroes of men that was formed in the medieval times. Costumes in films are used to enhance a reality of the narration not to define it. Simple outfits that are worn in film also tells some type of story or secret (Laverty, Lord Christopher 2011). Designers doesn't always enhance their characters by new fabric,costumes are rented from existing materials to fit characters in movies or plays. The use of colors and patterns in costumes are bold representations. Before a movie or play is produced, designers read scripts to identify the era in which the piece is taken place, this helps to get started on their first sketch.They create costume charts that label what characters are wearing in specific scenes. Their final sketch is presented after the first has been approved. The final sketch shows more vivid and unique features with the use of colors. All of this information sounds very similar to a fashion designer. Some people are unable to identify the difference between costume and fashion designers. Costume designing is made for characters in stories while fashion is for a person's style. Costume designs have limited time and assignments on creativity. There are more expenses used in costume designing and there is the need for research and knowledge of culture or history (UKEssay 2018).

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''design rationale''' is an explicit documentation of the [[reason]]s behind [[Decision making|decisions]] made when [[design]]ing a [[system]] or [[Artifact (software development)|artifact]]. As initially developed by W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]], design rationale seeks to provide [[argumentation]]-based structure to the political, collaborative process of addressing [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"/&gt;

== Overview ==
A design rationale is the explicit listing of [[Decision making|decisions]] made during a [[design process]], and the reasons why those decisions were made.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"&gt;Jarczyk, Alex P.; Löffler, Peter; Shipman III, Frank M. (1992), "Design Rationale for Software Engineering: A Survey", ''25th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', 2, pp. 577-586&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal is to support [[designer]]s by providing a means to [[document|record]] and [[communicate]] the argumentation and reasoning behind the design process.&lt;ref name="HoAt06"&gt;Horner, J.; Atwood, M.E. (2006), "Effective Design Rationale: Understanding the Barriers", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., Rationale Management in Software Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; 
It should therefore include:&lt;ref name="Lee97"&gt;Lee, J. (1997). "Design Rationale Systems: Understanding the Issues". ''IEEE Expert'' 12 (3): 78–85&lt;/ref&gt;
* the reasons behind a design decision,
* the justification for it,
* the other alternatives considered, 
* the trade offs evaluated, and 
* the argumentation that led to the decision.

Several science areas are involved in the study of design rationales, such as [[computer science]]&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"/&gt;  [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="HoAt06" /&gt; [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="BuBr00"&gt;Burge, J.E.; Brown, D.C. (2000), "Reasoning with Design Rationale", in Gero, J., ''Artificial Intelligence in Design '00'', Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publ., pp. 611–629&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]].&lt;ref&gt;Xin, W.; Guangleng, X. (2001), "Design Rationale as Part of Corporate Technical Memory", ''Systems, Man and Cybernetics'', pp. 1904 - 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; For supporting design rationale, various frameworks have been proposed, such as QOC, DRCS, [[Issue-Based Information System|IBIS]], and DRL.

== History ==
While argumentation formats can be traced back to [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s work in the 1950s&lt;ref name="Toul50"&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] (1958). ''The Uses of Argument''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; datums, claims, warrants, backings and rebuttals, the origin of design rationale can be traced back to W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]]'s&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"&gt;Kunz, W.; Rittel, H. (1970), ''Issues as elements of information systems''. Working Paper 131, Center for Urban and Regional Development, University of California Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; development of the [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS) notation in 1970. Several variants on IBIS have since been proposed.

* The first was Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI), first described in Ray McCall's PhD Dissertation&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R. (1978), ''On the structure and use of issue systems in design'', Doctoral Dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, University Microfilms&lt;/ref&gt; although not named at the time.
* IBIS was also modified, in this case to support Software Engineering, by Potts &amp; Bruns.&lt;ref name="PoBu88"&gt;Potts, C.; Burns, G. (1988), "Recording the reasons for design decisions", ''10th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '1988), pp. 418-427&lt;/ref&gt; The Potts &amp; Bruns approach was then extended by the Decision Representation Language (DRL).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13)'', IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was extended by RATSpeak.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt;
* Questions Options and Criteria (QOC), also known as Design Space Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Moran, T. (1989), "Design rationale: the argument behind the artifact", ''SIGCHI Bull''. 20, pp. 247-252114-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates'', pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative representation for argumentation-based rationale, as are Win-Win&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]], Ross, R (1989). "Theory-W software project management: principles and examples.". ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'' 18 (7): 902-916.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decision Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM).&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221"&gt;Pena-Mora, F.; Sriram, D.; Logcher, R. (1993), "SHARED-DRIMS: SHARED Design Recommendation-Intent Management System", ''Proceedings Enabling Technologies Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprise'', IEEE Press, Morgantown, WV, pp. 213-221&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rationale Management System (RMS) was PROTOCOL, which supported PHI, which was followed by other PHI-based systems MIKROPOLIS and PHIDIAS. The first system providing IBIS support was [[:de:Hans Dehlinger|Hans Dehlinger]]'s STIEC.&lt;ref&gt;Dehlinger, H. (1978), Project STIEC: Systems Analysis of the Generation and Dissemination of Scientific and Technological Information in the European Community" ''Report No. 26: Report on a Batch - Version of STIEC'', Heidelberg/Stuttgart&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel developed a small system in 1983 (also not published) and the better known [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS) was developed in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; YakemBegemanovic, M. (1988). "gIBIS: A hypertext tool for exploratory policy discussion". ''ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems'' 6 (4): 303-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all successful DR approaches involve structured argumentation. For example, Carroll and Rosson's Scenario-Claims Analysis approach&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, JM; Rosson, M (1992). "Getting around the task-artifact cycle: how to make claims and design by scenario". ''ACM Trans. Inf. Syst''. 10 (2): 181-212&lt;/ref&gt; captures rationale in scenarios that describe how the system is used and how well the system features support the user goals. Carroll and Rosson's approach to design rationale is intended to help designers of computer software and hardware identify underlying design tradeoffs and make inferences about the impact of potential design interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J. M., &amp; Rosson, M. B. (2003). Design rationale as theory. HCI models, theories, and frameworks: toward a multidisciplinary science, 431-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts in design rationale ==
There are a number of ways to characterize DR approaches. Some key distinguishing features are how it is captured, how it is represented, and how it can be used.

=== Rationale capture ===
''Rationale capture'' is the process of acquiring rationale information to a rationale management

; Capture methods
* A method called "Reconstruction"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; captures rationales in a raw form such as video, and then reconstruct them into a more structured form.&lt;ref name="BuBr98"&gt;Burge, J.; Brown, D.C. (1998), [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html ''Design Rationale: Types and Tools, Technical Report''], [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept.], retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of Reconstruction method is that rationales can be carefully captured and capturing process won't disrupt the designer. But this method might result in high cost and biases of the person producing the rationales 
* The "Record-and-replay"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method simply captures rationales as they unfold. Rationales are synchronously captured in a [[video conference]] or asynchronously captured via [[bulletin board]] or email-based discussion. If the system has informal and semi-formal representation, the method will be helpful.
* The "Methodological byproduct"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales during the process of design following a schema. But it's hard to design such a schema. The advantage of this method is its low cost.
* With a rich knowledge base (KB) created in advance, the "Apprentice"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales by asking questions when confusing or disagreeing with the designer's action. This method benefits not only the user but the system.
* In "Automatic Generation"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method, design rationales are automatically generated from an execution history at low cost. It has the ability in maintaining consistent and up-to-date rationales. But the cost of compiling the execution history is high due to the complexity and difficulty of some machine-learning problems.
* The "Historian"&lt;ref&gt;Chen, A.; McGinnis, B.; Ullman, D.; Dietterich, T. (1990), "Design History Knowledge Representation and Its Basic Computer Implementation", The 2nd International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology, Chicago, IL, pp. 175-185&lt;/ref&gt; method let a person or computer program watches all designer's actions but does not make suggestions. Rationales are captured during the design process.&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt;

=== Rationale representation ===
The choice of design rationale representation is very important to make sure that the rationales we capture is what we desire and we can use efficiently. According to the degree of formality, the approaches that are used to represent design rationale can be divided into three main categories: informal, semiformal, or formal.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; In the informal representation, rationales can be recorded and captured by just using our traditionally accepted methods and media, such as word processors, audio and video records or even hand writings. However, these descriptions make it hard for automatic interpretation or other computer-based supports. In the formal representation, the rationale must be collected under a strict format so that the rationale can be interpreted and understood by computers. However, due to the strict format of rationale defined by formal representations, the contents can hardly be understood by human being and the process of capturing design rationale will require more efforts to finish, and therefore becomes more intrusive.

Semiformal representations try to combine the advantages of informal and formal representations. On one hand, the information captured should be able to be processed by computers so that more computer based support can be provided. On the other hand, the procedure and method used to capture information of design rationale should not be very intrusive. In the system with a semiformal representation, the information expected is suggested and the users can capture rationale by following the instructions to either fill out the attributes according to some templates or just type into natural language descriptions.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt;

=== Argumentation-based models ===
; The Toulmin model : One commonly accepted way for semiformal design rationale representation is structuring design rationale as argumentation.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; The earliest argumentation-based model used by many design rationale systems is the Toulmin model.&lt;ref name="Toul50" /&gt; The [[Stephen Toulmin#The Toulmin Model of Argument|Toulmin model]] defines the rules of design rationale argumentation with six steps:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Chris (2000), [http://www.concentric.net/~Creyn266/COMM335/Toulmin.htm ''What is the Toulmin Model?''] Paper at concentric.net.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:# Claim is made; 
:# Supporting data are provided; 
:# Warrant provides evidence to the existing relations; 
:# Warrant can be supported by a backing; 
:# Model qualifiers (some, many, most, etc.) are provided; 
:# Possible rebuttals are also considered. 
:One advantage of Toulmin model is that it uses words and concepts which can be easily understood by most people.

; Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) : Another important approach to argumentation of design rationale is Rittel and Kunz's IBIS ([[Issue-Based Information System]]),&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970" /&gt; which is actually not a software system but an argumentative notation. It has been implemented in software form by [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS), itIBIS (test-based IBIS), [[Compendium (software)|Compendium]], and other software.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; Yakemovic, K. (1991). "A Process-Oriented Approach to Design Rationale". ''Human-Computer Interaction'' 6 (3 &amp; 4): 357–391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Rittel |first1=Horst W. J. |authorlink1=Horst Rittel |last2=Noble |first2=Douglas |date=January 1989 |title=Issue-based information systems for design |number=492 |location=Berkeley, CA |institution=Institute of Urban and Regional Development, [[University of California]] |oclc=20155825 |url=http://cumincad.architexturez.net/system/files/pdf/ca71.content.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBIS uses some rationale elements (denoted as nodes) such as issues, positions, arguments, resolutions and several relationships such as more general than, logical successor to, temporal successor to, replaces and similar to, to link the issue discussions.

; Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI) : PHI (Procedural Hierarchy of Issues)&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R.J. (1991). "PHI: A Conceptual Foundation for Design Hypermedia". ''Design Studies'' 12 (1): 30–41.&lt;/ref&gt; extended IBIS to noncontroversial issues and redefined the relationships. PHI adds the subissue relationship which means one issue's resolution depends on the resolution of another issue.

; Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) : QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria)&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is used for design space analysis. Similar to IBIS, QOC identifies the key design problems as questions and possible answers to questions as options. In addition, QOC uses criteria to explicitly describe the methods to evaluate the options, such as the requirements to be satisfied or the properties desired. The options are linked with criteria positively or negatively and these links are defined as assessments.

; Decision Representation Language (DRL) : DRL (Decision Representation Language)&lt;ref name="Lee91"&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '13), IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; extends the Potts and Bruns model of DR&lt;ref name="PoBu88" /&gt; and defines the primary elements as decision problems, alternatives, goals, claims and groups. Lee (1991) has argued that DRL is more expressive than other languages.&lt;ref name="Lee91" /&gt; DRL focuses more on the representation of decision making and its rationale instead of on design rationale.

; RATSpeak : Based on DRL, RATSpeak is developed and used as the representation language in SEURAT (Software Engineering Using RATionale).&lt;ref&gt;Burge, J. (2005), [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-050205-085625/ ''Software Engineering Using design RATionale''], Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept&lt;/ref&gt; RATSpeak takes into account requirements (functional and non-functional) as part of the arguments for alternatives to the decision problems. SEURAT also includes an Argument Ontology which is a hierarchy of argument types and includes the types of claims used in the system.

; WinWin Spiral Model :  The WinWin Spiral Model, which is used in the WinWin approach,&lt;ref name="BoKi06"&gt;[[Barry Boehm]]; Kitapci, H. (2006), "The WinWin Approach: Using a Requirement Negotiation Tool for Rationale Capture and Use", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 173-190&lt;/ref&gt; adds the WinWin negotiation activities, including identifying key stakeholders of the systems, and identifying the win conditions of each stakeholder and negotiation, into the front of each cycle of the [[Spiral model|spiral software development model]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]] (1998). [http://www.cs.usu.edu/~supratik/CS%205370/r5061.pdf "A spiral model of software development and enhancement"]. ''Computer'' 21 (5): 61–72&lt;/ref&gt; in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory (winwin) agreement for all stakeholders of the project.

: In the WinWin Spiral Model, the goals of each stakeholder are defined as Win conditions. Once there is a conflict between win conditions, it is captured as an Issue. Then the stakeholders invent Options and explore trade-offs to resolve the issue. When the issue is solved, an Agreement which satisfies the win conditions of stakeholders and captures the agreed option is achieved. Design rationale behind the decisions is captured during the process of the WinWin model and will be used by stakeholders and the designers to improve their later decision making.&lt;ref name="BoKi06" /&gt; The WinWin Spiral model reduces the overheads of the capture of design rationale by providing stakeholders a well-defined process to negotiate. In&lt;ref&gt;Bose, P. (1995). "A Model for Decision Maintenance in the WinWin Collaboration Framework". ''Knowledge Based Software Engineering '' (KBSE '95).&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of decision rationale is defined and their model utilizes the ontology to address the problem of supporting decision maintenance in the WinWin collaboration framework.

; Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) : DRIM (Design Recommendation and Intent Model) is used in SHARED-DRIM.&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221" /&gt; The main structure of DRIM is a proposal which consists of the intents of each designer, the recommendations that satisfy the intents and the justifications of the recommendations. Negotiations are also needed when conflicts exist between the intents of different designers. The recommendation accepted becomes a design decision, and the rationale of the unaccepted but proposed recommendations are also recorded during this process, which can be useful during the iterative design and/or system maintenance.

== Applications ==
Design rationale has the potential to be used in many different ways. One set of uses, defined by Burge and Brown (1998),&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt; are:
* Design verification — The design rationale can be used to verify if the design decisions and the product itself are the reflection of what the designers and the users actually wanted.
* Design evaluation — The design rationale is used to evaluate the various design alternatives discussed during the design process.
* Design maintenance — The design rationale helps to determine the changes that are necessary to modify the design.
* Design reuse — The design rationale is used to determine how the existing design could be reused for a new requirement with or without any changes in it. If there is a need to modify the design, then the DR also suggests what needs to be modified in the design.
* Design teaching — The design rationale could be used as a resource to teach people who are unfamiliar with the design and the system.
* Design communication — The design rationale facilitates better communication among people who are involved in the design process and thus helps to come up with a better design.
* Design assistance — The design rationale could be used to verify the design decisions made during the design process.
* Design documentation — The design rationale is used to document the entire design process which involves the meeting room deliberations, alternatives discussed, reasons behind the design decisions and the product overview.

DR is used by research communities in software engineering, mechanical design, artificial intelligence, civil engineering, and human-computer interaction research. In software engineering, it could be used to support the designers ideas during requirement analysis, capturing and documenting design meetings and predicting possible issues due to new design approach.&lt;ref name="DMM06"&gt;Dutoit, A.; McCall, B.; Mistrik et al., eds. (2006), ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer pp.1-48.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software architecture]] and outcourcing solution design, it can justify the outcome of [[architectural decision]]s and serve as a design guide.&lt;ref&gt;O. Zimmermann, C. Miksovic, J. Küster, [http://soadecisions.org/download/SDA-JSS-SpecialIssueWICSA2011v16FinalAuthorsVersion.pdf Reference Architecture, Metamodel and Modeling Principles for Architectural Knowledge Management in Information Technology Services]. Journal of Systems and Software, Elsevier. Vol. 85, Issue 9, Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
In civil engineering, it helps to coordinate the variety of work that the designers do at the same time in different areas of a construction project. It also help the designers to understand and respect each other's ideas and resolve any possible issues.&lt;ref&gt;Whelton, Michael; Ballard, Glenn; Tommelein, Iris (2007) [http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/DesignRationaleSystemsandProjectDefinitionIGLC9.pdf ''Application Of Design Rationale Systems To Project Definition – Establishing A Research Project''.] Retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The DR can also be used by the project managers to maintain their project plan and the project status up to date. Also, the project team members who missed a design meeting can refer back the DR to learn what was discussed on a particular topic. The unresolved issues captured in DR could be used to organize further meetings on those topics.&lt;ref name="DMM06" /&gt;
 
Design rationale helps the designers to avoid the same mistakes made in the previous design. This can also be helpful to avoid duplication of work.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; In some cases DR could save time and money when a software system is upgraded from its previous versions.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586" /&gt;

There are several books and articles that provide excellent surveys of rationale approaches applied to HCI,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T.; Carroll, J., eds. (1996), ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering Design&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; and Software Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Dutoit, Rationale Management in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''detachment of wall paintings''' involves the removal of a [[Mural|wall painting]] from the structure of which it formed part.

==Origins==
[[Vitruvius]] records how in [[Sparta]], in 59 BC, "paintings have been taken out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, enclosed in wooden frames, and brought to the [[Comitium]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0072%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D9 |title=Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'' II.8.9 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, apprised of paintings of [[Atalanta]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] without drapery and "enflamed with lust", [[Caligula]] attempted to carry them off, but was prevented by the makeup of the [[Plaster#In art|plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D6 |title=Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXV.6.17-18 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Maiuri|Maiuri]] cites examples of wall paintings in wooden frames excavated at [[Pompeii]], a precursor to [[Pompeii#Rediscovery|what was to follow]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation==
In their study, Mora, Mora, and Philippot cite four reasons for the "over-use" of detachment: the 19th-century division of [[the arts]] that privileged a "painting" divorced from its architectural and historical context; insensitivity to the [[aesthetic]] consequences, often partially concealed by [[Conservation-restoration|restorers]]; the curiosity of [[Art history|art historians]] looking for ''[[Sinopia|sinopie]]''; or perceived savings relating to the initial cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=245f |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gain and exploitation as consumer goods by collectors, dealers and restorers provides another possible incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=64f |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Minimum intervention and reversibility are core [[Conservation-restoration#Definition|conservation ethics]] that favour preservation ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transfer of Wallpaintings; based on Danish experience |author=Brajer, Isabelle |publisher=Archetype Publications |year=2002 |ISBN=978-1-873132-43-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mosaics make a Site: The conservation ''in situ'' of mosaics on archaeological sites |chapter=Philosophies favouring ''in situ'' conservation |pages=17–29 |publisher=ICCM |editor=Michaelides, Demetrios |year=2003 |ISBN=92-9077-179-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detachment breaks the intrinsic link between wall paintings and architecture; causes irreversible physical damage to the texture, topography, and tone of the painting; leaves a void in the stripped interior; with the introduction of new materials, typically leads to a cycle of retreatment; and has resulted in "many transfers in terrible condition that serve as examples of serious, albeit unintentional, maltreatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=63–71 (p. 65 for quote) |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diana Jones Award''' is an annual award for "excellence in [[Role-playing game|gaming]]" that was made from a burned book encased in plastic&lt;ref name="polygon"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang | title = Tabletop gaming's most coveted trophy is a burned book | publisher = [[Polygon (magazine)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The award is unusual in two ways: first, it is not an award for a specific class of thing, but can be awarded to a [[person]], [[Product (business)|product]], [[publication]], [[company (law)|company]], [[organization]], event or [[Fads and trends|trend]] – anything related to gaming; second, it does not count popularity or commercial success as a sign of "excellence".&lt;ref name="djaabout"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dianajonesaward.org/about.html| title = About the Diana Jones Award | accessdate = 2008-08-24 | publisher = The Diana Jones Award committee | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dianajonesaward.org%2Fabout.html&amp;date=2008-08-24 | archivedate = 2008-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award was first presented in 2001.&lt;ref name="djafront"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dianajonesaward.org/ | title = The Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming | accessdate = 2008-08-24 | publisher = The Diana Jones Award committee | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dianajonesaward.org%2F&amp;date=2008-08-24 | archivedate = 2008-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominees are circulated during the year to the [[committee]], which is mostly anonymous but which is known to include [[Peter Adkison]], [[Matt Forbeck]], [[John Kovalic]] and [[James Wallis (games designer)|James Wallis]].&lt;ref name="TabletopGaming"&gt; {{Cite web | url=https://www.tabletopgaming.co.uk/board-games/news/gamings-nobel-prize-the-diana-jones-award-selects-gen-con-gloomhaven | title = Gaming’s Nobel Prize, the Diana Jones Award, selects Gen Con, Gloomhaven and Terraforming Mars among 2017 nominees | publisher = Tabletop Gaming }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The committee is anonymous to protect the voting process from interference, but individual judges are free to reveal themselves.&lt;ref name="djaabout" /&gt;  The committee releases a shortlist of three to seven nominees&lt;ref name="djaabout" /&gt; in spring, and the award is presented to the winner at [[Gen Con]] in Indianapolis in August.

The Diana Jones trophy was created in the UK offices of [[Tactical Studies Rules|TSR]] in the mid 1980s to commemorate the ending of their license to publish ''[[The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game]]''.&lt;ref name="wallisgencon"&gt;"JAMES WALLIS: ...Eventually the Lucasfilm license expires and is not renewed. The word comes down from TSR head office to TSR UK that all unsold copies are to be destroyed, as per the terms of the license. They guys at TSR UK...got the final unsold copy and they destroyed it.... this did this it in strategic ways, by singeing bits of it. They took the singed remains, which included the logo, from which they'd burned the first two letters, to turn it from 'Indiana Jones' to 'Diana Jones,' and they encased these remains in a Perspex pyramid." (Laws 2007, p 139)&lt;/ref&gt;  The trophy itself is a [[perspex]] pyramid containing the burnt remains of the last unsold copy of the game; all that is legible of the title is "'''diana Jones'''".&lt;ref name="wallisgencon" /&gt;  (There is no relation of the award with fantasy author [[Diana Wynne Jones]].) The trophy was "liberated" and eventually ended up with the Diana Jones committee.&lt;ref&gt;"JAMES WALLIS: ... let's just say it was liberated from TSR UK by persons unnamed, and made its ways into the hands of the committee...." (Laws 2007, p 137)&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of "one of the least-loved and critically savaged games of all time" was seen an appropriate symbol for an award for excellence in gaming.&lt;ref name="djaabout" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"JAMES WALLIS: ... a trophy that symbolizes the destruction of one of the least-loved and critically savaged games of all time would make suitable symbol for an award that celebrated excellence in gaming." (Laws 2007, p 137)&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy also contains a counter that reads "Nazi&amp;trade;" from the game.&lt;ref name="genconnazi"&gt;"MATT FORBECK:...the last copy of the ''Indiana Jones'' roleplaying games.... It actually has one of the legendary counters in it that reads 'Nazi&amp;trade;.' Which apparently was not TSR's idea, but Lucasfilm insisted that everything that appeared in the game have a "TM" next to it." (Laws 2007, p 139)&lt;/ref&gt;  While the trademark claim was present at Lucasfilm's insistence, it led to rumors that TSR had tried to trademark the term.&lt;ref name="genconnazi" /&gt;

Among the paintings attributed to '''Giovanni da Rimini''' (''[[Floruit|fl]]''. 1292–1336) are two [[Panel painting|panels]] from a former '''[[diptych]]''', dated to 1300–1305, of which the left wing is in the collection of the [[National Gallery]], London, and the right that of the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], [[Palazzo Barberini]], Rome.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barberini"/&gt;

==Giovanni da Rimini==
Giovanni, ''pictor'' (painter), later ''maestro'' (master), is known from legal documents to have lived in [[Rimini]] between 1292 and 1336. This Giovanni is thought to be the same as the artist of the inscribed [[crucifix]] ([[:it:Crocifisso di Mercatello sul Metauro|it]]) in San Francesco ([[:it:Museo di San Francesco|it]]), [[Mercatello sul Metauro]], inscribed IOH(ann)ES PICTOR FECIT HOC OPUS / FR(atri) TOBALDI, attesting to its creation by Giovanni the Painter, and dated 1309.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museodelmetauro.it/?q=it/node/17 |title=Crocifisso Giovanni da Rimini |trans-title=Crucifix by Giovanni da Rimini |publisher=[[:it:Museo di San Francesco|Museo del Metauro]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OUP"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FtlMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA7 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture, Volume 2 |editor=Hourihane, Colum |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |pages=7–8 |isbn=978-0195395365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three or four other crucifixes are identified as being by the same artist, influenced by that ([[:it:Crocifisso di Rimini|it]]) of [[Giotto]]: the "Diotallevi” Crucifix ([[:it:Crocifisso (Giovanni da Rimini)|it]]), in the Museo della città, Rimini ([[:it:Museo della città di Rimini|it]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museicomunalirimini.it/musei/museo_citta/patrimonio_museo_citta/catalogo_mappa_museo_citta/-medievale_moderno_piano1/pagina18.html |title=La Scuola riminese e i dipinti del XIV secolo |trans-title=The Rimini School and paintings of the fourteenth century |language=Italian |publisher=[[Rimini|Comune di Rimini]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; another in San Lorenzo, [[Talamello]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.talamello.rn.it/index.php?id=14263 |title=Il Crocefisso di Giovanni da Rimini (1300) |trans-title=Crucifix by Giovanni da Rimini (1300) |language=Italian |publisher=[[Talamello|Comune di Talamello]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; another in San Francesco, [[Sassoferrato]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.jsp?decorator=layout_S2&amp;apply=true&amp;tipo_scheda=OA&amp;id=7629 |title=Giovanni da Rimini, Cristo crocifisso |trans-title=Christ on the Cross, by Giovanni da Rimini |language=Italian |publisher=[[Federico Zeri|Fondazione Federico Zeri]], [[University of Bologna]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fourth sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/so-moretti-n09306/lot.131.html |title=Giovanni da Rimini: Painted Crucifix |publisher=[[Sotheby's]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanni's panel paintings include what is probably half of a second diptych, ''The Virgin and Child with Five Saints'', in the Pinacoteca Comunale di Faenza ([[:it:Pinacoteca comunale di Faenza|it]]).&lt;ref name="OUP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pinacotecafaenza.racine.ra.it/ita/opere/op_626.htm |title=Giovanni da Rimini, Madonna col Bambino, due Angeli e i SS.

==''Scenes from the Lives of the Virgin and other Saints''==
The diptych's left wing, [[Provenance|once owned]] by the [[Barberini family]], and subsequently by Pietro and [[Vincenzo Camuccini]], was acquired as being by Giotto by [[Algernon Percy, 4th Duke of Northumberland]] in 1853, for £100. At [[Alnwick Castle]] thereafter, the painting passed by descent to the [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|12th Duke of Northumberland]], before being sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2014 for £5.7 million, including [[buyer's premium]].&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.17.html |title=Giovanni da Rimini: Left wing of a diptych with episodes from the lives of the Virgin and other saints |publisher=[[Sotheby's]] |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art|temporary export bar]] was placed on the painting, on the grounds of it meeting "[[Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art#Waverley Criteria|Waverley Criteria]]" 2 and 3, being of "outstanding aesthetic [[Values (heritage)|value]]" and in excellent condition, and of "outstanding significance for the study of [[Trecento]] painting in Rimini".&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/last-chance-to-keep-rare-14th-century-italian-painting-in-the-uk |title=Last chance to keep rare 14th century Italian painting in the UK |publisher=[[Gov.uk]] |date=29 October 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the financial assistance of [[Ronald Lauder]], son of [[Estée Lauder (businesswoman)|Estée Lauder]], the painting was acquired by the [[National Gallery]] in 2015, under an agreement that would see it loaned back to the benefactor for the remainder of his lifetime, with triennial displays at the Gallery, the first in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/press-and-media/saved-for-the-nation |title=Saved for the nation |date=July 2015 |publisher=[[National Gallery]] |accessdate=4 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905202126/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/press-and-media/saved-for-the-nation |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/28/rare-painting-secured-for-uk-in-unique-deal-with-cosmetics-heir |title=Rare painting secured for UK in unique deal with cosmetics heir |author=Mark Brown |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "jewel-like"&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt; painting, showing the influence of [[Byzantine art]] and of [[Giotto]], comprises four scenes in an unusual [[iconographic]] combination that likely reflects the donor's wishes.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; Of the four scenes, the top two are of a double height, the bottom two separated by the edge of the throne in place of a decorative band. They depict, from left to right, top to bottom, the [[Apotheosis#Christianity|Apotheosis]] of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], above a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] temple standing over the saint's empty tomb, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], above a crowd of onlooking saints and angels, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] disputing with the philosophers before Emperor [[Maxentius]], and a pairing of the episodes of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]] receiving the [[stigmata]] and [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] in the wilderness, proclaiming the coming of the [[Messiah#Christianity|Messiah]], with a winged [[cherub]] in-between.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt; John the Baptist's scroll reads ECCE / [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|AGN(us) / DEI]] / ECCE / Q(u)I TO(l) / LIT (peccata mundi) ''Behold the Lambe of God, which taketh away the sinne of the world'' ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1.29, [[KJV]]).

==''Scenes from the Life of Christ''==
The right wing of the diptych formed part of the Sciarra Collection until 1897 and is now in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], [[Palazzo Barberini]], Rome. Separated by decorative bands, the six zones of equal size depict, from left to right, top to bottom, the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]], with Christ's first bath in the foreground, the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]], the [[Burial of Jesus|Entombment]], the [[Harrowing of Hell|Descent into Limbo]], the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], with the [[The Three Marys#The three Marys at the tomb|Three Marys at the Tomb]], and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref name="Barberini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACE"/&gt;

'''Gibraltar Photographic Society''' was established in January 1965 in Gibraltar. The object of the Society is to raise the standards of photography by organising meetings, lectures, excursions, competitions; encouraging beginners and advanced alike by&amp;nbsp;the exchange of ideas and to affiliate with foreign clubs and societies. All classes of&amp;nbsp;photography shall be included.

== Photography in Gibraltar before the formation of the GPS ==
In 1940 a camera club was formed by a group of Gibraltarians who held their meetings at the now defunct Calpe Institute. This club was never firmly established and more often than not it was closed due to lack of support from both local photographers and those from the Services. The problem was very likely due to the fact that no photographer in Gibraltar had the experience of organising and running successfully a club of this nature.

In 1960, after having run for some months with a very small membership, the club closed, never to re-open. Its assets, about £30, were placed in a suspended account and held by the Committee of the Calpe Institute. Any hopes of re-forming the club were dashed by the closing of the Calpe Institute itself.

During most of this time, the United Services Camera Club based at the Command Education Centre, ran successfully under various names, though with a small membership. The Club was not open to local civilians. This Club was closed in July 1964 by the Command Education Officer as a result of poor administration in the Club’s affairs, and re-opened in October 1964.

=== Formation of the Gibraltar Photographic Society ===
In October 1964, a Sergeant K Lloyd of the Middlesex Regiment and member of the United Services Camera Club, and local photographer Mr Albert Pizzarello put on an exhibition at the John Mackintosh Hall with a view of generating interest in the formation of a Service/civilian club. The venture proved successful and that same month a meeting was held at the John Mackintosh Hall with the aim of forming a camera club which would be open to everyone in Gibraltar, including servicemen and UK based civilians. The club was to be called The John Mackintosh Hall Camera Club, and would incorporate the United Services Camera Club. A caretaker Committee was formed and a provisional programme arranged.

In January 1965, the first Annual General Meeting took place and the following officers appointed :

Chairman :&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Wing Commander P A Rumbold Scott, RAF

Secretary &amp; A/Chairman&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A A Hammon, Esq

Treasurer &amp; A/Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Staff Sergeant C P Berry, RAOC

Syllabus Secretary&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A J Pizzarello, Esq

House Member&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A Perera, Esq

Committee Members &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - T Adamberry, Esq

- M M Bonilla, Esq

- Sgt K Lloyd was co-opted to the Committee.

The Chairman due to his appointment as Senior Air Staff Officer, RAF North Front, was frequently away from Gibraltar and so his duties were in the main carried out by Mr Hammon. As a result, S/Sgt Berry usually carried out the task of Secretary as well as that of Treasurer. Lectures, initial organisation and instruction were generally carried out by Messrs Berry and Pizzarello.

Later that year the Committee decided to change the name of the Club to that of The Gibraltar Photographic Society. An application for affiliation to The Photographic Alliance of Great Britain was accepted. The aims of the Society were as follows :

(a) To stimulate and promote amateur photographic activity within Gibraltar

(b) To provide a congenial club atmosphere where enthusiasts can meet others similarly inclined.

(c) To instruct, guide and assist novices in basic theoretical and practical&amp;nbsp;photographic work

(d) To cater for the intermediate and advanced amateur photographer by means of lectures, demonstrations,                               visual aids, instruction and discussion

(e) To work in close liaison with the Photographic Alliance of Great Britain, to &amp;nbsp; promote the advancement of, and                         maintain a high standard of amateur&amp;nbsp;photography in Gibraltar.

Subscriptions were set at 5 shillings (25p) a month for full members and 2 shillings and 6 pence (12½p) for those under the age of 18. Meetings were held on Wednesdays at fortnightly intervals, with a short recess during the Summer. Several local professional photographers were elected to Honorary Membership, and Lady Lathbury, the Governor’s wife, accepted to become patroness of the Society.

==== To the present ====
By February 1966, the membership of the Society stood at around 40, with the average attendance at meetings between 20 and 25. Initially, novices were placed into groups with an intermediate or advanced worker nominated as group leader whose duty was to instruct the novices. Printing was carried out in the group leader’s own darkroom or at the John Mackintosh Hall. This system worked but with great difficulty, and was eventually abandoned. Competitions for black and white prints were held about once a month, and based on set themes. Entries were limited to 4 prints per person, and the print size restricted to 9 x 7 inches. It was not till 1974 that the first slides competition was held. This was just a one-off event. It was not till 1977 that regular slides competitions were incorporated into the annual programme, whilst the first colour prints competitions were not introduced till 1979. Initially, beginners had to compete in the same group as everybody else, but in 1973 they were provided with their own set of competitions.

Since its founding, the Society has held an annual exhibition. At first this consisted of black and white prints, but in 1977 two other sections were added : a colour prints section and one for beginners. The addition of a slides section had to wait till 1986. The size and popularity of the exhibition grew to such an extent that since 1982 two exhibition rooms have been required for it. Problems with the judging of the annual exhibition resulted in the Society getting in touch with the Royal Photographic Society in 1982 with a view of their providing an adjudicator. This they did and have continued to do so up to the present, resulting in our forging very close links with this world-renowned organisation.

In 1968 the Society only had one challenge trophy in its possession : The Society Challenge Cup, which was presented to the winner of the competitions held during the year. By 1980 the total had increased to 11 as the number of competitions and the number of sections in the annual exhibition increased. In 1985, the late Alex Perera presented a trophy he had made himself for the award of the title of Photographer of the Year to the person obtaining the highest aggregate of points in competitions during the course of the year. Today the total number of challenge trophies is 20!

The logo of the Society was designed by Mr A Harper in 1977 and the proof drawing made by Mr A Ryman MBE. Also in that year the Society made its first application for funds from the Government Cultural Grants Committee and succeeded in obtaining the sum of £90. Thanks to subsequent grants from this Committee, the Society has been able to purchase much needed equipment, and more recently for the purchase of books to help establish a good reference library. Also in 1977 first contacts were made with the Malta Photographic Society. This was the first of many such contacts with other clubs and societies, especially from U.K., with the view of exchanging ideas and holding competitions. In 1986 the Society became members of the Southern Photographic Federation of Great Britain, and through them affiliated to the Photographic Alliance of&amp;nbsp; Great Britain. As members of the SPF the Society has competed every year in their league competitions. Contacts with Spanish clubs in La Linea and Algeciras were established in 1984, and a few competitions and exhibitions have been held with them since then.

In 1981 the Society held its first basic course on photography, aimed at members who were beginners, but also opened to the general public. These successful courses have been kept up to the present.

In 1976 a need was felt for updating and extending the statute of the Society. A new statute was voted in April of that year. Minor revisions were made in 1982 and in 1983&amp;nbsp; with respect to classes of membership, and again in 1984 with respect to the use of the darkroom and equipment. In 1990 further changes were made with respect to the use of the Society’s equipment and premises, and lastly in 1994 with respect of classes of membership once again.

The 150th anniversary of the invention of photography was marked in1989 by the Society holding a special exhibition. For this exhibition copy prints of early historical photographs were purchased from the RPS, and exhibited together with hundreds of old and personal photographs loaned by members of the public, depicting family photos and old views of Gibraltar. The exhibition was a great success.

First enquiries on the acquisition of premises were made in 1985, and at the end of that year, during the opening of a special exhibition marking the 20th anniversary of the Society, the then Minister for Education Mr G Mascarenhas announced that we were being offered premises at Wellington Front.&amp;nbsp; These premises were officially handed over in January 1986, and works on refurbishing them commenced in April. By March 1987 the bulk of the works were over in the main hall, and the first Annual General Meeting held there that month. Works still continued in refurbishing the rest of the premises, and in fitting out a darkroom. The darkroom at John Mackintosh Hall was demolished in December 1989, and it was not till August 1990 that the one at Wellington Front became operational. The official opening of the premises was held on 26 November 1990, and carried out by H.E. the Governor Sir Derek Reffell. This coincided with the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Society. The acquisition of&amp;nbsp; the premises resulted in the Society being able to extend its activities without restrictions, and in the acquisition of the type of equipment which would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.

At present the Society is self-sufficient in terms of darkroom, audio-visual and studio facilities. The Society has also embraced the advent of digital imaging without any reservations; in all competitions digitally processed and manipulated images are accepted on a par with traditionally processed ones. With the help of awards from the Government Cultural Grants Committee, the Society has purchased three computers, two printers, two slides/negative scanner, a flat-bed scanner and a digital projector. In the programme of events for the year, a significant amount of time is dedicated to learning how to use imaging programmes, and the hardware.

=== Premises ===
The Society has premises which will shortly be refurbished in Summer 2015 at  Wellington Front, their mailing address  :

Wellington Front, PO Box 1422,  Gibraltar.

== Exhibition ==
The society hold a yearly exhibition, dates of the exhibition can be obtained from the society´s [http://www.gibps.com/ website] 

=== Competitions ===
The society holds a series of competitions throughout the year in two categories, Beginners and Advance with the photographer who has mosts points at the end of the year is presented with a trophy as "Beginner of the Year" and "Photographer of the Year"

== Becoming a member of the Society ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5438">'''''Interdisciplinary Arts''''' is an academic department in the School of Media Arts at [[Columbia College Chicago]]. As one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the United States, it has been an incubator for new approaches towards art making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty-three years. Guided by the principle that [[interdisciplinarity]] "is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice" &lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Mission Statement"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice",&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Homepage"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the artists who work in the Interdisciplinary Arts department investigate new terrain.

Examining concepts, forms and techniques from across the fine, performing and media arts, students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books, installations, gesture and movement, sound art, durational performance, interactive media, video, performance media, papermaking, letterpress, etching and offset printing, electronically controlled artworks, online artwork, performance in artificial spaces, democratic multiples, written, spoken and performed text, dramatic forms, DIY/DIT collaborative strategies and relational art forms.

== History ==
Interdisciplinary Arts was formulated in Chicago Il, 1976, by [[Suzanne Cohan-Lange]], Jean Unsworth, and Rebecca Ruben.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Beverly T., In Non-Traditional, Interdisciplinary Study at Columbia College, Artists Get a Chance to Broaden Their Horizons, Hone Creativity, [http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ416792&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ416792 "Chronicle of Higher Education"], v37 n3 pA17,20 Sep 19 1990, {{ISSN|0009-5982}}, Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally accepted by the Chicago Consortium of Colleges as a program taught across several universities, in 1981, it was established as a department with a permanent home at [[Columbia College Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Columbia College Oral History Project, [http://www.lib.colum.edu/archives/oralhistory/index.php "Columbia College Oral History Project"], Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Interdisciplinary Arts MA program was formalized within the context of the department. Since then, two MFA degrees were added: the Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA, launched in 1994; and the Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA, launched in 2002. The founding of the Interdisciplinary Arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the [[Studio for Interrelated Media]] program founded by [[Harris Barron]] in 1969 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston.

==Programs==
The Interdisciplinary Arts MA is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques, as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media. It is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program: visual art, movement, sound, writing, and drama.

The Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice. It promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse, community building, and collaborative practice.

The Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA fosters an innovative dialog between the fine, performing and media arts. It is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance, installation, interactive, and relational art forms.

==Facilities==
In the 916 S. Wabash building are housed the departmental offices, faculty offices, conference room, lecture hall, two smart classrooms, large computer lab, three installation labs and the media equipment center. Additionally, the [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] is part of the Interdisciplinary Arts department. The [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] occupies the entire second floor of the historic [[Ludington Building]] at 1104 South Wabash and includes a papermaking studio, a letterpress facility, a bookbindery, a gallery, a smart classroom, a multi-purpose space for performance and lectures, a computer laboratory, a critique room, studio space for artists, a resource room, and offices for the staff.  Also at 1104 South Wabash are studio spaces for the MFA students.

This following is a '''list of case colors and styles that have been produced for the [[Nintendo 3DS family]]''' of [[handheld game console]]s produced by [[Nintendo]]. Although the system initially launched with only two colors, its lineup has subsequently expanded to incorporate many more color varieties and limited editions, some of which are exclusive to various regions. As such, the list includes all color variations of regular [[Nintendo 3DS]] and [[New Nintendo 3DS]], as well as their larger models, the [[Nintendo 3DS XL]] and [[New Nintendo 3DS XL]] along with the Chinese version, the [[iQue#iQue 3DS XL|iQue 3DS XL]], and the entry-level versions, the [[Nintendo 2DS]] and [[New Nintendo 2DS XL]].

This list contains all of the series that have run in the monthly [[Shōnen]] manga magazine, {{nihongo|''[[Shōnen Book]]''|少年ブック|Shōnen Bukku|lit. "Boy Book"}}. ''Shōnen Book'' was known for featuring many popular manga by many popular [[Mangaka|manga artists]]. Some found their way into the US in the 1970s, although the magazine remains little known there.

*Manga titles with a shade of light green appeared in the last issue.

==Manga series==
===1950s===
====1958–1959====
''Shōnen Book'' had a very few amount of series at its start because it started as an offshoot of the already successful ''Omoshiro Book''. ''Shōnen Book'' is starting to gain more series, as it eases its way into a separate publication.

==Early life==
Quant was born on 11 February 1934 in [[Blackheath, London]], the daughter of Welsh teachers.&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office of England and Wales, Births, March quarter 1930, Woolwich, {{cite book|author=Kent, Jacqueline C.|title=Business Builders in Fashion|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5EgJ9BwO5Q0C&amp;pg=PA96|pages=96–99|publisher=The Oliver Press, Inc.|location=Minneapolis, MN|year=2003|isbn=1-881508-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Jack and Mildred Quant (John H Quant married Mildred G Jones, 1925),&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office of England and Wales, Marriages, December quarter 1925, Woolwich, Vol 1d, page 2092&lt;/ref&gt; were both from mining families; however, they had been awarded scholarships to grammar school and had both attained first-class degrees at [[Cardiff University]] before they moved to London to work as school teachers.&lt;ref name="Designers"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Polan, Brenda|author2=Tredre, Roger|title=The Great Fashion Designer|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H5oadQtleT4C&amp;pg=PA103|pages=103–04|publisher=Berg|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84788-228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She went to [[Blackheath High School]], then studied [[illustration]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]]. After gaining a Diploma in Art Education from Goldsmiths, Quant began an apprenticeship at Erik, a high-end [[Mayfair]] [[Hatmaking|milliner]] on [[Brook Street]] next door to [[Claridge's]] hotel.&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="V&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Quant|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/mary_quant/index.html|accessdate=24 February 2011|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|year=2011|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914124204/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/1960s/fashion_designers/mary_quant/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lisa&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Lisa|title=Mary Quant: 'You have to work at staying slim - but it's worth it'|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG9087300/Mary-Quant-You-have-to-work-at-staying-slim-but-its-worth-it.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her younger brother John Antony 'Tony' Quant became a high ranking [[dental surgeon|Dental Officer]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;''London Gazette Supplement'', various editions including 27 August 1957 pg 5045 &amp; 14 January 1985 pg 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion career==
[[File:Mary Quant 'Rex Harrison' cardigan dress chosen as Dress of the Year, 1963.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Mary Quant dress chosen as the [[Dress of the Year]], 1963]]

===Early career===
In November 1955, Quant and Plunket Greene teamed up with a photographer and former [[solicitor]], Archie McNair, to open Quant's first shop on the corner of [[Markham Square]] and [[King's Road]] in Chelsea, London called ''Bazaar'', above "Alexander's", a basement restaurant run by Plunket Green.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=berg&gt;{{cite book|first=Amy|last=DelaHaye|editor1-last=Steele|editor1-first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|year=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=1847885632|pages=586–588|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0_3qzO6NTqcC&amp;pg=PA586}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, they opened the second branch of ''Bazaar'', which was designed by [[Terence Conran]].&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt;&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

Successful designs from this early period included small white plastic collars to brighten up sweaters and dresses, bright stockings in colours matched to her knitwear, men's cardigans made long enough to be worn as dresses, and a pair of "mad" lounging [[pyjamas]] made by Quant herself which were featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' and purchased by an American manufacturer to copy.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; Following this, Quant decided to design and make more of the clothes she stocked, instead of buying-in stock.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; Initially working solo, she was soon employing a handful of [[machinist]]s, and by 1966 she was working with eighteen manufacturers concurrently.

For a while in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Quant was one of only two London-based high-end designers consistently offering youthful clothes for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Denza|first1=Vanessa|title=Interview with Vanessa Denza MBE|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/i/vanessa-denza-mbe/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddell|first1=Gavin|title=How fashion works: couture, ready-to-wear, and mass production|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9781118814994|page=130|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GX-uAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[Kiki Byrne]], who opened her boutique on the King's Road in direct competition with Quant.&lt;ref name=obyrne&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Byrne|first1=Robert|title=Style city: how London became a fashion capital|date=2009|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711228955|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quant and the miniskirt===
[[File:1960s Mary Quant minidress, green, purple and white jersey.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jersey minidress by Mary Quant, late 1960s]]
The miniskirt, described as one of the defining [[1960s in fashion|fashions of the 1960s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ros |last1=Horton |first2=Sally |last2=Simmons |date=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LYLOj2APSsC&amp;pg=PA170 |title=Women Who Changed the World |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the garments most widely associated with Quant. While she is often cited as the inventor of the style, this claim has been challenged by others. [[Marit Allen]], a contemporary fashion journalist and editor of the influential "Young Ideas" pages for UK [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']], firmly stated that another British fashion designer, [[John Bates (designer)|John Bates]], rather than Quant or [[André Courrèges]], was the original creator of the miniskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garments worn by Marit Allen|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/garments-worn-by-marit-allen/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others credit Courrèges with the invention of the style.&lt;ref name=jess&gt;{{cite news|last=Cartner-Morley|first=Jess|title=Chelsea girl who instigated a new era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skirts had been getting shorter since the 1950s—a development Quant considered practical and liberating, allowing women the ability to run for a bus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |authorlink=Barry Miles |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era |page=194 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Quant later said, "It was the girls on the [[King's Road]] [during the "[[Swinging London]]" scene] who invented the mini. I was making easy, youthful, simple clothes, in which you could move, in which you could run and jump and we would make them the length the customer wanted. I wore them very short and the customers would say, 'Shorter, shorter.'"&lt;ref name="Designers"/&gt; She gave the miniskirt its name, after her favourite make of car, the [[Mini]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Barry |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The British Invasion: The Music, the Times, the Era |page=203 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |year=2009}}&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and said of its wearers, "they are curiously feminine, but their femininity lies in their attitude rather than in their appearance ... She enjoys being noticed, but wittily. She is lively—positive—opinionated."&lt;ref name="seebohm19710719"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-MCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|title=English Girls in New York: They Don't Go Home Again|work=New York|date=19 July 1971|accessdate=6 January 2015|author=Seebohm, Caroline|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned [[tights]] that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] who offered [[harlequin]]-patterned tights in 1962&lt;ref name=jess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Ernestine|title=The changing world of fashion: 1900 to the present|year=1977|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297773498|pages=213|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=PNn-T8q3GMXV0QXltIC7Bw&amp;id=AkdEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Balenciaga+stockings+patterned&amp;q=Balenciaga+harlequin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to John Bates.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;Lester, Richard, ''John Bates: Fashion Designer'', London, 2008.&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Quant popularised [[hot pants]] and became a British fashion icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Quant profile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1966/fashion3.shtml|quote=Quant was responsible for hot pants, the Lolita look, the slip dress, PVC raincoats, smoky eyes and sleek bob haircuts, but it was make-up that eventually made her company the most money.|accessdate=9 January 2011|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=November 2008|work=[[BBC]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hillary Alexander|title=Fashion designer Mary Quant to have design included on Royal Mail stamps|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1966/fashion3.shtml|quote=Apart from the mini, Quant is credited with popularising white "go-go" boots, patterned tights, {{Sic|hide=y|brightly|-}}coloured "Paintbox" make-up, the micro-mini skirt, plastic raincoats, the "wet look", and hot-pants, which she designed in 1966, the year she received an OBE from the Queen for her services to the fashion industry.|accessdate=9 January 2011|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London, UK|date=9 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up, rather than just her clothing lines, including the [[duvet]] which she claims to have invented.&lt;ref name=lisa/&gt;

In 1988, Quant designed the interior of the [[Mini]] (1000) Designer (originally dubbed the Mini Quant, the name was changed when popularity charts were set against having Quant's name on the car). It featured black and white striped seats with red trimming. The seatbelts were red, and the driving and passenger seats had Quant's signature on the upper left quadrant. The steering wheel had Quant's signature daisy and the bonnet badge had "Mary Quant" written over the signature name. The headlight housings, wheel arches, door handles and bumpers were all nimbus grey, rather than the more common chrome or black finishes. Two thousand were released in the U.K. on 15 June 1988, and a number were also released on to foreign markets; however, the numbers for these are hard to come by. The special edition Mini came in two body colours, jet black and diamond white. She is a [[Fellow#Learned or professional societies, or speciality training|Fellow]] of the [[Chartered Society of Designers]], and winner of the ''Minerva Medal'', the Society's highest award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=These were the days that shook the world|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/20/review.features7|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, she resigned as director of ''Mary Quant Ltd.'', her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out.&lt;ref name=gillan&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillan|first=Audrey|title=Mary Quant quits fashion empire|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan.&lt;ref name="gillan" /&gt;

===Recognition===
In 1963 Quant was the first winner of the [[Dress of the Year]] award. In 1966 she was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for her outstanding contribution to the fashion industry. She arrived at [[Buckingham Palace]] to accept the award in a cream wool jersey minidress with blue facings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.B.E.

In 1990 she won the Hall of Fame Award of the [[British Fashion Council]].

The '''National Museum of Women in the Arts''' (NMWA), located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is "the only major [[museum]] in the world solely dedicated" to celebrating women's achievements in the visual, performing, and literary arts.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/about|title=About|publisher= National Museum of Women in the Arts|accessdate=September 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and [[Wilhelmina Holladay]]. Since opening its doors in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nmwa.org/about/our-history|title=Our History - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum has acquired a collection of more than 4,500 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative art. Highlights of the collection include works by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Frida Kahlo]], and [[Élisabeth Louise Vigée-Le Brun]]. The museum occupies the old [[Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)|Masonic Temple]], a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art.  It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art.  The museum's founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under-representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions.  Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by [[Clara Peeters]] that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist.  They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center.

The National Museum of Women in the Arts was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution's permanent collection.  After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition American Women Artists, 1830–1930.  To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize-winning composer [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] to write ''Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra'' inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert.  In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. Currently, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 30 people.

===Building===
{{Main|Masonic Temple (Washington, D.C.)}}
In 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark {{convert|78810|sqft}} former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works.  After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987. The Elizabeth A. Kasser Wing opened November 8, 1997 making the entire facility {{convert|84110|sqft}}.

===Wilhelmina Cole Holladay===
{{main|Wilhelmina Cole Holladay}}
[[Wilhelmina Cole Holladay]] is the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay has made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods.

Holladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and 7 countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups (e.g. [[Girl Scouts of the USA]]), as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe.

Wilhelmina Cole Holladay's interest in art was sparked as a student at [[Elmira College]] in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the [[University of Paris]].  She is listed in ''[[Who's Who of American Women]]'', ''[[Who's Who in American Art]]'', ''[[Who's Who in the World]]'', and she holds many honorary degrees and achievement awards for her work in the arts community. In 2006 she received the [[National Medal of Arts]] from the United States and the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]'' from the French government. In 2007 Holladay received the Gold Medal for the Arts from the [[National Arts Club]] in New York City.

===New York Avenue Sculpture Project===
{{see also|Les Trois Grâces|Nana on a Dolphin}}
By 2015, a selection of sculptures will be installed along New York Avenue from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of [[Mount Vernon Square]]. The museums efforts are in part to bring "character" to an area where "there is a lot of good stuff going on," due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood.

[[Niki de Saint Phalle]]'s works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jacqueline Trescott | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts to turn D.C. corridor into sculpture alley | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/23/AR2010022304712.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museums installation of de Saint Phalle's iconic pop art works are meant to be contrasting to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips will eventually be made into "sculpture islands," as described by National Museum of Women in the Art's director [[Susan Fisher Sterling]]. Another inspiration for the project comes from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of an area that is in need of becoming hip and vibrant.&lt;ref name="Trescott1"/&gt; The second artist to be featured, whose works are on display March 8, 2012 – March 9, 2014, was [[Chakaia Booker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite blog|url=http://womeninthearts.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/chakaia-booker-evocative-dynamic-works-in-the-new-york-avenue-sculpture-project/|date=March 7, 2012|title=Chakaia Booker: Evocative, Dynamic Works in the New York Avenue Sculpture Project|author=Orin Zahra|publisher=National Museum of Women in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has been sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, the D.C. Department of Transportation, among others.&lt;ref name="Pressphalle"&gt;{{cite web | author=Michelle Cragle | year=2010 | title=National Museum of Women in the Arts Announces Sculpture Project | work=Press Center | publisher=Niki Charitable Art Foundation | url=http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | accessdate=8 Feb 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306070929/http://nikidesaintphalle.org/press/20100224_nmwa | archivedate=2010-03-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These works will remain up for one year, before being returned to the artists foundation.&lt;ref name="Gopnik1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Blake Gopnik | title=Sculptures add color to New York Avenue, but are they art? | work=Style | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703104.html | accessdate= 8 Feb 2011 | date=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center ==
The Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmwa.org/learn/library-archives|title=Library &amp; Archives - National Museum of Women in the Arts|website=www.nmwa.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women.

Also available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist's life and work.

In spring 2007, the LRC launched "[[Clara database|Clara: Database of Women Artists]]," a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved.

It was written, directed, produced and shot by rock phenomenologist feminist [[Lisa Rose Apramian]], edited, shot and co-produced by drummer Kyle C. Kyle and co-produced by [[Courtney Love]]&lt;ref&gt;https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9802E2DA163DF931A15752C1A960958260&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Cobain]].  A DVD, with a booklet, is available for purchase at the official website and a release date for the sequel book is in the works.

[[File:Olifant, Aachener Domschatz.jpg|thumb|Olifant from the [[Aachen Cathedral]]'s [[Schatzkammer]]]]

'''Olifant''' (an alternate spelling of the word [[elephant]]) was the name applied in the [[Middle Ages]] to [[ivory]] [[Horn (instrument)|hunting horns]] made from elephants' [[tusk]]s. One of the most famous olifants belonged to the legendary Frankish knight [[Roland]], [[protagonist]] of ''[[The Song of Roland]]''.

In ''The Song of Roland'', Roland carries his olifant while serving on the rearguard of [[Charlemagne]]'s army. When they are attacked at the [[Battle of Roncevaux]], [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]] tells Roland to use it to call for aid, but he refuses. Roland finally relents, but the battle is already lost. He tries to destroy the olifant along with his sword [[Durendal]], lest they fall into enemy hands. In the end, Roland blows the horn, but the force required bursts his temple, resulting in death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Song of Roland'' ([[Oxford]] text, ''trans.'' Douglas David Roy Owen, 1972. George Allen and Unwin, {{ISBN|0-04-841003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Karlamagnussaga]]'' elaborates (V. c.XIV) that Roland's olifant was a [[unicorn]]'s horn, hunted in [[India]].

Another famous olifant belonged to [[Gaston IV of Bearn|Gaston IV]], viscount of [[Béarn]], and is now preserved in the Spanish city of [[Saragosse]], which he helped conquer from the [[Banu Hud]].

==Salernitan oliphants==
The ''Horn'' or ''Oliphant of Ulph'', preserved in the treasury of [[York Minster]] is one of a group that were carved in [[Salerno]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanns Swarzenski, "Two Oliphants in the Museum", ''Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts'' '''60''' (1962):27-45) esp. pp 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt; in the first half of the eleventh century. In one of its bands of low-relief carving, addorsed paired [[griffon]]s have tails that terminate in monstrous eared heads.

The horn of Ulph is most likely the very Horn of Tenure given to York Minster by the Viking nobleman Ulph, who resided in Yorkshire before the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]]; thus the Horn of Ulph cannot be dated later than the first half of the eleventh century&lt;ref&gt;Swarzenski 1962:36.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group of surviving ivory horns carved with bands of low relief have been attributed to the same Salerno workshops as the Oliphant of Ulph:&lt;ref&gt;Swarzenski (1962:34ff, 40).&lt;/ref&gt; the oliphant of the Chartreuse de Portes,&lt;ref&gt;Conserved in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; an oliphant in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], the horn of [[Muri Abbey]] conserved in Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski (1962:34) supports T.D.Kendrick's assertion (Kendrick, "The Horn of Ulph", ''Antiquity'' '''11''' (1937:237ff) that the oliphant from Muri was carved in the same workshop as the Horn of Ulph.&lt;/ref&gt; and oliphants from the treasury of the [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse]], and [[La Seo Cathedral|Saragossa Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski 1962:40 and illus.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[entertainment]], an '''origin story''' is an account or [[back-story]] revealing how a [[Character (arts)|character]] or group of people become a [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]], and it adds to the overall study of a [[narrative]], often giving reasons for their intentions.

In [[American comic book]]s, it also refers to how characters gained their [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s and/or the circumstances under which they became [[superhero]]es or [[supervillain]]s. In order to keep their characters current, comic book companies, as well as cartoon companies, game companies, children's show companies, and toy companies, frequently rewrite the origins of their oldest characters. This goes from adding details that do not contradict earlier facts to a totally new origin which makes it seem that it is an altogether different character.

A [[pourquoi story]], also dubbed an "origin story", is also used in [[mythology]], referring to narratives of how a world began, how creatures and plants came into existence, and why certain things in the cosmos have certain yet distinct qualities.

== Critical explorations of the origin story ==

In ''The Superhero Reader'' (nominated for a 2014 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Scholarly/Academic Work), edited by Charles Hatfield (Professor at University of Connecticut), Jeet Heer (Toronto-based journalist), and Dr. Kent Worcester (Professor of Political Science at [[Marymount Manhattan College]]), the editors write in "Section One: Historical Considerations":  "Almost all superheroes have an origin story: a bedrock account of the transformative events that set the protagonist apart from ordinary humanity. If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition. To read stories about destroyed worlds, murdered parents, genetic mutations, and mysterious power-giving wizards is to realize the degree to which the superhero genre is about transformation, about identity, about difference, and about the tension between psychological rigidity and a flexible and fluid sense of human nature. ... When surveying the superhero genre, preliminary questions often turn to the problem of roots." The book has a wealth of pertinent bibliographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatfield, Charles|title= The Superhero Reader |location= Jackson, Mississippi |publisher= University Press of Mississippi |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 9781617038068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], discuss in their book ''Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature'' "the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= Introduction |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they write, "Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]], event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= 6. Superhero Storytelling |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 109 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.

Dr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of [[Spider-Man]] as an example of how a [[Character (arts)|character]] can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. "It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'." Duncan and Smith explain how [[Stan Lee]] butted heads with publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], who worried about an "ick factor," but Lee prevailed. "The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions," the authors say. "Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's ''Metamorphosis'', Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful [[Uncanny|'return of the repressed']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 684 |ISBN= 9780313399237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.

*[[Spider-Man]] – Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker found himself bestowed with spider-based superpowers. He was motivated to fight crime by his [[uncle Ben|uncle's]] death, which he blames on himself.&lt;br/&gt;A 2012 comic book specifically addresses the origin of Peter's transformation: ''The Amazing Spider-Man: An Origin Story'' (authors given as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Staff, [[Scott Peterson (comics)|Scott Peterson]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Steve Ditko]]; 64 pp.; {{ISBN|978-1-74283-234-0}}); as well as its identically named revision ''The Amazing Spider-Man: An Origin Story'' (2013; {{ISBN|1742837271}}).&lt;br/&gt;Works both scholarly and entertaining discuss Peter's origin story and its variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallon |first= Philip |chapter= 6.

[T]he death of Peter Parker's uncle powerfully shapes his hero ethos and his desire to fight crime. ... [Footnote 1] There are three notable differences between the film and the comic versions of the Spider-Man origin. The first is that in the comic, Peter Parker was not provoked in any way to allow the thief to escape (as he was in the film by the rude behavior of the promoter). The second is that in ''Amazing Fantasy #15'', Uncle Ben never utters the line "With great power comes great responsibility." Rather, this line is stated in the final narration. The third is that in the film, Uncle Ben is killed while waiting for Peter in the car, but in the comic, he's killed in a home invasion. Notably, in more recent issues of the comic, Uncle Ben's murder and the origin of the "great responsibility" line have been retroactively changed ("[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]") to fit with the movie version. |ISBN= 978-0-470-57560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= 1 |page= 684 |isbn= 9780313399237 |quote= In the final panel of his origin story, a devastated Spider-Man turns away from readers: 'a lean and silent figure' fades 'into the gathering darkness, aware at last that in this world, with great power must also come – great responsibility!'

*[[Dr. Two-Brains]] – Professor Steven Boxleitner was one of WordGirl's best friends. He is a kind, but easily distracted scientist. He made a device that was supposed to help people read into the minds of rodents. While doing this experiment, he was hooked up to a lab rat named Squeaky. When Boxleitner wasn't looking, Squeaky pushes a button and the result fused his mind with Squeaky's. This causes him to turn his hair white and grew whiskers on his cheeks. When Boxleitner became Dr. Two-Brains, he became one of WordGirl's arch-enemies.

'''Ossian Opera House''', also known as the '''Knights of Columbus Hall''', is a historic building located in [[Ossian, Iowa]], United States.  The opera house "movement" was active in [[Iowa]] from about 1870 to 1930.  Numerous auditoriums and halls were built in towns large and small.  Ossian is somewhat unusual for a small town in that its opera house was a single-use type of building, rather a mixed-use facility.&lt;ref name=Klingensmith&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79000950}}|title=Steyer Opera House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2016-07-09|author=S.J. Klingensmith}} with {{NRHP url|id=79000950|photos=y|title=photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The frame building with a [[gable]] roof was built in 1893 by the Ossian Hall Company.  It features a three-part [[facade]], with a central frontispiece that is flanked by side wings.  The hall could seat 350 people.  The local [[Knights of Columbus]] council, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[fraternal organization]], acquired the building in 1956, and renovated the building for their clubhouse.  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;

[[File:Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres_-_Roger_Delivering_Angelica.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], ''Roger Freeing Angelica'', 1819]]
'''''Roger Freeing Angelica''''' or '''''Ruggiero Freeing Angelica''''' is an 1819 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], inspired by ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]. An oil painting on canvas measuring 147 x 199 cm, it is owned by the [[Louvre]]. Ingres subsequently painted several variants of the composition.

==Subject==
''Orlando Furioso'', a 16th-century epic poem by Ariosto, is the source of the tale of Roger, a knight whose steed is a [[hippogriff]] (a legendary creature half horse and half eagle). While riding near [[Brittany]]'s coast Roger espies a beautiful woman, Angelica, chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears. She has been abducted and stripped naked by barbarians who have left her there as a human sacrifice to a sea monster. As Roger rides to her aid, a great thrashing in the water occurs—it is the monster approaching Angelica. Roger drives his lance between the monster's eyes and rescues Angelica.&lt;ref&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Jean auguste dominique ingres - angélica acorrentada 01.jpg|thumb|right|''Angelica'', 1859, [[São Paulo Museum of Art]]]]
Ingres received the commission for the work in 1817 and completed it in 1819.&lt;ref name="Arikha 1986, p. 51"&gt;Arikha 1986, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; When it was exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1819 alongside his ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', the work was criticised for the treatment of Angelica's figure, described by the art historian [[Théophile Silvestre]] as "Angelica with [[goitre]]s" and by the painter [[Henry de Waroquier]] as "triple-breasted Angelica". Comte de Blacas, the French ambassador to the Vatican, acquired the painting for [[King Louis XVIII]].&lt;ref name="Arikha 1986, p. 51"/&gt; It was installed above a doorway in the throne room of [[Versailles]] from 1820 until 1823 before being relocated to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Arikha 1986, p. 51"/&gt; It  was Ingres' first painting to enter a public collection.

Ingres executed the work with his usual care, and many preparatory drawings for the composition and the individual figures exist. 

He painted several later versions of the composition, none of which are known to have been commissioned.&lt;ref name="Condon 1983 p.94"&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A reduced copy of the painting in a vertical format was painted sometime before 1839, and eventually acquired by [[Edgar Degas]], who purchased it in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Dumas 1996, pp. 25, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later acquired by the [[National Gallery, London]]. An 1841 replica, in an oval format, is in the [[Musée Ingres]]. A painting of 1859, also in an oval format, repeats the figure of Angelica but nearly eliminates Roger, whose presence is indicated only by his shield visible at the right edge.&lt;ref&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825–30 Ingres painted ''Perseus and Andromeda'' ([[Detroit Institute of Arts]]), which like ''Roger Freeing Angelica'' features a nude woman chained to a rock and a hero slaying a sea monster.&lt;ref&gt;Mongan and Naef 1967, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sasaki was founded in 1953 by acclaimed landscape architect, [[Hideo Sasaki]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], while he served as a professor and landscape architecture department chair at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/25/arts/hideo-sasaki-80-influential-landscape-architect-dies.html|title=Hideo Sasaki, 80, Influential Landscape Architect, Dies|last=Raver|first=Anne|date=2000-09-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sasaki partnered with Peter Walker in 1957 the firm became Sasaki, Walker and Associates. In 1959, Walker opened up a new branch of the firm in San Francisco, and in 1964 the Watertown location was renamed Sasaki, Dawnson &amp; DeMay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sasaki, Dawson &amp; DeMay {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation| accessdate = 2018-01-06| url = https://tclf.org/pioneer/sasaki-dawson-demay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasaki, Dawson and DeMay redesigned [[Copley Square]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = A Unique Job: Expanding a Famed Architect's Legacy| work = The Boston Globe (Boston, MA)| accessdate = 2018-01-06| date = 2017-10-24| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P4-1954151614.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Sasaki| first = Dawson| title = Copley Square| accessdate = 2018-01-06| date = 1858| url = http://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/28767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's work includes Christopher Columbus Park (also called the Waterfront Park) and the plaza at the [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist|First Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = MUM'S THE WORD AT SMITH - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) {{!}} HighBeam Research| accessdate = 2018-01-06| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8575742.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasaki won an international design competition for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] Green. The design included over 1,700 acres of woods and wetlands. Alan Ward was the lead landscape architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0190-8286| last = DeFord| first = Susan| title = Looking Past Columbia For Its Center| accessdate = 2018-01-06| date = 2008-03-06| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/05/AR2008030501762.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Master plan for Beijing Olympics| accessdate = 2018-01-06| date = 2003-03-27| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/2890191.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasaki principal Dennis Pieprz also wanted the Olympic Green design to be useful in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Monacelli Press| isbn = 978-1-58093-264-6| last = Goldberger| first = Paul| title = Building Up and Tearing Down: Reflections on the Age of Architecture| date = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympic Forest Park is Beijing's largest public green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Texas Press| isbn = 978-0-292-77337-0| last = Steiner| first = Frederick| title = Design for a Vulnerable Planet| date = 2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Sasaki Principals Michael Grove, Mark Dawson, and Tao Zhang, the firm opened its [[Shanghai]] office in 2012 where it worked on influential projects including the [[798 Art Zone]], the master plan for [[Suzhou Creek]], and a vision plan for the [[Songzhuang art colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bdcnetwork.com/sasaki-opens-office-shanghai|title=Sasaki opens office in Shanghai|work=Building Design + Construction|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">'''Scopophilia''' or '''scoptophilia''' (from {{lang-grc|σκοπέω}} {{lang|grc-Latn|skopeō}}, "look to, examine" and {{lang|grc|φῐλῐ́ᾱ}} {{lang|grc-Latn|philíā}}, "tendency toward"), is deriving pleasure from looking. As an expression of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], it refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], [[nudity|naked bodies]], etc.

==Psychoanalysis==

The term was introduced to translate [[Freud]]'s {{lang|de|Schaulust}}, or pleasure in looking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the [[Rat Man]] called "a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) pp. 41–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of [[Otto Fenichel]], with special reference to [[Identification (psychology)|identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk5gPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+collected+papers+of+otto+fenichel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZhhhTbTNGc3Oswa3uLW1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ ''The Scoptophilic Instinct and Identification''] (1953) {{ISBN|0-393-33741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenichel maintained that "a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] subsequently drew on [[Sartre]]'s theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: "the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] image of the other;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (1990) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneiderman|first1=Stuart|title=Returning to Freud: Clinical Psychoanalysis in the School of Lacan|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300039320|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==

[[Voyeurism]] plays a role in the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], most notably in the 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the film, [[Norman Bates]] is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on [[Marion Crane]], while she is in a state of undress.

Scopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's ''Peeping Tom'' (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)

Building on Lacan's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mills,[https://books.google.com/books?id=65HbQfMKmAIC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=scopophobia&amp;lr= "The Money Shot"] (2001) {{ISBN|1-86403-142-5}},  p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; scopophilia was used by [[Film|cinema]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]]s of the 1970s to describe pleasures (often considered pathological) and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton Caldwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=59S8pfkFb-IC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=scopophobia#PPA343,M1 ''Televisuality: Style, Crisis, and Authority in American Television''] (1995) {{ISBN|0-8135-2164-5}}, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voyeurism]] and the [[male gaze]] have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) pp. 316–17&lt;/ref&gt; and are most famously discussed in [[Laura Mulvey]]'s influential 1975 essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=England|isbn=978-1-4039-9246-8|pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, have objected to the element of [[scapegoating]] in such an analysis of the variegated pleasures of movie-viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miklitsch|first1=Robert|title=Roll over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|date=2006|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|isbn=978-0791467336|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Roll_Over_Adorno.html?id=oCprHBiGYoMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[scopophobia]]).

In their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.&lt;ref&gt;Todd W. Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'' (2011) pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
* The ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Gaius Petronius Arbiter]] is pervaded with scopophilia, as when a priestess of [[Priapus]] was "the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness".&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''[[The Satyricon]]'' (Penguin 1986) p. 50 and p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Secret Sexualities'', Ian McCormick notes the inter-relationship of public and private, and of the open and the secret, as features that constitute transgressive or forbidden sexualities. In this respect, there is an example from Fanny's observation of two sodomites in ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (1749): 'at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.' &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Ian. ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing''. Routledge, 1997. pp. 1-11; p. 158. See also George E. Haggerty.

==Life==
Seyid Yahya Bakuvi was born in [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]] into a rich family. Seyid Yahya Bakuvi lived in the 15th century, in [[Baku]] in the palace of [[Khalilullah I]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Hocazade – Seyid Yahya eş-Şirvani, İstanbul, 1319&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Bartold, F. Köprülü – İslam medeniyyeti tarihi, Ankara, DİB, 1984, səh 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rıhtım"&gt;M.

Mustakimzde – Şerhi Virdü – Settar, SK: Pertev Paşa, N611&lt;/ref&gt; In his youth he was engaged in [[Sufism]], and was a follower of the eminent Sheikh Sadr ad-Din al Khalvati, leader of the tariqa’s [[Shirvan]]. After the sheikh’s death, Seyid Yahya quarreled with a student Pirizade about who would lead Khalvati’s sect; he then left Shamakhi to move to Baku. In Baku he settled in the palace of Khalilullah I, where he enjoyed wide popularity as a philosopher and scientist. Soon the number of his followers (in countries of the [[Near East]], too) exceeded ten thousand people.

==Death==
According to one source, the date of Bakuvi’s death was 862 AH (1457), to another it was 868 AH (1463). There is a [[Mausoleum of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi]] in the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshahs’ Palace]] complex. The date on that building is the date of mausoleum's construction.

==Bakuvi’s works==
15 works of Seyid Yahya Bakuvi have been saved up to date. His works have a sufistic and mystic character. They are kept in cities of [[Turkey]]: [[Istanbul]] (“Muradiye” library), [[Konya]], [[Manisa]]. Seyid Yahya wrote such philosophic treatises as “Sharkh-I Gulshani-raz”(“Comments to flower garden of secrets”), “Asrar at-Talibin” (“Secrets of searchers of the truth”), “Symbolism of signs”, “Comments to the Safavids dynasty”, “Secrets of spirits” and others, penetrated through religious and mystic ideas which are valuable sources in the sphere of investigation of philosophy, astronomy and math.

[[File:Shakespeare and His Contemporaries.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|right|''Shakespeare and His Friends at the Mermaid Tavern'' (1850, oil on canvas) by [[John Faed]]. The painting depicts (from left in back) [[Joshua Sylvester]], [[John Selden]], [[Francis Beaumont]], (seated at table from left) [[William Camden]], [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Donne]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton|the Earl of Southampton]], [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]], and [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]].]]

'''[[William Shakespeare]]'s style of writing''' was borrowed from the conventions of the day and adapted to his needs.

==Overview==
William Shakespeare's first plays were written in the conventional style of the day. He wrote them in a stylised language that does not always spring naturally from the needs of the characters or the drama.{{sfn|Clemen|2005|p=150}} The poetry depends on extended, sometimes elaborate [[metaphor]]s and [[conceit]]s, and the language is often [[rhetoric]]al—written for actors to declaim rather than speak. For example, the grand speeches in ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', in the view of some critics, often hold up the action, and the verse in ''The'' ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' has been described as stilted.{{sfn|Frye|2005|pp=105, 177}}{{sfn|Clemen|2005|p=29}}

Soon, however, William  Shakespeare began to adapt the traditional styles to his own purposes. The opening [[soliloquy]] of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' has its roots in the self-declaration of [[the Vice|Vice]] in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays.{{sfn|Brooke|2004|p=69}}{{sfn|Bradbrook|2004|p=195}} No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles.{{sfn|Clemen|2005|p=63}} By the time of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.

Shakespeare's standard poetic form was [[blank verse]], composed in [[iambic pentameter]] with clever use of puns and [[imagery]]. In practice, this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line, spoken with a stress on every second syllable. The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones. It is often beautiful, but its sentences tend to start, pause, and finish at the [[End-stopping|end of lines]], with the risk of monotony.{{sfn|Frye|2005|p=185}} Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse, he began to interrupt and vary its flow. This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. Shakespeare uses it, for example, to convey the turmoil in Hamlet's mind:{{sfn|Wright|2004|p=868}}

{{quote
|character = [[Prince Hamlet]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Hamlet]]''
|source = 5.2.4–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Hamlet'' 5.2.4–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly—
And prais'd be rashness for it—let us know
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well…
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

After ''Hamlet'', Shakespeare varied his poetic style further, particularly in the more emotional passages of the late tragedies. The literary critic [[A. C. Bradley]] described this style as "more concentrated, rapid, varied, and, in construction, less regular, not seldom twisted or elliptical".{{sfn|Bradley|1991|p=91}} In the last phase of his career, Shakespeare adopted many techniques to achieve these effects. These included [[enjambment|run-on lines]], irregular pauses and stops, and extreme variations in sentence structure and length.{{sfn|Empson|2004|pp=42–6}} In ''[[Macbeth]]'', for example, the language darts from one unrelated metaphor or simile to another in one of [[Lady Macbeth|Lady Macbeth's]] well-known speeches:

{{quote
|character = [[Lady Macbeth]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Macbeth]]''
|source = I.VII.35–8.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' I.VII.35–8.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
{{spaces|24}}Was the hope drunk,
Wherein you dress'd yourself? Hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely?
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Pity by William Blake 1795.jpg|thumb|''[[Pity (William Blake)|Pity]]'' (1795) by [[William Blake]], is an illustration of two similes in ''Macbeth'': "And Pity, like a naked new-born babe, / Striding the blast, or heaven's Cherubins, hors'd / Upon the sightless couriers of the air,".&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' I.VII.21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
And in [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth's]] preceding speech:

{{quote
|character = [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Macbeth]]''
|source = I.VII.21–3.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' I.VII.21–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
And Pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's Cherubins, hors'd
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The audience is challenged to complete the sense.{{sfn|Empson|2004|pp=42–6}} The late romances, with their shifts in time and surprising turns of plot, inspired a last poetic style in which long and short sentences are set against one another, clauses are piled up, subject and object are reversed, and words are omitted, creating an effect of spontaneity.{{sfn|Empson|2004|pp=36, 39}}{{sfn|Keast|2004|p=75}}

Shakespeare's poetic genius was allied with a practical sense of the theatre.{{sfn|Gibbons|1993|p=4}} Like all playwrights of the time, Shakespeare dramatised stories from sources such as [[Petrarch]] and [[Holinshed]].{{sfn|Gibbons|1993|pp=1–4}} He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and show as many sides of a narrative to the audience as possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama.{{sfn|Gibbons|1993|pp=1–7, 15}} As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In his [[Shakespeare's late romances|late romances]], he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|2004|p=13}}{{sfn|Meagher|2003|p=358}}

==Form==
In some of Shakespeare's early works, punctuation at the end of the lines strengthen the rhythm. He and other dramatists at the time used this form of [[blank verse]] for much of the dialogue between characters to elevate the poetry of drama.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=64–8}} To end many scenes in his plays he used a rhyming [[couplet]], thus creating suspense.{{sfn|Boulton|2014|pp=78–9}} A typical example occurs in ''[[Macbeth]]'' as Macbeth leaves the stage to murder Duncan:

{{quote
|character = [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]
|author = [[William Shakespeare]]
|title = ''[[Macbeth]]''
|source = II.I.62–4.&lt;ref&gt;''Macbeth'' II.I.62–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
|text = &lt;poem&gt;
[''A bell rings.''
{{spaces|4}}I go, and it is done: the bell invites me.
{{spaces|4}}Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
{{spaces|4}}That summons thee to Heaven, or to Hell.{{spaces|4}}[''Exit.''
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

His plays make effective use of the [[soliloquy]], in which a character makes a solitary speech, giving the audience insight to the character's motivations and inner conflict.{{sfn|Clemen|1987|p=11}} The character either speaks to the audience directly (in the case of choruses, or characters that become epilogues), or more commonly, speaks to himself or herself in the fictional realm.{{sfn|Maurer|2005|p=504}} Shakespeare's writing features extensive wordplay of [[double entendres]] and clever rhetorical flourishes.{{sfn|Mahood|1988|p=9}} Humour is a key element in all of Shakespeare's plays. His works have been considered controversial through the centuries for his use of [[Ribaldry|bawdy]] punning,{{sfn|Partridge|1947|p=xi}} to the extent that "virtually every play is shot through with sexual puns."{{sfn|Wells|2004|p=1}} Indeed, in the nineteenth century, popular censored versions of the plays were produced as ''The Family Shakspeare'' {{sic}} by Henrietta Bowdler (writing anonymously) and later by her brother [[Thomas Bowdler]].{{sfn|Wells|2004|pp=19–20}} Comedy is not confined to Shakespeare's comedies, and is a core element of many of the tragedy and history plays. For example, comic scenes dominate over historical material in [[Henry IV, Part 1]].{{sfn|Kastan|2002|p=14}}

==Similarities to contemporaries==
Besides following the popular forms of his day, Shakespeare's general style is comparable to several of his contemporaries.  His works have many similarities to the writing of [[Christopher Marlowe]], and seem to reveal strong influences from the [[Queen's Men]]'s performances, especially in his history plays.  His style is also comparable to [[Francis Beaumont]]'s and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s, other playwrights of the time.{{sfn|Holland|2013}}

Shakespeare often borrowed plots from other plays and stories.  ''[[Hamlet]]'', for example, is comparable to [[Saxo Grammaticus]]' ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.{{sfn|Edwards|1985}} ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' is thought to be based on [[Arthur Brooke (poet)|Arthur Brooke]]'s [[narrative poem]] ''[[The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet]]''.{{sfn|Roberts|1902}} ''[[King Lear]]'' is based on the story of [[King Leir]] in ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], which was retold in 1587 by [[Raphael Holinshed]].{{sfn|Foakes|1997}} Borrowing plots in this way was not uncommon at the time.  After Shakespeare's death, playwrights quickly began borrowing from his works, a tradition that continues to this day.{{sfn|Holland|2013}}

==Differences from contemporaries==
Shakespeare's works express the complete range of human experience.{{sfn|Reich|Cunningham|Fichner-Rathus|2013|p=354}} His [[characterisation|characters]] were human beings{{sfn|Webster|2012|p=194}} who commanded the sympathy of audiences when many other playwrights' characters were [[Fictional character#Round vs. flat|flat]] or [[archetypes]].{{sfn|Hunter|1997|p=503}}{{sfn|Leggatt|1983|p=121}} Macbeth, for example, commits six murders by the end of the fourth act, and is responsible for many deaths offstage, yet still commands an audience's sympathy until the very end{{sfn|Collins|1989|p=91}} because he is seen as a flawed human being, not a monster.{{sfn|McCarthy|1998|pp=234–40}} [[Hamlet]] knows that he must avenge the death of his father, but he is too indecisive, too self-doubting, to carry this out until he has no choice.{{sfn|Berryman|2001|pp=114–16}} His failings cause his downfall, and he exhibits some of the most basic human reactions and emotions. Shakespeare's characters were complex and human in nature. By making the protagonist's [[Characterization#Character development|character development]] central to the plot, Shakespeare changed what could be accomplished with drama.{{sfn|Frye|2005|p=118}}

== History ==
The [[Becontree]] estate was the largest public housing project in the world when it was completed in the mid-1930s. Recognising the need for education but with no responsibility to provide it, the London County Council transferred 24 acres on the western edge of the estate to Essex County Council, who built a technical college (the South East Essex Technical College) and a secondary school (South East Essex County Technical High School) on the site.&lt;ref name=LSIS3&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet3UELBarkingcampus.pdf | publisher=London Borough of Barking and Dagenham | title=Local Studies Information Sheet No.3 THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST LONDON (UEL)BARKING CAMPUS | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405151148/http://www.lbbd.gov.uk/MuseumsAndHeritage/LocalHistoryResources/Documents/Infosheet3UELBarkingcampus.pdf | archivedate=2012-04-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The College opened in 1936,&lt;ref name=LE&gt;{{cite | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAA9olZqPSMC&amp;pg=PA42 | page=42 | title=The London Encyclopedia | first1=Christopher | last1= Hibbert | authorlink1 = Christopher Hibbert|first2=Ben | last2=Weinreb | |authorlink2 = Ben Weinreb|first3=John | last3=Keay |authorlink3 = John Keay| first4= Julia | last4=Keay | first5=Matthew | last5=Weinreb | edition=3 | publisher = Pan Macmillan | year= 2009 | isbn=978-1-4050-4925-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a building designed by J.Stuart.&lt;ref name=LE /&gt;

During [[World War II]], the College was commandeered by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Air Force]].{{Citation needed| date=September 2011}} The secondary school moved to a new site in Cannington Road in 1960 and was renamed the South East Essex Technical High School.&lt;ref name=LSIS3/&gt; The technical college was renamed Barking Regional College of Technology in 1965, following the creation of the London Borough of Barking.&lt;ref name=LSIS3/&gt; In 1969 it became the Barking Campus of the [[North East London Polytechnic]], which in turn became the [[Polytechnic of East London]] in 1988 and the [[University of East London]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=LSIS3/&gt; In 2006 the campus was closed and sold for redevelopment by Taylor Wimpey. The agent for the sellers, being the University of East London, was Graham Bridgeman-Clarke of Bridgeman Clarke Chartered Surveyors, who coincidently was a former pupil. Flats in the main building is being marketed as "Mayesbrook Manor", and new buildings on the rest of the site are being branded "Academy Central".&lt;ref name=LSIS3/&gt;

'''Stanley Palace''' is at 83 Watergate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376455|desc= Number 83 Watergate Street, Stanley Palace, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Built as a [[town house]] for Sir&amp;nbsp;Peter Warburton in 1591, it has since been [[Apartment building|apartments]], a boys' school, and a museum.

The building, which is currently owned by [[Cheshire West and Chester]] council, is administered by the Friends of Stanley Palace.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  It is used as an office and meeting rooms.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

==History==

Stanley Palace was built in 1591&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; on the site of the former [[Dominican Order|Black (Dominican) Friary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | page = 60| url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 | postscript =&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was built as the [[town house]] for Sir Peter Warburton, a local lawyer and [[Member of Parliament]].

The house is [[timber-framed]] on an [[ashlar]] [[sandstone]] [[plinth]] in two storeys.  The south wall is brick and the roofs are [[slate]].  There are four [[gable]]s on the east face and three on the north face which overlooks the street.  On the ground floor there is a door on the east face and [[mullion]]ed windows on both faces.  The upper storey is [[jettying|jettied]] with a [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[bressumer]].  In each bay of the upper storey on both faces is a ten-light mullioned and [[transom (architectural)|transom]]ed window, each of which contains [[Leadlight|leaded lights]].  Below and to the sides of these windows are panels, most of which are decorated.  In the gables are wavy herringbone struts.  At the top of each gable is a [[finial]].&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''''The Minpins''''' is a book by [[Roald Dahl]] with illustrations by Patrick Benson. It was published in 1991, a few months after Dahl's death in November 1990, and is the author's final contribution to literature after an illustrious career spanning almost half a century. The book was republished in 2017 under the title '''''Billy and the Minpins''''' with new illustrations by [[Quentin Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41189188|title=Sir Quentin Blake illustrates Roald Dahl's final book, 26 years on|publisher=BBC News|date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Little Billy is forbidden by his mother to enter the Forest of Sin behind his house.  She tells him of the [[Whangdoodle]], Hornswogglers, Snozzwanglers and [[Vermicious knids]] that live in the forest.  Worst of all is the Terrible Blood-suckling Tooth-puckling Stone-chuckling Spittler, who chases his prey while glowing clouds of hot smoke pour out of his nose, and then swallows them up in one gulp.  Little Billy doesn't believe his mother, and the Devil whispers to Little Billy that the monsters don't exist, and there is a plethora of luscious wild strawberries in the forest.  Soon, Little Billy is walking through the forest when he hears something coming after him, and runs to escape it.  As he looks back, he sees puffs of orange-red smoke catching up with him.  

He escapes what he is sure must be the Spittler by climbing up a tree as high and as fast as he can.  When he comes to a rest, he notices windows opening all over the branches, and discovers a whole city of little people, the Minpins, living inside the tree.  The leader of the Minpins, Don Mini, tells Little Billy that the monster waiting under the tree is not the Spittler (which the Minpins have never heard of), but the Red-Hot Smoke-Belching Gruncher, who grunches up everything in the forest.  It seems that there is no way for Little Billy to safely get down from the tree and return home.  

But upon learning of the close friendship between the Minpins and birds, Little Billy devises a plan to rid the forest of the Gruncher: Little Billy flies on the back of a swan and uses his scent to lure the Gruncher into a lake.  The water of the lake puts out the fire in the Gruncher's belly, killing him.  The Minpins are grateful to Little Billy for ridding the forest of their tormentor.  They reward him by sending the swan to serve as Little Billy's own personal transport every night, which he uses to explore the world and to continue his newfound friendship with the Minpins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">'''The Pastellists''' was an organization of artists that formed in [[New York City|New York]] at the end of 1910 for the purpose of exhibiting artwork produced in the medium of [[pastel]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Artist's Society", American Art News (December 17, 1910) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;  The group helped organize four exhibitions in New York between 1910 and 1914 before disbanding in 1915.  Some  Pastellist members are credited with the initial idea for the exhibition that later became the 1913 [[Armory Show]], the first major exhibition of European modernism in America.&lt;ref name=lehman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Robert Lehman Collection|last=Pope-Hennessy|first=John Wyndham|year=1987|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York |oclc=13642651 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Leon Dabo in his studio.jpg|thumb|''[[Leon Dabo]] in his studio,'' c. 1910]]
Many artists worked in pastel but few organizations were promoting or including pastel works in their annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Pastels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | first=Doreen (Editor) | last=Bolger | publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York | year=1989 | ISBN=0-87099-547-2 | page=20 | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=PGRWSZbbB5bCyQTDnvwi&amp;client=safari&amp;id=fKNQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22american+pastels+in+the+metropolitan%22&amp;q=dabo&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibit at the [[Rand School]], organized by [[Leon Dabo]] in 1909 and the [[Exhibition of Independent Artists]], organized by [[Robert Henri]], in 1910, had fostered a desire among artists to present more personal work and exhibit irrespective of the expectations of conservative organizations like the [[National Academy]].&lt;ref name="RH"&gt;{{cite book | title=Robert Henri: His Life and Art |  first=Bennard B. | last=Perlman |  publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1991 | ISBN=0-486-26722-9 | page=94 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOCYTyD2_cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Robert+Henri&amp;ei=KRNXSbe1KZfUzATGnoA_&amp;client=safari#PPA94,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Dabo became leader of The Pastellists.&lt;ref&gt;"Pastellists," ''American Art Annual'' (1911), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

A diary kept by the secretary/treasurer of the Pastellists, artist [[Elmer Livingston MacRae]], records the activities of the young group during their first two exhibitions.  The president was Leon Dabo and the Board of Control included [[Jerome Myers]], [[Everett Shinn]], and [[Juliet Thompson]].  Mr. Dabo engaged his lawyer and artist friend Henry Wellington Wack to draw up the papers for incorporation, which were agreed upon at a members meeting on February 15, 1911.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; There are no known records by MacRae or other artists of the member meetings or the later exhibitions.&lt;ref name="AP b"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Pastels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | first=Doreen (Editor) | last=Bolger | publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York | year=1989 | ISBN=0-87099-547-2 | page=30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=PGRWSZbbB5bCyQTDnvwi&amp;client=safari&amp;id=fKNQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22american+pastels+in+the+metropolitan%22&amp;q=dabo&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two exhibitions, were held at the Folsom Galleries and according to the MacRae diaries, met with good reviews and high attendance. ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the second show "surpasses in interest its predecessor, which certainly was sufficiently charming."&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;"Art at Home and Abroad", ''[[The New York Times]]'', Magazine Section Part Five, Page SM15, December 17, 1911. Available online at ''[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/12/17/104886838.pdf The New York Times]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A "striking and important" work was ''L'enfant a l'orange'' by [[Mary Cassatt]]; ''Big Wave Design'' by [[Arthur Bowen Davies]] had "vigor and free handling, with the addition of a feeling for great rhythms".&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

[[File:National-arts-club.jpg|thumb|left|The [[National Arts Club]], 15 [[Gramercy Park]], [[New York City]], venue for the fourth exhibition.]]

The daily newspapers chronicled the activities of the Pastellists and we do know that the third exhibition was held at Powell Art Gallery and artists like [[Arthur B. Davies]], [[Walt Kuhn]], and Edward Adam Kramer had become regular exhibitors. Guests like [[Gutzon Borglum]] showing some large figure works and [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]] with "his cube forms, his weird women, his astonishing color schemes", caused such a stir that one critic wrote that the show was “the best exhibition yet held by the progressive and gifted artists constituting this group.”&lt;ref&gt;"The Pastellists' Show", ''The Evening Mail'', February 24, 1912, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth exhibition, held at the [[National Arts Club]], was a sister exhibit to a Contemporary Art Exhibition held in the main galleries at the same time.

[[File:Flowers in a Green Vase by Leon Dabo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leon Dabo]], ''Flowers in a Green Vase'', pastel]]By 1915 the [[American Art Annual]] listed the Pastellists as "Inactive."&lt;ref name="AP c"&gt;{{cite book | title=American Pastels in the Metropolitan Museum of Art | first=Doreen (Editor) | last=Bolger | publisher=Harry N.

An account states that one evening after a successful day at the second Pastellist exhibition, a few of the artists began to discuss forming a larger organization of artists, that would include not only easel painter but sculptors as well.&lt;ref name="AP c"/&gt;  The new organization was to exist for the express purpose of mounting large scale exhibitions, using the same progressive ideas of the Pastellists and the MacDowell exhibits, creating shows that would rival the more conservative juried exhibitions of the [[National Academy]].&lt;ref name="RH"/&gt;  Like the American Painters and Sculptors, the Pastellists may not have been in existence very long but the impact they had on the American art scene, reached far into the future.

==Pastel==
{{main|Pastel}}

Pastel is an [[art medium]] in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered [[pigment]] and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low [[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturation]]. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph. The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques.

==Background==
Patterson began writing ''The Quants'' in 2008. He was first exposed to the [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] [[investment strategies]] while covering the [[financial industry]] for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Greg|title=The Quants: Q&amp;A With Scott Patterson|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/quants-scott-patterson-fat-tails-todd/4/13/2010/id/27748|publisher=Minyanville|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he became more acquainted with the players involved, he found that many of the most successful quants knew each other and carried similar eccentricities.&lt;ref name=min/&gt; Realizing this was a world that the average investor knew little of, Patterson wrote the book to shed light on the strategies, players, and related risks of such trading strategies.&lt;ref name=min/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The introduction to ''The Quants'' describes the real-life, annual, high-stakes [[poker]] match between Wall Street's hedge fund managers, comparing their trading styles to their poker strategies.&lt;ref name=sa&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Scott|title=How Math Whizzes Helped Sink the Economy]|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=quants-book|publisher=Scientific American|date=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on, among other things, the 2007 [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and how it helped trigger a sudden and massive unwind of complex, highly leveraged quantitative strategies. The book also delves into critical short-comings of many quantitative strategies, such as their tendency to lead to crowded trades and their underestimation of the likelihood of chaotic, volatile moves in the markets.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|last=Sender|first=Henny|title=Wall St maths geniuses whose models did not add up|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d0fbfad4-16ad-11df-aa09-00144feab49a.html#axzz223gU2rnb|publisher=Financial Times|date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also delves into the background of the various vanguards of quantitative analysis. It tells the history  of ''Beat the Market'' &amp; ''Beat the Dealer'' author [[Edward O.

The '''University of Arts in Belgrade''' ({{lang|sr|Универзитет уметности у Београду / Univerzitet umetnosti u Beogradu}}) is a [[List of universities in Serbia|public university]] in Serbia. It was founded in 1957 as the '''Academy of Arts''' to unite four academies. It became a university and acquired its current name in 1973.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{Cite web|title=History of the University |publisher=University of Arts in Belgrade |url=http://www.arts.bg.ac.rs/rektoraten/uu/?id=istorijatuu |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006191238/http://www.arts.bg.ac.rs/rektoraten/uu/?id=istorijatuu |archivedate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Arts was established on June 10, 1957, as the Academy of Arts, a union of the existing higher art schools (academies).

In 1973, these four academies, being the only higher art schools in Serbia at that time, became faculties: the Faculty of Fine Arts, the Faculty of Music, the Faculty of Applied Arts and Design and the Faculty of Dramatic Arts (theater, film, radio and television).

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Interdisciplinary studies of the University of Arts in Belgrade were founded in 2001, as contemporary conceived studies in the domain of polymedia, digital arts, scene design, theory of arts and media and management in the culture. Interdisciplinary studies were created out of the need of studying contemporary artistic or theoretical fields which are not covered by usual artistic and scientific disciplines. These studies research new artistic and theoretical practices, which are linked to studies on particular faculties.

'''Venezuelan art''' has a long and eventful history. [[Venezuela]]'s [[museums]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are well on the way to forming a new discourse in which the public can experience and interact. Capturing the Venezuelan public view and interact with the installations and collections within a museum setting, re-establishes a new base for understanding the Venezuelan patron. This considered, the museum visitor is better understood and served as it is realized that a modern Venezuela, is represented as a diverse culture, intertwined with the traditional. The proactive cultural center strives to reacquaint itself with its audience, who in fact, are participants and beneficiaries of such cultural and heritage organizations. An effort by the Venezuelan government to connect its people to its cultural organizations, is a response to a cultural diversity and changes within.

Venezuelan art is gaining prominence. Initially dominated by religious motifs, it began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late nineteenth century, a move led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the twentieth century. Notable Venezuelan artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré, the kinetic artists Jesús-Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez, the Meta-realism artist Pajaro and Yucef Merhi.

Vtape's collection features more than 1000 artists and consists of conceptual art videos, video art installation, performance-based works, and social issue documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vtape.org/about-vtape&lt;/ref&gt; All artists distributed by Vtape maintain full ownership of their work, and the organization does not require exclusive distribution rights. This model is seen in other Canadian video art distribution organizations [[Video In Video Out (arts organization)|Video In Video Out]] and [[Videopool]].&lt;ref name="Quanz" /&gt;

Vtape was established in 1980 by artists [[Lisa Steele]], Susan Britton, Rodney Werden, [[Clive Robertson (artist)|Clive Robertson]] and [[Colin Campbell (artist)|Colin Campbell]] with the mission to improve the distribution and dissemination of video art and to compensate artists fairly for their work. It was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.vtape.org/history|website=www.vtape.org|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vtape provided organizational assistance for independent art exhibitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s during conditions of intensive censorship of artists' film and video works by the Government of Ontario.&lt;ref name="AGOSteele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vtape’s Toronto New Work Shows Revisited - Program 1 {{!}} AGO Art Gallery of Ontario|url=https://www.ago.net/vtape1|website=www.ago.net|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal Collection==
Vtape began a dedicated collection of video works by Aboriginal artists in 1994, after being approached by [[Zachary Longboy]]. It is the only specialized collection within the organization, and the only collection at Vtape that will accept works on film and works by first-time artists. Longboy helped develop the collection as Vtape's Aboriginal outreach coordinator, and was succeeded by [[Cynthia Lickers-Sage]]. As outreach coordinator, Lickers-Sage broadened the collection's reach through the establishment of the [[ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival|imagineNative Film Festival]] in 1998. The foundation of the [[Aboriginal Digital Access Project]] in 2012 broadened access to this special collection by allowing curators from around the world to preview video and film works online, rather than at the archive in person.&lt;ref name="Quanz" /&gt;

'''Yeshayau Sheinfeld''' (Scheinfeld) (1909&amp;ndash;1979) was an Israeli painter and industrialist who is listed as one of the Founders and Builders of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tidhar.tourolib.org/tidhar/view/19/5602|title=5602 - Encyclopedia of the Founders and Builders of Israel|author=David Tidhar|work=tourolib.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and work==
Sheinfeld was born in [[Bessarabia]] and in 1929 he emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]]. He first resided in [[Magdiel]], then in 1941 relocated to [[Petach Tikva]] where he found employment as a stonecutter and a road worker. In 1947 he established his own stonecutting factory which in time became one of the biggest quarries in Israel, producing thousands of tons of materials daily for the Israeli construction and road industry.

==Painting career==
It was only in 1969 at age 60, that Scheinfeld first took up a paintbrush. In his first year, unwilling to reveal the need for self-expression, Scheinfeld worked surreptitiously in the early mornings or late nights - when no one was about.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Just a year later, in 1970, after a successful group exhibition in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Scheinfeld was recognized as one of the striking artists on the local [[Naïve]] art scene. Although his usual subject matter was the scenery of the land of Israel, Scheinfeld introduced the landscape using a mosaic pattern, something that had become his unique artistic signature. While Scheinfeld’s favorite media were tempera and ink on board, he also worked in various others including acrylic on canvas and board, etching with hand-painted colors, mixed-media collage and even weaving.

Between 1971 and 1975, Scheinfeld gained a wide international recognition and his artworks were exhibited not only in Israel, but also in Europe and in North and South America. In 1975, Scheinfeld’s colorful pen-and-ink artwork ‘Aqueduct’ was featured in [[UNICEF]]’s New Year Round collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19750802&amp;id=d-QLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OFgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3933,319218|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Scheinfeld had only a short ten-year career as an artist, in 2004 he was recognized by [[INSITA]], the International Triennial congress of Naïve self-taught Art, as one of the four exceptional artists who played a major role in the international context of 20th century art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.sk/go/clanky/183.asp?lang=en&amp;sv=2 Insita 2004 - The International Triennale of Naive Art]&lt;/ref&gt;
