'''Amargosa Opera House and Hotel''' is a historic building and cultural center located in [[Death Valley Junction, California|Death Valley Junction]], in eastern [[Inyo County, California]] near [[Death Valley National Park]]. Resident artist [[Marta Becket]] staged dance and mime shows there from the late 1960s until her final show in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pvtimes.com/news/soiree-planned-for-beckets-final-stage-performance|title=Soiree Planned for Becket's Final Stage Performance|author=Dean, Charlene|date=10 February 2012|work=Pahrump Valley Times|accessdate=2012-04-15|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616113114/http://pvtimes.com/news/soiree-planned-for-beckets-final-stage-performance|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Death Valley Junction Historic District is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is owned by the [[nonprofit]] established by Becket for the preservation of the property.&lt;ref name="pvt201201" /&gt;

The theater was part of a [[company town]] designed by architect Alexander Hamilton McCulloch and constructed in 1923&amp;ndash;25 by the [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]]. The U-shaped complex of [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] style [[adobe]] buildings included company offices, employees' headquarters, a dormitory and a 23-room&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotelguides.com/hotels/california/shoshone/211340.html "Amargosa Opera House Motel Shoshone"]. ''HotelGuides.com''. Retrieved 2013-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt; hotel with a dining room, lobby and store. At the northeast end of the complex was a recreation hall used as a community center for dances, church services, movies, funerals and town meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2005/02/18/news/dvjunction.html|title=The town that Zane Grey helped build|author=Bostwick, Dennis W.|date=18 February 2005|work=Pahrump Valley Times|accessdate=2013-05-21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616113137/http://archive.pahrumpvalleytimes.com/2005/02/18/news/dvjunction.html|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amgHotel"&gt;[http://www.amargosa-opera-house.com/hotel.htm "The Hotel"].

==History==
When the town of Amargosa was booming due to the Borax mining business, and its position at the terminus of the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, about 350 people lived in the town. The hotel served as a very  nice place to stay for both company executives and visiting investors, who were met at the train with white-gloved valets after a long and hot train ride. In addition to the hotel rooms, the cafe and a restaurant within the hotel, other rooms were bunkhouses for workers, an infirmary, a general store and what is now the Opera House, which was mostly used for showing films. A large gas station and garage across from the cafe was the only location in the area for repairs of trucks hauling borax out of the mines, in addition to passenger car repairs. When the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad ceased to be economical in 1942, the tracks were torn up completely and sent to Egypt, where the railroad was set up again to aid the Allies military effort in Egypt. Once the railroad stopped, the Opera House, Hotel and about 250 acres of land changed hands many times, until Marta Becket arrived on the scene.

Marta Becket rented the recreation hall in 1967, when it was known as Corkhill Hall; she began repairs, created the sets, and painted murals on the adobe walls.&lt;ref name="pvt201201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SantaMariaTimes2008" /&gt; She renamed it the Amargosa, the original name of the former mining town.&lt;ref name="metroactive" /&gt; In 1970, journalists from ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' discovered Becket doing a performance at the Amargosa Opera House without an audience. Their profile and another in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' led to an international interest in Becket and her theater. She began performing to visitors from around the world,&lt;ref name="SantaMariaTimes2008"&gt;{{cite news | author= Dozois, Pamela |title = S.Y.

In 1974, Becket completed her murals&lt;ref name="SantaMariaTimes2008" /&gt; and established the nonprofit Amargosa Opera House, Inc. to continue preservation of the property.&lt;ref name="pvt201201"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pvtimes.com/news/marta-becket-to-retire/|title=Marta Becket to retire|author=Dean, Charlene|date=13 January 2012|work=Pahrump Valley Times|accessdate=2012-05-21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616113135/http://pvtimes.com/news/marta-becket-to-retire/|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Trust for Public Land]], the nonprofit bought the town of Death Valley Junction, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1981.&lt;ref name="amgTheOperaHse" /&gt; In 1983, the Opera House bought 120 theater seats from the Boulder City Theater in [[Boulder City, Nevada]] to replace the worn garden chairs&lt;ref name="amgTheOperaHse"&gt;[http://www.amargosa-opera-house.com/operahhouse.htm "The Opera House"]. ''Amargosa Opera House (official site)''. Retrieved 2013-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and the official National Register of Historic Places marker for Death Valley Junction was placed.&lt;ref name="pvt201201" /&gt;

Jenna McClintock saw a performance when she was six years old and was inspired to start training in ballet.  After a career with the Oakland Ballet, Jenna returned to thank Marta, and decided to stay and maintain the tradition. Jenna retired from the Amargosa Opera House in the spring of 2016.

Hilda Vazquez requested to perform for Marta Becket on her 92th birthday while visiting the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel on a road trip from Massachusetts, both unaware that Marta Becket had no dancer. Hilda Vazquez, a ballerina from Dominican Republic, was invited to perform in the Amargosa Opera House for 2 years by Marta Becket. Marta Becket and Hilda Vazquez rehearsed for many months. Marta Becket took Hilda as her student and gave her all the secrets to her performances repertoire created of ballet and pantomime. Marta Becket entrusted the legacy of the Opera House to Hilda Vazquez. They rehearsed and worked hard on the performances and on Marta Becket's last day they danced together on the sands of Death Valley.

The Amargosa Hotel is open year-round for visitors from all over the world. Beyond these maintained areas, the town of Death Valley Junction is almost a [[ghost town]]. There are no gas stations. The single restaurant, the Amargosa Cafe, was part of the Opera House and Hotel, and has recently re-opened with an Australian-American cook making very upscale, Australian-American fusion roadhouse/coffee shop meals, pastries and coffees from espresso to American drip.  The interior of the Cafe is like a time capsule, like most of the Amargosa Hotel, with an old counter and circular counter chairs.

==Location==
The Amargosa Opera House and Hotel is located on [[California State Route 127]] in Death Valley Junction at the junction of [[National Scenic Byway]], [[California State Route 190]], [[California State Route 127]], [[Furnace Creek, California|Furnace Creek]] Inn area and [[Death Valley National Park]], 27 miles (43&amp;nbsp;km) northwest.

An '''appraiser''' (from Latin ''appretiare'', "to value"), is one who determines the fair market [[Value (economics)|value]] of [[property]], [[real property|real]] or [[personal property|personal]]. In [[England]] the business of an appraiser is usually combined with that of an [[auctioneer]], while the word itself has a similar meaning to that of "valuer."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Appraiser|volume=2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
In the [[United States]], the most common usage relates to real estate and personal property appraisals, while the term is often used to describe a person specially [[wikt:appointment|appointed]] by a [[judicial]] or quasi-judicial [[authority]] to put a valuation on property, ''e.g.'' on the items of an [[inventory]] of the Tangible Property of an Estate (IRS law) of a deceased person or on land taken for public purposes by the right of [[eminent domain]]. Appraisers of imported goods and boards of general appraisers have extensive functions in administering the customs laws of the United States. Merchant appraisers are sometimes appointed temporarily under the revenue laws to value where there is no resident appraiser without holding the office of appraiser (U.S. Rev. Stats. § 2609).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Church of Holy Trinity''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva sv. Trojstva }}) is a [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] style Roman Catholic church located in [[Split, Croatia]]. Out of all early-medieval ([[Croatian pre-Romanesque art and architecture|old Croatian]]) architectural monuments in [[Dalmatia]], which historians date beck to the period between 8th and 11th century, Church of Holy Trinity, with its original shape and rich findings, has a very important place. This small central edifice with six-leaf structure of semicircular arches strung around irregular circle has become one of the most precious heritage monuments of Split and Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unizd.hr/Portals/11/ArsAdriatica/ArsAdriatica%202012,%20Dalmatinski%20%C5%A1esterolisti%20,%20P.%20Ve%C5%BEi%C4%87.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dalmatinski šesterolisti - sličnosti i razlike |author=Pavuša Vežić |website=Unizd.hr |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church of the Holy Trinity has been added to the register of the most valuable [[Natural and Cultural Heritage of Croatia|Croatian Cultural Heritage]], of the highest category. The church is still in active use with Holy Mass being celebrated every Sunday at 8:30 am, except in the summertime (from June 13 to September 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsplit.com/hr/1243/crkva-sv-trojice |title=Split - Crkva Sv. Trojice |website=Visitsplit.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Church of Holy Trinity was first mentioned in a list of countries which had Benedictine monasteries from 1060, which doesn't mean that the church wasn't built in the 9th century. Historians cite different dates of construction of this church; Iveković holds that it was built in the 6th century and Ljubo Karaman in the 11th century, but most historians believe that it was built in the 9th century.

English architect [[Thomas Graham Jackson]], while studying the old architecture of Dalmatia, was first warned of the exceptional heritage value of this edifice, although it was founded abandoned and partially demolished in 1887. In 1891, investigations by domestic and foreign experts were conducted on the site. In 1914 the company from [[Bihać]] rented the church. In 1924, walls on the northwestern apse were renovated, while the previously walled up windows were opened in the 1950s. During restoration works in 1948, the remains of an older edifice that extends to the east, and more fragments of the altar partition were found. Findings are today kept in Archaeological Museum in Split. [[Arch]]es and altar screen are a typical example of pre-Romanesque stone sculpture which is harmoniously decorated with the geometric [[Croatian interlace]] motifes and carved text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-insitu.com/hr/praksa/praksa/restauracija-luka-oltarne-pregrade-iz-crkvice-sv.-trojice-u-splitu.html |title=Restauriranje luka oltarne pregrade iz crkvice Sv. Trojice u Splitu |website=E-insitu.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the walls and vaults of the church were cracked, and both interior and exterior neglected, with thorns growing in the interior. Therefore, the head of a monastery of the Assumption of Mary from Poljud neighborhood in Split, fra Vjekoslav Bonifačić, asked the authorities to renovate the church, which they eventually did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samostan-poljud.com/povijest |title=Povijest |website=Samostan-poljud.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 1967, church become founding place of newly founded parish of the Holy Trinity. The nearby monastery of the Assumption of Mary is used as a parish church because of practical reasons.

==Description==
Church has a central shape which is dominated by a dome that lies on six apses interconnected with pillars. The church is only of all six-apse edifices in the early medieval architecture of Dalmatia that is located in Split (the others are in the [[Zadar]] area). In addition, it's also the best preserved. The maximum external length of the church is 10.30 meters, a minimum internal length 5.90 meters, while the height of the central [[tambour]] is  9.5 meters. The church is built of limestone drowned in plaster and vaulted with a semi-dome, probably taken from some older buildings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Remains of an ancient edifice with an apse that had an unknown purpose were found nearby.&lt;ref&gt;T. Marasović – F. Oreb,

'''''Cliff Rock - Appledore''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Childe Hassam]], painted in 1903. It is currently part of the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
Inspired by the [[France|French]] [[impressionism|impressionists]] of the time, Childe painted vibrant, colorful lines filled with action and movement. The varying brushstrokes and loose handling of the medium, Childe shows his confident free handling. Blue ocean reflects onto the large, sun-bleached rock, while Childe’s open strokes leads the viewer’s eye back into the painting, off into the distance to the shores beyond, which are barely hinted at with lines of cream and green. Through the broken brushstrokes, Childe’s desire for realism shines through with his use of shadows and broken reflection of the water.&lt;ref name= "Cliff"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cliff Rock - Appledore gallery label|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/cliff-rock-appledore-hassam-childe|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
Hassam, like many American painters at the turn of the century, studied in [[Paris, France]] for three years. He adopted the impressionist style as his own, and worked closely with other [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Mary Cassatt]]. Childe is often hailed as a pure example of the American Impressionist movement.&lt;ref name="Cliff" /&gt;

A native New Endlander, Childe heavily favored the [[New England]] area for his work, and spent his time painting much of the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]]. This shore is the shore of Appledore, one of the nine islands that make up the [[Isles of Shoals]], located off the coasts of [[New Hampshire]] and [[Maine]]. Appledore was the location of a small [[artist colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fredrick Childe Hassam Biography|url=http://www.frederickhassam.org/biography.html|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Cliff Rock - Appledore'' was purchased at its inaugural exhibition in 1906 by the John Herron Art Fund.&lt;ref name="Cliff" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">{{For|the curriculum program|Design and Technology}}'''Design technology''', or D.T., is the study, design, development, application, implementation, support and management of computer and non-computer based technologies for the express purpose of communicating product design intent and constructability. Design technology can be applied to the problems encountered in construction, operation and maintenance of a product.

At times there is cross-over between D.T. and [[Information Technology]], whereas I.T. is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure, hardware &amp; software requirements, and implementation, D.T. is specifically focused on supporting, maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with I.T. to provide necessary infrastructure, for the most effective use of these applications and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Information Technology {{!}} North Dakota ITD|url = https://www.nd.gov/itd/about-us/definition-information-technology|website = www.nd.gov|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building design, construction and maintenance industry (also known as AEC/O/FM), the product is the building and the role of D.T., is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process. D.T. processes have adopted Building Information Modeling (BIM) to quicken construction, design and facilities management using technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Solutions {{!}} BIM|url = http://www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com/solutions/bim-modeling|website = www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com|access-date = 2016-02-17|first = Thomas Enterprise|last = Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; So though D.T. encompasses [[Building information modeling|BIM]] and Integrated Project Delivery, I.P.D., it is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize C.A.D., Virtual Design &amp; Construction, V.D.C., as well as historical and legacy data and systems.

D.T. is also applicable to industrial and product design and the [[manufacturing]] and [[Metal fabrication|fabrication processes]] therein.

There are formal courses of study in some countries known as [[design and technology]] that focus on particular areas. In this case the above definition still remains valid, if for instance one takes the subject textiles technology and replace product in the above definition with textile.

'''''Dream Home''''' (維多利亞壹號 ''Wai dor lei ah yut ho'', literally ''Victoria No. 1'')&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt; is a 2010 Hong Kong [[slasher film]] directed and co-written by [[Pang Ho-cheung]].&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt; The film is the story of Cheng Lai-sheung ([[Josie Ho]]) who saves up money to buy her dream home. After the sellers decide to turn her down, she goes into a murderous frenzy.

''Dream Home'' was originally meant to be released in October 2009 in Hong Kong but due to legal disputes between 852 Films and the director the film premiered in Italy on 23 April 2010 and in Hong Kong on 13 May. The film received mixed reviews which focused on whether or not the satirical and horrific scenes worked well together.

==Plot==
In Hong Kong, Cheng Lai-sheung ([[Josie Ho]]) works two jobs with the hope of earning enough money to buy her own apartment with a view of the [[Victoria Harbour]].&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942962.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=''Dream Home''|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=22 September 2010|author=Hoeij, Boyd von}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt; In mixed chronological order, we see scenes from Lai-sheung's past. In her childhood, her family and friends are evicted from their low-rent housing so that developers can build expensive flats. Later in life, she vows to buy her mother and father a new apartment, but is unable to fulfill her promise before her mother dies. When her father becomes ill, she begins searching in earnest for a new place, having an obsession for the ''Victoria Bay No. 1'' high-rise address from a childhood vow that she would one day buy a flat near the harbour so that her uncle would not have to walk there and back on a daily basis and not needing to search for him every evening.

The bank will only give her a 70% mortgage and payments would reach over $15,000. Unfortunately, because of an oversight in declaring her father's medical history, she no longer has insurance to pay for his expensive treatment and has to take a second job. After Lai-sheung does save enough for a down-payment, her father's medical bills become excessive. When she asks her married lover for a loan to cover these, he refuses. One night her father has trouble breathing and, instead of giving him his oxygen, Lai-sheung allows him to die. The insurance payment now adds enough money to her current savings to purchase her dream flat.

On her way to finalize the purchase, there is a hike in the stock market that makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Lai-sheung into a frenzy where she goes to the flats and attacks people who live and work there, killing them with low-tech, household items. During the course of the final killings, the police arrive at the flat, demanding entry. A struggle ensues during which both officers are killed.

Returning to her day job, Lai-sheung receives a call from her agent saying the owners of the flat she wishes to buy are willing to sell after all. Lai-sheung suggests that they might want to sell for a lower price, since there were 11 murders in the building the previous evening. That night, Lai-sheung's lover comes round to pick her up, but she turns her back on him and walks away, ending their relationship. The film concludes with Lai-sheung staring out at the harbour as newscasts discuss how America's worsening [[subprime mortgage crisis]] is beginning to have global repercussions.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josie did research and found that horror films were the best selling genre for films which led to the idea of producing one. She was also influenced by the Hong Kong action film ''[[The Story of Riki]]'' proclaiming that she had "never seen such an outrageous film from Hong Kong before" and thought that "if that could be done, why can't we do the same"?&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/film/features/33930/josie-the-killer.html|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]|title=Josie the Killer|date=28 April 2010|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews after its festival showings. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film, describing it as a "deliciously dark take on the dog-eat-dog Hong Kong housing market...another slickly produced, femme-driven item from local multihyphenate Pang (aka Edmond Pang), with its intricate editing and dash of capitalist critique adding some gloss and a hint of topicality to the blood-soaked proceedings."&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; After its showing at the Tribeca Film Festival, [[Salon.com]] declared it as one of the best films of the whole festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/film_salon/2010/05/04/tff_dream_home|work=[[Salon.com]]|title=Best of Tribeca: Killing for a ''Dream Home''|author=O'Hehir, Andrew|accessdate=22 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009231005/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/film_salon/2010/05/04/tff_dream_home|archivedate=9 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' wrote that the film was "really well done but also really gory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/blogs/thecinefiles/archive/2010/07/25/fantasia-2010-review-of-dream-home.aspx|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]|title=Fantasia 2010: Review of ''Dream Home''|author=Ferguson, Liz|accessdate=23 September 2010|date=25 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808060014/http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/blogs/thecinefiles/archive/2010/07/25/fantasia-2010-review-of-dream-home.aspx|archivedate=8 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Screen Daily]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating that "with its clever packaging and slasher credentials, the film will be grossing out viewers on the festival circuit and home video markets for some time to come" and that "Josie Ho in the lead role is focused but a bit wooden...Nonetheless Pang's direction is tight and cinematography by Yu Lik-wai is unobtrusively effective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/dream-home/5013343.article|work=[[Screen Daily]]|title=''Dream Home''|date=2 May 2010|author=Paquet, Darcy|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, [[3 News]] gave the film five stars, calling it "a classy, clever film with an interesting story that is a darkly comic take on Hong Kong’s ever increasing property prices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Dream-Home-review/tabid/418/articleID/170564/Default.aspx|work=[[3 News]]|accessdate=24 September 2010|date=13 August 2010|author=Rutledge, Daniel|title=''Dream Home'' review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film Business Asia gave the film a six out of ten rating, writing that the film "starts with a brilliant idea and has some great moments along the way but, as so often, doesn't quite manage to make all the bits cohere as the audience expects."&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, finding that the social observation of the film is lost to the "increasingly unrealistic and grotesque splatter material."&lt;ref name="hwr-review" /&gt; ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' gave the film a three out of six rating, opining that it is "rendered with tremendous style but with little narrative intrigue, it's a shame that the macabre humour gracing ''Dream Home's'' (literally) eye-popping extreme violence doesn’t extend to its portrayal of Cheng’s hardship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com.hk/film/features/34212/dream-home.html|work=Time Out|author=Lee, Edmund|accessdate=23 September 2010|date=12 May 2010|title=''Dream Home''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kim Newman]] in ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film three stars out of five stating that "there's an undeniable sense of liberation in the killing frenzy, though some scenes (the asphyxiation of a pregnant woman using a [[vacuum cleaner]] attachment) will cross a line for many."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137015|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=29 December 2010|author=Newman, Kim|title=Review of ''Dream Home''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 74%, based on {{nowrap|19 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 6.3/10.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream Home (2010) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dream_home_2010|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes.com|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5364">'''E-book lending''' is a practice in which access to already-purchased downloads or online reads of [[e-book]]s is made available on a time-limited basis to others. It works around the [[digital rights management]] built into online-store-published e-books by limiting access to a purchased e-book file to the borrower, resulting in loss of access to the file by the purchaser for the duration of the borrowing period.

E-book lending has become an increasing practice in the early 2010s for public libraries as well as independent e-book lending communities; the latter is increasingly viable, especially for books which are not available in the [[Amazon Kindle]]'s Kindle Format, [[Mobipocket]] or [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]] formats. Websites such as Lendle.me and BookLending.com have emerged to facilitate lending and borrowing of books between strangers.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703726904576192923709743108| title = E-Book Lending Takes Off|date = 2011-03-11| accessdate=2014-05-09| author = Stu Woo| publisher = [[Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of interlibrary loan librarians it was found that 92% of libraries held ebooks in their collections and that 27% of those libraries had negotiated interlibrary loan rights for some of their ebooks. This survey found significant barriers to conducting interlibrary loan for ebooks.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Frederiksen, Joel Cummings, Lara Cummings and Diane Carroll. “Ebooks and Interlibrary Loan.” Journal of Interlibrary Loan, Document Delivery and Electronic Reserves.  21(31), 2011. 117-131. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1072303X.2011.585102#&lt;/ref&gt; Demand-driven acquisition (DDA) has been around for a few years in public libraries, which allows vendors to streamline the acquisition process by offering to match a library's selection profile to the vendor's e-book titles.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, B. W. The e-Book Apocalypse: A Survivor's Guide. Behavioral &amp; Social Sciences Librarian v. 30 no. 3 (July 2011) p.&amp;nbsp;181–4&lt;/ref&gt; The library's catalog is then populated with records for all the e-books that match the profile.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; The decision to purchase the title is left to the patrons, although the library can set purchasing conditions such as a maximum price and purchasing caps so that the dedicated funds are spent according to the library's budget.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;
The 2012 meeting of the Association of American University Presses included a panel on [[Patron-driven acquisition]] (PDA) of books produced by university presses based on a preliminary report by Joseph Esposito, a digital publishing consultant who has studied the implications of PDA with a grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Kolowich, "Affection for PDA," ''Inside Higher Ed'' June 20, 2012 http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/06/20/research-foresees-demand-driven-book-acquisition-replacing-librarians-discretion#ixzz1ycQKnfeo&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, over 90% of U.S. public libraries offer ebook lending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2014/american-library-association-90-of-libraries-in-u-s-now-lend-ebooks/ American Library Association: 90% of Libraries in U.S. Now Lend Ebooks]. Retrieved 11 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those libraries use [[OverDrive, Inc.|OverDrive]], which provides ebook access to about 26,000 libraries and schools in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recode.net/2014/10/23/overdrive-review-a-free-e-book-lending-service-that-requires-some-patience/ OverDrive Review: A Free E-Book Lending Service That Requires Some Patience]. Retrieved 11 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Overdrive is the only lending service that works with the [[Amazon Kindle]].

Some publishers have feared that making books available for loan may deter people from buying the books. However, ebook lending has the potential to increase the discoverability of books, encouraging readers to try out new authors and genres, resulting in increased purchases.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

In December 2010, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] introduced the ability for [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] users to lend ebooks to friends for a 14-day period. However, not all books support lending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5721490/you-can-now-lend-your-kindle-books-to-a-friend-for-14-days|title=You Can Now Lend Your Kindle Books to Friends for 14 Days|website=[[Lifehacker]]|author=Adam Pash|date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative lending models==
Amazon operates a ''Kindle Owners' Lending Library'' that enables paid [[Amazon Prime]] users to borrow from a collection of over 600,000 ebooks without any due date, with books being delivered to Kindle and Kindle Fire devices, but not to the free Kindle reading apps for other platforms. The same book can be borrowed by a number of users at the same time, and users may keep a book for as long as they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000739811|title=Amazon.com: Kindle Owners' Lending Library|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the books that are available in public domain can be downloaded in different formats from many sites&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepdfnovels.com Ebook Download Website]&lt;/ref&gt; like archive.org etc.

From 1942 to the mid-1980s, particularly during the 1960s — the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] era — DC Comics began to make a distinction between the continuity of its fictional universe and stories with plots that did not fit that continuity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} These out-of-continuity stories eventually came to be called ''Imaginary Stories''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The title page of "Superman, Cartoon Hero!" stated that the story was "Our first imaginary story", and continued to say: "In 1942, a series of Superman shorts started showing throughout the U.S.! So, with tongue firmly in cheek, the DC team turned out this story of what might have happened if [[Lois Lane]] had decided to see... Superman, Cartoon Hero!".&lt;ref name="Superman"&gt;''Superman'' #183 (Jan. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The story opens with Lois determined to learn Superman's secret identity and going to the theater to see the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Max Fleisher ''Superman'' short]] "[[Superman (animated short)|Mad Scientist]]" in hopes of seeing the animated Man of Steel reveal his secret identity. In addition to other things, when the opening credits roll and state that the cartoons are based on DC Comics, Lois Lane states that she has never heard of DC Comics. [[Clark Kent]] then wonders if the people there are clairvoyant. In the final panel, Clark Kent exchanges a knowing wink with the image of himself as [[Superman]] on the movie screen.&lt;ref name="Superman"/&gt;

[[Craig Shutt]], author of the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' column ''Ask Mr. Silver Age'', states that true imaginary stories differed from stories that were dreams and hoaxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Dreams and hoaxes were "gyps" on account of "not having happened" whilst true imaginary stories were canonical at least unto themselves. Also, since they were "just" imaginary and thus had no bearing on the characters’ regular stories, imaginary stories could show things like people dying and the victory of evil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In the optimistic and hopeful Silver Age of Comics, such stories usually would not be told; this was hinted with writers telling readers how such an Imaginary Story often reassured the readers that it did not really happen.{{or|date=March 2015}}

Most of these imaginary stories featured [[alternate histories]] of characters, such as "[[Superman Red/Superman Blue|The Amazing Story of Superman-Red and Superman Blue!]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, readers saw possible pasts that could have happened, but did not happen. One such story has Superman being raised by apes in imitation of [[Tarzan]], an idea that would be recycled into a later ''Elseworlds'' tale where Tarzan and Superman were switched at birth. Possible present times were shown, such as one story where [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], touched by pity, adopt a recently orphaned [[Bruce Wayne]] and raise him along with their own son, Clark. Thus, the present shows Superman and Batman as brothers, with Clark protecting Gotham and working for the ''Gotham Gazette'' instead of living in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[Batman]] inviting his foster parents, the Kents, to live with him in Wayne Manor. In keeping with the fact that imaginary stories allowed for much grimmer stories than usual, the story ended with [[Lex Luthor]] killing the Kents and Batman trying to murder him in revenge.

{{rquote|right|This Super-Wedding is REAL!&lt;br&gt;The marriage is not a HOAX!&lt;br&gt;The bride and groom are not ROBOTS!&lt;br&gt;This romance is not a DREAM of LOIS LANE or SUPERMAN!|''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #15 (Feb. 1960)}}
Possible futures that "could very well happen" were explored, such as [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|Clark Kent revealing to Lois Lane his secret identity and marrying her]]. Futures that "perhaps never will" happen were also examined, such as the permanent death of Superman. ''Imaginary Stories'' appeared often enough that some comics – such as ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #15 (February 1960), the cover of which appears to depict Superman marrying Lois Lane – had to assure readers that their contents were not "imaginary". The cover of ''Lois Lane'' #59 (August 1965), by contrast, promised that its depiction of Lois as romantic rival of [[Lara (comics)|Lara]], [[Jor-El]]'s girlfriend and future mother of Superman, was "real--'''not''' imaginary!".

A few ''Imaginary Stories'' appeared in other DC publications. Batman editor [[Jack Schiff]] supervised stories in which the Dark Knight starts a family or loses his identity, though these were revealed at the end of the story to be stories written by [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #131 (April 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #135 (Oct. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff's stories were notable for the first appearance of the [[Bruce Wayne Junior|original Bruce Wayne Junior]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Writer/editor [[Robert Kanigher]] supervised [[Wonder Woman]]'s own series of ''Imaginary Stories'' called ''Impossible Tales'' which featured the same principle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, Wonder Woman appeared along with her younger selves, [[Wonder Girl]] and [[Wonder Tot]]. However, the majority of ''Imaginary Stories'' were published in various Superman comics under the guidance of Superman editor [[Mort Weisinger]], the "King of Imaginary Stories".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This was in part because, according to Shutt, Weisinger aimed for younger readers instead of older ones.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Later editors such as [[Julius Schwartz]] rarely used the ''Imaginary Stories'' concept.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Alan Moore]]'s "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow]]?" two-part story in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #423 and ''[[Action Comics]]'' #583 in 1986 was the last Pre-''Crisis'' story to use the ''Imaginary Stories'' label.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===''Elseworlds'' imprint===
The first ''Elseworlds'' title was ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' (1989), written by [[Brian Augustyn]] and drawn by [[Mike Mignola]], which featured a [[Victorian Age]] version of the [[superhero]] Batman hunting [[Jack the Ripper]], who had come to [[Gotham City]]. The title was not originally published as an ''Elseworlds'' comic, but its success led to the creation of the ''Elseworlds'' imprint and this title was retroactively declared the first ''Elseworlds'' story.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The first book to feature the ''Elseworlds'' logo was ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'' in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1994, the ''Elseworlds'' imprint was used as the theme for the [[annual publication|annual edition]] comic books of that summer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

DC sporadically published various ''Elseworlds'' titles from 1989 to 2003. In August 2003, editor Mike Carlin mentioned that DC had scaled back the production of ''Elseworlds'' books in order to "put the luster back on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Michael Patrick|title=CHICAGO DAY 2: New 'Challengers of the Unknown,' Richard Corben Monthly Announced, DC Teams with Aspen|url=http://www.cbr.com/chicago-day-2-new-challengers-of-the-unknown-richard-corben-monthly-announced-dc-teams-with-aspen/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2015-03-10|date=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several titles that were announced as ''Elseworlds'' books prior to this, such as ''Superman &amp; Batman: Generations IV'' and ''The [[Teen Titans]] Swingin' Elseworlds Special'', were cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The planned ''Teen Titans'' tale was released in January 2008 as the ''Teen Titans Lost Annual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=Teen Titans: The Lost Annual Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/09/teen-titans-the-lost-annual-review|website=IGN|accessdate=2015-03-10|date=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, [[Dan DiDio]] revealed the return of the ''Elseworlds'' imprint as a series of Prestige Format books, with the approach of taking the basic concepts and origins of DC characters and twisting them in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Vaneta|title=20 Answers &amp; 1 Question with Dan Didio|url=http://www.newsarama.com/3834-20-answers-1-question-with-dan-didio-9-14-09.html|website=Newsarama|date=2009-09-14|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only ''Elseworlds'' story released under the initiative was the three-issue miniseries ''Superman: The Last Family of Krypton'', published from August to October 2010, which told the story of baby Kal-El reaching Earth with his mother and father and how the world handles the emergence of a superpowered family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/comics/superman-the-last-family-of-krypton |title=Superman: The Last Family of Krypton Comics |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship to DC continuity====
Although the ''Elseworlds'' imprint was created to feature stories separate from DC continuity, concepts from various ''Elseworlds'' stories were incorporated into DC continuity at various times.

''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'' miniseries in 1999 brought the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries into DC continuity as part of a series of alternate timelines known as [[Hypertime]], which included some of the alternate worlds depicted in various ''Elseworlds'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kingdom'' #2 (Feb. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] was introduced at the conclusion of the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly series that includes alternate worlds that were previously seen in various ''Elseworlds'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week Fifty-Two (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
The fifth annual crossover of the [[Arrowverse]] series is set to be titled "[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]", and will include ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''. This crossover will introduce [[Batwoman]], [[Gotham City]], [[Nora Fries]], and [[Lois Lane]] to the Arrowverse, and is set to air on December 9–11, 2018 on [[The CW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/09/26/arrowverse-crossover-elseworlds-theme-batwoman-gotham/|title=Arrowverse Crossover Theme Is 'Elseworlds,' Casts Multiverse Observer|last=Mitovitch|first=Matt Webb|work=[[TV Line]]|date=September 26, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2018|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/72jANcl1y|archivedate=September 26, 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of '''exhibition catalogue''' (or '''exhibition catalog'''): a printed list of exhibits at an [[Art exhibition|art]] exhibition; and a directory of exhibitors at a [[trade fair]] or business-to-business event.

==Art or museum exhibition catalogues==
Catalogues for art or museum exhibitions may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish [[hardcover]] "[[coffee table book]]". The advent of cheap colour-[[printing]] in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple "handlists" with several works to each page into large scale "descriptive catalogues" that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers.  The catalogues for exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. 
  
In the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues in the form of substantial books.

===Format of art catalogues===
Book-sized exhibition catalogues in the West typically have a colour photograph of every item on display, and also of other relevant works not in the exhibition (these usually smaller and often in black and white).  There will be a short formal catalogue description of each item, and usually interpretative text often amounting to one or more pages.  The resulting book will have at least one introductory essay, often several, footnotes, [[bibliography]] and other [[critical apparatus]].  It is usually only in the language of the location, although if the exhibition is travelling internationally, local translated editions will be produced for each location.  The book may be published by the institution that hosts the exhibition (or one of these institutions), but is distributed by and often co-published with a larger publisher.  It will not dwell on the fact that it is the catalogue of a particular exhibition, and often will not contain a plan of the exhibition.  Visitors to the exhibition will anyway know this, and the intention - often successful - is to create a book which has a permanent usefulness.  Nearly all are produced in [[paperback]]; a hardback edition is a sign of serious intentions.  Most major catalogues are sold in at least some bookshops, and are available for order more widely through the booktrade.  Many receive specific sponsorship to finance them, and usually a number of authors contribute.
[[File:Bibliotheca Zriniana (Croatia) - katalog.jpg|thumb|Front cover of the 2008 [[Čakovec]] exhibition catalogue of ''[[Bibliotheca Zriniana]]'' library from 1662, owned by [[Nikola Zrinski]], Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia]]

In recent decades, exhibition catalogues have grown to prodigious sizes and may be the most comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas.  Probably the largest to be produced were in the 1970s in a competitive spree by Italian provinces and German [[States of Germany|lander]] to promote the significance of their region by mounting huge exhibitions on the period when its cultural production was at its peak.  A typical example is the three-volume ''Die ''Parler'' und der schöne Stil 1350-1400. Europäische Kunst unter den Luxemburgern'' from [[Cologne]] of 1978, with a further two volumes published in 1980 on a colloquium held in conjunction with the exhibition.  The three volumes covering the exhibition proper amount to over a thousand pages and it would have been unfeasible to have taken them into the exhibition itself.  Another example is ''The History of Japanese Photography,'' 432 pages long and with over four hundred plates.

This trend was led in Britain by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the USA by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.

===Japanese catalogues===
Japanese exhibition catalogues often provide captions, a certain amount of text, or both in a second language (usually English), and occasionally also a smaller amount in a third language. This is not always so: the large catalogue (over 360 pages) for a major exhibition of the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|wood-block]] artist [[Yasunori Taninaka]] is in Japanese alone. Meanwhile, ''Works by 25 Photographers in their 20s'' is completely bilingual, Japanese and English.

The great majority of Japanese exhibition catalogues are only available directly from the galleries or museums that host or hosted the exhibitions. These catalogues are acquired and shelved by libraries together with other books and are available on the used book market, but lack [[ISBN]]s. However, exceptions do exist: the catalogue of an exhibition of the photographs of [[Nakaji Yasui]] was produced via an independent publisher and distributed as a regular book.

==Catalogues for trade fairs==
Exhibition catalogues are used at commercial exhibitions and trade fairs to profile all the exhibitors at the event. They serve not only as a guide for visitors on the day, but also as an industry directory used afterwards by visitors (and others) to find suppliers and business partners.

Many exhibition catalogues are used by market researchers because they contain good quality information about companies that are active in a particular market place.

A typical exhibition catalogue contains the following: 
* Introduction and welcome message from the event organiser
* Floor plan showing the location of each exhibition stand
* Summary alphabetical list of exhibitors
* Exhibitor profiles (normally a textual description of each exhibitor plus their contact details)
* A ‘buyer’s guide’ where exhibitors are listed under relevant product or service categories
* Details of seminars or conference sessions running alongside the exhibition
* Advertisements promoting the exhibitors

The format of exhibition catalogues for trade fairs can range from A5-sized ‘saddle-stitched’ publications with descriptions of as few as 30-40 exhibitors, to much larger perfect-bound ‘stretched A5’ or A4-sized directories containing profiles on thousands of companies exhibiting at major international trade events such as The [[London Book Fair]], SIAL (the Paris-based food exhibition), and [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] (Spielwarenmesse).

The exhibition organiser is ultimately responsible for publishing the catalogue for their own event. However, many organisers outsource the design, production and advertising sales for these publications to specialist exhibition catalogue contract publishers operating within the exhibitions industry.

Other common terms to describe the exhibition catalogue at a trade fair include 'event guide', 'show guide', 'show catalogue', 'exhibition directory', 'fair guide' or 'exhibition guide'. Often exhibition organisers will add the word 'official' to the front of the name of the publication (e.g. 'Official exhibition catalogue') to distinguish their publication from unofficial exhibition catalogues for their event produced by trade magazine publishers.

__NOTOC__
:''This club should not be confused with the [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] of New York.''
The '''Experimental Theatre Club''' ('''ETC''') is a student [[dramatic society]] at the [[University of Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="carpenter85"&gt;{{cite book|  first=Humphrey | last=Carpenter | authorlink=Humphrey Carpenter | title=O.U.D.S.: A Centenary History of the Oxford University Dramatic Society | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | date=1985 | isbn=0-19-21-2241-X | pages=145–6, 151, 164, 183, 184, 189, 193, 194, 201–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1936 by [[Nevill Coghill]] as an alternative company to the [[Oxford University Dramatic Society]] ([[OUDS]]), and produces several productions a year.&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford"  The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre. Ed. Phyllis Hartnoll and Peter Found. [[Oxford University Press]], 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 16 June 2007 [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e2302 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has staged the first productions of many new works, including ''[[Epitaph for George Dillon]]'', written by [[John Osborne]] in 1957 and directed by [[Don Taylor (English director and playwright)|Don Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/pdf/record_2003-4.pdf Pembroke College Record]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2003—04, page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

ETC was home to Oxford's student revue company, the Etceteras – by the early 1970s a rather poor relation of the [[Cambridge Footlights]]. Then, in 1975, two figures who would together become major players in TV and film comedy met after answering an advert to join the Etceteras revue-writing team. They were [[Richard Curtis]] and [[Rowan Atkinson]] – a graduate engineering student who made his memorable Oxford debut in a Leapyear Revue at the [[Oxford Playhouse]] on 29 February 1976, directed by Etceteras president, [[Robert Orchard]]. Curtis had already taken his own first bow in another show by the same director, "Allswellthatendsrock!". From 1977 to 1981, Paul Twivy and [[Ian Hislop]] then took over the Etceteras, producing several shows at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] and Oxford Playhouse.

ETC funded the Etceteras' first major revue in years, "After Eights" at the Oxford Playhouse in May 1976, featuring Atkinson, Curtis, Robin Seavill and others, with material written by the cast, director [[Andrew Rissik]], [[John Albery]], Orchard, Iain Moss and other contributors.&lt;ref&gt;''After Eights'' programme, Oxford Playhouse, May 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

''('''Note:''' The Etceteras' brief as part of ETC was to stage regular revues in Oxford, while the show performed at the annual [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] as the Oxford Revue was produced and funded by the separate [[Oxford Theatre Group]] (OTG), which also took several plays to the Fringe. Today's thriving [[Oxford Revue]] company combines both roles.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}})''

[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry décembre.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', a famous [[illuminated manuscript]], is on view to both the public and to scholars only in the form of a high-quality facsimile]]
A '''facsimile''' (from [[Latin]] ''fac simile'' (to 'make alike')) is a copy or reproduction of an old [[book]], [[manuscript]], [[map]], [[Old master print|art print]], or other item of historical value that is as true to the original source as possible. It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a "partial facsimile". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source that they do not have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for [[media preservation]] and [[Art conservation and restoration|conservation]]. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in [[limited edition]]s, typically of 500–2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand [[United States dollars]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The term "[[fax]]" is a shortened form of "facsimile" though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.

==Facsimiles in the age of mechanical reproduction==
Advances in the art of facsimile are closely related to advances in [[printmaking]]. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected.&lt;ref name="koeman"&gt;C. Koeman, "An Increase in Facsimile Reprints," ''Imago Mundi'', vol. 18 (1964), pp. 87-88.&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is the [[Abraham Ortelius]] [[map]] (1598).&lt;ref name="koeman"/&gt; Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of  [[lithography]] and [[aquatint]], facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of [[old master]] drawings that could be studied from afar.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Hartley, "Aquatint," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:RueMorgueManuscript.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Facsimile of Edgar Allan Poe's original manuscript for ''The Murders in the Rue Morgue'']] In the past, a technique such as the [[photostat]], [[hectograph]], or [[lithograph]] was usually used to create facsimiles. More recently, facsimiles have been made by the use of some form of [[photographic]] technique. For documents, a facsimile most often refers to document reproduction by a [[photocopy]] machine. In the digital age, an [[image scanner]], a [[personal computer]], and a [[desktop printer]] can be used to make a facsimile.

==Facsimiles and conservation==
Important [[illuminated manuscript]]s like [[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] are not only on display to the public as facsimiles, but available in high quality to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facsimile-editions.com/en/about/institutions.aspx Public institutions with facsimile collections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDD1E3FF936A15752C0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Paul Lewis, "Preservation takes rare manuscripts from the public," ''New York Times''] - 25 January 1987 [accessed 19 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike normal book reproductions, facsimiles remain truer to the original colors—which is especially important for illuminated manuscripts—and preserve defects.&lt;ref name="um"&gt;[http://www.unimelb.edu.au/culturalcollections/exhibitions/facsimile/essay.html Bronwyn Stocks, "The Facsimile and the Manuscript,"] - an exhibition in the Leigh Scott Gallery, [[University of Melbourne]] (on-line catalogue with additional images).&lt;/ref&gt;

Facsimiles are best suited to printed or hand-written documents, and not to items such as three-dimensional objects or oil paintings with unique surface texture.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Godfrey, "Reproduction reproductive prints," ''The Oxford Companion to Western Art'', ed. Hugh Brigstocke. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001; [[Grove Art Online]], Oxford University Press, 2005. [accessed 20 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductions of those latter objects are often referred to as [[replica]]s.

'''Ferenc Kalmar''' was born in 1928 in [[Subotica]]). He was a [[Serbian people|Serbian]] and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[sculptor]], living in [[Vojvodina]]. He died in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naiveart.rs/ferenckalmar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Ferenc Kalmar''' was born in [[Subotica]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) on 25 May 1928. He began doing sculptures in 1947. He had his first solo exhibition in Subotica in 1956. During more than six decades of rich creative work he produced a unique oeuvre which revealed his inquisitive and exploitative mind. His universality is seen in his interest in various materials: [[ceramics]], [[metal]], [[wood]] and frequent change of medium, until his ultimate surrender to raw, magnetic energy of the unity of painting and sculpture, expressed in coloured wood [[sculptures]]. He died in his [[atelier]] in [[Subotica]] ([[Serbia]]) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Н. Крстић, Наивна и маргинална уметност Србије, МНМУ, Јагодина, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic style ==
At the beginning of the eighties, coloured wood successfully and permanently ranked Ferend Kalmar among artists of [[outsider art]] in [[Serbia]]. His journey to the United States (in the early eighties) when he was fascinated with the art of distant [[Indian culture]], [[Mayan art]] and [[reliefs]] on Egyptian [[tombstones]] stimulated new sources of inspiration, changed his philosophy of living and artistic perception. He watched [[India|Indian]] [[ritual dances]] where [[exotic dancers]] decorated with feathers, flowers and turquoise flitted like birds in the wind.&lt;ref&gt;N. Krstić, Outsiders, catalogue, MNMU, Jagodina, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
As an explicitly authentic artist, the explorer of primordial unity, in the era of incredible speed and smoke of high technologies he provided us with the reminiscences of lost dimensions of everlasting childhood. With deep and surface incisions, the artist achieved the dynamics of closed and open, sharp and rounded forms, a dance of light and shadow. He coloured his figures with strong and bright tint and frequent interchanges of red and green, blue and yellow. The colour always followed the development of volume, whether related to gorgeous branching or delicately stylized and calm forms. The combination of the sculptural and the pictorial bears witness of the artist's complexity and expressiveness with additional help of naturally "blooming" forms, and nearly fauvist, wild tint. Kalmar the sculptor is sometimes overmastered by Kalmar the painter! The mere procedure of embodiment of the artist’s idea is an indispensable ritual where the artist and wood intertwine, surrender, snatch and combine. Animals are basic objects of Kalmar's inspiration: [[bird]]s, [[Insect|bugs]], [[lizard]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[butterflies]]. His artistic ''credo'' is fully expressed in monumental and brightly painted birds. 
“Birds are divine creatures. Man is astonished with their grace and tenderness. Monuments should be erected to these beautiful creatures because our generations may be the last who are lucky to listen to nightingales in nature” he used to say.&lt;ref name="krstic1"&gt;N. Krstić, Outsider Art in Serbia, monograph, MNMA, Јагодина, 2014, pp. 108-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions and awards ==
The numerous collection of his sculptures is at Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia. 
He exhibited worldwide and he was awarded several times. 
The most significant awards are ''Forum’s Prize for Art'' [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]], 1993) and the ''Award for Entire Artistic Work'' at the [http://www.mnmu.rs Thirteenth International Biennial of Naïve and Marginal Art], MNMA, Jagodina, 2007.&lt;ref name="krstic1"/&gt;

'''Film criticism''' is the analysis and evaluation of [[film]]s and the film medium. The concept is often used interchangeably with that of film reviews. A film review implies a recommendation aimed at consumers, however not all film criticism takes the form of reviews.

In general, film criticism can be divided into two categories: journalistic criticism which appears regularly in [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s and other popular mass-media outlets; and academic criticism by [[film scholar]]s who are informed by [[film theory]] and are published in academic journals. Academic film criticism rarely takes the form of a review; instead it is more likely to analyse the film and its place within the history of its genre, or the whole of [[History of film|film history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://researchguides.uvm.edu/c.php?g=290200&amp;p=3481769|title=Reviews vs Criticism - Film &amp; Television Studies|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2017|website=The University of Vermont Libraries Research Guides|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Film was introduced in the late 19th century. The earliest artistic criticism of film emerged in the early 1900s. The first paper to serve as a critique of film came out of ''The Optical Lantern and Cinematograph Journal,'' followed by the ''Bioscope'' in 1908.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=James|date=May 2010|title=Everyone's a Critic: Film Criticism Through History and Into the Digital Age|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honors|journal=Senior Honors Theses|volume=|pages=32|via=Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film is a relatively new form of art, in comparison to [[music]], [[literature]] and [[painting]] which have existed since ancient times. Because of this, early writing on film sought to argue that films could also be respected as art. In 1911, [[Ricciotto Canudo]] wrote a manifesto proclaiming cinema to be the "Sixth Art" (later "Seventh Art").&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Dotoli, ''Ricciotto Canudo ou le cinéma comme art'', Preface by Jean-Louis Leutrat, Fasano-Paris, Schena-Didier Érudition, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades after, film was still being treated with less prestige than longer-established art forms.&lt;ref name="kilkenny"/&gt;

By the 1920s, critics were analyzing film for its merit and value as more than just entertainment. The growing popularity of the medium caused major newspapers to start hiring film critics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In the 1930s, the film industry developed [[Movie star|concepts of stardom]] and celebrity in relation to actors, which led to a rise in obsession with critics as well, to the point that they were often seen on "[[red carpet]]" and at major events with the actors.

It was in the 1940s that new forms of criticism emerged. Essays analyzing films with a distinctive charm and style to persuade the reader of the critic's argument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was the emergence of these styles that brought film criticism to the mainstream, gaining the attention of many popular magazines; this made film reviews and critiques an eventual staple among most print media. As the decades passed, the fame for critics grew and gave rise to household names among the craft like [[James Agee]], [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Pauline Kael]] and in modern times [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Peter Travers]].

== Journalistic criticism ==
Film [[critic]]s working for [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[broadcast media]], and online publications, mainly review new releases, although also review older films.&lt;ref name="Classics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/classic/|title=The Classic|work=At the Movies with Margaret and David|publisher=ABC.net.au|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important task for these reviews is to inform readers on whether or not they would want to see the film. A film review will typically explain the [[Premise (filmmaking)|premise]] of the film before discussing its merits. The verdict is often summarised with a form of rating. Numerous rating systems exist, such as [[Star rating#Films|5- or 4-star scales]], academic-style grades and pictograms (such as in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'').

[[File:Russ_Meyer_and_Roger_Ebert_by_Roger_Ebert.jpg|right|thumb|264x264px|Chicago critic Roger Ebert (R) with director [[Russ Meyer]].]]
Some well-known journalistic critics have included: [[James Agee]] (''Time'' (magazine), ''The Nation''); [[Vincent Canby]] (''The New York Times''); [[Roger Ebert]] (''Chicago Sun-Times''); [[Mark Kermode]] (''BBC'', ''The Observer''); [[James Berardinelli]]; [[Philip French]] (''The Observer''); [[Pauline Kael]] (''The New Yorker''); [[Manny Farber]] (''The New Republic'', ''Time'', ''The Nation''); [[Peter Bradshaw]] (''The Guardian''); [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] (''Chicago Tribune''); [[Andrew Sarris]] (''The Village Voice''); [[Joel Siegel]] (''Good Morning America''); [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] (''Chicago Reader''); and [[Christy Lemire]] (''What The Flick?!'').

[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] popularised the concept of reviewing films in a television format in the show ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert At the Movies]]'' which became syndicated in the 1980s. Both critics had established their careers in print media, and continued to write written reviews for their respective newspapers alongside their television show.

== Online film criticism ==
===Aggregators===
Some websites, such as [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and [[Metacritic]], seek to improve the usefulness of film reviews by compiling them and assigning a score to each in order to gauge the general reception a film receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/06/slates_hollywood_careeromatic.html|title=Slate's Hollywood Career-O-Matic|last=Beam|first=Christopher|date=2011-06-06|work=Slate|access-date=2017-10-25|last2=Singer-Vine|first2=Jeremy|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online film critics===
[[Blogging]] has also introduced opportunities for a new wave of amateur film critics to have their opinions heard. These review blogs may focus on one genre, director or actor, or encompass a much wider variety of films. Friends, friends of friends, or strangers are able to visit these blogsites, and can often leave their own comments about the movie and/or the author's review. Although much less frequented than their professional counterparts, these sites can gather a following of like-minded people who look to specific bloggers for reviews as they have found that the critic consistently exhibits an outlook very similar to their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/blogging-what-is-it-1794405|title=What is blogging?|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[YouTube]] has also served as a platform for amateur film critics.

Some websites specialize in narrow aspects of film reviewing. For instance, there are sites that focus on specific content advisories for parents to judge a film's suitability for children. Others focus on a religious perspective (e.g. CAP Alert). Still others highlight more esoteric subjects such as the depiction of [[science]] in fiction films. One such example is ''Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics'' by [[Intuitor]]. Some online niche websites provide comprehensive coverage of the independent sector; usually adopting a style closer to print journalism. They tend to prohibit adverts and offer uncompromising opinions free of any commercial interest. Their film critics normally have an academic film background.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Online Film Critics Society]], an international professional association of Internet-based cinema reviewers, consists of writers from all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ofcs.org/bylaws-of-the-online-film-critics-society/|title=Our Bylaws – Online Film Critics Society|website=ofcs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[New York Film Critics Online]] members handle reviews in the New York tri-state area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyfco.net/who-we-are/|title=New York Film Critics Online - Who We Are|website=www.nyfco.net|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User-submitted reviews===
A number of websites allow Internet users to submit movie reviews and aggregate them into an average. Community-driven review sites have allowed the common movie goer to express their opinion on films. Many of these sites allow users to rate films on a 0 to 10 scale, while some rely on the star rating system of 1–5, 0–5 or 0–4 stars. The votes are then culled into an overall rating and ranking for any particular film. Some of these community driven review sites include Reviewer, Movie Attractions, [[Flixster]], [[FilmCrave]], [[Flickchart]] and [[Everyone's a Critic]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and [[Metacritic]] aggregate both scores from accredited critics and those submitted by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: About|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On these online review sites, users generally only have to register with the site in order to submit reviews. This means that they are a form of [[open access poll]], and have the same advantages and disadvantages; notably, there is no guarantee that they will be a representative sample of the film's audience. In some cases, online review sites have produced wildly differing results to scientific polling of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-imdb-users-cinemascore-posttrak-1202228837/|title=Did Audiences Enjoy ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’?

=== Taste-based reviews ===
The  emerging big data science has enabled computing to understand user's taste from reviews and connect them with similar users so that networked Tribe can be a great source of recommendations.  Most review aggregators indirectly influence the herd mentality in us while critic reviewers are just one opinion among many. CineBee, a machine learning based approach to reviews and opinions, helps isolate user's taste from their reviews and connects similar users. As these Tribes are formed, CineBee uses the Tribe intelligence to provide recommendation, prediction and discovery to its users.  

== Academic film criticism ==
More often known as [[film theory]] or [[film studies]], academic critique explores cinema beyond journalistic film reviews. These film critics try to examine why film works, how it works aesthetically or politically, what it means, and what effects it has on people. Rather than write for mass-market publications their articles are usually published in scholarly journals and texts which tend to be affiliated with university presses; or sometimes in up-market magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/english/faculty/publications_nz.html#ray|title=Faculty publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most academic criticism of film often follows a similar format. They usually include summaries of the plot of the film to either refresh the plot to the reader, or reinforce an idea of repetition in the film's genre. After this, there tends to be discussions about the cultural context, major themes and repetitions, and details about the legacy of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hantke|first=Steffen|date=2007|title=Academic Film Criticism, the Rhetoric of Crisis, and the Current State of American Horror Cinema: Thoughts on Canonicity and Academic Anxiety|jstor=25115464|journal=College Literature|volume=34|issue=4|pages=191–202|doi=10.2307/25115464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable academic film critics include [[André Bazin]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]] (all writers for ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]''); [[Kristin Thompson]], [[David Bordwell]], and [[Sergei Eisenstein]]. Godard, Truffaut and Eisenstein were also film directors.

==Issues and controversies==
===Influence===
In the 2000s, the effect that reviews have on a film's [[box office]] performance and DVD rentals/sales have become a matter for debate. Some analysts argue that modern [[movie marketing]], using pop culture convention appearances (e.g., [[Comicon]]) and [[social media]] along with traditional means of advertising, has led, in part, to a decline in the readership of many reviewers for newspapers and other print publications. There are fewer critics on television and radio in the last thirty years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

However, in recent years, there has been a growing belief in the film industry that critic aggregators (especially [[Rotten Tomatoes]]) are increasing the collective influence of film critics. The underperformance of several films in 2017 was blamed on their low scores on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/06/13/box-office-rotten-tomatoes-netflix-and-a-perfect-storm-dooms-hollywood/#6704f0f43a61|title=Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix And A Perfect Storm That Dooms Hollywood|last1=Mendelson|first1=Scott|date=13 June 2017|accessdate=14 June 2017|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to studies such as one commissioned by [[20th Century Fox]] claiming that younger viewers give the website more credibility than the major studio [[Movie marketing|marketing]], which undercuts its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/how-hollywood-came-to-fear-and-loathe-rotten-tomatoes|title=How Hollywood Came to Fear and Loathe Rotten Tomatoes|last1=Lee|first1=Chris|date=9 June 2017|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, fan-run film analysis websites like [[Box Office Prophets]], [[CineBee]] and Box Office Guru routinely factor more into the opinions of the general public on films produced.

===  The "undulating curve of shifting expectations" ===
The "undulating curve of shifting expectations" (UCoSE) refers to both the title of a recurring entertainment industry feature in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine by cultural critic [[Adam Sternbergh]] and also to a concept of media analysis co-developed by writer [[Emily Nussbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/212516-when-it-ok-spoil/|title=When Is It OK to Spoil?|work=[[On the Media]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/the-mathemagical-world-of-new-york-magazine_b1149|title=The Mathemagical World of New York Magazine|publisher=mediabistro.com|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCoSE refers to the dynamic tension between pre-release promotional efforts and subsequent audience reactions to entertainment media.&lt;blockquote&gt;…what the UCoSE does is provide us a way of analyzing the trajectory of entertainment products as they metamorphize their way through his theorized seven-stage growth chart: Pre-Buzz, Buzz, Rave Reviews, Saturation Point, Overhyped, Backlash, and finally, Backlash To The Backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-01-19/whitney-cummings-the-television-industrys-most-criticized-female-comes-out-in-support-of-lana-del-rey-the-music-industrys-most-criticized-female/|title=Whitney Cummings, The Television Industry’s Most Criticized Female, Comes Out In Support Of Lana Del Rey, The Music Industry’s Most Criticized Female|publisher=VH1 Music News|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Female representation ===
There have been many complaints against the film-criticism industry for its underrepresentation of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/spotlight/lack-of-women-film-criticism-1201667282/|title=The Curious Case of the Missing Women in Film Criticism|last=Adams|first=Thelma|date=2015-12-29|work=Variety|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the top critics on Rotten Tomatoes shows that 91 per cent of writers for movie/entertainment magazines and websites are men, as are 90 per cent of those for trade publications, 80 per cent of critics for general interest magazines like [[Time (magazine)|Time]], and 70 per cent of reviewers for radio formats such as [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/23/film-criticism-gender-study/|title=Male film critics greatly outnumber female critics, study finds|date=2016-06-23|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Kate Kilkenny argued that women were better represented in film criticism before the rise of the Internet. In the past, when film was considered less prestigious than visual art and literature, it was easier for women to break into film criticism. [[Judith Crist]] and [[Pauline Kael]] were two of the most influential film critics of the 1960s and 1970s. The Internet led to a decline in jobs at small newspapers where women were more likely to review films, whereas the more male-dominated jobs at major newspapers survived better. The Internet also encouraged a growth in niche review websites that were even more male-dominated than older media. Kilkenny also suggested that the shortage of female critics was related to the shortage of female opinion columnists.&lt;ref name="kilkenny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/female-film-critics/421629/|publisher=The Atlantic|title=How the Internet Led to the Decline of Female Film Critics|date=2015-12-27|accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clem Bastow, culture writer at ''[[The Guardian Australia]]'', discussed the possible effects of this on the critical response to the 2015 film ''[[The Intern (2015 film)|The Intern]]'', which received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics:&lt;blockquote&gt;The critical response to ''The Intern'' was fascinating. There’s a subset of male critics that clearly see Nancy Meyers as code for chick flick and react with according bile. What’s very interesting, though, is that I think female critics, working in an industry that is coded as very male, if not macho, often feel the need to go hard on certain films for women, presumably because they worry that they’ll be dismissed, critically speaking, if they praise a film like ''The Intern'' as though they’re only reviewing it favorably because they’re women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Film Critic Salary ==
As of 2013 film critics make about $82,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://work.chron.com/pay-scale-movie-critics-19069.html|title=Pay Scale for Movie Critics|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper and Magazine critics would make $27,364-$49,574.&lt;ref name="Bizfluent"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bizfluent.com/info-8519831-much-do-movie-critics-make.html|title=How Much Money Do Movie Critics Make?|work=Bizfluent|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online movie critics would make $2-$200 per review.&lt;ref name="Bizfluent"/&gt; TV critics would make up to $40,000-$60,000 per month.&lt;ref name="Bizfluent"/&gt;

The '''Gairloch Stone''' is a Class-I [[Pictish stone]] which was discovered at [[Achtercairn]] in [[Wester Ross]] around 1880. Subsequently, the stone was used as masonry for the cemetery wall of [[Gairloch]]'s church. It has survived only imperfectly, but on it are still visible a [[fish]] - probably a [[salmon]] - and, above, the lower part of a bird. The bird is probably an [[eagle]], common on Pictish stones, but a goose has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Iain, Ritchie, J.N.G., ''et al.'', ''Pictish Symbol Stones: An Illustrated Gazetteer'', (Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The stone currently resides in [[Gairloch Heritage Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gairloch Heritage Museum]], http://www.gairlochheritagemuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb.JPG|thumb|''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'' – Picture from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
According to the [[Bible]], the '''golden calf''' (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב '' ‘ēggel hazāhāv'') was an [[Idolatry|idol]] (a [[cult image]]) made by the [[Israelites]] during [[Moses]]' absence, when he went up to [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the incident is known as ''ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel'' (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or "The Sin of the Calf". It is first mentioned in {{bibleref2|Exodus|32:4}}.

[[Bull worship]] was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the [[The Exodus|Exodus narrative]] the Hebrews had recently come, the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis Bull]] was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;The early Christian ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. IV|vi. 4]] (c. 380), mentions that "the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice, before the people made that calf which represented the Egyptian Apis."&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of [[religious assimilation]] and [[syncretism]]. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the [[ancient Near East]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[aurochs]], the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]] and as the creature of [[El (god)|El]].

==In the Book of Exodus==

[[File:The Worship of the Golden Calf (Filippino Lippi).jpg|thumb|right|''The Worship of the Golden Calf'' by [[Filippino Lippi]] (1457–1504)]]
When [[Moses]] went up into [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] to receive the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|24:12-18|9}}), he left the Israelites for [[forty days and forty nights]]. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that [[Aaron]] make them "gods" to go before them ({{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|9}}). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a "molten calf" and they declared: "These ''[be]'' thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." (Exodus 32:4)

Aaron built an [[altar]] before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the {{LORD}}. So they rose up early the next day and "offered [[Korban Olah|burnt-offerings]], and brought [[Slaughter offering|peace-offerings]]; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play." (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:11-14|HE}}), and God "repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people."

Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two [[Tablets of Stone]], breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:21-24|HE}}).

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===
{{main|Levite}}
The Bible records that the [[tribe of Levi]] did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the {{LORD}}'s side, let him come unto me.' And all the [[Levite|sons of Levi]] gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the {{LORD}}, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:26-28|HE}})

The golden calf is mentioned in {{bibleref2|Nehemiah|9:16–21|NIV}}.
{{quote|
"But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt', or when they committed awful blasphemies. "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."}}

The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1&amp;nbsp;Kings are written by [[Deuteronomist]]ic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:4 where "gods" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009, pg.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between "gods" in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32 and "God" in Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew ''[[elohim]]'' is used.  Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish ''elohim'' God (known as the majestic plural) from ''elohim'' gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a)&amp;nbsp;context or (b)&amp;nbsp;adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32, the verb is in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;person plural. In Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9, the verb connected to ''elohim'' is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000&amp;nbsp;years apart: Exodus (by Moses) ''circa'' 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, and Nehemiah ''circa'' 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.

==Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
{{main|Jeroboam}}
[[Image:Worshiping the golden calf.jpg|thumb|right|Worshiping the Golden Calf]]
According to {{bibleref2|1 Kings|12:26–30|NIV}}, after [[Jeroboam]] establishes the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
{{quote|
Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the {{LORD}} in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." One he set up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.}}

His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], would lead to a return to King [[Rehoboam]]. He makes two golden calves and places them in [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the ''[[cherub]]im'' built by [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pg. 117, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] says "at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people." Friedman believes that the story was turned into a [[polemic]], exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott "Who Wrote the Bible?" 1987 pp 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8);
* 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=John E.|title=Retelling the Torah: the Deuteronomistic historian's use of Tetrateuchal Narratives|date=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark International|location=New York; London|page=2|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/retelling-the-torah-the-deuteronomistic-historians-use-of-tetrateuchal-narratives/oclc/276852204}}: "The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views==
[[File:Book of Exodus Chapter 33-8 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett)]]
In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', the Conservative rabbi and scholar [[Louis Ginzberg]] wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in [[The Exodus|their exodus]] from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=Ginzberg&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at [[Crossing the Red Sea|passing through the Red Sea]], when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt; After seeing [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] son of [[Miriam]] who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, [[Aaron]] was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt;

Also there would be among the Israelites no [[priestly caste]], and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the [[tribe of Levi]] as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic narrative==
{{tone|section|date=April 2012}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam|Islamic view of Aaron}}
{{Musa|related}}
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to [[fasting|fast]] for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (''[[Harun]]'') was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]] raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"&gt;{{cite book|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|author=M. Th Houtsma|page=136|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=sP_hVmik-QYC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u5j2T4DfD4S0-QaextDwBg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prophets, Their Lives and Their Stories|author=Abdul-Sahib Al-Hasani Al-'amili|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YyYS_hjKpEC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=the+prophets+their+lives+and+their+stories+punishment+of+the+golden+calf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4pf2T962PMbO-gaKgPHHBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness [http://al-quran.info/#7:150 (Qur'an 7:167-174]). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his [[soul]] had suggested it to him.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"/&gt; Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=113|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Islam: Inception to Conclusion|author=Iftikhar Ahmed Mehar|page=123|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=O0gypGNaj3kC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9p32T7_iF8j0-gb7wcTaBg&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and [[Resurrection|resurrected]] them and they continued on their journey.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] ({{lang-ar|شرك}}), the sin of [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]]. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than [[God in Islam|Allah]], or more literally the establishment of "partners" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.

==Criticism and interpretation==
{{One source|section|date=April 2015}}
Despite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to [[Michael Coogan]], it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a [[false god]].&lt;ref name=coogan115&gt;{{cite book |author=Coogan, M. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context |year=2009 |page=115 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites {{bibleverse||Exodus|32:4-5|HE}} as evidence:
{{quote|He [Aaron] took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the {{Lord}} ([[Yahweh]])."}} Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the "gods", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ({{hebrew|אֱלֹהֶיךָ}} ''elo'hecha'', from {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}), which is a name of God as well as general word for "gods". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh {{Hebrew|יהוה}} in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;  It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the narrative of the Ten Commandments" the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the [[ark of the covenant]] or the [[cherubim]] upon which Yahweh was enthroned.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The reason for this complication may be understood as
:(1) a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
:(2) as "an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;
The second explanation relies on the "sin of [[Jeroboam]]," who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Jeroboam’s "sin" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to [[Bethel]] as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the [[cherubim]] of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The [[documentary hypothesis]] can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by [[Elohist|E]] (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and [[Jahwist|J]] (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, "the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light," and the worship of the calf was depicted as "polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy" (see Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:6). When compiling the narratives, [[Priestly source|P]] (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the [[Ten Commandments]] by [[Moses]] when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. "The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard Elliott |title=Who Wrote the Bible? |year=1987 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus&amp;nbsp;20) and J (Exodus&amp;nbsp;34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus&amp;nbsp;20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: "The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Finkelstein, Israel |author2=Silberman, Neil Asher |year=2001 |title=The Bible Unearthed |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the "gold" part of "golden calf" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?LEMA=becerro&amp;SUPIND=0&amp;CAREXT=10000&amp;NEDIC=No#becerro_de_oro. |title=becerro de oro |website=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Mammon]], the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

'''Harriet Shaw Weaver''' (1 September 1876 – 14 October 1961) was a [[Activism|political activist]] and a [[magazine]] [[Editing|editor]]. She was a [[patronage|patron]] of Irish writer [[James Joyce]].

Harriet Shaw Weaver was born in [[Frodsham]], [[Cheshire]], the sixth of eight children of Frederic Poynton Weaver, a [[Physician|doctor]], and Mary (née Wright) Weaver, a wealthy heiress. She was educated privately by a governess, Miss Marion Spooner, until 1894, initially in Cheshire and later in [[Hampstead]]. Her parents denied her wish to go to university. She decided to become a social worker. After attending a course on the [[Economics|economic]] basis of social relations at the [[London School of Economics]] she became involved in [[women's suffrage]] and joined the [[Women's Social and Political Union]].&lt;ref name="spartacus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/WweaverH.htm |title=Harriet Shaw Weaver |publisher=[[Spartacus Educational]] |first=John |last=Simkin |date=August 2014 |access-date=30 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
 
In 1911 she began subscribing to ''[[Freewoman|The Freewoman]]: A Weekly Feminist Review'', a radical periodical edited by [[Dora Marsden]] and [[Mary Gawthorpe]]. The following year its proprietors withdrew their support from it and Weaver stepped in to save it from financial ruin. In 1913 it was renamed ''[[The New Freewoman]]''. Later that year at the suggestion of the magazine's literary editor, [[Ezra Pound]], the name was changed again to ''[[The Egoist (periodical)|The Egoist]]''. During the following years Weaver made more financial donations to the periodical, becoming more involved with its organisation and also becoming its editor.&lt;ref name="spartacus"/&gt;

Ezra Pound was involved with finding new contributors and one of these was James Joyce. Weaver was convinced of his genius and started to support him, first by serialising ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' in ''The Egoist'' in 1914. When Joyce could not find anyone to publish it as a book, Weaver set up the Egoist Press for this purpose at her own expense. Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' was then serialised in The Egoist but because of its controversial content it was rejected by all the printers approached by Weaver and she arranged for it to be printed abroad. Weaver continued to give considerable support to Joyce and his family but following her reservations about his work that was to become ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', their relationship became strained and then virtually broken. However, on Joyce's death, Weaver paid for his funeral and acted as his executor.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|last=Cottam|first=Rachel|title=Weaver, Harriet Shaw (1876–1961)|id=57346|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Weaver joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] but then, having been influenced by reading [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] ''[[Das Kapital]]'' she joined the [[Communist Party]] in 1938. She was active in this organisation, taking part in demonstrations and selling copies of the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]''. She also continued her allegiance to the memory of Joyce, acting as his literary executor and helping to compile ''The Letters of James Joyce''. She died at her home near [[Saffron Walden]] in 1961, aged 85, leaving her collection of literary material to the [[British Library]] and to the National Book League.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

The '''International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers''' was a union of professional artists that existed from 1898 to 1925, "To promote the study, practice, and knowledge of sculpture, painting, etching, lithographing, engraving, and kindered arts in England or elsewhere...".&lt;ref name="Gla"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1203018932|title=The International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers|work=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|publisher=[[Glasgow University]]|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came to be known simply as '''The International'''.&lt;ref name=athill&gt;Philip Athill (January 1985).

==Formation==
The society was initially incorporated as The Exhibition of International Art Ltd., but soon changed its name to the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers.

'''Lauren Branning''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. The role was originated by [[Madeline Duggan]], who first appeared on 3 July 2006.

==Storylines==
The eldest child and daughter of [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]), Lauren moves to [[Walford]] with her parents and younger sister, [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) in July 2006. In 2007, Lauren discovers that her father is having an affair with her half-brother [[Bradley Branning]]'s ([[Charlie Clements]]) fiancée, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), after accidentally filming them kissing on her video camera. Lauren burns the footage onto a DVD and it is played on Christmas Day, exposing Max and Stacey's affair and resulting in the breakdown of Max and Tanya's marriage. Romantically involved with [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]), Max disapproves of their relationship and demands Peter end the romance but ends up throttling him when they meet secretly in the cafe. Shortly after, Max is left comatose, following a hit-and-run. It is revealed that Lauren is responsible but Tanya confesses to the crime and is imprisoned, pleading guilty to attempted murder. This distresses Lauren who confesses to the police and is found guilty of [[grievous bodily harm|GBH with intent]], and is sentenced to two years under supervision.

In 2008, paedophile [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]), stepfather to her best friend, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), starts grooming her to replace Whitney. When Tony's paedophilia is revealed, Lauren is shocked to learn about his intentions. Unnerved, Lauren dumps Peter, who tells his friends that he and Lauren had a sexual experience in the allotments. However, the couple plan a reunion and Lauren tells him she is ready to have sex, but Max bans them from seeing each other. Lauren leaves Walford when the extent of Max's debt is revealed by bailiffs who remove the family's possessions. She returns briefly at Christmas, and dumps Peter again before seeing him kiss [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]), causing a catfight between her, Zsa Zsa and Whitney. She attends Bradley's funeral after he falls from the roof of [[The Queen Victoria]] pub (The Vic), while attempting to evade arrest by the police for the murder of [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She celebrates her sixteenth birthday at a party in [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)|R&amp;R]] [[nightclub]], where her uncle [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) is shot by [[List of EastEnders characters (2010)#Kylie|Kylie]] ([[Elarica Gallacher]]). After attending Abi's birthday dinner, Lauren informs her father that she is going  to spend the summer at a summer camp in the United States.

Lauren (now played by [[Jacqueline Jossa]]) returns from America earlier than expected, after being expelled from school for smoking cannabis. She reveals that she has a new boyfriend, [[Edward Brooks (EastEnders)|Edward Brooks]] (Luke Striffler), but they split up because of the distance. Lauren attends her cousin [[Billie Jackson]]'s ([[Devon Anderson]]) birthday party and as a present, she gives him alcohol and he is found dead of alcohol poisoning the next morning. Billie's mother, [[Carol Jackson|Carol]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) attacks Lauren, blaming her for encouraging Billie to drink. Lauren suspects that Max killed Archie after he tells her that Bradley was not the culprit and she notes his violent tendencies when he confronts [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) for making crude sexual remarks after she rejects his attempt to proposition her. Lauren confronts Max and he tells her that he is not the killer but knows who is; after seeing Max and Stacey together, Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tricks a confession out of her, which she records on her mobile phone. Lauren threatens to go the police, but agrees to keep quiet after discovering that Archie raped Stacey. However, on Christmas Day, Lauren hands [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) the recording and Stacey flees after Janine exposes her. Lauren develops a crush on Whitney's half-brother, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]), and they begin an affair. However, the relationship is threatened when Tanya finds out and the relationship ends when he flees after killing [[Rob Grayson]] ([[Jody Latham]]), who had been sexually exploiting Whitney for financial gain. 

Lauren discovers that Max and Tanya are having an affair, despite Tanya now being married to [[Greg Jessop]] ([[Stefan Booth]]), Lauren threatens to kill Max unless the affair ends, but it secretly continues. The affair is soon exposed, causing Max to leave Walford. Lauren is angered by Tanya's actions, but is devastated to learn that Tanya has been diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]]. Lauren promises to support her but struggles to cope with her mother's illness. She starts drinking excessively and almost ends [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) and [[Jodie Gold]]'s ([[Kylie Babbington]]) relationship by having sex with Darren in the car lot - hours before the wedding. She also casually dates [[Tyler Moon]] (Tony Discipline) until realising Whitney is still in love with him. Max returns to Walford, and when Lauren learns that Tanya has stopped her treatment, begs him to stay and reveals her illness so he stays. Lauren's rebellion continues and after she gets drunk at [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]]' ([[Pam St. Clement]]) funeral, she is berated by her parents and given a private consultation with a GP. Lauren withdraws from school, and is employed at the car lot. She resumes drinking and tries to conceal this from her parents. Her drinking is so heavy that Lucy tells her to go home but Lauren ignores her, insisting that she is fine. Lucy loses her and she is found passed out in the street. Lauren tells her parents her drink was spiked before stating she is mature enough to make decisions. She then decides to move out. On her 18th birthday, a drunken Lauren belatedly arrives at a family party, organised by Tanya. After being sick, Lauren admits to her parents that she is uncontrollable and promises not to drink any more. She moves back home after not being able to cope with the laziness of her housemates. Lauren and Lucy (now played by [[Hetti Bywater]]) go on a night out where a drunken Lauren shares a kiss with a stranger, Dan, who drags her into his car. After Lucy manages to drag her out, they argue and Lauren storms off. Lucy finds her unconscious and takes her to hospital but Lauren discharges herself. Lauren returns home to find Lucy has already told Max, Tanya and Ian everything. Angry, Lauren argues with her family and leaves, meeting Dan. After she rejects his advances, Lauren goes to Lucy's house and Lucy tells her that she does not want anything more to do with her.

Lauren meets her cousin, [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]), and is attracted to him. Her friendship with Lucy begins to improve after Ian disappears and Lauren helps find him. Joey and Lucy start dating but Lauren learns  that Joey had cheated with Whitney, and urges her to tell Lucy. Lucy ends the relationship and the girls take revenge by handcuffing him to playground equipment. Lauren decides to free him so he does not lose his job, and he tells her she is jealous that she did not get a kiss, so she slaps him. Joey is working at R&amp;R when he sees Lauren flirting with a group of men so he throws them out and takes Lauren home. Lauren drunkenly kisses Joey but he rejects her. The following day, Joey explains that he rejected her because she was drunk and they kiss again. Lauren realises she cannot be with her cousin, so resists. Eventually, sexual tension mounts between them and they start a secret relationship. Joey's father [[Derek Branning]] ([[Jamie Foreman]]) finds out when he sees Joey and Lauren passionately kissing in the car lot office. Derek threatens Lauren so she and Joey plan to leave Walford. As they drive away in Derek's car, a drunk Lauren loses control of the car and crashes into a shop. Derek helps rescue them from the burning building and makes Joey take the blame for the crash. At the hospital, Lauren tells Tanya about her relationship with Joey and Derek blackmails Joey to end it. Heartbroken and distraught, Lauren continues to drink and Tanya realises that Joey is still in love with Lauren. Lauren later drunkenly reveals her relationship with Joey to the rest of her family. Joey leaves Walford after Derek dies but returns and reunites with Lauren, where Lucy witnesses them kissing. When trying to justify her relationship, Lauren is shocked when Lucy calls her selfish and undeserving of Joey's love, so Lauren considers telling the police the truth about the car crash, but Joey convinces her not to. Lauren and Joey's relationship is publicly revealed, though people start to accept it. Lauren discovers that Tanya has lied about missing a hospital appointment, and as Tanya refuses to talk, Lauren starts drinking again. Lauren destroys her mother's wedding gown and cake before Tanya and Max remarry. She later bonds with Max's secret wife, [[Kirsty Branning]] ([[Kierston Wareing]]), upsetting Tanya.

Lauren finds out that Kirsty is pregnant, unaware that Kirsty is lying. At a party, Lucy spikes Lauren's drink so she drunkenly reveals that Kirsty is pregnant. Lauren falls out with Joey, who breaks up with her over her behaviour. She applies for a job as a waitress with Whitney at [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) new restaurant but Lucy gets Joey to be Lauren's test customer so Lauren will fail. Whitney gets the job but purposely withdraws so that Lauren gets the job instead. She tries to make Joey jealous by kissing Tyler, who is engaged to Whitney, but it fails and Whitney ends their friendship and Lucy offers the job to Whitney. Lauren's drinking gets worse, though she believes she is not alcohol and tricks her step-grandmother [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) to give her money, which she uses to buy alcohol. Tanya is angry when she discovers this. Lauren then steals £20 from her grandmother's purse and when Tanya discovers this, she compares her to her aunt, [[Rainie Cross]] ([[Tanya Franks]]). Disgusted, Lauren attempts to buy more alcohol but Kirsty refuses to serve her, following Tanya's wishes. Lauren walks outside and confides in Joey but Lucy sees this and starts intimidating Lauren so she punches Lucy and smashes the café window. Lauren is arrested but Lucy decides not to press charges. Ian gives Lauren her waitress job back, but is sacked on the opening night for getting drunk and spills drink on a guest. Tanya and Max find bottles in Lauren's bedroom and decide to keep her locked in the house. She believes Lauren is showing no signs of withdrawal but Lauren reveals she has been drinking vodka from a water bottle, so Tanya realises she is addicted. Tanya keeps Lauren locked in her room but her withdrawal leads her to climb out of the window and Lauren says that nobody can stop her from drinking if she wants to. The next day, Tanya tells Lauren to leave after she destroys Abi's revision notes, and she stays with Max and Kirsty. Tanya asks Peter (now played by [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) to spend time with Lauren, but their date is sabotaged by Lucy, so Lauren gets drunk again and leaves with a group of strangers. When she returns, her skin and eyes are yellow and she collapses in pain, so she is taken to hospital and diagnosed with [[alcoholic hepatitis]]. She is warned that she could die if she doesn't stop drinking. Lauren returns and sees Joey so tries to find him. She confronts Lucy over her relationship with Joey, but Lucy refuses to answer, so Lauren concludes that they are together and tries to get a drink but is refused service. Tanya takes her home, where she admits that she cannot cope with her parents'  onxtant arguing. Ultimately, Tanya blames herself and takes Lauren to a clinic in Exeter, believing a change of scene could help.

Lauren, now a [[recovering alcoholic]], returns to Walford and dislikes how people treat her, until Abi reminds her of the hurt she caused. Lauren reconciles and is heartbroken to discover that Joey slept with Whitney while she was away. Lauren leaves, taking a drink with her but chooses not to drink it. She attends counselling and meets [[Jake Stone (EastEnders)|Jake Stone]] ([[Jamie Lomas]]). She sees that he is married but learns that is separated. Lauren falls in love with him but finds out that he is still married to [[Sadie Young]] ([[Kate Magowan]]), they split up but resume their affair, Max catches them and orders Lauren to end the relationship. Later that day, Joey asks Lauren to leave Walford with him but she decides to stay and resumes her affair with Jake.  They are caught by [[Bella Young]] (Isobelle Molloy) when she walks in on Lauren getting dressed. Understanding how Bella feels, Lauren ends the affair. When Sadie learns of this, Lauren attempts to apologise to her but learns that Sadie and Bella have left. She tries to persuade Jake not to drink again but he angrily throws a bottle of wine at Lauren and injuring her face; however, she forgives him before he leaves Walford. Lauren is stunned to see Stacey in The Vic, Stacey tells Lauren she is not staying but they meet again at Dot's house. Cora decides to call the police, but Lauren stops her and makes amends with Stacey as they talk about Bradley. She overhears Max and Stacey talking about a recent kiss they had and is agitated, asking her to stay away from Max. She overlooks what she heard when Stacey reveals she is waiting for the police to arrest her for murdering Archie because she wants to clear Bradley's name. Lauren avoids Jake when he returns to Walford as he has fallen off the wagon and is staying on Ian Beale's sofa.

Lucy asks Lauren to go into business with her. Although initially reluctant, Lauren agrees and they set up "LB Lettings". Lauren becomes suspicious that Lucy is dating Jake when he sets up the website for their business and Lucy begins arranging secret meetings. Lucy soothes her anxieties but she is seeing Max. Soon after, Lucy is found dead and Lauren is devastated. She leans on Peter for support in her grief, and is tempted to drink again but Cora talks her out of it. Determined to overcome her grief, Lauren starts up the business again and finds an email from someone wanting to meet on the night Lucy died. Believing Lucy went instead of her, Lauren tells the police but is not taken seriously, so she arranges to meet them herself. She is shocked when the person is revealed to be Jake and he chases her through Walford to try and stop her from going to the police. However, she does and he is arrested, although Lauren clearly has doubts if he did kill Lucy.

When Peter falls out with his girlfriend, [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), Lauren comforts him and they kiss. However, Peter feels bad for cheating on Lola and leaves, but it is clear Lauren has feelings for him. Jake is released when evidence clears him of any involvement and makes peace with Lauren before leaving. Lauren starts dating [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) after they have a one night stand but is shocked when Peter breaks up with Lola and tells Lauren he loves her after kissing her again. Lauren tells him that she wants to be with Dean and Peter vows to wait for her. When Peter is about to visit New Zealand, Lauren ends her relationship with Dean and tells Peter she loves him. Lauren and Peter later begin to get paranoid when they are followed. When they get a car registration, DS Summerhayes finds that it is a police car signed out to [[List of EastEnders characters (2014)#DS Cameron Bryant|DS Cameron Bryant]] ([[Glen Wallace]]) but she tells everyone that the registration number belongs to a reporter. On Halloween night, she encounters a mysterious person in a Halloween mask who follows her throughout the evening. This is later revealed to be Abi.

Peter asks Lauren to [[Proposal (marriage)|marry]] him. Lauren accepts, but after finding out that Peter was [[drug dealing|selling drugs]] to Lucy, she tells him that she cannot marry him.&lt;ref name="EastEnders episode"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04tlnnt | title=BBC One EastEnders | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On New Year's Day 2015, Max's girlfriend [[Emma Summerhayes]] ([[Anna Acton]]) is killed in a car accident after meeting someone who she thinks killed Lucy. Although Max tears up Emma's case notes, Lauren finds most of the pages and puts them together, suspicious about who killed Lucy. Lauren asks Peter to marry her and he accepts.&lt;ref name="Marriage"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-01-27/eastenders-spoilers-lauren-asks-peter-to-marry-her---first-look-pictures | title=Lauren asks Peter to marry her | work=[[Radio Times]] | date=27 January 2015 | accessdate=7 February 2015 | author=Brown, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after finding a previously torn off piece of a page from Emma's case files and trying to use Emma's phone, Lauren starts to doubt if she should marry Peter and drinks most of a half-bottle of whisky in Max's office. When Lauren nearly faints, Stacey buys her a test and discovers that Lauren is pregnant. Stacey confronts her about it but Lauren reveals that she knows who killed Lucy, but refuses to divulge the identity to the police. When Stacey calls the police, she is upset at her inability to keep a secret but hands in most of Emma's case files, while keeping the torn-off piece. She writes a card addressed to Jane, saying that Lucy was killed at home, and abruptly leaves to book an abortion. However, during the consultation, Peter interrupts her and offers to support her through all her issues. Lauren says she is confused and that she knows what happened to Lucy, leading him to discover the truth about the murder at home. When Peter decides to emigrate to New Zealand, he asks Lauren to go with him. She initially refuses, planning to join Tanya in Devon but after he tells her that his brother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington) is Lucy's killer, she changes her mind and decides to go to New Zealand. They dispose of Emma's remaining evidence and SIM card, deciding not to tell the police about Bobby being Lucy's killer. She says goodbye to Max and Abi and leaves with Peter, taking an outfit for their unborn child with them.

A heavily pregnant Lauren returns for Max's murder trial, saying she knows who killed Lucy. As she threatens to tell everyone about Bobby, her waters break. She later gives birth to a baby boy who she names [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]], in honour of Peter's great-grandmother, [[Lou Beale]] ([[Anna Wing]]). Lauren convinces Abi to stop Max from going to prison and tells [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) that she is going to tell the truth but Max is found guilty, thanks to Phil bribing the jury foreman. Max is sentenced to 21 years imprisonment. Max discovers Lauren knew that he was innocent and disowns her. Lauren makes a statement to the Police claiming that Bobby killed Lucy but they do not believe her and she returns to New Zealand with Louie, vowing to come back and clear Max's name.

In May 2016, Bobby puts Jane in a coma and confesses to killing Lucy, so Ian's mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy Sullivan]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) telephones Lauren and tells Ian that she and Peter are returning. However, when Lauren arrives with Louie, Ian is surprised to see his stepson [[Steven Beale]] ([[Aaron Sidwell]]) instead of Peter. Lauren tries to reconcile with an angry Abi, who is furious that Lauren did not tell her that Bobby killed Lucy. Lauren and Steven try to make Ian understand their relationship and why Peter has not returned. When Max is due to have a court hearing following Bobby's confession, Lauren and Abi write a letter saying they will wait for him in the pub, asking Stacey to deliver it. Stacey returns, saying she missed the hearing but passed the letter to his solicitor. Max is released but does not meet Lauren, so she goes home. The letter is returned and she runs outside to see Max leaving in a taxi. Lauren helps Abi get her job back in The Vic and decides to party with her friends. Lauren catches Abi and Lee and assumes that Abi is making a move on him, however Abi drunkenly reveals that she and Lee previously had sex. Lauren promises not to tell Whitney even though Steven tells her to. That same day, Lauren helps Whitney do a pregnancy test, which is positive. Lauren later warns Lee that she knows about his sex with Abi but says she will not say anything because it would mean ruining Whitney's happiness. When Whitney does eventually find out about Lee's unfaithfulness, Lauren supports her. She later starts a business as a web designer, with her first client being [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]). Steven is annoyed when Lauren buys a new laptop following a burglary at the Beales' restaurant. Steven tells Lauren he needed a way to pay debts and she promises not to tell Ian the truth about the burglary as long as they are honest with each other in future.

Lauren is excited when Louie says his first word: "mama". Steven gets him to say "dada" and records a video. Lauren sends it to Peter, which upsets Steven as he sees himself as Louie's father, but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. When Jane discovers Steven has been stealing money from the restaurant, he explains he borrowed it to pay Peter's debts as he is drinking heavily and getting into fights, and Lauren does not know the whole truth. When Lauren learns this, she is angry that he was not honest and considers visiting Peter. Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake, so she decides not to go. Lauren starts to worry that her relationship with Steven has become stale but she does manage to seduce him until they are interrupted. While visiting Max at work, Lauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]) and they share an attraction. Lauren insists on meeting up with him to see what happens. Josh suggests that Lauren apply for a job at the company he works for, Weyland &amp; Co, where Max also works. Lauren is shocked that Josh is one of the interviewers as she thought he worked on the photocopier, so she leaves but Josh follows; she slaps him for lying but they kiss. Meanwhile, Steven is eager for a baby with Lauren but she would rather concentrate on her career, so Steven starts piercing holes in his condoms. Lauren reaches the final two for the job and Max asks Josh not to employ Lauren, and he makes sure someone else gets the job, however, Josh visits Lauren at home and offers her a different job, and he meets Steven and realises Lauren is in a relationship and has a child. Thanks to Abi, Steven becomes paranoid about Lauren and Josh's relationship and starts tracking Lauren's whereabouts via a mobile app. Lauren finds out she is pregnant, and books an appointment to discuss an abortion, soon after revealing her intentions to Abi, as she is not ready to have a second child. Max tells a disbelieving Lauren that Josh is engaged, then Josh admits he is getting married in November. Lauren surprises and annoys Abi by arranging a secret Father's Day visit from Oscar for Max, neglecting to tell Abi about it. However, this drives Abi to reveal the abortion to Steven, though he decides not to confront Lauren. Lauren tells Josh that she loves Steven but admits that there are no "fireworks", and tells Josh that she will not cheat on him, unaware that Steven has been spying on her with a secret camera. Unaware that Abi and Steven have embarked on an affair, Lauren realises she does not love Steven and plans on returning to New Zealand to make amends with Peter. However, Steven learns about her plans and lies to her that he has an inoperable brain tumour. Lauren is wracked with guilt and decides to remain in Walford. In another desperate attempt to keep her, Steven spontaneously proposes to her in the Queen Vic, which she accepts. Lauren then resigns from Weyland &amp; Co and starts planning her and Steven's wedding, however, after a fire which he started at Ian's restaurant, he dies. Lauren is devastated. Abi tries to tell her that she is pregnant with Steven's baby but Lauren misinterprets it as gloating about her own abortion, so Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven's love, causing Lauren to start drinking again. On the day of Steven's funeral, Lauren finds out he lied about having a brain tumour and destroys his wreaths. When she finds out that Steven has been cremated, she refuses to scatter his ashes. Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya and when Lauren learns of this, she asks if she and Louie can join her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together; unbeknownst to Lauren, Abi is secretly taking Steven's ashes with her.

Lauren returns and moves back in with Ian and asks Josh for her job back. Josh accepts and flirts with Lauren but she rejects him again, but after numerous attempts, Lauren eventually gives into temptation and kisses Josh. When Josh's former fiancee, [[List of EastEnders characters (2017)#Imogen|Imogen]] (Alexandra Sinclair) arrives unexpectedly at the office, she belittles Lauren and tells her that Josh dislikes children. To confirm this, Lauren asks Josh if he would like to spend time with her and Louie; he reluctantly accepts, but implies that they should go as a couple instead which displeases Lauren. Josh later tries to declare his love for he and asks why they cannot be together; she explains that they are different people and that she is a recovering alcoholic. Ian's mother [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]) advises Lauren to move on from Steven and pursue Josh, which she does and they start a relationship. Lauren discovers Weyland &amp; Co's Project Dagmar, a plan to develop Albert Square into luxury apartments, and photographs a scale model. She threatens to publicise the project but her boss [[James Willmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]), who is also Josh's father, convinces Lauren that the project has fallen through due to investors dropping out at the last minute and she deletes the photo. Josh confirms this, having only just heard about the project. However, it emerges that this was a lie and that Weyland &amp; Co have bought several properties in Albert Square and are evicting business owners. Lauren refuses to give an eviction notice to Ian, so is fired. She discovers that Max is involved in the plan to con the residents. James destroys Max's contract, revealing that he has also been manipulated, but Josh gives Lauren a copy as he is entitled to his share. Lauren asks Max for the truth or she will destroy the copy, but he destroys it himself, saying that he knew about Abi's affair with Steven and her pregnancy and that his plan was to exact revenge on those who abandoned him. Later, Josh tells Lauren that he can stop the development by revealing that James bribes members of Walford Council. Josh asks Lauren to stall James and Fi at a press launch so he can get evidence of the bribes, so she chains herself to their property, but is arrested for breach of the peace. Lauren is cautioned and released, and then kisses Josh when he says he has left Weyland, though his plan has failed. Josh is offered a new job in Glasgow and Lauren agrees to move there with him. Ian disapproves of her relationship with Josh when he catches them kissing which causes Lauren to slap Ian, but Kathy convinces him that Josh is not like his father. On Christmas Day, Max gives Lauren a thoughtful Christmas present and she tells him that he needs medical help. Tanya returns to take Lauren and Abi away from Walford, revealing that Max killed Steven and tried to kill Jane. Lauren and Abi reject Max. Max goes to the roof of the Vic where he plans to kill himself by jumping off, but Lauren and Abi climb on to the ledge to try and stop him. As Max agrees to come down, Lauren slips and she and Abi both fall off. They are taken to hospital, where Lauren has surgery on her pelvis, which is fractured, and Abi has a CT scan and is declared brain-stem dead. When Lauren starts physiotherapy, she becomes frustrated with not being told the truth about Abi and breaks down when she sees her. Lauren slaps Max for lying to her about Abi's condition and is devastated by Abi's death. Lauren is distraught when Abi's life support is withdrawn.

Before Abi's funeral, Lauren lies to Max that it has already taken place because Tanya does not want him there, however, he realises it is a lie. On the day of the funeral, Lauren tells Whitney about her planned move to Scotland with Josh and Whitney asks her to be sure that she actually loves him or if she is only with him because he is good with Louie. After the service, she sees Max going into the chapel and tells him that she needs to leave, before hugging him and crying. Lauren then takes Louie from Josh and walks away without him. Cora later reveals that Lauren has moved to New Zealand, possibly reuniting with Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a861337/eastenders-lauren-branning-peter-beale-back-together|title=Has EastEnders just revealed that Lauren Branning and Peter Beale reconciled off-screen?|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|first=Justin|last=Harp|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jossa's first appearance was on 27 September 2010.&lt;ref name="First Jossa Episode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a275192/ryan-and-janine-face-a-big-crisis.html |title=Ryan and Janine face a big crisis |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=September 2010 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |accessdate=9 September 2010 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sccQNOO8?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a275192/ryan-and-janine-face-a-big-crisis.html |archivedate= 9 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jossa said that when she first got the part of Lauren, she "worried unnecessarily".&lt;ref name="Worried Role"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=26 January 2012|title='EastEnders' Jacqueline Jossa: 'I worried over soap role'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a362315/eastenders-jacqueline-jossa-i-worried-over-soap-role.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talking to ''PA'', Jossa said that working with Joyner and Wood was not as scary as she thought.&lt;ref name="Worried Role" /&gt; She commented: "There was less pressure than I thought there was going to be. When I first started I got really scared and worked up, thinking everyone's going to hate me. They've been there four years and then I'm coming in to be their daughter - it was a bit surreal. And then two weeks later I felt completely comfortable, everyone was cracking jokes and I thought, 'Oh... I built it up a bit!'"&lt;ref name="Worried Role" /&gt;

===Storyline development===
Lauren's primary storylines concerned a school girl romance with [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]), a friendship with the delinquent [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]), and being caught in the middle of her warring parents, who separated in the serial in 2007 when Tanya discovered Max was cheating on her with [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), Lauren's half brother [[Bradley Branning|Bradley]]'s wife. In the storyline, Lauren played an integral part in the discovery of the affair; as a result of a practical joke, Lauren unwittingly recorded Max and Stacey kissing on video camera, and sent the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present in December 2007 as means of revenge on her father.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a82113/in-pictures-tanya-slaps-stacey-in-fit-of-rage.html|title=In Pictures: Tanya Slaps Stacey In A Fit Of Rage|last=Green|first=Kris|date=21 December 2007|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a change of heart, the recording was seen by the entire Branning family on Christmas Day, an episode that drew 13.9 million viewers, 55.3% of the total audience share.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1573673/BBC-wins-Christmas-Day-ratings-battle.html|title=BBC Wins Christmas Day Ratings Battle|last=Martin|first=Nicole|date=26 December 2007|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character became involved in one of ''EastEnders''' most controversial storylines in 2008, when she was [[child grooming|groomed]] by a [[paedophile]], [[Tony King (EastEnders)|Tony King]] ([[Chris Coghill]]).&lt;ref name="Revoir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056737/Scores-complaints-EastEnders-shows-scenes-paedophile-grooming-teenager.html|title=Scores of Complaints as EastEnders Shows Scenes Of A Paedophile Grooming A Teenager|last=Revoir|first=Paul|date=17 September 2008|publisher=Mail Online|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tony King had been introduced in September 2008 as the fiancé of Lauren's cousin [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). However, in a plot twist, it was revealed that Tony was already in a sexual relationship with Bianca's 15-year-old stepdaughter [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]). After losing interest in Whitney, Tony turns his attentions to 14-year-old Lauren. An insider said: "He has got away with abusing Whitney for years but it seems one young girl isn't enough."&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/09/28/eastenders-paedophile-tony-king-is-set-to-strike-again-115875-20758414/|title=EastEnders Paedophile Tony King Is Set To Strike Again|last=Gould|first=Lara|date=28 September 2008|publisher=Sunday Mirror|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/317408-enders-tony-sets-sights-on-new-victim|title=Enders' Tony Sets Sights On New Victim?|date=19 September 2008|website=Metro|accessdate=12 December 2009|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, it was announced that Lauren is to have a relationship with already established character, [[Ryan Malloy]].&lt;ref name="Ryan Relationship"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Rebecca|title='EastEnders' Ryan to have teen affair?|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a317032/eastenders-ryan-to-have-teen-affair.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=27 January 2012|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ''EastEnders'' insider commented: "Sparks will fly when Ryan and Lauren begin their relationship. Max is certainly someone not to mess with. He's already very protective of his daughters and Ryan isn't exactly his favourite person after his relationship with Stacey, who Max will always hold a torch for."&lt;ref name="Ryan Relationship" /&gt;

Jossa explained that upon Lauren finding out about Tanya's cancer, viewers see a different side to Lauren.&lt;ref name="New Side"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Lauren will change, says Jacqueline Jossa|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a340361/eastenders-lauren-will-change-says-jacqueline-jossa.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told ''[[Inside Soap]]'': "Immediately, there's a change in her - with Tanya so sick, Lauren has to grow up. You'd expect her to dive into the drink again or something like that, but she's right there for Tanya from the minute she finds out what's going on."&lt;ref name="New Side" /&gt; She continues: "Tanya is still convinced she'll be fine, but then she finds out that the cancer has begun to spread. Tanya's really vulnerable at that point and it's Lauren who's saying, 'We're going to fix this and everything will be fine'. She's there for her mum the whole time - shopping, cooking, cleaning, looking after Abi and Oscar. She really wants to help Tanya and actually enjoys the responsibility."&lt;ref name="New Side" /&gt;

===Alcoholism===
In January 2012, Jossa praised her storyline in which Lauren starts [[binge drinking]] due to the stress of her mother suffering from cancer. Jossa commented on the storyline saying that teenagers should take binge drinking more seriously.&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jossa: Take teen drinking seriously |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jVwwQ2HNCRn7HrBOSqEczbIpwNXg?docId=N0099971327406389394A |work=[[Google News]] |publisher=[[The Press Association]] |accessdate=12 February 2012 |date=24 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65OkAg9iK?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jVwwQ2HNCRn7HrBOSqEczbIpwNXg?docId=N0099971327406389394A |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said: "It's good ''EastEnders'' have done the storyline. It highlights that teenagers who people label irresponsible could be doing it to deal with worries they are keeping to themselves. What they actually need is help or someone to talk to. At first to Lauren drinking was a laugh. Then it became a way of forgetting - she has carried the burden of keeping her mum's illness secret."&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking" /&gt; Speaking about Lauren's love life, Jossa added: "I always want Lauren and Fatboy to get together. They would make such a cute couple."&lt;ref name="Binge Drinking" /&gt;

Jossa predicted in November 2012 that Lauren will revert to her old ways after her latest relationship break-up.&lt;ref name=Setback&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Jacqueline Jossa expects Lauren alcohol setback|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a439946/eastenders-jacqueline-jossa-expects-lauren-alcohol-setback.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 December 2012|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if Lauren would start drinking again, Jossa said that Lauren did not really stop and that alcohol is her "comfort blanket".&lt;ref name=Setback /&gt; Executive Producer [[Lorraine Newman]] said that Lauren's binge drinking will "come to a head" in Spring 2013.&lt;ref name="Newman Troubled"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|title='EastEnders' Lauren Branning is very troubled, says executive producer|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a447872/eastenders-lauren-branning-is-very-troubled-says-executive-producer.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman commented "Lauren's obviously very troubled. A huge amount of what we're seeing now is to do with what's been going on with her parents for such a long time. It's a tough one covering the issue of binge drinking because inevitably, in order for it to have sufficient impact, it has to go on for a considerable amount of time. There's a real danger that it will become unpalatable and that you won't have too much empathy for the character."&lt;ref name="Newman Troubled" /&gt; Newman also added that the binge drinking storyline will come to a conclusion in 2013.&lt;ref name="Newman Troubled" /&gt;

In March 2013, it was revealed that Lauren is to have her drink spiked by her friend Lucy Beale.&lt;ref name="Spiked"&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title='EastEnders' Lauren Branning 'has drink spiked'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a469580/eastenders-lauren-branning-has-drink-spiked.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren gave up her binge drinking to save her relationship with Joey but Lucy cannot stand seeing them happy together and decides she wants Joey back after a brief fling.&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Lauren becomes extremely drunk and makes a fool of herself.&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; Joey dumps Lauren as he thinks she has drinking behind her back and Lauren's life spirals out of control.&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; An insider told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' "It's going to be emotional to watch Lauren go through it all again as she's already been through so many battles with the bottle."&lt;ref name=Spiked /&gt; Hetti Bywater said that she will continue her scheming until she gets Joey back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dainty|first=Sophie|title='EastEnders' Hetti Bywater: 'Lucy will keep scheming until she gets Joey'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a473840/eastenders-hetti-bywater-lucy-will-keep-scheming-until-she-gets-joey.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Joey Branning===
In September 2012, Alison Rowley of ''Digital Spy'' said that Lauren will fall in love with her cousin [[Joey Branning]] ([[David Witts]]).&lt;ref name="Joey Love"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowley|first=Alison|title='EastEnders': Lauren Branning falls for cousin Joey|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a404754/eastenders-lauren-branning-falls-for-cousin-joey.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=9 September 2012|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''EastEnders'' insider told the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' that it will be a huge storyline across the autumn.&lt;ref name="Joey Love" /&gt; The insider said "Lauren hits the booze and shows her vulnerable side to Joey. He's there for her and feels very protective. The more time they spend together the more they start to realise their feelings for each other are not just that of cousins."&lt;ref name="Joey Love" /&gt; As the chemistry between the pair intensifies, they try to hide the relationship from their parents. The insider said that it is a powerful force and that the attraction between them is so strong that it will take something huge to "stop them jumping into bed".&lt;ref name="Joey Love" /&gt; Daniel Kilkelly later revealed that Lauren and Joey will be in a "horrifying" car crash.&lt;ref name="Car Crash"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' car crash details revealed|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a405239/eastenders-car-crash-details-revealed.html#article_continue|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=11 September 2012|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for scenes begun on 10 September and is thought that the on-location filming will continue through the week.&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt; The details of the storyline are being kept under wraps but the ''Daily Mail'' reports that Lauren will joyride her uncle [[Derek Branning]]'s ([[Jamie Foreman]]) car but it goes horribly wrong and their lives are left hanging in the balance when Lauren loses control of the car and goes through a shop window.&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt; An insider commented "Everyone is really excited about these scenes. It's going to be a huge storyline for us in a few weeks' time, so it's definitely one for the fans to watch out for."&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt; The storyline will reportedly air in November 2012 and is said to be one of the show's biggest moments of the year.&lt;ref name="Car Crash" /&gt;

Lauren is later dumped by Joey after Derek blackmails him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Lauren and Joey face terrible danger|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a438899/lauren-and-joey-face-terrible-danger.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witts said that Joey will find life "really hard" after dumping Lauren.&lt;ref name="Joey dump"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' David Witts: 'It's hard for Joey to dump Lauren'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a439869/eastenders-david-witts-its-hard-for-joey-to-dump-lauren.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=21 November 2012|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek suggests to Joey that if he tells the police that he was driving the car that drunken Lauren crashed, she can avoid a prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Joey agrees to the deception to help Lauren but is later horrified when Derek threatens to tell the police the truth unless he gets his own way.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Speaking to ''[[Soaplife]]'', Witts said "Joey must either move in with Derek and be a respectful and loving son, or dump Lauren. If Joey takes either of those options, Derek won't tell the police that Lauren was driving the car. Joey's love for Lauren is massive, but not quite as massive as his hatred for Derek. He decides to become the villain and lie that he never loved her. He'll take the flack because that will make it easier for her to move on without him."&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Witts also added that it will be "really hard" as he keeps making out to Lauren that he is not interested.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Witts also said that Joey would be making a mistake if he told Lauren about Derek's blackmail.&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; He commented "She's very headstrong and she'd say that she doesn't care about getting into trouble with the law. It would all end in tears. Everyone would find out as Lauren's the sort of person who'd blurt everything out, and it would cause even more of a mess. Joey very much thinks he's doing the right thing."&lt;ref name="Joey dump" /&gt; Tony Discipline said that he does not mind watching Jossa's, his real-life girlfriend's scenes and that he supports the Joey and Lauren plot commenting "I don't find it strange to watch - it is part of the job. We always support each other and Jacqueline always asks me how it looks. But it is part of our job."&lt;ref name="Discipline Support"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Tony Discipline: 'I support Lauren, Joey plot'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a444856/eastenders-tony-discipline-i-support-lauren-joey-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departure ===
On 10 September 2017, it was announced that Jossa had been axed from the show by executive consultant [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]], along with [[Lorna Fitzgerald]]. An official spokesperson said: "We can confirm Jacqueline and Lorna will be leaving. They have been wonderful to work with and we wish them all the best for the future."

[[File:Frozen2009 crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at a 2009 show]]
The '''lead vocalist''' (or '''main vocalist''', '''lead vocals''', or '''lead singer''') in [[popular music]] is typically the member of a group or [[Band (music)|band]] whose voice is the most prominent in a performance where multiple voices may be heard.&lt;ref name="conitnuum"/&gt; The lead singer either leads the vocal ensemble, or sets against the ensemble as the dominant sound.&lt;ref name="conitnuum"/&gt; In [[vocal group]] performances, notably in [[soul music|soul]] and [[gospel music]], and early [[rock and roll]], the lead singer takes the main vocal part, with a chorus provided by other band members as [[backing vocalist]]s.

Especially in [[rock music]], the lead singer or solo singer is often the '''front man'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/front%20man|title=Definition of FRONT MAN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''front woman''', who may also play one or more instruments and is often seen as the leader or spokesman of the band by the public.  As an example in rock music, [[Liam Gallagher]] was the lead singer of [[Oasis]].  Similarly in soul music, [[Smokey Robinson]] was the lead singer of [[The Miracles]].

==History==

[[File:Queen 1984 011.jpg|thumb|[[Queen (band)|Queen]] performs in a typical rock band layout during a 1984 concert. Lead singer (front man) [[Freddie Mercury]] stands centre-stage in front of drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] and positioned between bass guitarist [[John Deacon]] and lead guitarist [[Brian May]].]] 
It is uncertain when the term "lead vocals" was first used, but it may have emerged in the late 1930s, when rich vocal interplay with multiple voices where one or more voices may dominate began to impact on North American popular music, which was previously dominated by solo vocals.&lt;ref name="conitnuum"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA634#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production |editor= John Shepherd |publisher=Continuum |pages=634–635|date=May 8, 2003|isbn=978-0826463227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of using a lead singer in vocal groups, however, has a longer history: an early form is the "[[call and response]]" found in [[work song]]s and [[spirituals]] sung by African-American slaves. Songs of the late nineteenth century frequently used a leading solo voice (or "call"), followed by a choral response by other singers.  As the style developed through early commercial recordings and performances in the early 20th century, the role of the lead vocalist became more established, although popular groups of the 1930s and 1940s such as [[the Ink Spots]] and [[the Mills Brothers]] generally used different lead singers on different songs rather than keeping the same lead singer throughout.  By the 1950s, singers such as [[Sam Cooke]] (with [[the Soul Stirrers]]) and [[Clyde McPhatter]] (with [[the Drifters]]) took on more clearly defined roles as lead singers, and by the end of the decade credited group names often changed to reflect the leading roles of the main vocalists, with examples such as [[Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers]] and [[Dion &amp; the Belmonts]].&lt;ref name=continuum&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22lead+singer%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Rp9EVf_GItbVasrhgYAC&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lead%20singer%22&amp;f=false David Horn, '"Lead Singer", in ''Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and Production'', A&amp;C Black, 2003, pp.103-104]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Academic David Horn has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The influence of US [[rhythm and blues]] recordings may well be a crucial one in the assimilation of the format of lead singer plus [[backing group]] into the guitar-based British '[[beat music|beat]]' groups of the 1960s, and in US groups such as [[The Beach Boys]]. From these various points - including [[Motown]] - it went on to become a standard device in much rock and pop music.  In some bands - most famously, [[The Beatles]] - the role of lead singer alternated (in this case, principally between two performers), while in others - for example, [[Herman's Hermits]] - one lead singer dominated.&lt;ref name=continuum/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Characteristics and exceptions in rock and pop music==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
There are as many types and styles of lead singer as there are styles and genres of music. However, the lead singer of a group or band is usually the main focus of audiences' attention.&lt;ref name=vocalist&gt;[http://www.vocalist.org.uk/lead_vocalist.html "Role of the Lead Vocalist", ''Vocalist.org.uk'']. Accessed 2 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  The lead vocalist of band is sometimes called the "front man" or "front woman," as the most visible performer in a group. While most bands have a singular lead singer, many others have dual lead singers, or other member of the band that occasionally sing lead on particular songs. While the lead singer often defines the group's image and personality to the general public, this is not always the case.

In modern rock music, the lead singer is often, but not always, also the band's leader and spokesperson. While lead singers or spokespersons for any musical ensembles can be called a front man, the term is used very widely in [[rock music]]. Since the position commonly has an expanded role from simple lead vocalists, there have been cases in which the front man for a band is someone other than the lead vocalist. For example, while the lead vocalist for the band [[Fall Out Boy]] is guitarist [[Patrick Stump]], the bassist and lyricist, [[Pete Wentz]], is generally called the front man, both in the media and by the band members themselves, since he represents the band in most interviews and contributes most to the band's image in the popular media.&lt;ref&gt;CARAMANICA, JON (December 12, 2008), [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/arts/music/14cara.html?_r=1 "The Frontman in the Background"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. (accessed 2009-01-19)&lt;/ref&gt;   Another example is [[Angus Young]] of [[AC/DC]], who is the band's lead guitarist, and co-leader with his brother [[Malcolm Young]] (until the latter's death in 2017); while lead singer [[Brian Johnson]] (and before him [[Bon Scott]]) is the band's front man, Angus Young can be thought to share the front man position with Johnson, due to his on-stage antics and his role as the band's [[mascot]], frequently featuring on album covers and promotional materials.

In many bands, such as [[The Who]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Living Colour]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Stone Roses]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], the [[lead guitarist]] may share spokesman responsibilities with the lead singer. Usually, this is derived from that guitarist's specific role as a co-songwriter, co-founder and/or co-vocalist. Also in some cases, there are two frontmen, such as [[Alice in Chains]], with singer [[Layne Staley]] (and later [[William DuVall]]) sharing vocal duties with guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/alice-in-chains-jerry-cantrell-vocals/|title=Jerry Cantrell Recalls How Alice in Chains Developed Their Twin-Vocal Sound|publisher=Diffuser.fm|date=April 25, 2017|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Underoath]], with singers [[Spencer Chamberlain]] and [[Aaron Gillespie]] ([[drummer]]) sharing vocal duties. Another example is [[Blink-182]], in which vocal duties are split between bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] and guitarist [[Tom DeLonge]]. Hoppus usually carries out most media either by himself or together with DeLonge, while the band's other member, drummer [[Travis Barker]], usually remains quiet. [[Linkin Park]] had two vocalists as well, [[Mike Shinoda]] and [[Chester Bennington]], both considered as frontmen. Another example is the [[thrash metal]] band [[Metallica]], in which [[James Hetfield]] (lead singer and rhythm guitarist) and [[Lars Ulrich]] (drummer) share the spokesperson duties for being both founders and the only members who have never left the band.

'''Leila Aboulela''' (born 1964), [[Arabic]] ''''ليلى ابوالعلا'''' is a [[List of Sudanese writers|Sudanese writer]] who writes in English. Her most recent books are the short-story collection ''[[Elsewhere, Home]]'' (2018) and the novel ''[[The Kindness of Enemies]]'' (2015), inspired by the life of [[Imam Shamil]], who united the tribes of the [[Caucasus]] to fight against [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] expansion. Aboulela's 2011 novel, ''[[Lyrics Alley]]'', was Fiction Winner of the Scottish Book Awards and short-listed for a Regional Commonwealth Writers Prize. She is also the author of the novels ''[[The Translator]]'' (a ''New York Times'' 100 Notable Book of the Year) and ''[[Minaret (novel)|Minaret]]''. All three novels were long-listed for the [[Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction|Orange Prize]] and the [[International Dublin Literary Award|IMPAC Dublin Award]]. Leila Aboulela won the [[Caine Prize]] for African Writing for her short story "The Museum", included in the collection ''[[Coloured Lights]]'', which went on to be short-listed for the [[List of PEN literary awards|Macmillan/Silver PEN award]]. Aboulela’s work has been translated into 14 languages and included in publications such as ''[[Granta]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''. [[BBC Radio]] has adapted her work extensively and broadcast a number of her plays, including ''The Mystic Life'' and the historical drama ''The Lion of Chechnya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/leila-aboulela|title=Leila Aboulela - Literature|website=literature.britishcouncil.org|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-part radio serialization of her 1999 novel ''The Translator'' was short-listed for the RIMA (Race In the Media Award). Aboulela grew up in Khartoum and now lives in Aberdeen.

== Personal life ==
Born in 1964 in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] to an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] mother and a [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudanese]] father, Aboulela moved at the age of six weeks to [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]], where she lived continuously until 1987.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leila-aboulela.com/about/biography/|title=Biography |publisher= Leila Aboulela|website=www.leila-aboulela.com|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child she attended the [[Khartoum American School]] and the Sisters' School, a private Catholic high school, where she learned English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Claire|date=1 June 2009|title=An Interview with Leila Aboulela|url=http://cww.oxfordjournals.org/content/3/1/86|journal=Contemporary Women's Writing|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=86–102|doi=10.1093/cww/vpp003|issn=1754-1484}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later attended the [[University of Khartoum]], graduating in 1985 with a degree in Economics. Aboulela was awarded an M.Sc. and an MPhil degree in [[Statistics]] from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of African Biography, Volume 2|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-19-538207-5|location=New York, NY|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 Aboulela moved to [[Aberdeen]] with her husband and children, a move she cites as the inspiration for her first novel, ''The Translator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leila-aboulela.com/books/the-translator/inspiration/|title= The Translator - Inspiration |publisher= Leila Aboulela|website=www.leila-aboulela.com|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboulela began writing in 1992 while working as a lecturer in [[Aberdeen College]] and later as a research assistant in [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Between 2000 and 2012, Aboulela lived in [[Jakarta]], [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Doha]]. In 2012, she returned to live in Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Sethi | first1 = Anita | title = Keep the faith | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/05/fiction.features2 | accessdate = 3 March 2015 | work = The Guardian | date = 4 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aboulela is a devout Muslim, and her faith informs much of her written work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Literary career ==

Her third novel, ''[[Lyrics Alley]]'', is set in the Sudan of the 1950s and was long-listed for the Orange Prize 2011. 
Lyrics Alley was the Fiction Winner of the Scottish Book Awards and was shortlisted for the Commonwealth Writers Prize -Europe and S.E Asia.

Aboulela cites Arab authors [[Tayeb Salih]] and [[Naguib Mahfouz]], as well as [[Ahdaf Soueif]], [[Jean Rhys]], [[Anita Desai]], and [[Doris Lessing]], as her literary influences. She also acknowledges the influence of Scottish writers such as [[Alan Spence]] and [[Robin Jenkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leila-aboulela.com/about/|title= About Leila |publisher=Leila Aboulela|website=www.leila-aboulela.com|access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among her works, her second novel ''[[Minaret (novel)|Minaret]]'' (2005) has drawn more readers' and critical attention compared to other works. Her novel ''[[Minaret (novel)|Minaret]]'' singles out her as one of the influential authors of the new wave of British Muslim writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/7582406/Aboulela_s_Minaret_A_New_Understanding_of_Diasporic_Muslim_Women_in_the_West|title=Aboulela’s Minaret : A New Understanding of Diasporic Muslim Women in the West|first=Abu |last=Sufian|publisher=|journal=[[The Criterion]]|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judy Garland]] has been the subject of many biographies. Since her death in 1969, she has been the subject of over two dozen books. The first of these was Brad Steiger's ''Judy Garland'', published shortly after her death, which includes information on Garland's [[Astrology|astrological]] chart, [[Graphology|analysis of her handwriting]], [[numerology]] and [[biorhythm]]s. Most of the books are entirely about Garland, but some, including Patricia Fox-Sheinwold's ''Too Young to Die'', ''Some Are Born Great'' by [[Adela Rogers St. Johns]] and Jane Ellen Wayne's ''The Golden Girls of MGM'', merely feature a chapter about her. Two volumes, ''Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show'' by Coyne Steven Sanders and [[Mel Tormé]]'s ''The Other Side of the Rainbow: On the Dawn Patrol With Judy Garland'', focus on Garland's television series, ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. Garland's last husband, [[Mickey Deans]], co-authored an early biography in 1972 and Garland's daughter [[Lorna Luft]] wrote a family memoir in 1988.

Garland has been profiled on-screen several times. The earliest known film biography was a 1961 installment of the syndicated television series ''[[Hollywood Hist-o-rama]]'', which covered her career through the filming of ''[[A Star is Born (1954 film)|A Star is Born]]''. Garland was the subject of episodes of the British series ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'', ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' and the ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]''. Her life story was fictionalized in ''Rainbow'' in 1978 and in 2001 in ''[[Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows]]'', based on daughter Luft's memoir. On stage, Garland is a character in ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'', a 1998 musical based on the life of former son-in-law [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], and the 2006 play ''The Property Known as Garland'', based on tape recordings made prior to her last ever concert appearance.

{{Literature}}
'''Literary adaptation''' is the [[adaptation (arts)|adapting]] of a literary source (e.g. a novel, short story, poem) to another genre or medium, such as a film, stage play, or video game.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It can also involve adapting the same literary work in the same genre or medium just for different purposes, e.g. to work with a smaller cast, in a smaller venue (or on the road), or for a different demographic group (such as adapting a story for children). Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case.

It also appeals because it obviously works as a story; it has interesting characters, who say and do interesting things. This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work, e.g. film, stage play, teleplay, as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult. To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensions—concept, character, story, dialogue, and action—is an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent.

Perhaps most importantly, especially for producers of the screen and stage, an adapted work is more bankable; it represents considerably less risk to investors, and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains. This is because:
* It has already attracted a following.
* It clearly works as a literary piece in appealing to a broad group of people who care.
* Its title, author, characters, etc. may be a franchise in and of themselves already.

==Film==
{{main|Film adaptation}}
Works of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry. Some of the earliest examples come from the work of [[Georges Méliès]], who pioneered many film techniques. In 1899, he released two adaptations — ''Cinderella'' based on the [[Brothers Grimm]] story of the same name and ''[[King John (1899 film)|King John]]'', the first known film to be based on the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The 1900 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes Baffled]]'', directed by [[Arthur Marvin]] featured [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s detective character [[Sherlock Holmes]] intruding upon a pseudo-supernatural burglary. The film, considered the first detective movie, ran for only 30 seconds and was originally intended to be shown in hand-cranked [[Mutoscope]] machines.

Méliès' 1902 original science-fiction feature ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' was based loosely on two popular novels of the time: [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=Greatest&gt;{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Dirks |title=A Trip to The Moon |work= FilmSite.org |url=http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html |accessdate=2007-01-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117090347/http://www.filmsite.org/voya.html| archivedate= 17 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of many adaptations of the [[Brothers Grimm]] tale ''[[Snow White]]'' was [[Snow White (1902 film)|released in 1902]] while the earliest surviving copy is [[Snow White (1916 film)|the 1916 version]]. 1903 saw the release of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1903 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' directed by [[Cecil Hepworth]] and [[Percy Stow]], the first movie adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s children's book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0000420|title=Alice in Wonderland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first feature-length film to be shot entirely in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] was [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s first assignment, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'', in 1914, which was the first of three movie versions (all directed by DeMille) based on [[Edwin Milton Royle]]'s [[play (theatre)|play]] [[The Squaw Man (play)|of the same name]]. Since the early days of the genre, major films have been largely adapted:
* Novels: [[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]] (1939), [[From Here to Eternity]] (1953), and [[The Godfather]] (1972) were all adapted from novels of the same name.
* Plays: [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]] (1942), [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|Streetcar Named Desire]] (1951), and [[Equus (film)|Equus]] (1977) were all adapted from stage plays.
* Short stories: [[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947 film)|The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]] (1947), [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]] (1961), [[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (film)|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]] (1968), [[The Shawshank Redemption|Shawshank Redemption]] (1994), and [[Brokeback Mountain]] (2005) were all made from short stories.
The most celebrated of the early adaptations is [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'', a 1924 adaptation of the 1899 novel ''[[McTeague]]'' by naturalist writer [[Frank Norris]]. The director intended to film every aspect of the novel in great detail, resulting in a 9½-hour epic feature. At studio insistence, the film was cut down to two hours and was considered a flop upon its theatrical release. It has since been restored to just over four hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/03/entertainment/ca-39909|title=A 'Greed' More as Stroheim Had Intended|last=THOMAS|first=KEVIN|date=1999-12-03|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. 

One book that has been adapted very frequently (in one form or another) is [[Charles Dickens]]' Christmas story ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', which has around 20 film adaptations to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collider.com/a-christmas-carol-adaptations-ranked/|title='A Christmas Carol' Adaptations Ranked from "Bah Humbug!" to "God Bless Us Everyone!"|date=2015-12-25|work=Collider|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
From a legal standpoint, when a literary source has not passed into the [[public domain]], rights must be arranged for the adaptation to be performed legally. Plagiarism occurs in every [[genre]], and throughout history, but such literary rights violations can be challenged in court. In the case of Hollywood films, judgments for the [[plaintiff]] can run into the millions of dollars, but these have typically been for outright theft of a screenplay idea rather than for fraudulent adaptations (see ''[[Buchwald v. Paramount]]'').

Because of the importance of telling a story with a limited number of [[Character (arts)|character]]s, short stories often make better sources for adaptable material than do novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://screencraft.org/2015/11/13/5-reasons-short-stories-are-easier-to-adapt-than-novels/|title=5 Reasons Short Stories Are Easier to Adapt Than Novels|date=2015-11-13|work=ScreenCraft|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the stage, in addition, theater audiences tend to accept and prefer works of a more conceptual, thought-based nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/what-fences-misses-about-adapting-plays-for-the-screen|title=What “Fences” Misses About Adapting Plays for the Screen|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning their preferences need to be considered when selecting a work for adaptation, but also when determining how best to adapt it. The stage imposes physical limits of size and technology. Not every [[illusion]] that can be made to appear real on the [[movie screen]] can be made to appear so on stage.

[[File:Civic Opera House 060528.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Civic Opera House]]
'''Lyric Opera of Chicago''' is one of the leading [[opera]] companies in the United States. It was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1954, under the name 'Lyric Theatre of Chicago' by [[Carol Fox (Chicago opera)|Carol Fox]], [[Nicolà Rescigno]] and Lawrence Kelly, with a season that included [[Maria Callas]]'s American debut in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. The company was re-organized by Fox in 1956 under its present name and, after her 1981 departure, it has continued to be of one of the major opera companies in the United States.  The Lyric is housed in the [[Civic Opera Building]], which the company now owns.

==Opera in Chicago 1850–1954==
The first opera to be performed in Chicago was Bellini's ''[[La sonnambula]]'', presented by a traveling opera company on 29 July 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Preston 1993, p. ??: "One measure of ''La sonnambula'' 's popularity is the fact that it was the first opera to be performed in Chicago."&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Chicago]] in 1871. The second opera house, the [[Chicago Auditorium]], opened in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Opera" in ''The Encyclopedia Americana'' (1973), Volume 1: "Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the Great Fire five years later. A new house, the Auditorium, opened in 1889"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the current [[Civic Opera House]] on 20 North Wacker Drive was opened, though the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] Company itself collapsed in the [[Great Depression]]. The old Auditorium continued to produce stage shows and musicals till it closed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitz, p. 93: "In 1929 it relinquished its role as Chicago's premier opera house to the new Civic Opera Building (see p. 95). But six years earlier,... ''Hellzapoppin'' was the last show to grace the stage before the Auditorium closed in 1941."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resident opera companies began in Chicago in 1910 with the [[Chicago Grand Opera Company]] being formed from the remains of the Manhattan Opera Company, which had been founded by Oscar Hammerstein I, and had been squeezed out by the more financially sound Metropolitan Opera. Chicago had this first company for four seasons, then, after no season in 1914/15, it was re-formed as the [[Chicago Opera Association]]. This lasted through 1921/22, when it became the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] from 1922 until 1932. After no season in 1932/33, the company was re-formed and again named the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1933 to 1935. From 1936 to 1939, the company was called [[Chicago City Opera Company]], and finally from 1940 to 1946 opera was presented by the [[Chicago Opera Company]]. There were no seasons from 1947 until 1953, so opera was presented by other companies on tour. Lyric Opera was formed in 1954 and has continued uninterrupted except for 1967.

==Lyric Opera, 1954 to 1980==
Carol Fox, America's first female opera impresario at the age of 28, began her first season in 1954 by bringing [[Maria Callas]] for her American debut in the title role of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', the first of many electrifying Callas performances in Chicago. However, this first eight-opera season in 1954 was not the result of a long apprenticeship in opera production; Carol Fox, fluent in Italian and French, had studied opera singing for many years, culminating in two years of intensive work in Italy. However, when she realized that performance was not to be in her future, she decided that it lay in bringing the performances of the world's finest artists to her home town of Chicago. Her success can be measured in one statistic regarding the filling of the Lyric's Civic Opera House: in 1954, the season ran for three weeks; in 2007/08 the Lyric had an almost six-month season.

Fox also used her formidable persuasive powers on artists other than singers: she was able to bring [[Rudolph Nureyev]] to make his debut on an American opera stage at the Lyric; [[Vera Zorina]], [[Alicia Markova]], [[Erik Bruhn]] and [[Maria Tallchief]] also danced at the Lyric, and [[George Balanchine]] created choreography for the Lyric. The Italian composer [[Pino Donati]] was her artistic director. [[Bruno Bartoletti]] was principal conductor, but other conductors included [[Tullio Serafin]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] and [[Artur Rodzinski]]. [[Christoph von Dohnányi]] and Sir [[Georg Solti]] chose the Lyric for their American operatic debuts. [[Franco Zeffirelli]] staged operas as did [[Harold Prince]].

Because of her illnesses and her refusal to lower her artistic standards despite the Lyric's dire financial state in 1980, her resignation was sought and given. Carol Fox died a few months later, survived by a daughter Victoria.

It was of the Lyric's founder that [[Saul Bellow]] wrote in 1979 "Miss Fox will be remembered, together with Jane Addams of Hull House and Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine, as one of Chicago's greatest women."&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Claudia, foreword by Saul Bellow, ''Lyric Opera of Chicago'', The Opera,1979, {{ISBN|0960353801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the many years at the Lyric, Carol Fox developed the confidence and authority to bring world-famous artists to the Lyric: [[Luciano Pavarotti]] (56 performances in 7 roles), [[Tito Gobbi]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]], [[Giulietta Simionato]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Boris Christoff]], [[Eileen Farrell]], [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Leonie Rysanek]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Geraint Evans]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Robert Merrill]], [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Christa Ludwig]], [[Jon Vickers]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Grace Bumbry]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Tatiana Troyanos]], [[Sherrill Milnes]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Felicia Weathers]] and [[José Carreras]]. [[Anna Moffo]] also chose the Lyric for her American debut.

==Later administrations, 1981 to the present==
Carol Fox was succeeded at the Lyric by her longtime assistant manager, [[Ardis Krainik]] (1981–1996), after whom the opera house was named, and then by William Mason (1997–2011). [[Anthony Freud]] took over in October 2011.

Sir [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]] is Lyric's music director and principal conductor, a post he has occupied since in September 2000. He led three complete cycles of ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' in the 2004/05 season to mark the company's 50th anniversary. [[Danny Newman]] was the company's long-time press agent from 1954 until his retirement in the 2001/02 season; Newman is largely credited as the founder of subscription-based arts marketing, the standard economic model for not-for-profit arts organizations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Weber, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDD153BF930A1575AC0A961958260 "Arts in America; The Unsung Hero of Nonprofit Theater Is Still Selling"], ''The New York Times'', 23 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip David Morehead]] was head of music staff until his retirement in 2015.

==Production history==
In addition to the [[List of famous operas|standard operatic repertoire]], Lyric also presents contemporary works. Recent productions have included [[John Harbison|Harbison's]] ''[[The Great Gatsby#Opera|The Great Gatsby]]'' (2000–2001), [[Kurt Weill|Weill's]] ''[[Street Scene (opera)|Street Scene]]'' (2001–2002), [[Carlisle Floyd|Floyd's]] ''[[Susannah]]'', [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim's]] ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (2002–2003), and [[John Adams]]' ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' directed by Peter Sellars.

Composer [[William Bolcom]] wrote his most recent opera for Lyric, ''[[A Wedding (opera)|A Wedding]]'', based on the 1978 film of the same name directed by [[Robert Altman]]. It premiered during Lyric's 50th-anniversary season. During the 2015/16 season, the company premiered its latest commission, ''[[Bel Canto (opera)|Bel Canto]]'' by Peruvian composer [[Jimmy López]] with a libretto by [[Nilo Cruz]] based on the novel by [[Ann Patchett]].

The Lyric Opera productions were broadcast and nationally syndicated by [[WFMT]] Radio Network, from 1971 until 2001. 
The broadcasts ceased then because of a loss of sponsorship &lt;ref&gt;Sponsors' Withdrawal Ends Lyric Opera Radio Show: John von Rhein, Chicago Tribune, September 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;.  The issue was resolved at the 11th hour for the October 21, 2006 premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' starring [[Deborah Voigt]]. Syndicated broadcast of the Lyric Opera resumed in May 2007 on the [[WFMT]] network, which was included on [[XM Satellite Radio]] before it merged and became SiriusXM Radio.

==Civic Opera House==

:''For details, see [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]]''

The company's permanent home is the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]], a building which it rented from 1954 until after the 1993 renovations. It is a 1929 structure with an [[Art Deco]] interior. Its 3,563-seat capacity makes it the second-largest opera auditorium in [[North America]] after the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City. The interior was named ''The Ardis Krainik Theatre'' in 1996 in honor of Ardis Krainik, the former General Director, who was responsible for its renovation from 1993 onwards.

===Joffrey Ballet===

In 2017, Lyric Opera of Chicago as house manager of the theater announced that the [[Joffrey Ballet]] plans to move from its longtime performance venue at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] to the opera house in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-ae-lyric-joffrey-jones-1001-story.html |title=How the Lyric and Joffrey's new partnership will change cultural Chicago |last=Jones |first=Chris |work=chicagotribune.com |access-date=2017-12-22 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement coincided with the Lyric’s presentation of a new production of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by choreographer [[John Neumeier]]; the production fused the musical and ballet elements of the opera and featured the Joffrey Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-ent-lyric-joffrey-orphee-review-20170924-story.html|title=Review: Triumphant new 'Orphee' presages strong partnership of Lyric Opera, Joffrey Ballet|last=von Rhein|first=John|date=September 24, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center==
The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center (formerly Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, 1981–2006), established in 1974 by Carol Fox, is the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago.

The Ryan Opera Center is considered one of the most prestigious vocal programs in America,&lt;ref name="ketterson"&gt;Ketterson, Mark Thomas, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062610/http://www.usoperaweb.com/2003/autum/locaa.html "Lyric Opera Center of American Artists Trains the Opera Singers of the Future]", on usoperaweb.com, Autumn 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
and has produced notable singers, including:

{{div col end}}

Approximately a dozen young singers are selected from the near 400 who audition annually,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricopera.org/about/ryanopera.aspx The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016025244/http://www.lyricopera.org/about/ryanopera.aspx |date=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are in residence for twelve months. Over the course of the year they receive advanced instruction in numerous aspects of operatic performance, including voice lessons and coachings, language and acting training, and master classes with some of opera’s most renowned artists. The singers gain valuable performing experience by participating in recitals and concerts at many Chicago-area venues. During Lyric Opera’s mainstage season, they perform and understudy roles at all levels. The singers work with the world’s greatest opera singers, conductors, and directors, thus advancing the young artists’ professionalism. In 2005, author [[William Murray (writer)|William Murray]] wrote a book about a year in the life of an entering class at the Ryan Opera Center.&lt;ref&gt;See Murray, William 2006, ''Fortissimo: Backstage at the Opera with Sacred Monsters and Young Singers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Foldi]] was Director of the Ryan Opera Center from 1991 to 1995. He was succeeded by [[Richard Pearlman]], who was Director of the program from 1995 until his death in 2006. Renowned soprano [[Gianna Rolandi]], who had been the Ryan Opera Center's Director of Vocal Studies and principal instructor since 2002, was appointed Director of the program in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2006/5/News/Gianna_Rolandi_Named_as_New_Lyric_Opera_Center_for_American_Artists_Director.html "Gianna Rolandi Named as New Lyric Opera Center for American Artists Director"], ''[[Opera News]]''. May 9, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The program is now administered by Dan Novak, Director; Craig Terry, Music Director; Julia Faulkner, Director of Vocal Studies, and [[Renée Fleming]], Advisor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">{{Other uses|Mode (disambiguation){{!}}Mode}}

In [[literature]] and other artistic media, a '''mode''' is an unspecific critical term usually designating a broad but identifiable kind of [[literary method]], [[Mood (literature)|mood]], or manner that is not tied exclusively to a particular [[List of narrative forms|form]] or [[Literary genre|genre]]. Examples are the ''satiric'' mode, the ''ironic'', the ''comic'', the ''pastoral'', and the ''didactic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] uses 'mode' in a more specific sense. Kinds of poetry, he writes, may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'' of [[mimesis|imitation]], according to their ''objects'' of imitation, and according to their mode or 'manner' of imitation (section I). "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section III). According to this definition, 'narrative' and 'dramatic' are modes of fiction:
:"This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in Aristotle's differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''[[mimesis]]'' (direct imitation). It has, as we shall see, important consequences for both the logic and the language of the drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Elam|1980|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction-writing==
[[Fiction]] is a form of [[narrative]], one of the four [[rhetorical modes]] of discourse.  Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions.  Agent and author [[Evan Marshall (agent)|Evan Marshall]] identifies five [[fiction-writing mode]]s: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Morrell|2006|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summarization===
Summarization (also referred to as summary, narration, or narrative summary) is the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are condensed.  The reader is told what happens, rather than having it shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|pp=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fiction-writing axiom "[[Show, don't tell]]" the "tell" is often in the form of summarization.

Summarization has important uses:
* To connect one part of a story to another
* To report events whose details aren't important
* To telescope time
* To convey an emotional state over an extended period of time&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Marshall|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To vary the rhythm and texture of the writing&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Selgin|2007|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author [[Orson Scott Card]], either action or summarization could be right, either could be wrong.  Factors such as rhythm, pace, and tone come into play.  The objective is to get the right balance between telling versus showing, action versus summarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Card|1988|pp=140–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introspection===
{{main|Introspection}}
Introspection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character's thoughts.  As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Browne|King|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Nancy Kress]], a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kress|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[scene (fiction)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bickham|1993|pp=12–22,50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Essay-writing==
According to Frederick Crews, it is traditional and useful to think of essays as falling into four types, corresponding to four basic functions of prose:  ''description'', or picturing; ''narration'', or telling; ''exposition'', or explaining; and ''argument'', or convincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Anker distinguishes between nine different modes of essay writing:  ''narration'', or writing that tells stories; ''illustration'', or writing that gives examples; ''description'', or writing that creates pictures in words; ''process analysis'', or writing that explains how things happen; ''classification'', or writing that sorts things into groups; ''definition'', or writing that tells what something means; ''comparison and contrast'', or writing that shows similarities and differences; ''cause and effect'', or writing that explains reasons or results; and ''argument'', or writing that persuades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Anker|2004|pp=97–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The office is responsible to the [[film producer|Film Producer]] and includes the [[production manager|Production Manager]], [[Assistant director|Assistant Director]] and one or more [[Production assistant|Production Assistants]]. Typically a ''Production Office'' is established in the [[pre-production]] phase and continues until at least [[post-production]].

The Production Office usually includes positions such as, but not entirely made of, Production Supervisor, Production Office Coordinator, Assistant Production Office Coordinator, Production Secretary and Office Assistants (otherwise known or credited as Office PA's or Staff Assistants).

A Production Office will look different for each production depending on many variables including the type of film, the production company producing the film and the size of the budget of the film itself. A Production Office can be as small as one or two people (mostly seen in an independent film structure) or as big as ten or more on a film with a sizeable budget.

[[File:Kings Place.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Kings Place]] from across the canal]]
The '''Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation''' is a [[registered charity]]&lt;ref name= "Open"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://opencharities.org/charities/1157063 | title=Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation | publisher=Open Charities | date=17 May 2014 | accessdate=18 November 2014}} Registered charity number 1157063&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was set up in 2011 to take advantage of the gift, in a legacy, of the property at [[Royal College Street|8 Royal College Street]] in the [[London Borough of Camden]], the house occupied by the French poets [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/about-us/about-foundation/ | title=About Us | publisher=Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation | accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poetry house"/&gt; when they lived in London in 1873. In 2014 it was launched as a new arts organisation and a registered charity.&lt;ref name= "Open"/&gt;

The Foundation’s long-term aim is to develop 8 Royal College Street as a European-style "poetry house".&lt;ref name="Poetry house"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/poetry-house/ | title=Poetry House | publisher=Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, it is using the two poets as an inspirational starting point for a much wider mission to champion arts and culture. Exploring the vital role played by the arts in education, [[social capital]] building and cultural exchange, the Foundation is also developing a new and more sustainable business model for the arts, based around earned income.

==Governance==
[[File:Graham Henderson portrait.png|thumb|150px|Portrait of Graham Henderson]]
The Foundation is managed by a board of English-speaking and French-speaking trustees, chaired by Thomas Venning, head of Books and Manuscripts at [[Christie’s]].&lt;ref name="Governance"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/about-us/board-corporate-governance/ | title=Corporate governance | publisher=Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation | accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chief executive (since April 2014) is [[Graham Henderson (cultural entrepreneur)|Graham Henderson]],&lt;ref name="Journey"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/news/rimbaud-and-verlaine-embark-journey/ | title=Rimbaud and Verlaine embark on a journey | author=[[Graham Henderson (cultural entrepreneur)|Henderson, Graham]]|publisher=Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation | date=7 January 2015 | accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was previously chief executive of [[Poet in the City]].&lt;ref name="Leaving"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/271/faces/graham-henderson-leaves-poet-city | title=Graham Henderson leaves Poet in the City | work=Arts Professional | date=6 March 2014 | accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:8 Royal College Street, Camden Town - geograph.org.uk - 430128.jpg|thumb|150px|8 [[Royal College Street]] in 2007, before restoration]]
[[File:8 Royal College Street.jpg|thumb|150px|8 Royal College Street in 2015, after restoration]]
The Foundation was created by Graham Henderson and was initially incubated within Poet in the City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/chasing-rimbaud/ | work=[[3:AM Magazine]]|location= Paris|title= Chasing Rimbaud | date=7 May 2008|accessdate= 1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson was part of (and inherited) the previous campaign to save the property at 8 Royal College Street. For many years this was run by Gerry Harrison, a [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] councillor,&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/verlaine-and-rimbaud-poets-from-hell-525605.html | title=Verlaine and Rimbaud: Poets from hell | work=[[The Independent]] | date=8 February 2006 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Patterson, Christina}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the process of which many celebrities have rallied to the cause, including the actor [[Simon Callow]],&lt;ref name="Osley"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecnj.com/camden/020906/news020906_14.html |title=French are urged to buy poets' home |last=Osley |first=Richard |date=2 September 2006 |work=[[Camden New Journal]] |access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the writers [[Julian Barnes]],&lt;ref name="Patterson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/dylan-called-in-to-help-save-poets-love-nest-on-londons-desolation-row-6106333.html |title=Dylan called in to help save poets' love nest on London's Desolation Row |last=Barnes |first=Anthony |date=19 March 2006 |work=[[The Independent]] |access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Appignanesi]]&lt;ref name="Patterson"/&gt; and [[Tracy Chevalier]] and the musician [[Patti Smith]].

In 2007 the house was bought and sympathetically restored by a new owner, Michael Corby. Committed to the historic identity of the property, he agreed in 2011 to leave the property as legacy gift to the Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation, created especially by Graham Henderson for this purpose. The Foundation has always been clear, however, that it does not want to be just a small [[Historic house museum|house museum]]. It has therefore used the idea of the "poetry house" to create an arts organisation with the wider goal of promoting culture and the arts and championing their role in social capital building.&lt;ref name = Venning&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rimbaudverlaine.org/en/new-business-model/are-arts-compatible-pursuit-profit/ |title=Are the arts compatible with the pursuit of profit? |last=Venning |first=Thomas |publisher = Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation|access-date=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has seen the Foundation deliver an extensive programme of cross-arts events and commissions and take an innovative approach to audience and business development.

==Events==

The programme of events delivered by the Foundation has been intentionally eclectic, involving many different art forms, and up-and-coming talent from across the arts and cultural sector. Amongst other things this programme has included events featuring opera, classical music, sculpture, poetry, literature, theatre, jazz music and rock music. Highlights have included ''The Disappearing Poet'',&lt;ref name="Disappearing"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1453827/ |title=Arthur Rimbaud: the Disappearing Poet |date=2014 |publisher=[[University College London]] |access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event exploring why poets disappear, ''[[Faure|Faure’s Verlaine Settings]]'', an event presenting classical song settings of the poet’s work, and ''Rock for Rimbaud'', a concert featuring Americana artists. Institutional partners have included the [[National Opera Studio]],  [[Bloodaxe Books]] and [[Pernod]] Absinthe. From 2018 the Foundation is organising a series of [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]-style events at Blacks Club in [[Soho]] in London, featuring speakers and artists, and designed to champion its work.

==Commissions==

The Foundation has also been responsible for commissioning new work in the arts. For instance, in 2016 it commissioned both a full-length jazz show (''Jazz from the Playing Card Factory'')&lt;ref name="LJN"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.londonjazznews.com/2016/09/previewinterview-romanian-pianist-sorin.html |title=PREVIEW/INTERVIEW: Romanian pianist Sorin Zlat (new commission From the Playing Card Factory, Kings Place, 10th October)  |date=3 September 2016 |work=London Jazz News |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-length theatre show (''Poetry House Live'').&lt;ref name="Live"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://poetryhouseproject.wordpress.com/ |title=Poetry House Live |website=Poetry House Project |access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as several performances the latter has resulted in a full-length film made in partnership with the film department at the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref name="CCA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cca-glasgow.com/programme/scottish-writers-centre-poetry-house-adapting-poetic-text-for-the-big-screen |title=Scottish Writers' Centre Poetry House&amp;nbsp;– Adapting Poetic Text for the Big Screen |year=2017 |publisher=[[Centre for Contemporary Arts]] |location=Glasgow |access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation has also been responsible for an original poetry commission involving a suite of poems by [[George Szirtes]], and a series of 24 paintings by the artist Rebecca Taber inspired by the poetry of Rimbaud and Verlaine. In 2018 the Foundation is seeking funding for, amongst other things, an original [[chamber opera]], and an original [[puppet show]].

==Educational work==

The Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation is committed to encouraging new generations of students in secondary schools in the UK to engage with the arts and literature, and to gain an international perspective. In particular, it seeks to engage with young people in local Camden and [[London Borough of Islington |Islington]] schools, located within a short distance of the property at 8 Royal College Street, many of whom come from socially and economically deprived backgrounds. The Foundation wants to provide these young people with experiences and educational opportunities they might otherwise not possess. This charitable mission lies at the heart of the Foundation’s identity, and forms an important part of its contribution to the local community.

In 2017, the Foundation delivered an extensive programme of educational placements featuring poetry in four schools in the London Borough of Camden, working with students from [[Maria Fidelis Roman Catholic Convent School]], [[Regent High School]], [[Camden School for Girls]]&lt;ref name="Camden Girls"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.camdengirls.camden.sch.uk/news/?pid=1183&amp;nid=115&amp;storyid=1222 |title=A Celebration of Poetry |last=Fearnside |first=Angie |date= 2017|access-date= 25 March 2018 |publisher=[[Camden School for Girls]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Celebration"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.camdengirls.camden.sch.uk/_files/342DF6759B4B7EC3E2E984C6F39A7A9F.pdf |title=A Celebration of Poetry |last=Fearnside |first=Angie |date=2017|access-date= 25 March 2018 |publisher=[[Camden School for Girls]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[La Sainte Union Catholic School]] in a programme that involved over 500 students. This schools programme was generously supported by the [[T.S. Eliot]] Foundation. As well as work in the classroom, it included school shows and the publication of an 89-page poetry [[anthology]] entitled ''How We Make Daylight'', featuring work by the students.&lt;ref name="Camden Girls"/&gt;

The Foundation is facilitating a repeat programme of schools’ placements in Camden in 2018, with poetry in translation as its main focus, which will be delivered by Modern Poetry in Translation.

==International connections== 
[[File:Kindred Spirits.jpg|thumb|200px|Delegates attending Kindred Spirits conference in [[Bucharest]], 2015]]
The Foundation has also been working internationally. In 2015 Graham Henderson and the organisation took the lead in creating the Kindred Spirits network of European poetry houses including seven arts organisations based in six different European countries.&lt;ref name="Kindred"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kindredspirits.eu/ |title=Welcome to Kindred Spirits|website=Kindred Spirits|accessdate = 3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation’s partners include the Rimbaud Museum in [[Charleville-Mézières]], La Maison de la Poesie in Paris, [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, the Lorca Foundation in [[Granada]], the Keats-Shelley House in Rome, the National Museum of Literature in Bucharest, the [[Druskininkai#Culture|Druskininkai Poetic Fall]] festival in Lithuania and the [[Halldór Laxness]] Museum in Iceland.&lt;ref name="Kindred partner"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kindredspirits.eu/partner-pages/ |title=Partners |website=Kindred Spirits |access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network became a vehicle for an application for a [[European Union]] Large Cooperation Grant in the autumn of that year. The Foundation was all set to resubmit its application in 2016, with every chance of success, when the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016 |referendum result]] in favour of  [[Brexit]] intervened. As a result, the charity's trustees decided that it was no longer sensible to place EU funding at the centre of the organisation’s future strategy. The Foundation, nevertheless, is keen to build on the relationships it had established with its "poetry house" partners, and particularly on the experience of the conference held in [[Bucharest]] in May 2015, bringing together representatives from all of the partner organisations.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kindredspirits.eu/news/poetry-house/ |title=The Poetry House |author= [[Graham Henderson (cultural entrepreneur)|Henderson, Graham]] |date=May 2015 |website=Kindred Spirits|accessdate = 3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poetry House Live theatre show in 2017 was commissioned expressly with the purpose of involving talented up-and-coming playwrights from all of the seven countries involved in the network.

After making her acting debut with a minor role in the thriller ''[[Hangmen (film)|Hangmen]]'' (1987), she received early attention for her performance in the sci-fi action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993).

This led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several [[independent film]]s as well as in the lead role of the short-lived [[NBC]] television version of the film ''[[Working Girl (TV series)|Working Girl]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yes, These Movies Became TV Shows...and it Didn't Work Out|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/551820/yes-these-movies-became-tv-shows-and-it-didn-t-work-out|accessdate=November 4, 2015|publisher=E!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Working Girl|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1990/04/27/working-girl|accessdate=November 4, 2015|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to appear in several films, such as ''[[Love Potion No. 9 (film)|Love Potion No. 9]]'' (1992), ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'' (1993) and ''[[Fire on the Amazon]]'' (1993), before rosing to early prominence with her supporting role in the sci-fi action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (1993).

Bullock's big breakthrough came in 1994, when she starred in the action thriller ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', with [[Keanu Reeves]], as one of the passengers of a city bus containing a bomb. She came to read for ''Speed'' with Reeves to make sure there was the right chemistry between the two actors.

While the film made US$182&amp;nbsp;million globally, it received positive reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: "''While You Were Sleeping'' is built wholly from familiar ingredients, but assembled with such skill — and with such a charming performance from Sandra Bullock — that it gives formula a good name".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/while_you_were_sleeping/&lt;/ref&gt; She received her first [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe Award nomination]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]].

[[Owen Gleiberman]], writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', complimented her performance, saying "Bullock pulls you into the movie.

The film was a commercial hit, grossing US$93&amp;nbsp;million worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forcesofnature.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Boxoffice Magazine'' remarked: "The combination of Affleck's deadpan by-the-book persona with the spontaneity of Bullock's character sparks with convincing chemistry, their diverse personalities causing both to grow and bring to the surface what each is running away from or can't admit".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/forces_of_nature/reviews/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Established career (2000–2008)===

[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three stars out of a possible four, stating: "Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability, creating a character you'd like to like, and could like, if she weren't so sad, strange and turned in upon herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/murder-by-numbers-2002 |last= Ebert |first= Roger |authorlink= Roger Ebert |date= April 19, 2002 |title= ''Murder by Numbers'' |publisher= rogerebert.com |accessdate= December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropy ==
Bullock has been a public supporter of the [[American Red Cross]], having donated US$1&amp;nbsp;million to the organization at least five times. Her first public donation of that amount was to the Red Cross's [[Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks|Liberty Disaster Relief Fund]]. Three years later, she sent money in [[Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/03/tsunami.bullock.ap/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Sandra Bullock donates $1 mil for tsunami |date=January 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107041343/http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/03/tsunami.bullock.ap/index.html |archivedate=January 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she donated US$1&amp;nbsp;million to relief efforts in Haiti following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]], and again donated the same amount following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/03/17/bullock.japan.donation/index.html?hpt=T2|publisher=CNN|title=Sandra Bullock sends million for Japan | date=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, she donated US$1&amp;nbsp;million to support Red Cross relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heyman|first1=J.D.|title=Sandra Bullock Donates $1 Million to Help Hurricane Relief Effort|url=http://people.com/human-interest/sandra-bullock-donates-1-million-hurricane-relief-effort/|website=People|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with other stars, Bullock did a [[public service announcement]] urging people to sign a petition for clean-up efforts of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|oil spill]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/sandra-bullock-urges-fans-to-help-in-gulf-oil-spill-2010207 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723151628/http://www.usmagazine.com/celebritynews/news/sandra-bullock-urges-fans-to-help-in-gulf-oil-spill-2010207 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 23, 2010 |title=Sandra Bullock Urges Fans to Help in Gulf Oil Spill |work=Us Weekly |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock backs the Texas non-profit organization The Kindred Life Foundation, Inc., and in late 2008 joined other top celebrities in supporting the work of KLF's founder and CEO Amos Ramirez. At a fundraising gala for the organization, Bullock said, "Amos has led many efforts across our nation that have helped families that are in need. Our country needs more organizations that are committed to the service that Kindred Life is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giving Hearts of Hollywood|url=http://www.listal.com/list/not-just-another-pretty-face|accessdate=June 20, 2013|publisher=listal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Bullock was inducted into the Warren Easton Hall of Fame for her donations to charities, and in 2013 was honored with the [[People's Choice Awards#Special|Favorite Humanitarian Award]] at the [[39th People's Choice Awards]] in 2013 for her contributions to New Orleans' [[Warren Easton High School]], which was severely damaged by 2005's [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sandra Bullock receives an award for her support to charities|url=http://www.theyarenews.com/eng/2012/5/14/sandra-bullock-receives-award-support-charities-3788.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504202455/http://www.theyarenews.com/eng/2012/5/14/sandra-bullock-receives-award-support-charities-3788.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=July 25, 2014|work=.theyarenews.com|date=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sandra Bullock Wins Favorite Humanitarian at 2013 People's Choice Awards|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sandra-bullock-wins-favorite-humanitarian-at-2013-peoples-choice-awards-2013101|accessdate=July 25, 2014|publisher=US Weekly|date=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

===Relationships===
Bullock was once engaged to actor [[Tate Donovan]], whom she met while filming ''[[Love Potion No. 9 (film)|Love Potion No. 9]]''. Their relationship lasted three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20101321,00.html|title=Speeding Bullock}}&lt;/ref&gt; She previously dated football player [[Troy Aikman]], and actors [[Matthew McConaughey]] and [[Ryan Gosling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/03/18/private_drama_plagues_oscar_winner_sandra_bullock/ |title=Private drama plagues Oscar winner Sandra Bullock |work=Boston Globe |date=March 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 5, 2010 | first=Sandy | last=Cohen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/praising-private-ryan/2007/04/25/1177459784728.html |title=Praising Private Ryan |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=April 27, 2007 |accessdate=June 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullock married motorcycle builder and ''[[Monster Garage]]'' host [[Jesse James (customizer)|Jesse James]] on July 16, 2005. They first met when Bullock arranged for her ten-year-old godson to meet James as a Christmas present. In November 2009, Bullock and James entered into a custody battle with James' second ex-wife, former adult film actress [[Janine Lindemulder]], with whom James had a child. Bullock and James subsequently won full legal custody of James' five-year-old daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272628903.shtml |title=Sandra Bullock Custody Battle |work=National Ledger |date=November 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, a scandal arose when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20355742,00.html |title=Jesse James's Alleged Mistress No. 1 to 'Clear the Air' Soon |work=People|date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20355713,00.html |title=Woman No. 3: I 'Made a Mistake' with Jesse James |work=People|date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20354852,00.html |title=A Fourth Woman Alleges Affair with Jesse James |work=People|date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock canceled European promotional appearances for ''The Blind Side'' citing "unforeseen personal reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20352311,00.html |title=Sandra Bullock Pulls Out of London Premiere |work=People|date=March 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20353810,00.html|title=Without Sandra Bullock, Blind Side's Berlin Premiere Canceled |work=People|date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. He stated, "The vast majority of the allegations reported are untrue and unfounded&amp;nbsp;… beyond that, I will not dignify these private matters with any further public comment."&lt;ref name="people1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20352642,00.html |title=Jesse James Apologizes to Sandra Bullock and His Children |work=People|date=March 18, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; James declared, "There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me." He asked that Bullock and their children one day "find it in their hearts to forgive me" for their "pain and embarrassment."&lt;ref name="people1"/&gt; James' publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010 that James had checked into a rehabilitation facility to "deal with personal issues" and save his marriage to Bullock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20355899,00.html |title=Jesse James Checks into Treatment Facility |work=People|date=March 30, 2010 |accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on April 28, 2010, it was reported that Bullock had filed for divorce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20364464_20364640,00.html |title=EXCLUSIVE: Sandra Bullock Has Filed for Divorce |work=People|date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on April 23 in [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20364464_20364883,00.html |title=Sandra Bullock's Divorce Likely Won't Be Messy |work=People|date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with "conflict of personalities" cited as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Abrams, Natalie|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Bullock-James-Divorce-1019990.aspx|title=Sandra Bullock, Jesse James Divorce FInalized|newspaper=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Bullock announced on April 28, 2010 that she had proceeded with plans to adopt a son born in January 2010 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.&lt;ref name="PeopleBaby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20364464_20364639,00.html|title=World Exclusive: Meet Sandra Bullock's Baby Boy!|date=April 28, 2010|work=People|accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four months earlier. Bullock's son began living with them in January 2010, but they chose to keep the news private until after the Oscars in March 2010. However, given the couple's separation and then divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of her son as a single parent.&lt;ref name="PeopleBaby"/&gt;

In December 2015, Bullock announced that she had adopted a second child, and appeared on the cover of ''People'' magazine with her then {{frac|3|1|2}}-year-old new daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/12/02/sandra-bullock-adopts-daughter-laila/76655260/|title=Sandra Bullock adopts second child|date=December 2, 2015|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
On December 20, 2000, Bullock, who was the only passenger, and the two crew all escaped uninjured in the crash of a chartered business jet. The pilots were unable to [[Pilot-controlled lighting|activate the runway lights]] during a night landing at [[Jackson Hole Airport]] due to the use of out-of-date [[approach plate]]s, but continued the landing anyway. The aircraft landed in the airport's graded safety area between the runway and parallel taxiway and hit a snowbank. The accident caused a separation of the nose cone and landing gear, partial separation of the right wing, and a bend in the left wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=20010105X00028|publisher=NTSB|title=Accident Brief DEN01FA030|date=December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, while Bullock was in [[Massachusetts]] shooting the film ''[[The Proposal (2009 film)|The Proposal]]'', she and her then-husband [[Jesse James (customizer)|Jesse James]] were in an [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] that was hit head-on (driver's side offset) at moderate speed by a [[driving under the influence|drunken driver]]. Vehicle damage was minor and there were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/entertainment/15931720/detail.html |title=Sandra Bullock's Car Hit Head-On |publisher=WCVB TV Boston |date=April 19, 2008 |accessdate=April 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421130109/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/entertainment/15931720/detail.html |archivedate=April 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
In October 2004, Bullock won a multimillion-dollar judgment against Benny Daneshjou, the builder of her [[Lake Austin]], [[Texas]] home; the jury ruled that the house was uninhabitable. It has since been torn down and rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Schatz |title=Actress Bullock sues over Texas land deal|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-06-24/business/0106240265_1_actress-sandra-bullock-subdivision-lake-austin |accessdate=September 13, 2014 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |agency=[[Knight Ridder]]/Tribune |date=June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Actress wins $7m for builder's shoddy work |first=Catherine |last=Elsworth |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1474292/Actress-wins-7m-for-builders-shoddy-work.html|accessdate=September 13, 2014 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=October 16, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daneshjou and his insurer later settled with Bullock for roughly half the awarded verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/408123/builder-for-sandra-bullock-can-t-revive-malpractice-suit|title=Builder For Sandra Bullock Can't Revive Malpractice Suit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2007, a woman named Marcia Diana Valentine was found lying outside James and Bullock's home in [[Orange County, California]]. When James confronted the woman, she ran to her car, got behind the wheel, and tried to run over him. She was said to be an [[Stalking|obsessed fan]] of Bullock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Ken |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20036964,00.html |title=Cops: Woman Tried to Kill Sandra Bullock's Husband&amp;nbsp;— Jesse James, Sandra Bullock |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine was charged with one felony count each of aggravated assault and stalking. Bullock obtained a restraining order to bar Valentine from "contacting or coming near her home, family or work for three years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Battistelli|first=L'Oreal|title=Bullock stalker put on notice|url=http://articles.hbindependent.com/2007-05-16/news/hbi-bullock17_1_restraining-sunset-beach-huntington-beach-woman|accessdate=August 30, 2013|newspaper=[[Huntington Beach Independent]] |date=May 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18729381/ |title= Sandra Bullock fan charged with stalking |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and stalking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonnet.co.uk/entertainment/2007/jun/6124_20070613.php |title=Stalker denies attempt to run over Sandra Bullock's husband |publisher=LondonNet |accessdate=April 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was subsequently convicted of stalking and sentenced to three years' probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Leah |last=Chernikoff |title=Sandra Bullock stalker Marcia Valentine sentenced to three years probation |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2008/11/13/2008-11-13_sandra_bullock_stalker_marcia_valentine_.html| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York  |date=November 13, 2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2002, Bullock was also stalked across several states by a man named Thomas James Weldon. In 2003, Bullock obtained a restraining order against him, which was renewed in 2006. After the restraining order expired and Weldon was released from a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental institution]], he again traveled across several states to find Bullock; she then obtained another restraining order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sandra Bullock Gets Restraining Order Against Thomas James Weldon |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/06/sandra-bullock-gets-restr_n_673552.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823083136/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/06/sandra-bullock-gets-restr_n_673552.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |newspaper=[[HuffPost]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 25, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Joshua James Corbett broke into Bullock's Los Angeles home. Bullock locked herself in a room and dialed 911. Corbett pleaded no contest in 2017 and was sentenced to five years' probation for stalking Bullock and breaking into her residence. He was then subject to a 10-year protective order requiring him to stay away from Bullock. On May 2, 2018, after Corbett missed a court date the previous month, police officers went to his parents' residence where he lived in a guest house to arrest him. When he refused to leave and threatened to shoot officers, a SWAT team was called. After a five-hour standoff, the SWAT team deployed gas canisters and entered the house, where they found Corbett had committed suicide. Corbett's death was the result of "multiple incised wounds" according to the Los Angeles County coroner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sandra-bullock-stalker-kills-himself-20180503-story.html ''Los Angeles Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Scottish Theatre Company''' was started in 1980 under the direction of Dundee-born actor [[Ewan Hooper]] who had revived the [[Greenwich Theatre]], London in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenwichtheatre.org.uk/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but for most of its 8 years it was directed by his successor [[Tom Fleming (actor)|Tom Fleming]]. From its production base in Glasgow, where its home theatre was the [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]], it set out its policy of presenting Scottish and international classic drama, and commissioned new plays of [[Scottish drama]]. It toured nationally and appeared at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]]. The company represented British Theatre at the International Theatre Biennale in Warsaw in 1986 with Sir David Lyndsay's ''[[Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaites]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/27939/scottish-actor-and-director-tom-fleming-dies&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite attracting large audiences and its success in securing commercial sponsorship, including [[Scottish Television]], it was brought to an end when the [[Scottish Arts Council]] stopped its annual funding. Papers relating to the administration and productions of the Scottish Theatre Company, including papers relating to administration, productions, finance, sponsorship and publicity, 1980-1987 are deposited in Glasgow University Library Special Collections Scottish Theatre Archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb247-gb247stacm-cuetc&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Screen tone example.svg|thumb|Three shapes overlaid with different screentone patterns]]
'''Screentone''' is a technique for applying [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]]s and [[shading|shade]]s to [[drawing]]s, used as an alternative to [[hatching]]. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to [[paper]] from preprinted sheets,&lt;ref&gt;Sharon Kinsella, ''Adult Manga: Culture and Power in Contemporary Japanese Society'', Routledge, 2000, p59. {{ISBN|0-7007-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the technique is also simulated in [[computer graphics]].  It is also known by the common brand names Zip-A-Tone (1937, now defunct&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|71456830 |Zip-A-Tone}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Chart-Pak (1949&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|72055435|Chart-Pak}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Letratone (1966, from [[Letraset]]&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturer-supplied first use date for {{US trademark|72322600|Letratone}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A traditional screentone sheet consists of a flexible transparent backing, the printed texture, and a [[wax]] [[adhesive]] layer. The sheet is applied to the paper, adhesive down, and rubbed with a stylus on the backing side. The backing is then peeled off, leaving the [[ink]] adhered to the paper where pressure was applied.

==Motivation==

}}
A screentone saves an artist's time by allowing quick application of textures to [[line art]] where a hand-shaded area would not be reproduced in a timely or acceptable manner. Much like [[halftone]], the size and spacing of black dots, lines, or hatches determine how light or dark an area will appear. Visual artists need to take into account how much an image will be reduced when prepared for publication when choosing the [[Dot pitch|pitch]] of a screentone. Screentones can also be layered to produce [[interference pattern]]s such as [[moire effect]]s, or to simulate multiple sources of shadow in an image.

==Styles==
Different styles of screentone exist, variously intended to depict clothing, clouds, emotions, backgrounds, [[image gradient|gradients]] and even objects such as trees. While the sheets are most commonly produced with black ink, there are also varieties in solid and patterned colors. Screentones can also be modified by lightly scratching the backing with an [[X-Acto]] blade to produce [[Starburst (symbol)|starburst]]s and other special effects.
[[File:Manga screentone.svg|thumb|Manga screentone]]
Screentones are widely used by illustrators and artists, especially for [[cartoon]]s and [[advertising]]. Use of the original medium has been declining since the advent of [[graphics software]] and [[desktop publishing]], but it is still used, for example in [[manga]].

While computer graphics software provides a variety of alternatives to screentone, its appearance is still frequently simulated, to achieve consistency with earlier work or avoid the appearance of computer-generated images. It is sometimes accomplished by [[image scanner|scanning]] actual screentone sheets, but original vector or bitmap screen patterns are also used.

'''Sentimental poetry''' is a [[melodramatic]] [[poetic form]]. It is aimed primarily at stimulating the [[emotion]]s rather than at communicating experience truthfully. [[Grief|Bereavement]] is a common theme of sentimental poetry. 

[[Friedrich Schiller]] discussed sentimental poetry in his influential essay, ''[[On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry]]''.

Sentimental poetry was parodied by [[Mark Twain]] in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Annie|title=The Poetess in American Literature|url=http://literature.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-472#acrefore-9780190201098-e-472-div1-1201|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seyyid Kasim Gubari''' of [[Diyarbakır]] was a 17th-century Ottoman artist, noted for his poetic writing and calligraphy. He is celebrated as one of the most accomplished calligraphers of his time and decorated a number of important public buildings including the Blue Mosque in Istanbul.

==Life and work==
Seyyid Kasim Gubari's date of birth is not known, but he lived in Diyarbakır in south-eastern (modern day) Turkey on the banks of the Tigris River. He was a direct descendant of the prophet, Mohammed which entitled him to use the appellation ''Seyyid''.&lt;ref&gt;Hueseyin Ayvansaray-i, H., ''The Garden of the Mosques: Hafiz Hüseyin Al-Ayvansarayî's Guide to the Muslim Monuments of Ottoman Istanbul'' Brill, 2000, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Born Cherif 'Abdallah, he was given the nickname of Gubari (or Ghobâri) because according to legend, he wrote, in ghobar writing, an entire chapter of the Q'ran, consisting of four verses and fifteen words, on a single grain of rice.&lt;ref&gt;Huart, C., ''Les Calligraphes et les Miniaturistes de l'Orient Musulman'', 1972, p. 123 [https://archive.org/details/lescalligraphes00huargoog  Digital copy (in French)]-&lt;/ref&gt;

He was originally known for his poetic writing and took up calligraphy and decorative inscription sometime later. He responsible for much of the [[Persian calligraphy|calligraphy]] in the dome of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (the "Blue Mosque") in [[Istanbul]]. He was also commissioned to write verses from the [[Quran]] throughout the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;"The Blue Mosque", ''National Geographic'',  [https://www.nationalgeographic.org/photo/9moorishart-mosque/ Online:]; "Architecture of the [Blue] Mosque, [http://www.sultanahmetcamii.org/architecture-of-the-mosque/ Online"]&lt;/ref&gt; He was celebrated as one the greatest calligraphers of his day.&lt;ref&gt;"The Blue Mosque: Jewel of Istanbul" ''The Miracle'', 17 March, 2017, [https://www.pressreader.com/canada/the-miracle/20170317/282119226355783 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1615/1616 and is buried near the tomb of Eyyub.&lt;ref&gt;Hueseyin Ayvansaray-i, H., ''The Garden of the Mosques: Hafiz Hüseyin Al-Ayvansarayî's Guide to the Muslim Monuments of Ottoman Istanbul''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3687">The '''Studiolo of the Palazzo Belfiore''' was a former [[study (room)|study]], or room for intellectual pursuits, that was once found in a razed [[Renaissance architecture]] palace in [[Ferrara]], region of [[Emilia-Romagna]], Italy. While the palace has disappeared, records do list the paintings, consisting of depictions of muses, that hung in the room. These secular works are now dispersed across museums, but their collective presences recall the renewed attention of Renaissance patrons to symbols from classic mythology.
 
The palace, like the [[Palazzo Schifanoia]], is described now a ''delizia'' of the [[House of Este|Este dynasty]], which are now considered semi-rural palaces for the enjoyment of ''delights''. The palace was commissioned in 1447 by [[Leonello d'Este]] but completed by [[Borso d'Este]] around 1463. The exact layout of the palace, located near the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Ferrara|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] is unknown, since in 1483, it was severely damaged by the besieging Venetian armies, and a fire in 1683 completed the destruction.

==Description==
Leonello had commissioned the Studiolo dedicated to the [[Muses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.castelloestense.it/delizie/ita/paesaggio/scomparse_ferrara.html Castello Estense] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222223913/http://old.castelloestense.it/delizie/ita/paesaggio/scomparse_ferrara.html |date=2015-02-22 }}, notes on delizie of Este family.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decorative layout of the room was conceived by [[Guarino Veronese]], a tutor of Lionello, In 1447, Guarino mailed Lionello a description of the allegorical figures. By 1449, the palace had the paintings of Clio and Melpomene. Decoration of the studio continued after the death of tutor and pupil, and the program underwent modifications. The intarsia walls were destroyed along with the palace. Eight of the nine canvases are now attributed to this room:
#''[[Erato]]'' (love poetry); attributed to [[Angelo Maccagnino]] and follower of [[Cosmè Tura]], Pinacoteca nazionale di Ferrara
#''[[Urania]]'' (astronomy); anonymous, Pinacoteca nazionale di Ferrara
#''[[Terpsichore]]'' (dance); [[Angelo Maccagnino]] and [[Cosmè Tura]], Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan
#''[[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]]'' (comedy and pastoral poetry); [[Michele Pannonio]], [[Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest]]
#''[[Euterpe]]'' (flutes and lyric poetry); anonymous Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest
#''[[Melpomene]]'' (tragedy); anonymous, Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest
#''[[Polyhymnia]]'' (sacred poetry); anonymous, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]
#''[[Calliope]]'' (epic poetry) [[Cosmè Tura]], [[National Gallery, London]]

Supposedly the iconography parallels a bas-relief (1454-1456) depicted by [[Agostino di Duccio]] in the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] of Rimini.

'''''The Hunters in the Snow''''' ({{lang-nl|Jagers in de Sneeuw}}), also known as '''''The Return of the Hunters''''', is a 1565 oil-on-wood painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. The [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|Northern Renaissance]] work is one of a series of works, five of which still survive, that depict different times of the year. The painting is in the collection of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. This scene is set in the depths of winter during December/January.

==Background and origins==
''The Hunters in the Snow'', and the series to which it belongs, are in the medieval and early Renaissance tradition of the [[Labours of the Months]]: depictions of various rural activities and work understood by a spectator in Breugel's time as representing the different months or times of the year. 

==Description and composition==
The painting shows a wintry scene in which three hunters are returning from an expedition accompanied by their dogs.  By appearances the outing was not successful; the hunters appear to trudge wearily, and the dogs appear downtrodden and miserable. One man carries the "meager corpse of a [[fox]]" illustrating the paucity of the hunt. In front of the hunters in the snow are the footprints of a rabbit or hare - which has escaped or been missed by the hunters. The overall visual impression is one of a calm, cold, overcast day; the colors are muted whites and grays, the trees are bare of leaves, and wood smoke hangs in the air. Several adults and a child prepare food at an inn with an outside fire. Of interest are the jagged mountain peaks which do not exist in Belgium or Holland.

The landscape itself is a flat-bottomed valley (a river meanders through it) with jagged peaks visible on the far side. A [[watermill]] is seen with its wheel frozen stiff. In the distance, figures [[ice skate]], play hockey with modern style sticks and [[curling|curl]] on a frozen lake; they are rendered as silhouettes.

==Interpretation and reception==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=[[File:Jäger im Schnee - Gebirge und Burg.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj3HdzOR2pY Pieter Bruegel the Elder, ''Hunters in the Snow'' (Winter), 1565], [[Smarthistory]]}}
The 1560s was a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, and Bruegel (and possibly his patron) may be attempting to portray an ideal of what country life used to be or what they wish it to be.

Writing in the "opinion" section of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] points out that [[Old Master]]s are popular subjects for [[Christmas cards]] and states that "probably no 'secular' subject is more popular than ... ''Hunters in the Snow''".&lt;ref name="kemp 2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1038/456876a| last=Kemp| first=Martin|  title=Looking at the face of the Earth|journal=Nature|date=December 2008| volume=456|issue=18| pages=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hunters in the Snow'' is used extensively in Russian director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s films ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1974), and in [[Lars von Trier]]'s 2011 film ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]''. It appears also in [[Alain Tanner]]'s film ''[[Dans la ville blanche]]'' (1983). It was an inspiration for [[Roy Andersson]]'s 2014 film ''[[A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence]]'', and it is the basis for the first frame of [[Abbas Kiarostami#2010s|Abbas Kiarostami]]'s ''[[24 Frames (film)|24 Frames]]'' (2017).

'''UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects''' (Rome, 1995) is the international treaty on the subject of cultural property protection. It attempts to strengthen the main weaknesses of the 1970 UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property''. The [[UNIDROIT]] Convention seeks to fight the illicit trafficking of cultural property by modifying the buyer's behaviour, obliging him/her to check the legitimacy of their purchase.

==Due diligence and Burden of Proof==
[[File:Claude monet - marina (MCM-RJ) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]]. ''Marina''. Painting stolen from the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museu da Chácara do Céu|pt}}, Rio de Janeiro, in 2006]]

The Convention states that if a cultural property was stolen it must be returned (Chapter II, Art. 3.1).&lt;ref name="Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention|title=''UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNIDROIT official website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Any possessor deprived of his/her property will be compensated only if he/she can prove due diligence at the time of the purchase (Chapter II, Art. 4.1). The criteria for due diligence is listed under Article 4.4. of the Convention.

To assess the legitimacy of the object's origin, art market players can use international and national databases dedicated to cultural property protection, for instance, the INTERPOL Stolen Works of Art Database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Database|title=Works of art / Works of art / Crime areas / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=|publisher=Interpol.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; collects information about stolen cultural property and issues identification numbers to cultural objects.

Whereas Chapter II of the Convention deals with stolen cultural objects, Chapter III contemplates the export of cultural property in violation of national export restrictions. A State Party can request the competent Court of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from its territory if the removal of the object caused detriment in one of the ways listed under Article 5.3. Again, the burden of proof is on the possessor to demonstrate that he/she "neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported" (Art. 6.1).

These rules apply equally to cultural objects inherited or received as gifts. Either an heir or a beneficiary has the same responsibility as a buyer. Therefore, museums and other public institutions must carry out checks over the origin of donated objects.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-overview-e.pdf | title=The 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects. An overview | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention==

The UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property'' (1970 UNESCO Convention) and the UNIDROIT Convention are compatible and complementary. 
As distinct from the UNESCO Convention, the UNIDROIT Convention focuses on the recovery of cultural property. The UNIDROIT Convention establishes conditions for claims of restitution/return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects respectively.

Although the UNIDROIT Convention follows key terminology of 1970 UNESCO Convention, cultural goods do not need to be defined as such by the State.

Furthermore, the term  "cultural property" is replaced by a more comprehensive "cultural object", but the list of their categories remains the same. The concept of "illicit export" is replaced by "illegal export",  which references a prohibitive law rather than a general forbiddance.

==Time Restrictions to Claims for Repatriation==
[[File:De Grashaven.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Withoos]]. ''De Grashaven''. Stolen from [[Westfries Museum]], [[Hoorne]], in 2005]]

The Convention regulates the time period that an affected party may bring a claim for the restitution of stolen cultural property or the return of those illegally exported. 
Such a claim may be brought in three years from the time when the claimant knew the location of the cultural property and the identity of the possessor and in 50 years since the time of the theft (Art. 3.3). However, there are exceptions to this rule for stolen objects. 
Cultural objects that form an integral part of an identified monument or archaeological site, or which belong to a public collection are not subject to time limitation other than a period of three years (Art. 3.4). In addition, a Contracting State may declare that a claim warrants an extended time limit of 75 years or longer if so stated in its national law (Art. 3.5).&lt;ref name="convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.pdf | title=UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNIDROIT Convention is not a retroactive treaty. Its provisions only apply to cultural property stolen or illegally exported after the Convention entered into force (Art. 10).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt; However the UNIDROIT Convention "does not in any way legitimise any illegal transaction of whatever which has taken place before the entry into force of this Convention" and does not "limit any right of a State or other person to make a claim under remedies available outside the framework" of the Convention (Art. 10.3).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;

A '''USB dead drop''' is a [[USB]] mass storage device installed in a [[public space]]. For example, a [[USB flash drive]] might be mounted in an outdoor brick wall and fixed in place with fast concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public are implicitly invited to find files, or leave files, on a dead drop by directly plugging their [[laptop]] into the wall-mounted [[USB stick]] in order to transfer data.  (It is also possible to use [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablet]]s for this purpose, by utilizing a [[USB On-The-Go|USB on-the-go]] cable.)  The dead drops can therefore be regarded as an anonymous, offline, [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] network.  However, in practice USB dead drops are [[USB dead drop#Comparison to other types of data transfer|often used for social or artistic reasons]], rather than for practical ones.

==Background and history== 
The Dead Drops project was conceived by [[Berlin]]-based conceptual artist [[Aram Bartholl]], a member of New York's [[Fat lab]] art and technology collective. The first USB dead drop network of five devices was started by Bartholl in October 2010 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/mar/08/dead-drops-what-to-do-if-you-see-a-usb-stick-sticking-out-of-a-wall|title=Dead Drops: what to do if you see a USB stick sticking out of a wall|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=8 March 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1326177/Dead-Drops-Bizarre-new-artwork-embeds-USB-sticks-buildings.html|title=Dead Drops: Bizarre new artwork embeds USB sticks in buildings|date=3 November 2010|work=[[Mail Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://gizmodo.com/5677377/theres-a-usb-stick-in-my-brick-wall&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the [[dead drop]] method of [[espionage]] communication. An unrelated system called "deadSwap," in which participants use an SMS gateway to coordinate passing USB memory sticks on to one another, was begun in [[Germany]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://deadswap.net/files/deadswap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Each dead drop is typically installed without any data on the drive, except two files:&lt;ref name="instructables.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Create-a-USB-Dead-Drop-in-Nature/?ALLSTEPS|title=Create a USB Dead Drop in Nature - All|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; deaddrops-manifesto.txt,&lt;ref&gt;http://deaddrops.com/download/deaddrops-manifesto.txt&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[readme.txt]] file explaining the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://deaddrops.com/download/readme.txt&lt;/ref&gt;  Although typically found in urban areas embedded in concrete or brick since 2010, installation of USB dead drop into trees&lt;ref name=computerworld_2013/&gt; and other types of bodies in natural settings has also been mentioned since at least 2013.&lt;ref name="instructables.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2015/02/there_was_a_secret_usb_drive_h.html&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wireless]] dead drops such as the 2011 [[PirateBox]], where the user connects to a [[wifi hotspot]] with [[network attached storage|local storage]] rather than physically connects to a USB device, have also been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= PirateBox | url= http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110129205033/http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2011-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= WIDROP | url= http://widrop.bzhack.org/ | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001303/http://widrop.bzhack.org/ | archivedate= 2011-05-14 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Wireless drop |url= https://deaddrops.com/db/?page=view&amp;id=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other types of data transfer==
Some of the advantages of utilizing USB dead drops are practical in nature:  they permit [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] file sharing without needing any internet or cellular connection, sharing files with another person secretly/anonymously, and they record no [[IP address]] or similar [[personally identifying information]].  Other benefits are more social or artistic in nature:  USB dead drops are an opportunity to practice "[[Telecomix#Datalove|datalove]]" and can be seen as a way to promote [[off-grid]] data networks.  The motive to utilize USB dead drops has been compared to what drives people involved in [[geocaching]], which has been around for much longer and is somewhat similar in that often a set of GPS coordinates is used to locate a particular USB dead drop,&lt;ref name=arstechnica_2016/&gt; in particularly that USB dead drops give the user "the thrill of discovery"&lt;ref name=vocative_2015/&gt; both in seeking out the location of the dead drop, and then also in addition when examining the data it contains.

===Potential drawbacks to users===
Dead drops are USB-based devices, which must be connected to an upstream computer system (laptop or smartphone or similar).  The act of making such a connection, to a device which is not necessarily trusted, inherently poses certain threats:  
* [[Malware]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2010/11/02/usb-ports-on-new-york-citys-streets-plug-in-if-you-dare/&lt;/ref&gt; anyone can intentionally or unintentionally store malware on it that can infect an attached computer with malware such as a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]], [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] or [[Firmware#Security risks|proprietary firmware]].  This risk can be mitigated by using [[antivirus software]], or by using a [[burner phone|throwaway device]] for the act of data-transfer. 
* [[Booby trap]]:  a fake dead drop or [[USB Killer]] might be rigged up to electrically damage any equipment connected to it, and/or constitute a health and safety hazard for potential users. This risk can be mitigated by using a USB [[galvanic isolation]] adapter, which allows data exchange while physically decoupling the two circuits.  Wifi-based dead drops do not suffer from this threat. 
* [[Mugging (robbery)|Mugging]]:  because a USB dead drop is normally in a public or quasi-public location, it is possible for the location itself to be watched, and users of the dead drop attacked when they attempt to use the system. (Compare with the risk of being mugged at night near an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] outside a bank which is higher than the risk of being mugged during the day at the teller window inside the bank.  Thieves target ATM users because they know most people are withdrawing money, which can then be stolen; thieves can also target USB dead drops, because they know that using one requires a laptop or similar [[consumer electronics]] device.)

===Drawbacks to the system infrastructure===
Publicly and privately available USB dead drops give anyone (with physical access) the ability to save and transfer data anonymously and free of charge.  These features are advantages over [[the internet]] and the [[cellular network]], which are at best quasi-anonymous and low-cost (there is always some fee associated although in certain scenarios such as government-subsidized or employer-subsidized or public-library-subsidized network access the enduser may experience [[indirect costs|no direct costs]]).  However, offline networks are vulnerable to various types of threats and disadvantages, relative to online ones:
* One device at a time: Users cannot plug in to a USB dead drop if someone else is already plugged in
* Removal of stored data: anyone with physical access can erase all of the data held within the USB dead drop (via [[file deletion]] or [[disk formatting]]), or make it unusable by encrypting the data or the whole drive and hiding the key (see also the related topic of [[ransomware]]).
* Removal of the entire device:  thieves can steal the USB drive itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miamis-dead-drop-art-project-failing-because-thieves-keep-stealing-public-usb-drives-6537986&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disclosure: anyone can disclose the location of a (formerly) private dead drop, by shadowing people that use it, and publishing coordinates in a public fashion.  This impacts the anonymous nature of USB dead drops, since known drops can be [[CCTV camera|filmed]] or otherwise observed. 
* [[Vandalism]] of the dead drop by physical destruction: anyone with physical access can destroy the dead drop by using for instance [[pliers]] or a [[hammer]], by high voltage from a static field, with high temperature from a blowtorch, or other methods of physical force. It is possible to make the USB key more difficult to vandalize or to extract, by sealing it in a hole deeper than the length of the USB key (at least 2&amp;nbsp;cm more), but this requires legitimate users to connect with a USB [[Extension cable|extender cable]].  For clarity, sometimes the installation of the dead-drop can itself be vandalism of the building; when a building owner destroys a dead drop placed without permission, they are not vandalizing the dead drop, but removing a device placed without their leave.  Even when a device is placed legally, the device itself is vulnerable to third-party vandalism. 
* [[Hazards of outdoor recreation#Inclement weather|Exposure to the elements]]:  dead drops tend to be exposed to [[precipitation|rain and snow]], which will presumably reduce their [[MTBF|service lifetime]].&lt;ref name=arstechnica_2016&gt;https://arstechnica.com/business/2016/04/on-the-hunt-for-dead-drops-the-offline-anonymous-information-network/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Demolition]] or damage during maintenance: certain dead drop locations are limited to the lifespan of public structures.  When a dead drop is embedded in a brick wall, the drop can be destroyed when the wall is destroyed.  When a drop is embedded in a concrete sidewalk, the drop can be destroyed by sidewalk-related construction and maintenance.  Sometimes dead drops are damaged when walls are repainted.&lt;ref name=vocative_2015/&gt;

==Prevalence==
As of 2013, there were more than one thousand known USB dead drops (plus six known wifi-based dead drops).&lt;ref name=computerworld_2013&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/article/2597815/data-center/dead-drops-offline-p2p-file-sharing-network-goes-global.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Countries which have large numbers of USB dead drops include the [[United States]] and several in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=computerworld_2013/&gt;  As of 2016, it was estimated that the overall dead drop infrastructure contained more than ten [[terabyte]]s of storage capacity, with the majority still in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], but also with significant numbers of devices reportedly installed in the [[Asia]]/[[Australia|Pacific]] region, [[South America]], and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/04/160331_tecnologia_proyecto_dead_drops_usb_muros_red_offline_aram_bartholl_lb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vocative_2015&gt;http://www.vocativ.com/tech/internet/odd-world-usb-dead-drops/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Violet Barungi was born in [[Mbarara District]], now [[Ibanda District]], Western Uganda. She was educated at [[Bweranyangi Girls' Senior Secondary School]], [[Gayaza High School]] and [[Makerere University]] in [[Kampala]], where she graduated with an honours degree in History. She is married and has six children.&lt;ref name=".violetbarungi"/&gt;

==Writing==
Violet Barungi started writing while she was still a student. Her first short story, "Kefa Kazana", was published in ''Origin East Africa'', an anthology of short stories edited by Prof. David Cook and broadcast on the BBC in 1964.&lt;ref name=vio-letba-rung&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications|website=www.violetbarungi.com/publications.htm|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barungi’s play ''Over My Dead Body'' won the [[British Council]] New Playwriting Award for Africa and The Middle East in 1997,&lt;ref name="femrite-ach"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.femriteug.org/?view=7|title=Welcome femriteug.org|website=www.femriteug.org|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been subsequently anthologized in ''African Women Playwrights'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/69ehr4gc9780252033872.html ''African Women Playwrights''] ({{ISBN|978-0-252-03387-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Professor Kathy Perkins, an authority on African and [[African Diaspora]] theatre.&lt;ref name="Kathy-Perkins"&gt;[http://theatre.uiuc.edu/faculty/26 "Kathy A. Perkins"], Illinois Theatre. Retrieved 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her publications include ''The Shadow and the Substance'' (novel) published by Lake Publishers, Kenya, 1998, ''Cassandra'' (novel) published by FEMRITE Publications Limited, Uganda, 1999, short stories for children, which include ''Tit for Tat and other stories'' (1997), ''The Promise'' (2002), ''Our Cousins From Abroad'' (2003) and ''The Boy Who Became King'' (2004). Her play ''Over My Dead Body'' (unpublished) won the British Council International New Playwriting Award for Africa and the Middle East region, 1997. Her other plays include ''The Award-winner'', a stage play written to commemorate women’s creative works in the new millennium (unpublished) and an unpublished radio play, ''The Bleeding Heart''.&lt;ref name="vio-letba-rung"/&gt; 
 
Violet Barungi’s works deal mainly with human relationships, gender issues and education of the girl child. ''Over My Dead Body'' was inspired by her deep concern for girls who are lured into early marriages to rich men before they finish their education. When things go wrong, and their marriages fail, they find themselves without anything to fall back on.”&lt;ref name="AfricanWriter-Caples" /&gt;
