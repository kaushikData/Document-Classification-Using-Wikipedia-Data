In 2016, with proposed legislation to completely outlaw abortion, 30,000 women went on [[Strike action|strike]] and marched in cities across the country to [[protest]] the legislation, leading high-ranking politicians to distance themselves from the proposed law.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/polish-government-performs-u-turn-on-total-abortion-ban|title=Polish government signals U-turn on total abortion ban|last=Davies|first=Christian|date=2016-10-05|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just three days after the strike, lawmakers voted against the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e391c7ab4cf74414a4b9973e6ed1386e/polish-lawmakers-overwhelmingly-reject-total-ban-abortion|title=Polish women hail victory in abortion standoff and seek more|newspaper=The Big Story|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poland]] is one of the few countries in the world to outlaw abortion after decades of liberal  legislation (during [[Polish People's Republic|Communist rule]]). Polish women often seek abortion in neighboring countries due to the strict restraints in their own country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Poland has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe, along with a group of other traditionally Catholic countries of the region ([[Abortion in Malta|Malta]], [[Abortion in San Marino|San Marino]], [[Abortion in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|Vatican]], [[Abortion in Monaco|Monaco]], [[Abortion in Andorra|Andorra]], and [[Abortion in the Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] - the latter being in the process of changing its laws).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2018-05-24/these-countries-in-europe-have-the-strictest-abortion-laws&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
In Poland, abortion is banned except in the following three circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abortion Policies: A Global Review|last=|first=|publisher=United Nations Publications|year=2002|isbn=92-1-151365-0|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When the woman's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy,
# When the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act, or
# When the fetus is seriously malformed

Unlike in other countries where [[abortion]] is banned, women in [[Poland]] are not subject to a penalty for illegal termination of pregnancy. Consent of a physician is required for circumstances (1) and (3) above, while abortions in view of circumstance (2) above must be certified by prosecutor. Parental consent is always required if the woman seeking abortion is a [[Minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6235557.stm#poland|title=BBC News - Europe's abortion rules|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, persuading a woman to carry out illegal termination of her pregnancy is a criminal act.

==History==
Until 1932, abortion was banned in Poland without exceptions. In that year, the new Penal Code legalised abortion only when there were medical reasons and, for the first time in Europe, when the pregnancy resulted from a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.przestepczosczorganizowana.republika.pl/praw_pliki/historia_prawa/Kodeks_karny_1932r.pdf |title=Republika.pl Portal Społeczności Internetowych |publisher=Przestepczosczorganizowana.republika.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GzYlbdjG?url=http://www.przestepczosczorganizowana.republika.pl/praw_pliki/historia_prawa/Kodeks_karny_1932r.pdf |archive-date=2013-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Except during the [[Germany|German]] occupation during [[World War II|the Second World War]], this law was in effect from 1932 to 1956. In Nazi Germany, which included territories of Poland 1939-1945, the penalties for abortion were increased, especially for providing an abortion to an "Aryan" woman. Abortion was permitted if the foetus was deformed or disabled. In 1956 the [[Sejm]] legalised abortion in cases where the woman was experiencing "difficult living conditions". The interpretation of the change in the law varied from a restrictive interpretation, in the late 1950s, to one in where abortion was allowed on request, in the 1960s and 1970s. It was not uncommon that women from countries where abortions were restricted, such as Sweden, travelled to Poland to carry out abortions which were accessible and affordable there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfsu.se/sv/Sex-och-politik/Fokus-SRHR/Ratten-till-abort/Polenaffaren/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830060806/http://www.rfsu.se/sv/Sex-och-politik/Fokus-SRHR/Ratten-till-abort/Polenaffaren/ |archivedate=2010-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedural requirements needed for obtaining a legal abortion were changed several times over the years, in 1956, 1959, 1969, 1981 and 1990. The most important change was that of 1990, after the end of Communist rule, when Ordinance of 30 April 1990 made access to abortion more difficult. A major change came in 1993, when the law was further tightened, removing entirely the "difficult living conditions" as a ground for abortions. As such, abortions could be legally obtained only in cases of serious threat to the life or health of the pregnant woman, as attested by two physicians, cases of rape or incest confirmed by a prosecutor, and cases in which prenatal tests, confirmed by two physicians, demonstrated that the foetus was seriously and irreversibly damaged. This law remains in place today.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/poland.doc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern debate===
{{See|Religion in Poland|Catholic Church in Poland}}
Poland is a country strongly influenced by [[Roman Catholicism]], and religion often influences politics and social views. Abortion is a controversial topic in Polish politics. The question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment was one of the reasons for the split in the [[Law and Justice]] (PiS) party and the creation of [[Prawica Rzeczypospolitej]], led by [[Marek Jurek]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Law and Justice, abbreviated to '''PiS''', is a [[national conservatism|national-conservative]],&lt;ref name="Ashgate"&gt;{{Citation |first1= Vít |last1=Hloušek |first2=Lubomír |last2=Kopeček |title= Origin, Ideology and Transformation of Political Parties: East-Central and Western Europe Compared |publisher=Ashgate |year= 2010 |page= 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"&gt;{{Citation |first=Wolfram |last= Nodsieck |title=Poland |work=Parties and Elections in Europe |url= http://parties-and-elections.eu/poland.html |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]]&lt;ref name="Hierlemann"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Dominik Hierlemann |title=Lobbying der katholischen Kirche: Das Einflussnetz des Klerus in Polen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83aABwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=pis+christdemokratisch&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=2005|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-3531146607|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unentschlossene als Zünglein an der Waage|url=http://orf.at/stories/2279771/2279772/|website=News ORF|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of political parties in Poland|political party in Poland]]. With 237 seats in the [[Sejm]] and 66 in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], it is currently the largest party in the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|Polish parliament]].

In June 2011, Polish pro-life NGOs collected over 500,000 signatures for a proposed bill to ban abortion in Poland altogether. The bill, while rejected by a majority of the MPs, got enough support to be sent to a Sejm committee in order to be subject to further amendments. The move was criticised by two right-wing opposition parties, Law and Justice and [[Poland Comes First]], which expressed their support for the bill. The left-wing [[Democratic Left Alliance]] pursues a pro-choice policy and was against the bill. The ruling [[Civic Platform]], while considering itself in favour of the current legislation on abortion in Poland, was divided on the matter; more than 60 of the party's MPs voted in favour of the bill.&lt;ref name="2011 bill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medindia.net/news/Poland-Moves-One-Step-Closer-to-Passing-Abortion-Law-87174-1.htm|title=Poland Moves One Step Closer to Passing Abortion Law|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed abortion ban ==
In September 2015, a civil initiative to introduce a complete ban on abortion was rejected in [[Sejm]]. 178 of MPs backed the measure, while 206 voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wbj.pl/sejm-rejects-citizens-initiative-to-ban-abortion/|title=Sejm rejects citizens’ initiative to ban abortion|newspaper=WBJ|language=en-us|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Polish organizations proposed amended legislation to ban abortion in all cases except to save the woman's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21697016-proposed-ban-pits-pro-choice-women-against-government-and-church-no-exceptions|title=No exceptions|date=2016-04-16|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill included penalties to abortion providers with up to five years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/18/why-would-poland-make-its-already-strict-abortion-law-draconian/|title=Why would Poland make its already strict abortion law draconian?|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed and was debated in Sejm, beginning 22 September 2016. The Sejm voted with majority in favour of continuing work on the bill.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A competing bill, proposing liberalisation of abortion laws and also supported by a civil initiative that succeeded in gathering the required number of signatures, was rejected outright in the same session of Sejm.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2016/09/23/polen-abtreibung-verbot_n_12152186.html|title=Polnisches Parlament will Abtreibungen komplett verbieten|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the law had passed, Poland's abortion restrictions would have mirrored those of [[Malta]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], the two countries in Europe with the harshest restrictions on abortion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37540139|title=Black Monday: Polish women strike against abortion ban|date=2016-10-03|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Protest ===
[[File:Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk 2016 10 01.jpg|[[Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk]] of the [[Razem]] National Board during the 2016 protests against a total ban on abortion|thumb]]
On 22 September 2016, on the day when the bill to ban abortion was debated in Sejm, the  [[Razem]] party organized a demonstration called "Czarny Protest" ("Black Protest"), initiated by party member Małgorzata Adamczyk. This was part of a larger campaign, in which people published selfies in black clothing in [[social media]], [[hashtag|tagged]] #czarnyprotest (#blackprotest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlamentarny.pl/wydarzenia/zaostrzenie-prawa-aborcyjnego-czarny-protest-partii-razem,14429.html|title=Zaostrzenie prawa aborcyjnego?

Thousands of people took part in the protests in various parts of Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wroclaw.partiarazem.pl/2016/09/25/czarnyprotest-we-wroclawiu/|title=#CzarnyProtest we Wrocławiu|date=25 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetakrakowska.pl/wiadomosci/krakow/a/czarny-protest-na-rynku-glownym-w-krakowie-pieklo-kobiet-trwa-zdjecia-wideo,10667034/|title=Czarny protest na Rynku Głównym w Krakowie. "Piekło kobiet trwa" [ZDJĘCIA, WIDEO]|first=Nicole|last=Makarewicz|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2016, a large protest also took place near the Sejm building, organized by [[Barbara Nowacka]] of Inicjatywa Polska, who had collected signatures under a citizens' bill to liberalize the Polish abortion law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pb.pl/4635579,80908,czarny-protest-przed-sejmem|title=Czarny protest przed Sejmem|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 October 2016, thousands of Polish women went on strike to oppose the proposed legislation for a total ban on abortion, called "Czarny Poniedziałek" ("Black Monday"), originally proposed in a [[Facebook]] post by Polish actress [[Krystyna Janda]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114883,20746998,kobiety-chca-strajkowac-ws-aborcji-wykladowca-uw-napisala.html|title=Janda wezwała kobiety do strajku i się zaczęło.

By 5 October 2016, politicians were distancing themselves from the proposed legislation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On 6 October, lawmakers voted the bill down with plans to present a counterproposal from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/welt/5097208/Polnisches-Parlament-kippt-voelliges-Abtreibungsverbot|title=Polnisches Parlament kippt völliges Abtreibungsverbot|date=6 October 2016|website=Die Presse|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine included [[Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk]] of the [[Razem]] party and [[Barbara Nowacka]] of Inicjatywa Polska, on its annual list of the [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers|100 most influential global thinkers]] for their role in organizing protests against a total ban on abortion in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gt.foreignpolicy.com/2016/profile/agnieszka-dziemianowicz-bak-and-barbara-nowacka?dc56681632=&amp;b5a58a9b9d= |title=Foreign Policy's Annual List of the 100 Top Global Thinkers |publisher=Foreign Policy |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Forbes]] magazine included [[Marcelina Zawisza]] on its annual [[Europe]]an [[Forbes 30 Under 30]] list in the "Law &amp; Policy" category for her role as a co-founder of Razem and one of the organizers of "black protest".&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/marcelina-zawisza/?list=30under30-europe-law-policy |title=Marcelina Zawisza

This protest inspired a similar event in Ireland, [[Strike 4 Repeal]], to repeal the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eight Amendment]] which bans abortion in nearly all cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/thousands-march-against-eighth-amendment-in-dublin-1.3002375|title=Thousands march against Eighth Amendment in Dublin|date=8 March 2017|first1=Elaine|last1=Edwards|first2=Rachel|last2=Flaherty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latest poll on abortion by the [[CBOS]] Public Opinion Research Center, 69% of Poles view abortion as immoral and unacceptable, 14% of Poles are ambivalent towards it and 14% view it as acceptable. Half of Poles oppose the right to abortion, but only one in seven (14%) supports the complete ban of all abortions, while more than one-third (36%) believe there should be exceptions. At the same time, almost half (45%) think that abortion should be permitted. In this group, 7% support abortion without restrictions, and 38% would like to see some restrictions to abortion rights.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Surveys indicate a conservative turn in the 1990s. Although the supporters of legal abortion prevailed, the difference continuously narrowed. In 2006, when the discussion about introducing a constitutional ban on abortion was publicly conducted, the opponents of legal abortion were for the first time more numerous than supporters of abortion rights. At present the proportions have returned to 2007 levels, when both groups were about equal in size.

Most Poles accept abortion in cases when it is legal under current law. The support for abortion rights when mother's life is in danger is almost universal (87%). Over three-quarters of respondents think that it should be available for women whose pregnancy threatens their health (78%), or was caused by rape or incest (78%). Three-fifths (60%) support the right to abortion if it is known that the child would be handicapped.

The support for legal abortion in cases when it is currently banned is much lower. About a quarter think that it should be legal if the woman is in a difficult material (26%) or personal (23%) situation. Almost one in five respondents (18%) think abortion should be legal if a woman does not want to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbos.pl/PL/publikacje/public_opinion/2010/07_2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll from 2013 showed that 49% of Poles support current legislation on abortion, 34% think it should be liberalised and 9% think it should be more restrictive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fakty.interia.pl/polska/news-cbos-wiekszosc-polakow-popiera-obecne-prawo-dotyczace-aborcj,nId,926768|title=CBOS: Większość Polaków popiera obecne prawo dotyczące aborcji|first=|last=INTERIA.PL|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBOS poll from 2013 found that 75% of Poles think abortion is "always wrong and can never be justified". Only 7% thought there was "nothing wrong with it and could always be justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2013/K_111_13.PDF |title=Wartości i normy |date=August 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=CBOS |author=Rafał Boguszewski |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBOS poll from February 2014 found that a majority (65%) found abortion morally inappropriate and only 27% found it appropriate, a drop of 4% in comparison to a 2009 poll.&lt;ref name="CBOS Feb 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2014/K_015_14.PDF |title=RELIGIJNOŚĆ A ZASADY MORALNE |date=February 2014 |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=CBOS |author=Rafał Boguszewski |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CBOS poll from November 2014 found that a majority (55%) of Poles oppose abortion on request, with only 37% supporting it. Furthermore, 71% of Poles believe that abortion on request is inappropriate, with 20% thinking it is appropriate.&lt;ref name="CBOS Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2014/K_153_14.PDF |title=PRAWO A MORALNOŚĆ – OPINIE O ZACHOWANIACH KONTROWERSYJNYCH SPOŁECZNIE |date=November 2014 |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=CBOS |author=Natalia Hipsz |language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Pew Research poll from 2017, 8% of Polish respondents believed abortion should be legal in all cases and 33% that it should be legal in most cases. On the other hand, 38% believed that it should be illegal in most cases and 13% that it should be illegal in all cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe-Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
In Poland, the vast majority of abortions takes place illegally, as obtaining a legal abortion is very difficult, both due to the restrictive legal grounds and because of many doctors refusing to perform lawful abortions due to being [[conscientious objectors]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/06/world/europe/ap-eu-poland-abortion.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of illegal abortions per year put the numbers between 10,000 and 150,000, compared to only 1,000 - 2,000 legal abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37449903|title=Poland's tussle over abortion ban|date=6 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/21/stop-abortion-law-crackdown-poland-reproductive-rights|title=Stop this crackdown on abortion in Poland|date=21 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 July 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study even estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Polish women terminate their pregnancies each year, with 10 to 15% of them estimated to seek their abortion abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/138222/thesis_Ewa_Hirvonen.pdf?sequence=1|title=Polish Abortion Tourism|date=6 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those women going abroad, Germany, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic are among the more popular destinations for abortions, with the UK, Austria, and Ukraine other countries women travel to for abortions.&lt;ref name="2018 CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/23/europe/poland-abortion-bill-germany-intl/index.html|title=As Poland mulls new abortion bill, women head to Germany|publisher=|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/30/how-polands-far-right-government-is-pushing-abortion-underground|title=How Poland’s far-right government is pushing abortion underground|date=6 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the strict legislation and the [[conservative]] political discourse, Poland has one of the lowest fertility rates in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00199&amp;plugin=1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abram Salmon Benenson''' (1914 – December 15, 2003) was an authority in [[public health]], [[preventive medicine]], [[military medicine]], and "shoe-leather" [[epidemiology]]. He was best known as the editor-in-chief (1970 to 1995) for the ''[[Control of Communicable Diseases Manual]]'' of the [[American Public Health Association]]. His tenure as editor was so lengthy that the manual was often known as the "Benenson Book".

==Biography==
Benenson graduated from [[Cornell Medical School]] in [[New York City]] and interned for 3 years before entering the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Medical Corps]]. He earned board certifications in [[pathology]], [[preventive medicine]] and [[public health]], and [[microbiology]]. His military career included assignments as commanding officer, [[Tropical Research Medical Laboratory]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], and as director of Experimental Medicine, [[Camp Detrick]], Maryland; of Division of Communicable Disease and Immunology at the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR); of the [[Pakistan–Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) [[Cholera Research Laboratory]] in [[Dacca]], [[Bangladesh]], and of the [[Gorgas Memorial Laboratory]] in [[Panama]]. He retired from the military in 1962 as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].

Benenson then served on numerous commissions and committees throughout his long civilian career, for which his expertise in [[smallpox]], [[cholera]], [[vaccines]], and [[biological warfare]] was utilized to make public health policy decisions at both state and federal levels. Highlights of his 60-year medical career included involvement in the eradication of smallpox (1979); the development of the [[jet injector]] for vaccines and of [[oral rehydration]] for the victims of debilitating diarrhea; [[AIDS]], cholera, and laboratory technology.  He subsequently held academic positions at the [[Jefferson Medical College]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; the Department of Community Medicine, [[University of Kentucky College of Medicine]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]; and the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the [[San Diego State University College of Health &amp; Human Services|Graduate School of Public Health]] at [[San Diego State University]] in California.

==Awards and honors==
*Joseph E. Smadel Memorial lecture (1981)
*Commander's Award for Civilian Service (1983)
*K. F. Meyer Gold-Headed Cane from the American Veterinary Epidemiological Society (1984).
*Distinguished Civilian Service Award (1990)

The '''Antwerp Water Works''' (Dutch: Antwerpse Water Werken) or '''AWW''' produces [[water]] for the city of [[Antwerp]] ([[Belgium]]) and its surroundings. The AWW has a yearly production of {{convert|150,000,000|m3|abbr=on}} and a revenue of 100 million [[euro]].

==History==
Between 1832 and 1892, Antwerp was struck every ten to fifteen years by a major [[cholera]] epidemic which each time claimed a few thousand lives and lasted for about two years.&lt;ref&gt;Velle K. Gevolgen van de blauwe dood. De cholera in België. Tijdschr Geschiedenis der Geneeskd 1997; 4: 95-105.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 the [[cholera]] epidemic infected about 5000 people and about 3000 people died.&lt;ref&gt;Standaert OL. De cholera in Antwerpen. Tijdschr Geschiedenis der Geneeskd 1997; 4: 126-36&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1861 and 1867 several propositions were done for a water supply for Antwerp. In 1873, under mayor [[Leopold De Wael]], it was decided that a concession should be granted to secure the water supply of the city.

On 25 June 1873, a concession of 50 years was granted to the English engineers, Joseph Quick from [[London]], together with John Dick, to organize the water supply of Antwerp. Due to a lack of funds and a dispute between the partners this venture stranded. In 1879, the English engineering company [[Easton &amp; Anderson]] took over the yards and the concession.&lt;ref&gt;W. Van Craenenbroeck, ‘Easton &amp; Anderson and the water supply of Antwerp (Belgium)’, Industrial Archaeology Review 20 (1998) 105-116&lt;/ref&gt; Within two years they succeeded in finishing the work. An exploitation society was established: the ''Antwerp Waterworks Company Limited'', a society according to English law which would be in charge of the exploitation from 1881 up to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;W. Anderson, ‘The Antwerp Waterworks’, in: Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers 72 (1883), 24-83&lt;/ref&gt;

The water was won from the [[Nete River|Nete]] river at the bridge of [[Mechelen|Walem]]. It was purified according to an original method: an iron filter. In the period 1881 up to 1908 the system was repaired repeatedly, until eventually a new method of filtration was chosen which was a combination of fast with slow sand filtration. This method of filtration is still being used today for the treatment of a large part of the raw material, now water from the [[Albert Canal]].

In 1930, the concession came to an end, as no agreement could be reached with the English owners concerning a new construction in which the municipalities surrounding Antwerp would be included. The city of Antwerp took over the company and founded a mixed intermunicipal company (private and public participation) in which the English Waterworks kept a minority participation. The remaining shares were in the hands of the city of Antwerp and the surrounding municipalities of [[Berchem]], [[Boechout]], [[Borgerhout]], [[Deurne, Belgium|Deurne]], [[Edegem]], [[Ekeren]], [[Hoboken (Antwerp)|Hoboken]], [[Hove]], [[Mortsel]], [[Kontich]] and [[Wilrijk]]. The English withdrew from the company in 1965. In the same year a new production site in [[Ranst|Oelegem]] was established and a new office building in Antwerp. During the dry summer of 1976 it became clear that the reserve capacity needed to be expanded and in 1982 the reservoir of [[Ranst|Broechem]] was inaugurated. The second concession ended after 53 years, so in 1983 a new concession to the AWW was granted.

In 2003 [[Brabo Industrial Water Solutions]] (BIWS) started, a [[consortium]] with [[Ondeo Industrial Solutions]], to provide water tailored for the industry. In 2004 the RI-ANT project started (together with [[Aquafin]]), which takes over the management and the maintenance of the [[sewerage]] network of Antwerp.

      <comment>Took out a sentence that was very misleading - it did not make clear that the number referred to metastatic breast cancer. It also did not make any sense to refer to metastatic breast cancer there. On top of that, the text states a different survival rate for this kind of cancer a few sentences down.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8788">'''Cancer survival rates''' vary by the type of [[cancer]], stage at diagnosis, treatment given and many other factors, including country.  In general survival rates are improving, although more so for some cancers than others.  Survival rate can be measured in several ways, [[median]] [[life expectancy]] having advantages over others in terms of meaning for people involved, rather than as an [[epidemiological]] measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-15726810|title=Cancer survival: Macmillan hails major improvement|author=Adam Brimelow|date=22 November 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan report on median survival times. November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, survival rates are currently often measured in terms of 5-year survival rates, which is the percentage of people who live at least five years after being diagnosed with cancer, and relative survival rates compare people with cancer to people in the overall population.&lt;ref name="cancer.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-survival-rates.html|title=Breast Cancer Survival Rates &amp; Statistics|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of cancer are associated with high survival rates, including [[breast cancer|breast]], [[prostate cancer|prostate]], [[testicular cancer|testicular]] and [[colon cancer]]. [[brain cancer|Brain]] and [[pancreatic cancer]]s have much lower median survival rates which have not improved as dramatically over the last forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Cancer survival figures issued by the [[Office of National Statistics]], 26 May 2011 (UK)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pancreatic cancer has one of the worst survival rates of all cancers.Small cell lung cancer has a five-year survival rate of 4% according to Cancer Centers of America's Website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancercenter.com/lung-cancer/statistics/&lt;/ref&gt; The American Cancer Society reports 5-year relative survival rates of over 70% for women with stage 0-III breast cancer with a 5-year relative survival rate close to 100% for women with stage 0 or stage I breast cancer. The 5-year relative survival rate drops to 22% for women with stage IV ([[Metastasis|metastatic]]) breast cancer.&lt;ref name="cancer.org"/&gt;

In cancer types with high survival rates, incidence is usually higher in the [[developed world]], where longevity is also greater. Cancers with lower survival rates are more common in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Global Cancer Research&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival rate trends ==
In the United States there has been an increase in the 5-year relative survival rate between people diagnosed with cancer in 1975-1977 (48.9%) and people diagnosed with cancer in 2007-2013 (69.2%); these figures coincide with a 20% decrease in cancer mortality from 1950 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Howlader N, Noone AM, Krapcho M, Miller D, Bishop K, Kosary CL, Yu M, Ruhl J, Tatalovich Z, Mariotto A, Lewis DR, Chen HS, Feuer EJ, Cronin KA (eds). SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2014, National Cancer Institute. Bethesda, MD, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2014/&lt;/nowiki&gt;, based on November 2016 SEER data submission, posted to the SEER web site, April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lung cancer ===
In males, researchers suggest that the overall reduction in cancer death rates is due in large part to a reduction in tobacco use over the last half century, estimating that the reduction in lung cancer caused by tobacco smoking accounts for about 40% of the overall reduction in cancer death rates in men and is responsible for preventing at least 146,000 lung cancer deaths in men during the time period 1991-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thun|first=Michael J|last2=Jemal|first2=Ahmedin|date=2017-04-21|title=How much of the decrease in cancer death rates in the United States is attributable to reductions in tobacco smoking?|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=15|issue=5|pages=345–347|doi=10.1136/tc.2006.017749|issn=0964-4563|pmc=2563648|pmid=16998161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breast cancer ===
The most common cancer among women in the United States is breast cancer (123.7 per 100,000), followed by lung cancer (51.5 per 100,000) and colorectal cancer (33.6 per 100,000), but lung cancer surpasses breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/data/women.htm|title=CDC - Cancer Statistics - Women|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers attribute the reduction in breast cancer mortality to improved treatment, including the increased use in [[Adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]] [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Narod|first=Steven A.|last2=Iqbal|first2=Javaid|last3=Miller|first3=Anthony B.|date=2015-09-01|title=Why have breast cancer mortality rates declined?|url=http://www.journalcancerpolicy.net/article/S2213-5383(15)00006-5/abstract|journal=Journal of Cancer Policy|language=English|volume=5|pages=8–17|doi=10.1016/j.jcpo.2015.03.002|issn=2213-5383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prostate cancer ===
The National Institute of Health (NIH) attributes the increase in the 5-year relative survival of prostate cancer (from 69% in the 1970s to 100% in 2006) to screening and diagnosis and due to the fact that men that participate in screening tend to be healthier and live longer than the average man and testing techniques that are able to detect slow growing cancer before they become life-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.nih.gov/NIHfactsheets/ViewFactSheet.aspx?csid=75|title=NIH Fact Sheets - Cancer|website=report.nih.gov|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Childhood cancer ===
The most common type of cancer among children and adolescents is [[leukemia]], followed by brain and other [[central nervous system]] tumors. Survival rates for most childhood cancers have improved, with a notable improvement in acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (the most common childhood cancer). Due to improved treatment, the 5-year survival rate for acute lymphoblastic lymphoma has increased from less than 10% in the 1960s to about 90% during the time period 2003-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/types/childhood-cancers/child-adolescent-cancers-fact-sheet|title=Cancer in Children and Adolescents|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improvements in cancer therapy ==
The improvement in survival rates for many cancers in the last half century is due to improved understanding about the causes of cancer and the availability of new treatment options, which are continually evolving. Where [[Surgical oncology|surgery]] was previously the only option for treatment, cancer is now treated with [[Radiation therapy|radiation]] and [[chemotherapy]], including [[History of cancer chemotherapy|combination chemotherapy]] that favors treatment with many drugs over just one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/history-of-cancer/cancer-treatment-chemo.html|title=Evolution of Cancer Treatments: Chemotherapy|last=|first=|date=|website=American Cancer Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Availability and access to clinical trials has also lead to more targeted therapy and improved knowledge of treatment efficacy. There are currently over 60,000 clinical trials related to cancer registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, so novel approaches to cancer treatment are continuing to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=cancer&amp;Search=Search|title=Search of: cancer - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCI lists over 100 targeted therapies that have been approved for the treatment of 26 different cancer types by the United States Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies/targeted-therapies-fact-sheet|title=Targeted Cancer Therapies|last=|first=|date=|website=National Cancer Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chronic actinic dermatitis''' (also known as "Actinic reticuloid," "Chronic photosensitivity dermatitis," "Persistent light reactivity," and "Photosensitive eczema"&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}) is a condition where a subject's skin becomes inflamed due to a reaction to sunlight or artificial light. Patients often suffer from other related conditions of the skin that cause dermatitis in response to a variety of stimuli (e.g., flowers, sunscreens, cosmetics, etc.).

Diagnosis can occur at any age, ranging from soon after birth to adulthood. A [[General Practitioner|GP]] may refer a patient to a dermatologist if the condition is not showing clear symptoms, and a variety of tests - usually completed at a hospital - can then determine the exact nature and cause of the patient's condition.

Reactions, which vary depending on the severity of the case, include rashes, flared 'bumpy' patches, affected areas being extremely hot to touch, and outbreaks shortly (or within 24 hours) after direct or indirect exposure to UVA and/or UVB light. The skin most likely reacts on the upper chest, hands and face, however it is not unlikely for reactions to happen all over the body. The patient may feel burning, stinging or throbbing sensations in these areas, which causes mild, yet uncomfortable pain in some patients. Others liken the pain and sensation to a chemical burn that doesn't go away. It is a mistake to think that the reaction is like a sunburn, it is far deeper in the skin and often requires the use of ingestible steroids as well as topical steroids in order to alleviate the condition to a degree. The best protection is to be fully covered from sunlight, even when cloudy or hazy. The use of UV-rated clothing is suggested as well as a UV-rated umbrella for outdoors.

Once affected, the symptoms may not show for several days. The symptoms can be severe burning, itching, swelling and pain in the affected areas. The areas exposed to sunlight may have the appearance of a sunburn - where clothing is worn the skin is protected. There is no known reaction to moonlight, but reflections from windows and mirrors of sunlight can still cause damage.

The '''Consortium for the Barcode of Life''' ('''CBOL''') is an international initiative dedicated to supporting the development of [[DNA barcoding]] as a global standard for species identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hebert|first1=P. D. N.|last2=Cywinska|first2=A.|last3=Ball|first3=S. L.|last4=deWaard|first4=J. R.|title=Biological identifications through DNA barcodes |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society|Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |date=7 February 2003|volume=270|issue=1512|pages=313–321|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2218|pmid=12614582|pmc=1691236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CBOL's Secretariat Office is hosted by the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, DC.  Barcoding was proposed in 2003 by Prof. Paul Hebert of the University of Guelph in Ontario as a way of distinguishing and identifying species with a short standardized gene sequence.  Hebert proposed the 648 bases of the Folmer region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome-C oxidase-1 as the standard barcode region.  Dr. Hebert is the Director of the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, and the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL), all headquartered at the University of Guelph.  The [[Barcode of Life Data Systems]] (BOLD) is also located at the University of Guelph.

CBOL was created in May 2004 with support of the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], following two meetings in 2003, also funded by the Sloan Foundation, at the Banbury Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Since then, more than 200 organizations from more than 50 countries have joined CBOL and agreed to put their barcode data in a public database.  CBOL promotes DNA barcoding through workshops, working groups, international conferences, outreach meetings to developing countries, planning meetings for barcoding projects, and production of outreach material to raise awareness of barcoding.  CBOL's Database Working Group developed the data standard that [[GenBank]], the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]], and the [[DNA Data Bank of Japan]] have endorsed.  CBOL's Plant Working Group proposed matK and rbcL as the standard barcode regions for land plants; CBOL approved this proposal in late 2005.  The Fungal Working Group has identified ITS as the best barcode region for fungi, and CBOL's Protist Working Group is analyzing candidate regions for protistan groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CBOL Protist Working Group: Barcoding Eukaryotic Richness beyond the Animal, Plant, and Fungal Kingdoms|author=

date=November 6, 2012|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001419}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  CBOL has also created [https://web.archive.org/web/20091119054648/http://connect.barcodeoflife.net/ Connect], a social network for the barcoding community.  CBOL helped to plan and launch the global campaigns to barcode all species of fish and birds, and socioeconomically important groups like fruitflies.

One of CBOL's primary contributions to the success of barcoding has been its outreach efforts to government agencies (agriculture, environment, conservation, and others) and international organizations ([[CITES]], [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]) that could benefit from barcoding.

'''Danielle Elizabeth Tumminio''' is an Episcopal priest, theologian, a certified life coach and spinning instructor, and the author of ''God and Harry Potter at Yale: Teaching Faith and Fantasy Fiction in an Ivy League Classroom''.  She was the instructor of the "Christian Theology and Harry Potter" seminar at [[Yale University]] in the spring of 2008; in 2011, she repeated the course at [[Tufts University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/books/03/25/cnnu.potter/|title=Pottermania lives on in college classrooms|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tumminio has also presented material on the intersection between theology and the [[Harry Potter]] series at the Infinitus Symposium in Orlando, Florida in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinitus2010.org/fp/revelio.html|title=Linksys wireless g driver wmp54gs|work=infinitus2010.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Portus Symposium in Dallas, Texas, in the summer of 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portus2008.org/programming.htm|title=Linksys wireless g driver wmp54gs|work=portus2008.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she chaired the panel on Harry Potter and Religion at the 2008 [[American Academy of Religion]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aarweb.org/meetings/annual_meeting/Current_Meeting/default.asp|title=Annual Meeting|work=aarweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her teaching has been praised by [[Harry Potter]] commentator [[John Granger]] on his Hogwarts Professor website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hogwartsprofessor.com/?p=361|title=Hogwarts Professor at Yale|work=Hogwarts Professor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs about Christianity and Harry Potter==
Tumminio stands in opposition to those in Christian circles who call the [[Harry Potter]] series heretical based upon the characters' use of witchcraft.  She has said that in order to consider whether they truly are heretical, Christians must analyze whether the writings of [[J.K. Rowling]] violate a number of core theological doctrines, including sin, evil, sacrifice, and grace.&lt;ref name="stephenryan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ministryvalues.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1294&amp;Itemid=125|title=Ministry Values.com - ChristianTheology and Harry Potter|author=stephen ryan|work=ministryvalues.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To that end, she offered the Yale seminar in order to offer students an opportunity for sustained discussion about the status of the series.  She later used that sustained discussion as the basis for her first book, ''God and Harry Potter at Yale: Teaching Faith and Fantasy Fiction in an Ivy League Classroom''.  She has maintained that the books are not heretical and are in fact powerful tools for teaching theology to curious academics, seekers, and faithful Christians.&lt;ref name="stephenryan"/&gt;

==Beliefs about Marriage==
In Dec 2013, Tumminio wrote a blog post&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/18/how-i-learned-to-love-polygamy/|title=How I learned to love polygamy|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for CNN citing support for the Utah Federal District Court decision of [[Brown v. Buhman]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?211cv0652-78&lt;/ref&gt; which ruled parts of Utah's laws banning polygamy to be unconstitutional, stating "I have become a supporter of them and their lifestyle, though I certainly can understand why others remain opposed...It’s a natural extension for those Christians who support same-sex marriage on theological grounds."  Criticism of her statements resulted in a clarifying statement stating she was not advocating for a change in the Episcopal Church's official position opposing polygamous marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanink.com/article/episcopal-priest-clarifies-her-support-polygamy|title=Episcopal priest clarifies her support for polygamy|work=anglicanink.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EMILY's List Australia''' is a political [[Business networking|network]] in [[Australia]] that supports [[progressivism|progressive]] women candidates seeking election to [[political office]]. EMILY's List Australia was inspired by [[EMILY's List]], a [[Political Action Committee]] with similar goals in the [[United States]].

Issues central to the organisation's support of candidates are the principles of [[Social equality|equity]], [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[reproductive rights]], and the provision of [[equal pay]] and [[childcare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilyslist.org.au/about-us/what-we-believe-in|title=What We Believe In|year=2010|work=emilyslist.org.au|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 230 EMILY's List members have been elected to state and federal Australian [[Parliament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[[EMILY's List Australia - Current Members of Parliament]]" 2013, Retrieved 2013-07-31&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in 1996 and supports candidates through directed donations, "Early Money" financial support, gender gap research and volunteer support.&lt;ref&gt;"[[EMILY's List Australia - What We Do]]".  Retrieved 2013-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 26 November 1994, at ''Fire with Fire: The [[Feminist]] Forum'' held at the [[Sydney Town Hall]], [[Joan Kirner]] mentioned the plan currently before the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|ALP National Executive]] to introduce an Australian version of the US [[Emily's List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.greenleft.org.au/article.php/article.php?id=8255 | title = Put another dime in the jukebox, baby | date = 1994-12-14 | author = Karen Fletcher | work = [[Green Left Weekly]] #171 | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[ALP National Conference]] passed an ''[[Affirmative Action]]'' Rule requiring that women be pre-selected in 35 per cent of [[winnable]] [[Legislative seat|seat]]s, in all elections, by 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilyslist.org.au/news/editorial.asp?id=118 |title=Making A Difference: How EMILY's List is working to achieve gender equity in Parliaments |date=2002-06-14 |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506074711/http://www.emilyslist.org.au/news/editorial.asp?id=118 |archivedate=6 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was at the same time as passing of the [http://www.comlaw.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/Act1.nsf/0/1B0DB7BDE7E8A341CA256F720016627A?OpenDocument Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986].  In 1995 the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] decided to form an internal version of EMILY's List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Women in Power: From [[Tokenism]] to [[Critical mass (sociodynamics)|Critical Mass]] | author = Jane S. Jaquette | journal = [[Foreign Policy]] | issue = 108 | date = Autumn 1997 | pages =23–37 | doi = 10.2307/1149087 | jstor = 1149087 | publisher = [[Washingtonpost]].Newsweek Interactive, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and in 1996 Kirner established EMILY's List Australia outside the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2005/s1396454.htm | title = Martin basking in huge election win | author = Murray McLaughlin | work = ABC | date = 2005-06-20 | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sharing Power: Women, Parliament, Democracy|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2005|isbn=0-7546-4089-2|page=181|author=Tremblay, Manon}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2007-07-30 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = The International [[Who's Who]] of Women 2002 | author = Elizabeth Sleeman | entry = Kirner, Joan Elizabeth | edition = 3rd |page=300 | year = 2001 | publisher = [[Routledge]] | isbn = 1-85743-122-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of attaining 45% female [[Member of Parliament|membership]] in both the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Australian Senate|Senate]].

The name EMILY comes from its United States equivalent and is an acronym for "Early Money Is Like Yeast"&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emilyslist.org.au/about-us/our-history|title= EMILY's List Australia - History|accessdate=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = EMILY's List and Angry White Men: [[Gender Wars]] in the Nineties| author = Marian Sawer | journal = [[Journal of Australian Studies]] | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the political saying, "Early money is like [[yeast]], because it helps to raise the [[dough]]".

In the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 Federal Election]] campaign EMILY's List donated a total of $100,000 to candidates.  Research conducted by EMILY's List and submitted to the Labor Party's national executive stated that Labor women regarded then health spokeswoman [[Julia Gillard]] as the best performer during the campaign, with then Prime Minister [[John Howard]] in second place.  Of [[Mark Latham]] their submission stated; "the most common themes were: perceived aggression, concern he had been watered down for the campaign, inexperience, constantly going on about background, glib answers, bully boy tactics of the past"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Samantha|last= Maiden|title= Gillard gets top rating by women|work= |publisher= [[The Australian]] |date=30 November 2004 |page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Federal Election campaign EMILY's List undertook Gender Gap research in six key marginal seats and undertook a targeted campaign incorporating materials along the themes of 'We Can't Trust Tony', 'Let's Make History' and 'Torpedo the Speedo'.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Karvelas (2010-08-10) "Women's group takes on Tony", ''The Australian. ''Retrieved 2013-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory elections, for the first time EMILY's List endorsed every female Labor Party candidate contesting those elections.&lt;ref&gt;"[[EMILY's List Australia - Every Woman Labor Candidate in NT Election a Member of EMILY's List]]". 2012-08-13. Retrieved 2013-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[[EMILY's List Australia - Every Woman Labor Candidate in ACT Election a Member of EMILY's List]]". 2012-07-25. Retrieved 2013-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia's first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was a founding member of EMILY's List Australia and assisted to prepare their initial constitution.  She presented the Inaugural EMILY's List Oration at Parliament House, Canberra in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Mamamia.com.au (2011-09-15) "[[Don't take women's rights for granted: Gillard]]". Retrieved 2013-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational structure==
EMILY's List Australia is run by a National Committee which includes [[Member of Parliament|parliament]]arians, volunteers and women [[Trade union|union]]ists. Although it is a [[Partisan (political)|partisan]] organisation, is not controlled by the formal structures of the ALP. At the [[States and Territories of Australia|State and Territory]] level there are "Action Groups" (ELAG) which have their own organisational structures.&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emilyslist.org.au/about_us/about_us.asp?id=13 |title=EMILY's List Australia - People |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607232848/http://www.emilyslist.org.au/about_us/about_us.asp?id=13 |archivedate=7 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne McEwen (politician)|South Australian Senator Anne McEwen]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n lawyer, poet and writer Tanja Kovac are currently the National Co-[[convenor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"[[EMILY's List - About Us]]".

'''ENRICH''' is a 125-item [[questionnaire]] for married couples that examines [[communication]], [[conflict resolution]], role relationship, financial management, expectations, sexual relationship, personality compatibility, marital satisfaction, and other personal beliefs related to marriage. It was developed by [[University of Minnesota]] family psychologist [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/people/faculty/OlsonD.asp David Olson, Ph.D.], and colleagues as a method of assessing the health of married couple relationships and is now used by over 100,000 facilitators in the United States and worldwide.

In studies of couples who completed the questionnaire, Fowers and Olson found ENRICH could predict [[divorce]] with 85% accuracy. Results from discriminant analysis indicated that using either the individual scores or couples' scores, happily married couples could be discriminated from unhappily married couples with 85-95% accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Marital and Family Therapy'', 1989, Vol. 15, No. 1, 65-79&lt;/ref&gt;

==PREPARE/ENRICH==
ENRICH has evolved into a complete online program called PREPARE/ENRICH, which also examines the beliefs of couples preparing to marry and provides couple exercises to build relationship skills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prepare-enrich.com PREPARE/ENRICH website]&lt;/ref&gt; This new program helps couples with the following:

* Identify strength and growth areas
* Explore personality traits
* Strengthen communication skills
* Resolve conflicts and reduce stress
* Compare family backgrounds
* Comfortably discuss financial issues
* Establish personal, couple, and family goals

'''Ear protection''' refers to devices used to protect the [[ear]], either externally from elements such as [[cold]], intrusion by [[water]] and other environmental conditions, debris, or specifically from [[noise]]. High levels of exposure to noise may result in [[noise-induced hearing loss]]. Measures to protect the ear are referred to as '''hearing protection''', and devices for that purpose are called [[hearing protection devices]]. In the context of work, adequate hearing protection is that which reduces noise exposure to below 85 [[A-weighting|dBA]] over the course of an average work shift of eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/reducenoiseexposure/adminppe.html|title=CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Reducing Noise Exposure, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Different types of hearing protection may be utilized to maximize hearing protection. OSHA regulations dictate whether hearing protection is required and if the company must participate in a [[hearing conservation program]].

Types of ear protection include:
*[[Earplug]]s, internal
*[[Earmuffs]], external
*[[Helmet]], covering various parts of the head, including the ears

Electronic ear protection is available as earplugs or earmuffs. Electronic earplugs detect and amplify quiet sounds while blocking loud noises. Electronic earplugs are useful in several situations such as hunters or shooters who need to protect their ears from the loud report of a hunting rifle but still need to hear the noises around them. Electronic hearing protection allows the user to carry on a normal conversation or listen for game while still blocking out external noises that can damage hearing.

'''Ella Eaton Kellogg''' (April 7, 1853 - June 14, 1920) was an American pioneer in [[dietetics]] who taught and wrote on the subject. She was educated in [[Alfred University]] (B.A. 1872, A.M. 1875); and the American School Household Economics (1909). In 1875, Kellogg visited the Battle Creek Sanitarium, became interested in the subjects of sanitation and hygiene, and a year later enrolled in the Sanitarium School of Hygiene. Later on, she joined the editorial staff of ''Good Health'' magazine, and in 1879, married Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]], superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.{{sfn|Gardner|1913|p=1350}}

Kellogg was prominently identified with the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), in 1882 being appointed national superintendent of the Department of Hygiene. Three years later, she was appointed associate superintendent of the Social Purity department of the WCTU. Out of her experiences in the Social Purity work in the WCTU, grew a pamphlet, in 1890, entitled "Talks to Girls" which enjoyed an extended circulation. Other books written by Kellogg included ''Studies in Character Building'' (1905), and ''Science in the Kitchen'' (1892). Kellogg charter member of the Michigan Woman's Press Association.{{sfn|Gardner|1913|p=1350}}

== Early life and education ==
Ella Ervilla Eaton was born in 1853, in [[Alfred (village), New York|Alfred, New York]]. She was of Puritan ancestry.  Her father, Joseph Clarke Eaton, traced his direct descent from John Eaton, an English pioneer, who, with Abigail, his wife, came to the United States from England in 1635 and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=391}} Her mother was Hannah Sophia (Coon) Eaton.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=449}}

Kellogg attended the local schools before going to [[Alfred University]], being continually in school, with the exception of one term of teaching, until her graduation at the age of 19, when she received the degree of A. L. (Laureate of Arts.). During her school life she was an active member of the Alfredian Lyceum, one of the four literary societies of the university, taking many prominent places upon the programme of its public sessions. She was also for some time one of the editors of the ''Alfred Student'', a college paper, and probably in the congenial atmosphere of these youthful experiences received her first inclination toward literary work. Being a quick and ready pupil, she was always in advance of those of her own age, and at her graduation was the youngest pupil who had ever won equal honors at that university.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=391}}

==Career==
[[File:Ella Eaton Kellogg, at her work.png|thumb|Ella Eaton Kellogg at work]]
The year following graduation was spent in teaching at a community school in [[Harmony Township, New Jersey|Harmony, New Jersey]], and then post-graduate work in the study of languages, particularly Latin, German, as well as music and drawing, and at the university commencement of 1875 she was given another degree, that of A. M. The young woman was, up to this time, planning to devote herself to teaching as a profession, but a visit to the Battle Creek Sanitarium in the summer of 1877 seems to have given an unconscious viewpoint to all her subsequent life.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=391}}

After teaching in the school for three years, she left the school in order to help her aunt, who was ill, receiving help from the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]]. During an epidemic of typhoid fever which occurred in the neighborhood during the early autumn, the number of patients being so great that trained nurses could not be obtained for them, she volunteered her services and carried safely through the disease several of the most critical cases. This experience led her to become interested in sanitary and hygienic subjects, and in the following year, she entered the Sanitarium School of Hygiene, in which she obtained a knowledge of anatomy, physiology, hygiene, and the practical care of the sick. The principal of the School of Hygiene, who was also the editor of ''Good Health'', soon discovered her capabilities, and engaged her services as an editorial assistant. On February 22, 1879, she married John Harvey Kellogg, M.D., the president and superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=391}}

At the national convention of the WCTU in [[Detroit]] in 1882, Kellogg was elected national superintendent of the department of hygiene, a position involving, among other duties, that of preparing and publishing a syllabus of lessons, together with the holding, from time to time, of numerous "health institutes" in different portions of the country.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=391}}

In 1884, was instituted the Sanitarium Experimental Kitchen, a work demanding her constant personal supervision, undertaken in the interest of dietetic reform and the cuisine of the Sanitarium, to prepare a thoroughly hygienic, yet ever-varying, attractive and appetizing menu for its guests, but which soon outgrew its bounds. From it evolved a distinct School of Domestic Economy, and an altogether new system of household cookery, besides a continued succession of cooking classes whose enthusiastic members became teachers to propagate the principles learned, and to teach a better way in diet.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=392}}
[[File:Ella Eaton Kellogg, age 60.png|thumb|Ella Eaton Kellogg, age 60]]
The following year, in 1885, Kellogg became the associate superintendent of the social purity department of the National WCTU, in connection with [[Frances E. Willard]]. Her special charge was the department of Mothers' Meetings, and to her fell the task of arranging the plans of work and the preparing of topics for study.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=392}}

She founded the School of Home Economics (later [[Battle Creek College]]). Working with the School of Domestic Economy founded by her and her husband, and other organizations, Kellogg wrote several books, including ''Science in the Kitchen''.&lt;ref name="michiganwomenshalloffame" /&gt; ''Science in the Kitchen'', an illustrated cook book of nearly 600 pages, was the outcome of the scientific and experimental investigation of Kellogg in the realm of dietetics, carried forward during a period of years. "Talks to Girls," a social purity pamphlet having a wide sale, was written in 1890.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=392}}

The Kelloggs had no children of own, but they adopted 12 children and raised several not adopted. She was one of the founders and for years manager of the Haskell Home for Orphan Children.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=449}}

Kellogg, during the year, 1892, was named chairman of the World's Fair committee on food supplies for Michigan.{{sfn|Literary Century|1893|p=392}}
She was a charter member, and president of the Michigan Women's Press Association; and a charter member of the [[American Dietetic Association]].&lt;ref name="michiganwomenshalloffame"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiganwomenshalloffame.org/Images/Kellogg,%20Ella%20Eaton.pdf|title=Ella Eaton Kellogg|website=Michigan Women's Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1920|p=n.p.}} She was a member of the household economics department of the Federation of Women's Clubs. She was a member of the WCTU, Y.W.C.A., National Congress of Mothers, American Home Economic Association, and Woman's League,{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=449}}

==Personal life==
Kellogg favored woman suffrage. In religion, she was a life long Seventh-Day Baptist. The Battle Creek Seventh Day Baptist Church in Battle Creek, Michigan was built in her honor in 1929. Her portrait hangs outside the sanctuary. She traveled in Europe, made two trips to Mexico, and visited Cuba, Puerto Rico, California, Colorado, and Florida.{{sfn|Leonard|1914|p=449}}

The '''Global Implementation Plan to End Violence Against Women and Girls''' was a recommendation from the multi-agency [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the prevention of violence against women and girls]]. The meeting was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations Commission on the Status of Women's]] multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014.

The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" formed a priority theme for its [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).]]
{{TOClimit}}

==Background==
The [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17 - 20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report that the meeting produced reflected the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] and presented key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls.] Background papers. Retrieved 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and was widely disseminated in preparation to the fifty-seventh session of CSW.

[[EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#A_global_implementation_plan_to_end_violence_against_women_and_girls|Recommendations 106 - 109]] of the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] calls for a global plan to be launched by 2015, to end violence against women and girls organised along these lines:-

'''Recommendation 109'''&lt;br /&gt;''The Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls, endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Recommendation 111'''&lt;br /&gt;''Development of the plan would require, among other things:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==United Nations Commission on the Status of Women - fifty-seventh session==
The [[United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women#Session_reports|fifty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] took place at the UN building, New York between 4 and 15 March 2013. The agreed conclusions from the session agreed the following four actions:
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening implementation of legal and policy frameworks and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing structural and underlying causes and risk factors so as to prevent violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening multisectorial services, programmes and responses to violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the evidence-base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw57/CSW57_agreed_conclusions_advance_unedited_version_18_March_2013.pdf Unedited draft.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0252-0117}} [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Final draft, pp. 1-17.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[[UN Women|UN Women's]] Executive Director [[Michelle Bachelet]] urged speedy implementation of the Agreed Conclusions saying, "The best way to honour the commitments made by Member States at the Commission is to work for implementation and accountability."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/2013/03/un-women-urges-implementation-of-historic-global-agreement-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls/ Press release from UN Women, "UN Women urges implementation of historic global agreement to end violence against women and girls", 20 March 2013.

'''Gospel Aerobics''' is a form of rhythmic [[aerobic exercise]] that uses [[gospel music]], spiritual encouragement and motivation during the routine. Both the term ‘Gospel Aerobics’ and the specific concept are the brainchild of Maryland based '''Hope Mason''' who was joined by her husband '''Marc Mason''' in making the production of the show 'Gospel Aerobics' a reality. The concept included the phrase, ‘Gospel Aerobics - Worshiping God with the whole man: Spirit, Soul and Body’, with the goal of affecting the whole man. In 1996, the now defunct Baltimore Cable Access Corporation (BCAC) the [[public access]] in [[Baltimore City]] offered training on the campus of [[Coppin State University]] to those that aspired to produce television programming in the area. In 1996, the television show entitled 'Gospel Aerobics' was produced by the couple who later went on to win an award in 1997 for the pioneering effort that aired on BCAC for 1 season. It was the first of its kind.

== Water supply and sanitation ==

{{Further information|Water supply and sanitation in Nigeria}}

Access to an improved water source stagnated at 47% of the population from 1990 to 2006, then increased to 54% in 2010. In urban areas access decreased from 80% to 65% in 2006, and then recovered to 74% in 2010.&lt;ref name="water"&gt;WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, 2010 estimates for [http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/NGA_wat.pdf water] and [http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/NGA_san.pdf sanitation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adequate sanitation is typically in the form of septic tanks, as there is no central sewerage system, except for [[Abuja]] and some areas of [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name="USAID"&gt;USAID: [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADO937.pdf Nigeria Water and Sanitation Profile], ca. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 study estimated that only 1% of Lagos households were connected to general sewers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Gandy:[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2006/papers/Gandy%20Matthew.pdf Water, Sanitation, and the Modern City: Colonial and post-colonial experiences in Lagos and Mumbai], , Human Development Report Office Occasional Paper, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== HIV/AIDS ==

{{Further information|HIV/AIDS in Nigeria}}

As of 2014 in [[Nigeria]], the [[HIV]] prevalence rate among adults ages 15–49&lt;ref name=cia_2&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html?fieldkey=2155&amp;term=HIV/AIDS%20-%20adult%20prevalence%20rate "Definitions and notes"] Accessed May 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; was 3.17 percent.&lt;ref name=cia_1&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html "HIV/AIDS - adult prevalence rate"] [[CIA World Factbook]] (2014) Accessed May 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of HIV in Nigeria varies widely by region. In some states, the epidemic is more concentrated and driven by high-risk behaviors, while other states have more generalized epidemics that are sustained primarily by multiple sexual partnerships in the general population. Youth and young adults in Nigeria are particularly vulnerable to HIV, with young women at higher risk than young men.&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepfar.gov/pepfar/press/81548.htm|title=2008 Country Profile: Nigeria|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]|date=2008|accessdate=25 August 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816141500/http://www.pepfar.gov/pepfar/press/81548.htm|archivedate=16 August 2008|df=}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many risk factors that contribute to the spread of HIV, including [[prostitution]], high-risk practices among [[migrant worker|itinerant workers]], high prevalence of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STI), clandestine high-risk heterosexual and homosexual practices, international trafficking of women, and irregular blood screening.&lt;ref name=us/&gt;

== Malaria ==

As of 2012 in Nigeria, the [[malaria]] prevalence rate was 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_nga_en.pdf?ua=1 "Nigeria-Malaria"] Accessed May 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/country-profiles/nigeria_profile.pdf?sfvrsn=14 "President's Malaria Initiative-Nigeria"] Accessed May 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A part of this data is from the [[President's Malaria Initiative]] which identifies Nigeria as a high-burden country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pmi.gov/where-we-work "Where We Work"] Accessed May 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria's branch dealing with this problem, the National Malaria Control Program, has recognized the problem and has embraced the [[World Malaria Day]] theme of "End Malaria for Good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmcp.gov.ng/ "National Malaria Control Program-Home"] Accessed May 12, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Endemic diseases ==

In 1985, an incidence of [[yellow fever]] devastated a town in Nigeria, leading to the death of 1000 people. In a span of 5 years, the epidemic grew, with a resulting rise in mortality. The vaccine for yellow fever has been in existence since the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnma.gov.ng/library/Whocares_Tomori.pdf Nigerian National Merit Award&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal and child healthcare ==
[[File:Emergency Cesarean Section.jpg|thumb|Successful emergency [[Caesarean section]] done in Nigeria.]]
The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Nigeria was 840. This is compared with 608.3 in 2008 and 473.4 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 143 and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 28.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In Nigeria the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women 1 in 23.&lt;ref name="SOWMY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sowmy/report/home.html|title=The State Of The World's Midwifery|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigeria’s [[Abortion in Nigeria|abortion laws]] make it one of the most restrictive countries regarding abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Iyioha|first1=Irehobhude O.|title=Comparative health law and policy : critical perspectives on Nigerian and global health law|date=2 November 2015|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-1-4724-3675-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food==
Nutrition, especially in the North of the country, is often poor. Since 2002 food staples are supposed to be fortified with nutrients such as vitamin A, folic acid, zinc, iodine and iron. Bill Gates said there had been “pushback” by some in Nigerian industry as this reduced profit margins. The [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] is donating $5m over four years to implement a rigorous testing regime to make sure these standards are met.  These nutrients would reach poorer children who ate mainly a cereal and beans diet at very low cost and reduce the risk of stunting.  Vitamin A would reduce the risk of death from measles or diarrhoea. In some districts 7% of children die before they reach the age of five.  Nearly half of these are attributable to malnutrition.  [[Aliko Dangote]], whose companies supply salt, sugar and flour, said there would need to be a crack down on the import of low-quality foodstuff, often smuggled into local markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nigerian food sector commits to nutrient fortification |url=https://www.ft.com/content/3a5712ca-9819-11e8-9702-5946bae86e6d?emailId=5b6873a4a1ccf60004083fa6 |accessdate=21 September 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
[[Traffic congestion]] in Lagos, [[environmental pollution]] and [[noise pollution]] are major health issues.

== Road traffic accident in [[Nigeria]] ==
Every year the lives of approximately 1.25 million people are cut short as a result of a road traffic crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a disability as a result of their injury. Road traffic injuries cause considerable economic losses to individuals, their families, and to nations as a whole. These losses arise from the cost of treatment as well as lost productivity for those killed or disabled by their injuries, and for family members who need to take time off work or school to care for the injured. Road traffic crashes cost most countries 3% of their gross domestic product. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/road-safety&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 3 400 people die on the world's roads every day and tens of millions of people are injured or disabled every year. Children, pedestrians, cyclists and older people are among the most vulnerable of road users. WHO works with partners - governmental and nongovernmental - around the world to raise the profile of the preventability of road traffic injuries and promote good practice related to addressing key behaviour risk factors – speed, drink-driving, the use of motorcycle helmets, seat-belts and child restraints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_traffic/en/]WHO&lt;/ref&gt;


In Africa, Nigeria has the highest record of road traffic accident. Sumaila (2001) observed that road
traffic accidents in Nigeria have claimed more lives than deaths resulting from all communicable diseases put together including the dreaded Acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The study of WHO in 2013 showed that more than one in four deaths in Africa region occurs on Nigerian road.&lt;ref&gt;Impact Assessment of Road Traffic Accidents on

With the continued dangerous trend of road [[traffic collision]] in Nigeria then, which placed it as one of the most road traffic accident (RTA) prone countries worldwide (the most in Africa) in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by traffic-related death rate]]. Wikipedia. 2018-04-11.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/TableA2.pdf?ua=1]. World Health Organization. Retrieved 2018-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;, the Nigerian government saw the need to establish the present [[Federal Road Safety Corps]] in 1988 to address the carnage on the highways.

===Level and Trend of Road Traffic Accidents in Nigeria===

The increase in level of motorization coupled with near collapse of rail system and high cost of air
travels in Nigeria have put quite a lot of pressure on the country’s road transport industry. This consequently has
caused increased accident and fatality rate in the country. In absolute term there were 13262 traffic accidents in
2012 against 164.8 million population and 13539090 registered vehicles, indicating a rate of 8 accidents per
100000 population or 98 accidents per 100000 registered vehicles. &lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ab20/47eebaff1c2ecb602499463386be14c6f331.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapted from ''Quest Journals''
''Journal of Research in Humanities and Social Science'' 


The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 456 people died and 3404 others were injured in 826 accidents recorded nationwide in January (2018).

The FRSC stated this in its CCC report for January signed by its Corps Marshal, Boboye Oyeyemi.&lt;ref&gt;premiumtimes [https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/264776-nigeria-records-456-road-accident-deaths-in-one-month.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Causes of road traffic accidents ===

The causes of road traffic accidents depend on a list of factors which can be broadly divided into:
*(i). Vehicle operator or driver factors
*(ii). Vehicle factors
*(iii). Road pavement condition factors
*(iv). Environmental factors. 

=== The UN Sustainable Development Goals ===

In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that includes 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind”, the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. &lt;ref&gt;''UN SDG'' [https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
*The Target 3.6 under goal 3 is designed specifically to addresses the issue of road traffic accident: By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents §
The Federal Government of Nigeria has put some mechanisms in place to ensure implementation of the SDGs in the country&lt;ref&gt; punch newspaper assessing-sdgs-implementation-in-nigeria [https://punchng.com/assessing-sdgs-implementation-in-nigeria/]&lt;/ref&gt; however, Nigeria is still far from achieving this goal.

==Traditional/Alternative medicine==

As recent reports have shown, in addition to the many benefits there are also risks associated with the different types of Traditional Medicine / Complimentary or alternative Medicine. Although consumers today have widespread access to various TM/CAM treatments and therapies, they often do not have enough information on what to check when using TM/CAM in order to avoid unnecessary harm.&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/s5525e/s5525e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. While traditional medicine has a lot to contribute to the health and economy, much harm has resulted from unregulated sale and misuse of traditional/alternative medicine and herbs in the country and has significantly delayed patients' seeking professional healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/excessive-intake-of-local-herbs-causes-kidney-damage-expert.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
For the first half of the twentieth century Uruguay and Argentina had the most advanced standards of medical care in Latin America. Military rule from 1973 to 1985 adversely affected standards in Uruguay.  More resources went to military hospitals, which were open only to relatives of the members of the armed forces.  Total health care spending in 1984 was 8.1% of GDP, and this included about 7.5% of household spending but 400,000 people had neither state nor private health care coverage. In 1987 there were seven major public hospitals in [[Montevideo]]. About half the interior departments had a hospital; the others had a centro auxiliar. Altogether there were about 9,505 hospital beds in the public system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uruguay: A Country Study. |url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/41.htm |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=Library of Congress |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are private health-insurance companies in Uruguay. The public healthcare system has hospitals and clinics spread across the country. Private-hospitals have membership plans. The [[mutualista]] model is popular among expatriates. There is a monthly membership fee and a small [[co-payment]] payable to see a doctor or have a test.   There may be age and pre-existing condition guidelines for accepting or not accepting non-employed members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quality Health Care at an Affordable Price in Uruguay |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/internationallivingcom/quality-health-care-at-an_b_5621826.html |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=Huffington Post |date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 58.9% of the inhabitants of Montevideo were covered by mutualistas in 1971 and 11.8% had the official health card from the Ministry of Public Health which entitled them to free health care. 16.6% had no coverage of any kind. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uruguay: A Country Study. |url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/41.htm |accessdate=26 November 2018 |publisher=Library of Congress |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Purpose==
[[Neuroblastoma]] is the most common type of solid [[tumor]] which afflicts children.  Three different [[protein]]s have been implicated in the production of neuroblastoma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">'''Identity preservation''' is the practice of tracking the details of agricultural shipments so that the specific characteristics of each shipment is known.  '''Identity preserved''' ('''IP''') is the designation given to such bulk commodities marketed in a manner that isolates and preserves the identity of a shipment, presumably because of unique characteristics that have value otherwise lost through commingling during normal storage, handling and shipping procedures.  The concept of IP has been accorded greater importance with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into agriculture.

Technical and managerial techniques are used to track and document the paths that agricultural products move in the production process.  A fully integrated IP system might track and document a commodity’s seed characteristics, initial planting, [[growing conditions]], [[harvesting]], [[shipping]], [[Food storage|storage]], [[Food processing|processing]], [[packaging]], and ultimate sale to the consumer.  Separating [[organic product]]s from conventionally raised ones is one type of IP system.  IP systems are a central component of [[value-chain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Identity-preserved systems: a reference handbook | author=Dennis Strayer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Involuntary treatment''' (also referred to by proponents as '''assisted treatment''' and by critics as '''forced drugging''') refers to medical treatment undertaken without the [[consent]] of the person being treated. In almost all circumstances, involuntary treatment refers to [[psychiatric]] treatment administered despite an individual's objections. These are typically individuals who have been diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] and are deemed by a court or by two doctors to be a danger to themselves or to others.

==Involuntary treatment and International Human Rights Law==

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, General comment No. 1 (2014) on Article 12: Equal recognition before the law, specifies that forced treatment, among other discriminatory practices must be abolished in order to ensure that full legal capacity is restored to persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRPD/C/GC/1&amp;Lang=en |title=Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Eleventh session 31 March–11 April 2014 General comment No. 1 (2014) Article 12: Equal recognition before the law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In 1975, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' that involuntary hospitalization and/or treatment violates an individual's [[civil rights]]. The individual must be exhibiting behavior that is a danger to themselves or others and a court order must be received for more than a short (e.g. 72-hour) detention. The treatment must take place in the least restrictive setting possible. This ruling has severely limited involuntary treatment and hospitalization in the United States. The statutes vary somewhat from state to state.

In 1979, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] established in ''[[Rogers v. Okin]]'' that a competent patient committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]] has the right to refuse treatment in non-emergency situations. The case of ''[[Rennie v. Klein]]'' established that an involuntarily committed individual has a constitutional right to refuse psychotropic medication without a court order. ''[[Rogers v. Okin]]'' established the patient's right to make treatment decisions.

Additional U.S. Supreme Court decisions have added more restraints to involuntary commitment and treatment. ''[[Foucha v. Louisiana]]'' established the unconstitutionality of the continued commitment of an insanity acquittee who was not suffering from a mental illness. In ''[[Jackson v. Indiana]]'' the court ruled that a person [[adjudicative competence|adjudicated incompetent]] could not be indefinitely committed. In ''[[Perry v. Louisiana]]'' the court struck down the forcible medication of a prisoner for the purposes of rendering him competent to be executed. In ''[[Riggins v. Nevada]]'' the court ruled that a defendant had the right to refuse psychiatric medication while he was on trial, given to mitigate his psychiatric symptoms. ''[[Sell v. United States]]'' imposed stringent limits on the right of a lower court to order the forcible administration of antipsychotic medication to a criminal defendant who had been determined to be incompetent to stand trial for the sole purpose of making them competent and able to be tried. In ''[[Washington v. Harper]]'' the Supreme Court upheld the involuntary medication of [[correctional facility]] inmates only under certain conditions as determined by established policy and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/legal/l1990/Harper.htm |title=Washington et al., Petitioners v. Walter Harper |accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents and detractors==
[[File:Protest graffiti against TSO Torino.jpg|thumb|Protest graffiti against Involuntary treatment, [[Turin]]; ''TSO = MORTE'' means ''Involuntary treatment = Death'']]
Supporters of involuntary treatment include organizations such as the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI), the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and the [[Treatment Advocacy Center]].

Some civil and human rights activists, [[Anti-psychiatry]] groups, and members of the [[psychiatric survivors movement]], vigorously oppose involuntary treatment on [[human rights]] grounds. Critics, such as the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], have denounced the strong [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]] and [[socioeconomic]] [[biases]] in forced treatment orders.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Lawyers for the Public Interest]], Inc., "Implementation of Kendra's Law is Severely Biased" (April 7, 2005) [http://nylpi.org/pub/Kendras_Law_04-07-05.pdf http://nylpi.org/pub/Kendras_Law_04-07-05.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628052901/http://nylpi.org/pub/Kendras_Law_04-07-05.pdf |date=28 June 2007 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ NYCLU Testimony On Extending Kendra's La NYCLU Testimony On Extending Kendra's Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of Scientology]] is also aggressively opposed to involuntary treatment. In the [[United States]] case law rulings have almost eliminated the legal right to involuntarily treat an adult patient or incarcerated inmate in non-emergency situations{{dubious|date=December 2012}}, starting in 1975 with ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'', ''[[Rennie v. Klein]]'' in 1978 and ''[[Rogers v. Okin]]'' in 1979, to name a few. However, the involuntary treatment of minors remains legally permitted in most states.

==Mental health law==
All states in the U.S. allow for some form of involuntary treatment for mental illness for short periods of time under emergency conditions, although criteria vary. Since the late 1990s, a growing number of states have adopted ''Assisted Outpatient Commitment (AOC)'' laws.

Under assisted [[outpatient commitment]], people committed involuntarily can live outside the [[psychiatric hospital]], sometimes under strict conditions including reporting to mandatory psychiatric appointments, taking psychiatric drugs in the presence of a nursing team, and testing medication blood levels. Forty-five states presently allow for outpatient commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/get-help/know-the-laws-in-your-state|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of involuntary medication==
A 2014 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] systematic review of the literature found that compulsory community treatment "results in no significant difference in service use, social functioning or quality of life compared with standard voluntary care."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/CD004408/SCHIZ_compulsory-community-and-involuntary-outpatient-treatment-for-people-with-severe-mental-disorders Compulsory community and involuntary outpatient treatment for people with severe mental disorders.] Kisely SR, Campbell LA. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2014, Issue 12. Art. No.: CD004408. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004408.pub4&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 review found that as many as 48% of respondents did not agree with their treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katsakou C, Priebe S |title=Outcomes of involuntary hospital admission—a review |journal= [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] |volume=114 |issue=4 |pages=232–41 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16968360 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2006.00823.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0001-690X&amp;date=2006&amp;volume=114&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a majority of people retrospectively agreed that involuntary medication had been in their best interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5360">'''Lee Allen''' (1910 – May 5, 2006), born '''Edwin Lee Allen''', was an American Regionalist painter, a muralist, and a [[medical illustrator]],and an acclaimed ophthalmic photographer and [[ocularist]].

==Early years==
Lee Allen was born in [[Muscatine, Iowa]], then moved to [[Des Moines]], where he graduated from East High School in 1928. He studied briefly with Iowa artist [[Charles Atherton Cumming]] at the [[Cumming School of Art]], housed then on the upper floor of the Des Moines Public Library. In 1880, Cumming had launched the art department at [[Cornell College]] ([[Mount Vernon, Iowa]]) and, in 1909, had become the founding head of the art department at the [[University of Iowa]] ([[Iowa City]]), a position he continued to hold while also teaching in Des Moines. Encouraged by Cumming most likely, Allen enrolled in the School of Art at the University of Iowa in 1929. In 1932 and 1933 Allen was a student at the [[Stone City Art Colony]] and studied under [[Grant Wood]].

==Murals==
Iowa artist [[Grant Wood]] became internationally known in 1930, with the completion of his painting called ''American Gothic'', and in 1934, he was invited to join the faculty at the University of Iowa. Wood also served as the Iowa director for the [[Public Works of Art Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/grant-wood-collection-9365/more |title=Grant Wood collection, 1930–1983 |website=Archives of American Art |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=2015-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in connection with which he called on Allen to assist him with various projects. Afterwards, in 1935, Allen went to Mexico, where he studied mural painting with [[Diego Rivera]], to whom he had been introduced by Grant Wood. When he returned to Iowa, he received two additional government commissions from the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture|Section of Fine Arts]] of the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] to make indoor murals for new post offices in two small Iowa communities. In 1938, Allen created a mural titled “Soil Erosion and Control” for the post office in Onawa, Iowa. In 1940, he produced a second mural called “Conservation of Wild Life” for the post office in Emmetsburg, Iowa.

==Medical illustration==
In 1937, while looking for full-time employment, Allen accepted an appointment at the College of Medicine at the University of Iowa as a medical illustrator.  He remained in that position for 39 years, during which he also published various scholarly papers about medical illustration as applied to [[ophthalmology]].  Lee retired from the U of I in 1976 with the rank of Emeritus, after which he and David Bulgarelli opened a private ocularist practice, Iowa Eye Prosthetics, Inc., in Coralville, Iowa, continuing the ocularist apprenticeship program.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wong and M. Fishman. “Lee Allen: The Man, The Legend” in ''Journal of Ophthalmic Photography''. 12(2):51-67 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macular degeneration==
Around 1988, while in retirement, Allen began to experience symptoms of [[macular degeneration]], an incurable dysfunction that had resulted in functional blindness for millions of senior citizens. In response, he made a series of diary-like drawings of the progression of his illness and its treatment with laser surgery. In 2000, at age 90, he produced a book about his twelve-year introspective watch of macular degeneration, titled ''The Hole in My Vision: An Artist’s View of His Own Macular Degeneration''. The book contains his drawings of the changes in his vision, his annotations, with other observations by his medical colleagues and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Allen, James C. Folk and H. Stanley Thompson. ''The Hole in My Vision: An Artist’s View of His Own Macular Degeneration''. Iowa City IA: Penfield Press, 2000. Includes bibliography of his publications. {{ISBN|978-1-57216-084-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
During his life, Lee Allen served as president of the Association of Medical Illustrators, he was one of ten founding members and the first president of the Ophthalmic Photographers' Society 1969, and he also served as president of the American Society of Ocularists. He died in Iowa City in 2006 at age 95.

The '''Manchester operation''' or simply '''"Fothergill operation"''' is a technique used in [[gynecology]] operations. It is an operation for [[uterine prolapse]]. Its purpose is to reduce the [[cystourethrocele]] and to reposition the uterus within the [[human pelvis|pelvis]].

STEPS OF FOTHERGILL-

# Preliminary dilatation and curettage
# Amputation of cervix
# strengthening the cervix by suturing cut end of Mackenrodt ligament in front of cervix
# Anterior colporrhaphy
# Posterior colpoperineorrhaphy

==Success Rate==
Success rate of Manchester operation was re-evaluated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey for clinical characteristics, complications, and satisfaction scores of patients. A high degree of acceptance/satisfaction and a low morbidity rate show the Manchester operation to be a good option for the treatment of uterine prolapse in women who wish to keep their uterus.High amputation of cervix during this procedure may cause cervical incompetence^2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijgo.org/article/S0020-7292%2805%2900627-2/abstract Abstract by Dr. A.

The '''Munchkin''' or Sausage Cat&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.peta.org/blog/sausage-cats/|title='Munchkin Cats' Are Deliberately Bred to Have 'Sausage' Bodies|date=2017-02-10|work=PETA|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a new [[breed of cat]] characterized by its [[Dwarf cat|very short legs]], which are caused by a genetic [[mutation]]. Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by [[The International Cat Association]] in 1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues.

The name "[[munchkin]]" derives from writer [[L. Frank Baum]]'s diminutive inhabitants of [[Munchkin Country]], originating in the 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Munchkin &amp; Midget Cat Breed Facts|url=https://www.petmd.com/cat/breeds/c_ct_munchkin|website=www.petmd.com|publisher=petMD, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nunn|first1=Lyn|title=Munchkin Cats - Origin and History|url=http://www.catbreedsjunction.com/munchkin-cats.html|website=Cat Breeds Junction|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fawcett|first1=Kirstin|title=7 Short Facts About Munchkin Cats|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/80011/7-short-facts-about-munchkin-cats|website=[[Mental Floss]]|accessdate=8 December 2017|language=en|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Short-legged cats have been documented a number of times around the world since the 1940s. A British veterinary report in 1944 noted four generations of healthy short-legged cats which were similar to normal cats except for the length of the legs. This line disappeared during the Second World War but other short-legged cats were spotted in Russia during 1956 and the United States in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="TICAintro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tica.org/cat-breeds/item/236|title=Munchkin breed introduction|publisher=The International Cat Association|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Sandra Hochenedel, a music teacher in [[Louisiana]], found two pregnant cats who had been chased under a truck by a bulldog. She kept one of the cats and named her Blackberry and half of her kittens were born short-legged. Hochenedel gave a short-legged male kitten from one of Blackberry's litters to a friend, Kay LaFrance, and she named the kitten Toulouse. It is from Blackberry and Toulouse that today's Munchkin breed is descended.

Toulouse was an unneutered cat with outdoor access and after some time a population of stray short-legged cats started to form. Thinking that they might have a new breed, Hochenedel and LaFrance contacted Dr. Solveig Pflueger, a show judge, chairperson of [[The International Cat Association]]'s (TICA) genetics committee and advisor to the Board of Directors. Together with Dr. David Biller, Head of Radiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University, Pflueger conducted studies on the cats and determined that the short-legged trait has an [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal dominant]] mode of inheritance and that the cats did not appear to have any spinal problems associated with those found in short-legged dog breeds such as the Corgi and Dachshund.

The Munchkin cat was first introduced to the general public in 1991 via a national network televised cat show held by The International Cat Association (TICA) in Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref name="Helgren2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iams.com/pet-health/cat-breeds/munchkin|title=Iams Cat Breed Guide: Munchkin|last=Helgren|first=J.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Munchkinshorthaired.jpg|thumb|Munchkin kitten, 7 months old]]
The Munchkin is generally described as a sweet-natured, playful, people-oriented, outgoing and intelligent cat which responds well to being handled.&lt;ref name="TICAstandard"/&gt; Some sources state that the shortness of their legs does not interfere with their running and leaping abilities,&lt;ref name="jonstroud"&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Stroud
  |first =Jon
  |title = The DVD Book of Cats.
  |publisher = Green Umbrella Pubg
  |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others state their ability to jump is limited by their condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Universities Federation for Animal Welfare]] |title=Munchkin - Limb Deformity |year=2011 |url=https://www.ufaw.org.uk/cats/munchkin-limb-deformity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Munchkin has similar characteristics to normal domestic cats, due to their frequent use as [[outcross]]es. It is a small to medium-sized cat with a moderate [[Cat#Body types|body type]] and medium-plush coat. Male Munchkins typically weigh between 6 and 9 pounds (3–4&amp;nbsp;kg) and are usually larger than female Munchkins, which typically weigh between 4 and 8 pounds. The hind legs can be slightly longer than the front which creates a slight rise from the shoulder to the rump. The legs of the Munchkin may be slightly [[Genu varum|bowed]], although excessive bowing is a disqualification in the show ring. [[Cow-hocked]] legs are also penalized.&lt;ref name="TICAintro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Helgren2006"/&gt;

The Munchkin comes in all coat colors and patterns. It also comes in a long-haired variety, which is shown in a separate Munchkin Longhair category. The short-haired variety has a medium-plush coat while the long-haired has a semi-long silky coat.&lt;ref name="TICAintro"/&gt; TICA rules for outcrossing allows the use of any domestic cat that does not already belong to a recognized breed. Similarity to other breeds is grounds for disqualification. Non-standard Munchkins are not allowed to be shown.&lt;ref name="TICAstandard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tica.org/pdf/publications/standards/mk.pdf|title=Munchkin Breed Group Standard|date=1 May 2007|publisher=The International Cat Association|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Although the genetic mutation causing the short-legged trait in Munchkins has been referred to as [[achondroplasia]],&lt;ref name="FIF"/&gt; achondroplasia is typically associated with an enlarged head as well as short legs. This combination of features is not seen in Munchkin cats. The condition has sometimes been referred to as [[hypochondroplasia]] or [[pseudoachondroplasia]].&lt;ref name="Wedderburn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Messybeast"&gt;[http://www.messybeast.com/gene-anomalies.htm Genetic Abnormalities of Cats]. Messybeast.com Cat Resource&lt;/ref&gt; Small [[Litter (animal)|litter]] sizes when two munchkin cats are crossed indicate that [[embryo]]s that are [[homozygous]] for the munchkin gene are non-[[:wikt:viable|viable]].&lt;ref name="Messybeast"/&gt;

While there were early speculations that the Munchkin will develop spinal problems commonly seen in short-legged dog breeds, in 1995 several breeders had their oldest Munchkins X-rayed and examined for signs of joint or bone problems and found none.&lt;ref name="Petstyle"&gt;[http://www.petstyle.com/cats/breeds/munchkin Munchkin] PetStyle Lifestyle Network For Pet Lovers.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715071625/http://www.petstyle.com/cats/breeds/munchkin |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there appear to be two conditions with increased incidence in the breed: [[lordosis]] (excessive curvature of the spine) and [[pectus excavatum]] (hollowed chest). Both conditions are commonly seen in humans with pseudoachondroplasia.&lt;ref name="Wedderburn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedderburn|first=Pete|title=Cat breeds–Trophies with hidden problems|journal=Journal of Small Animal Practice|date=October 2008|volume=49|series=BSAVA Companion|issue=10|pages=7–9|doi=10.1111/j.1748-5827.2008.00680.x|quote="This selection for an albeit naturally occurring mutation, resulting in pseudoachondroplasia, has resulted in a breed which appears to have an increased incidence of pectus excavatum and spinal lordosis, both problems commonly seen in human patients with pseudoachondroplasia."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
The munchkin gene is [[autosomal]] [[heredity|dominant]].&lt;ref name="FIF"/&gt; [[Homozygous]] embryos for the munchkin gene are not viable due to [[gene lethality]], and do not develop in the womb. Only kittens that are [[heterozygous]] for the munchkin gene develop into viable short legged munchkin kittens.&lt;ref name="Messybeast"/&gt; Because only heterozygous munchkin cats are able to pass on the gene, all litters with at least one munchkin parent have the possibility of containing kittens with the phenotypes: short-legged or normal-legged (referred to as non-standard munchkin), with the genotypes of Mm or mm, where M is the trait for short legs and m is the trait for long legs.  The mating of two munchkin parents, Mm x Mm, have the chance of producing these offspring: 25% MM- a nonviable kitten,  50% Mm-short-legged, 25% mm- normal. The resulting litter will be 2/3 Mm-short-legged and 1/3&amp;nbsp;mm-normal.

[[Punnett square]]s, in which the '''M''' represents the dominant munchkin gene and the '''m''' represents the recessive normal gene, may be used to illustrate the chances of a particular mating resulting in a short-legged cat.

Kittens bearing two copies of the munchkin gene ('''MM''') will not develop in the womb.  Kittens bearing one munchkin gene and one normal gene ('''Mm''') will be short-legged munchkins. Kittens bearing two normal genes ('''mm''') will be normal. '''Mm''' munchkin kittens will be able to pass on the munchkin gene to their own offspring. Normal '''mm''' kittens will not, as they do not have a copy of the munchkin gene.

[[File:Nordic Walkers near Ilkley 020.JPG|thumb|300px|Nordic Walkers in [[Ilkley]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]
'''Nordic walking''' is a total body version of [[walking]] that can be enjoyed both by non-athletes as a health-promoting physical activity, and by athletes as a sport. The activity is performed with specially designed walking poles similar to [[ski poles]].

==History==
Nordic walking (originally Finnish sauvakävely) is fitness walking with specially designed poles. While trekkers, backpackers and skiers had been using the basic concept for decades, Nordic Walking was first formally defined with the publication of "''Hiihdon lajiosa''" (translation: "A part of cross-country skiing training methodic") by [[Mauri Repo]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tul.fi/Portals/0/DOKUMENTIT/Koulutus/Vanhat%20materiaalit/Hiihdon%20lajiosa%201979.pdf|format=PDF|title=KOULUTUSAINEISTOA MAURI REPO : SEURAVALMENTAJAN PERUSTIEDOT HIIHDON LAJIOSA|website=Tul.fi|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''({{wikisource-inline|Hiihdon lajiosa}}.)'' Nordic Walking's concept was developed on the basis of off-season ski-training activity while using one-piece ski poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inwa-nordicwalking.com/?p=202#more-202|title=The History of Nordic Walking|website=Inwa-nordic-walking.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Скандинавская ходьба (Украина).jpg|thumb|]]

For decades hikers and backpackers used their one-piece ski poles long before trekking and Nordic walking poles came onto the scene. Ski racers deprived of snow have always used and still do use their one-piece ski poles for ski walking and hill bounding. The first poles specially designed and marketed to fitness walkers were produced by Exerstrider of the USA in 1988. ''Nordic Walker'' poles were produced and marketed by [[Exel Composites|Exel]] in 1997. Exel coined and popularized the term 'Nordic Walking' in 1999.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Benefits==
Compared to regular walking, Nordic walking (also called pole walking) involves applying force to the poles with each stride. Nordic walkers use more of their entire body (with greater intensity) and receive fitness building stimulation not present in normal walking for the chest, [[latissimus dorsi muscle]], triceps, biceps, shoulder, abdominals, spinal and other core muscles that may result in significant increases in heart rate at a given pace.&lt;ref&gt;Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise VOL. 27, NO. 4 April1995:607-11&lt;/ref&gt; Nordic walking has been estimated as producing up to a 46% increase in energy consumption, compared to walking without poles.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper Institute, ''Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sports'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Field testing of physiological responses associated with Nordic Walking|date=2013-03-25 |pmid=12230336 | doi=10.1080/02701367.2002.10609023 |volume=73 |journal=Res Q Exerc Sport |pages=296–300 | last1 = Church | first1 = TS | last2 = Earnest | first2 = CP | last3 = Morss | first3 = GM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of the research, conducted by the group scientists from various universities*, both Nordic walking and conventional walking are beneficial for older adults. However, Nordic walking provides additional benefits in muscular strength compared to conventional walking, making it suitable for improving aerobic capacity and muscular strength as well as other components of functional fitness in a short period of time. 
The key  points stated by the study authors are:
Nordic walking, conventional walking, and resistance training are beneficial for older adults.
*Nordic walking and conventional walking both improve cardio-respiratory fitness while resistance training does not.
*Nordic walking provides additional benefits in upper-body muscular strength compared to conventional walking.
*Nordic walking is an effective and efficient mode of exercise to improve overall fitness in older adults.

==Equipment==
[[File:Рукоять и темляк палок для скандинавской ходьбы.jpg|thumb|The handle of a walking pole]]
[[File:Push and Pull.jpg|thumb|Spike for offroad and rubber for asphalt]]
Nordic walking poles are significantly shorter than those recommended for cross-country skiing. Nordic walking poles come in one-piece, non-adjustable shaft versions, available in varying lengths, and telescoping two or three piece twist-locking versions of adjustable length. One piece poles are generally stronger and lighter, but must be matched to the user.  Telescoping poles are 'one-size fits all', and are more transportable.

Nordic walking poles feature a range of grips and wrist-straps, or rarely, no wrist-strap at all. The straps eliminate the need to tightly grasp the grips.
As with many trekking poles, Nordic walking poles come with removable [[Natural rubber|rubber]] tips for use on hard surfaces and hardened metal tips for trails, the beach, snow and ice. Most poles are made from lightweight [[aluminium]], [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]], or [[composite material]]s. Special walking shoes are not required, although there are shoes being marketed as specifically designed for the sport.

==Technique==
The cadences of the arms, legs and body are, rhythmically speaking, similar to those used in normal, vigorous, walking. The range of arm movement regulates the length of the stride. Restricted arm movements will mean a natural restricted pelvic motion and stride length. The longer the pole thrust, the longer the stride and more powerful the swing of the pelvis and upper torso.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55650">'''Patient participation''' is a trend that arose in answer to perceived physician [[paternalism]].

In recent years, the term "patient participation" has been used in many different contexts. These include, for example: '''participatory medicine''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dyson|first1=Esther|title=Why Participatory Medicine?|journal=Journal of Participatory Medicine|date=21 October 2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=e1 |url=http://www.jopm.org/opinion/editorials/2009/10/21/why-participatory-medicine/|issn=2152-7202}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''health consumerism''',&lt;ref name="Robinson2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=James C. |title=Managed Consumerism In Health Care|journal=[[Health Affairs]] |volume=24 |issue=6 |date=December 2005 |pages=1478–89 |issn=0278-2715 |pmid=16284020 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.6.1478 |doi-access=free |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/6/1478.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and '''patient-centered care'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=|title=Declaration on: Patient-Centered Healthcare|url=https://www.iapo.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/IAPO_declaration_ENG_2016.pdf|publisher=International Alliance of Patients' Organizations|accessdate=30 June 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=QualityChasm|Patient-centered care especially has been subject to reinterpretation since 2001, when the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) defined patient-centered care as "providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Institute of Medicine]] |date=2001 |chapter=Executive Summary |title=Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century |location=Washington, DC |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |chapter-url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10027/chapter/2 |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10027/crossing-the-quality-chasm-a-new-health-system-for-the |isbn=978-0-309-07280-9 |doi=10.17226/10027 |doi-access=free |page=[http://www.nap.edu/read/10027/page/6 6] |via=National Academies Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} For the latter context, i.e. patient-centered care, a more nuanced definition was proposed in 2009 by the president of the [[Institute for Healthcare Improvement]] [[Donald Berwick]]: "The experience (to the extent the informed, individual patient desires it) of transparency, individualization, recognition, respect, dignity, and choice in all matters, without exception, related to one's person, circumstances, and relationships in health care"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berwick |first=Donald M. |author-link=Donald Berwick |date=July 2009 |title=What Patient-Centered Should Mean: Confessions of an Extremist |journal=Health Affairs |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=w555-65 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.4.w555 |doi-access=free |pmid=19454528 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/4/w555.full |access-date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are concepts closely related to patient participation. In the UK over the course of 2016 two new relevant terms have expanded in usage: [[Patient and Public Involvement (PPI)]] and Engagement (PPIE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[National Institute for Health Research]] |title=Is 2017 the year for PPIE? |date=23 February 2017

Patient participation is a generic term, and thus no list can be exhaustive; nonetheless, the following description shall subdivide it into several areas where patients and/or their advocates have a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kelty |first1=C |last2= Panofsky|first2=A |last3= Currie|first3= M | last4= Crooks| first4= R| last5=Erickson | first5=S |last6= Garcia| first6=P | last7= Wartenbe | first7= M |last8= Wood |first8=S |date=2015 |title=Seven dimensions of contemporary participation disentangled |journal= [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]] |volume=66 |pages=474–488 |doi=10.1002/asi.23202 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262679683_Seven_Dimensions_of_Contemporary_Participation_Disentangled |access-date= May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patient participation, as it pertains to the formation of health policy, is a process that involves patients as [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], advisors and shared decision makers. The practice of engaging patients in health  policy originated from the [[consumer advocacy]] movement, which prioritized consumer safety, access to information and public participation in public health programs.&lt;ref name="Souliotis2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souliotis|first=Kyriakos|last2=Agapidaki|first2=Eirini|last3=Peppou|first3=Lily Evangelia|date=September 2017|title=Assessing Patient Organization Participation in Health Policy: A Comparative Study in France and Italy|url=http://ijhpm.com/article_3351_82d9af675fe60fb81f41a8bd9d62027a.pdf|journal=International Journal of Health Policy Management|volume=6(x)|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the context, patient participation in health policy can refer to informed decision making, health advocacy, program development, policy implementation, and evaluation of services.&lt;ref name="Souliotis2017" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Patient participation in health policy can affect many different levels of the health care system. Hospitalized individuals may participate in their own medical care in an effort to make shared decisions. In other areas, patients act as advocates by serving as members of organizational and governmental policy committees.

Increased patient participation in health policy can lead to improvements in patient satisfaction, quality and safety, cost savings and population health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Souliotis2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carman|first=Kristin L.|last2=Dardess|first2=Pam|last3=Maurer|first3=Maureen|last4=Sofaer|first4=Shoshanna|last5=Adams|first5=Karen|last6=Bechtel|first6=Christine|last7=Sweeney|first7=Jennifer|date=2013-02-01|title=Patient And Family Engagement: A Framework For Understanding The Elements And Developing Interventions And Policies|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/32/2/223|journal=Health Affairs|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=223–231|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2012.1133|issn=0278-2715|pmid=23381514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Involving patient participation in health policy research can also ensure that public health needs are accurately incorporated into policy proposals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Souliotis|first=Kyriakos|last2=Agapidaki|first2=Eirini|last3=Peppou|first3=Lily Evangelia|last4=Tzavara|first4=Chara|last5=Samoutis|first5=George|last6=Theodorou|first6=Mamas|date=2016-08-01|title=Assessing Patient Participation in Health Policy Decision-Making in Cyprus|url=http://www.ijhpm.com/article_3227_629.html|journal=International Journal of Health Policy and Management|volume=5|issue=8|pages=461–466|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2016.78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;When solicited for participation by policymakers and industry leaders, patients can influence health policy, and both groups benefit from collaboration on goal setting and outcome measurement. By providing feedback in the form of survey responses, patients give community health officials and hospital leaders helpful feedback on the perceived quality and accessibility of health care services. Furthermore, patient satisfaction scores from these surveys have become an important metric by which hospitals are evaluated and compared to one another.

Patient participation has driven the development of a variety of health policies, ranging from the expansion of hospital visitation hours to the implementation of patient-centered bedside rounding by hospital medical teams. Patient participation has contributed to improvements in the nurse-to-nurse handoff process by engaging with staff to discuss change-of-shift information at the patient's bedside. Patient participation in care coordination has also lead to the utilization of electronic medical records that patients can access and edit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;By engaging with patients and patient advocacy groups, policymakers can support patients to shape public policy. Examples include facilitation of public participation in research, town hall meetings, public information sessions, internet and mobile-based surveys and open comment periods on proposed legislation. Hospitals promote patient participation by empowering patients to serve as advisers and decision makers, including on quality improvement teams, patient safety committees, and family-centered care councils.&amp;nbsp;Similarly, foundations, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies can create funding mechanisms requiring and supporting patient participation in societal decisions and priority setting. 

Some aspects of PPI have been seen critically; in addition to those under HTA below, examples of general critical voices include a group of U.S. researchers presenting a framework in 2013 and a young Canadian speaker in 2018. The former warn that clinicians, delivery systems, and policy makers cannot assume that patients have certain capabilities, interests, or goals, nor can they dictate the pathway to achieving a patient's goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The latter sees multiple potential conflicts of interest in the current arena of PPI.&lt;ref&gt;Keynote at the [[Cochrane (organisation)]] 2018, Edinburgh, Scotland: {{cite web |title="The trouble with patient and public involvement (PPI)" |date=2018 |url=https://johannesen.ca/2018/09/the-trouble-with-patient-and-public-involvement-ppi-keynote-at-cochrane-colloquium-2018/ |first1= Jennifer|last1= Johanssen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In health technology assessment==

Patient participation in [[health technology assessment]] (HTA) is an approach to HTA which aims to include patients in the process of HTA. It is sometimes called consumer or patient engagement or consumer or patient involvement, although in HTA the latter term has been defined to include research into patients' needs, preferences and experiences as well as participation per se.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives in HTA: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation | journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=334e340 |date=  2010 |doi=10.1017/S0266462310000395  | url=  |first1=Karen    |last1= Facey |first2= Antoine   |last2= Boivin  |first3= Javier  |last3=Gracia  |first4=Helle P    |last4= Hansen   |first5= Alessandra. |last5=  Los Scalzo  |first6= Jean |last6=  Mossman | first7= Ann |last7= Single | volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In HTA, patient participation is also often used to include the participation of patient groups, patient advocates, and patients' families and carers in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involvement of consumers in health technology assessment activities by INAHTA agencies| journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=79–83 |date=  2013 |doi=10.1017/S026646231200075X  | url=  http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2285&amp;context=eispapers |first1=David    |last1= Hailey |first2= Sophie   |last2= Werkö  |first3= Rugayah  |last3=Bakri  |first4=Alun    |last4= Cameron   |first5=Britta |last5=  Göhlen|first6= Susan |last6=  Myles |first7= Jasmine |last7= Pwu | first8= Jomkwan |last8= Yothasamut| volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As HTA aims to help healthcare funders, such as governments, make decisions about [[health policy]], it often involves the question as to whether to use broadly defined health "technologies", and if so, how and when; then patients comprise a key stakeholder in the HTA process. Additionally, because HTA seeks to assess if a heath technology produces useful outcomes for patients in real world settings (clinical effectiveness) that are good value for money (cost effectiveness), understanding patients' needs, preferences and experiences is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives in HTA: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation | journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=334–340 |date=  2010 |doi= 10.1017/S0266462310000395  | url=  |first1=Karen    |last1= Facey |first2= Antoine   |last2= Boivin  |first3= Javier  |last3=Gracia  |first4=Helle P    |last4= Hansen   |first5= Alessandra. |last5=  Los Scalzo |first6= Jean |last6=  Mossman |first7= Ann |last7= Single | volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When patients take part in HTA, their knowledge gained from living with a condition and using treatments and services can add value to an HTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives can be integrated in health technology assessments: an exploratory analysis of CADTH Common Drug Review|date=  2016 | url=  https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.118/s40900-016-0036-9?site=researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com |first1=Sarah    |last1= Berglas |first2= Lauren   |last2= Jutai  |first3= Gail  |last3=MacKean  |first4=Laura    |last4= Weeks   }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are called experience-based experts or lay experts.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involving patients in health technology funding decisions: stakeholder perspectives on processes used in Australia |date=2015 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hex.12356/pdf |first1= Edilene |last1= Lopes |first2= Jackie |last2= Street |first3= Drew |last3= Carter |first4= Tracy |last4= Merlin |doi=10.1111/hex.12356|pmc=5055264 }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt;
Patients can add value to HTAs by providing real world insights (e.g. implications of benefits and side effects, variation in clinical practice)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=  Understanding Health Technology Assessment (HTA) | url= http://img.eurordis.org/newsletter/pdf/nov-2010/58-1%20HEE%20Guide%20To%20HTA%20for%20Patients%20English.pdf |last1= Health Equality Europe (HEE) }}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting outcomes that matter, addressing gaps and uncertainties in the published literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involving patients in reducing decision uncertainties around orphan and ultra-orphan drugs: A rare opportunity? | journal= Patient | pages=29–39 |date=  2015 |doi= 10.1007/s40271-014-0106-8 |first1=Devidas    |last1= Menon |first2= Tania   |last2= Stafinski   |first3= A  |last3=Dunn  |first4=H    |last4= Short   | volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patients’ perspectives can be integrated in health technology assessments: an exploratory analysis of CADTH Common Drug Review|date=  2016 | url=  https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40900-016-0036-9?site=researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com |first1=Sarah    |last1= Berglas |first2= Lauren   |last2= Jutai   |first3= Gail  |last3=MacKean  |first4=Laura    |last4= Weeks   }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; and contributing to the value construct that shapes assessments and decisions.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"/&gt;

===Approaches===

In 2017, a book was published on patient involvement in HTA (Eds Facey KM, Hansen HP, Single ANV) bringing together research, approaches, methods and case studies prepared by 80 authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811040672|title=Patient Involvement in Health Technology Assessment|editor1=Facey, Karen|editor2=Ploug Hansen, Helle|editor3=Single, Ann|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It demonstrates that practices vary between HTA bodies, and patients can potentially contribute at every stage of an HTA from scoping the questions asked about the health technology, providing input, interpreting the evidence, and drafting and communicating recommendations. It suggests that patient participation in HTA depends on two-way communication and is a dialogue for shared learning and problem solving. The approach taken should be driven by the goal of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Supporting quality public and patient engagement in health system organizations: Development and usability testing of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool | journal= Health expectations | date=  2015 |doi= 10.1111/hex.12378  | first1=Julia    |last1= Abelson |first2= Sarah E   |last2= Boesveld   |first3= Kathy K  |last3=Li | pmc=5152717 | pmid=26113295 | volume=19 | pages=817–27}} {{Open Access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common way that patients take part in HTA is by providing written submissions and participating in expert meetings (for example as an equal member of an expert group or by attending an expert meeting to present information and answer questions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Good Practice Examples of Patient and Public Involvement in Health Technology Assessment  (a living document)| year=2015|last1= Health Technology Assessment international (HTAi)| url= https://www.htai.org/fileadmin/HTAi_Files/ISG/PatientInvolvement/EffectiveInvolvement/Good_Practice_Examples_Feb_2015.pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations and criticism ===

Although patient participation has been adopted and developed by a variety of HTA bodies around the world, there are limitations and criticisms of its use. These include concern about how and when to involve patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patient involvement in health technology assessment in Europe – results of the EPF survey| journal= European Patients Forum |date=  2013 | url=  http://www.eu-patient.eu/globalassets/projects/hta/hta-epf-final-report2013.pdf }} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; the burden of participation for patients, representativeness of patients, the potential for conflict of interest (in relation to patient groups receiving funding from manufacturers), and lack of evaluation of patient participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involvement of consumers in health technology assessment activities by INAHTA agencies| journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=79–83 |date=  2013 |doi=10.1017/S026646231200075X  | url=  http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2285&amp;context=eispapers |first1=David    |last1= Hailey |first2= Sophie   |last2= Werkö   |first3= Rugayah  |last3=Bakri   |first4=Alun    |last4= Cameron   |first5=Britta |last5=  Göhlen| first6= Susan |last6=  Myles  |first7= Jasmine |last7= Pwu | first8= Jomkwan |last8= Yothasamut| volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facey et al. (2017) published the book on patient involvement in HTA to establish consistent terminology in the field and demonstrate a range of recognised approaches and methods found in published literature. Authors also highlighted the challenges of evaluation, rapid (short HTAs) and the problem of HTA bodies confusing patient input (information provided by patients and patient groups taking part in HTA) with patient-based evidence (robust research into patients' needs, preferences and experiences). The book itself is not open access, but the lead editor also published a paper on the topic six years before the larger collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patient involvement in HTA: What added value?|date=2011 |url=https://doi.org/10.3233/PPL-2011-0329 |first1= Karen |last1= Facey|doi=10.3233/PPL-2011-0329}} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of the issues for patient participation in HTA is that HTA has often been constructed as a scientific process which must remain free from the subjective input of patients. 
Likewise, Gauvin et al. report that their "analysis reveals that HTA agencies' role as bridges or boundary organizations situated at the frontier of research and policymaking causes the agencies to struggle with the idea of public involvement" (page 1518).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=  ‘It all depends’: Conceptualizing public involvement in the context of health technology assessment agencies | journal= Social Science &amp; Medicine | pages=1518–1526 |date=  2010 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.01.036  | url=  |first1=Francois-Pierre    |last1= Gauvin |first2= Julia   |last2= Abelson   |first3= Mita |last3=Giacomini  |first4=John    |last4= Eyles   |first5= John N. |last5=  Lavis | volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, HTA would be better understood as a policy tool which critically reviews scientific evidence for a local context and this review is shaped by those involved in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Facey|first=Karen|last2=Boivin|first2=Antoine|last3=Gracia|first3=Javier|last4=Hansen|first4=Helle Ploug|last5=Scalzo|first5=Alessandra Lo|last6=Mossman|first6=Jean|last7=Single|first7=Ann|date=2010|title=Patients' perspectives in health technology assessment: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-technology-assessment-in-health-care/article/patients-perspectives-in-health-technology-assessment-a-route-to-robust-evidence-and-fair-deliberation/3A1AEAFCD140F4D5CAA3694766E0B0FF|journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care|volume=26|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1017/s0266462310000395|issn=1471-6348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways that public participation in HTA, including patients, can be implemented. In fact, an entire "typology of issues" has been developed by Gauvin et al., in which each type is "related to the most appropriate public involvement methods". Facey (2017) built on this work in Chapter 5 to describe it in detail for patient participation in HTA.

Sociologist Andrew Webster sees the problem as "a failure to recognise that evaluation is a contested terrain involving different sorts of evidence related to different sorts of context (such as the ''experimental'' derived from clinical trials, ''evidential'', derived from existing clinical practice, and ''experiential'', based on patients' experiences of an intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Andrew: Evaluation, governance and moves to a socially robust assessment of health technology, Working Paper 34, York, 2006, page 8,&lt;/ref&gt;

A further issue for patient participation in HTA is that of the individual versus the group. The HTAi's list available for endorsement on values for patient involvement express this issue as 'involvement ... contributes to equity by seeking to understand the diverse needs of patients with a particular health issue, balanced against the requirements of a health system that seeks to distribute resources fairly amongst all users'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Values and Standards for Patient Involvement in HTA  | url= https://www.htai.org/interest-groups/patient-and-citizen-involvement/pcig-home/values-and-standards }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelly et al. explain (with their original citations shown here in brackets): "From the moment Archie Cochrane linked questions of clinical effectiveness to cost effectiveness [17] and cost utility analysis was chosen as the basis for assessing value for money, [Evidence-Based Medicine] EBM and HTA have been framed within the utilitarian philosophical tradition. Utilitarianism is premised on the view that actions are good insofar as they maximize benefit for the greatest number [51]. This is not necessarily congruent with what is in the best interest of an individual patient [34]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The importance of values in evidence-based medicine |journal=BMC Medical Ethics |pages=16:69 |date=2015 |url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 |first1= Michael P. |last1= Kelly| first2=Kelly Iona| last2=Heath | first3 =Jeremy |last3=Howick| first4=Trisha | last4=Greenhalgh| doi=10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 | volume=16}} (Open Access)&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops in  Denmark  and  Austria  have resulted in calls to action to reinforce patients' role in SDM and health advocacy. The Danish workshop recommended the new Toolbox of resources for patient participation from the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eupati.eu|title=European Patients’ Academy (EUPATI) – Patient education!|website=EUPATI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borup |first1=Gitte  |last2=Friis Bach  |first2= Karin| last3=  Schmiegelow| first3= Merete | last4= Wallach-Kildemoes| first4= Helle| last5=  Jannik Bjerrum| first5=Ole | last6= Westergaard| first6= Niels |  title = A Paradigm Shift Towards Patient Involvement in Medicines Development and Regulatory Science: Workshop Proceedings and Commentary (open access copy) | journal = Therapeutic Innovation &amp; Regulatory Science | volume = 1–8 |date= 2015 | doi = 10.1177/2168479015622668 | subscription= yes | url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288888136_A_Paradigm_Shift_Towards_Patient_Involvement_in_Medicines_Development_and_Regulatory_Science_Workshop_Proceedings_and_Commentary?ev=prf_high |ref=harv | pages=304–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the Danish workshop reported that the European Medicines Agency would be "measuring the impact of patient involvement", this being crucial to establishing credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borup|Friis Bach|Schmiegelow|Wallach-Kildemoes|2015|p=5 &amp; note 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed, measurement is provided for in the place cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=European Medicines Agency, Stakeholders and Communication Division  | title =Draft Work plan for the European Medicines Agency Human Scientific Committees' Working Party with Patients' and Consumers' Organisations (PCWP) 2016 |year=2015 | url= https://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Work_programme/2015/12/WC500198775.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Austria, a bibliography ''inter alia'' resulted from the most recent event in a workshop series continuing through 2019 entitled "Toward a Shared Culture of Health: Enriching and Charting the Patient-Clinician Relationship held from 10–16 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.salzburgglobal.org/calendar/2010-2019/2017/session-553.html | title=Session 553: Overview |website=Salzburg Global Seminar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, there is a debate about the relative value of patient participation versus decisions without explicitly empowering patients. Bovenkamp is one of the most vocal opponents challenging patients as stakeholders in clinical guideline development.&lt;ref name="Bovenkamp"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bovenkamp |first1=H.M. |last2=Trappenburg |first2=M.

In Norway, Nilsen et al. were critical of patients' role in health policy and clinical guideline development in their Cochrane Intervention Review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nilsen |first1=Elin Strømme |last2= Tinderholdt Myrhaug| first2=Hilde |last3=Oliver |first3= Sandy |last4= Oxman |first4 =Andrew D |title = Methods of consumer involvement in developing healthcare policy and research, clinical practice guidelines and patient information material | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |page=CD004563  | issue = 3 |date= 2006 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004563.pub2/abstract | doi = 10.1007/s10728-008-0099-3 | volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Norwegian researchers, though, in unison with the workshop findings above, expand the list of areas where patients' views matter: "The central arena for patient participation is the meeting between patient and health professional, but other important areas of involvement include decisions at the system and policy levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Austvoll-Dahlgren |first1= A   |last2= Johansen| first2=M | trans-title = The patient as participant and knowledge manager |title=Pasienten som medvirker og kunnskapshåndterer | journal = Norsk Epidemiologi| volume = 23| issue = 2 | pages= 225–230| date= 2012 |url= https://www.kunnskapssenteret.no/en/publications/the-patient-as-participant-and-knowledge-manager | doi=10.5324/nje.v23i2.1649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States there are several trends emerging with potential international implications: [[Health 2.0]],  [[artificial intelligence in healthcare]] (AI), the role of entrepreneurs, the value of patient participation in precision medicine and mobile health or [[MHealth]], which will be dealt with in greater detail below.

== In shared decision making and artificial intelligence ==
{{See also|Shared decision-making|Artificial intelligence in healthcare}}

Prior to the recent advances in technology, patient participation was limited to&amp;nbsp;[[Shared decision-making in medicine|shared decision making]]&amp;nbsp;(SDM), a form of participation that occurred specifically between a patient and their physician in clinical practice, but can be regarded as a step forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30075-4 |title= Regressing or progressing: what next for the doctor/ patient relationship?

(28 February 2018), pp. 178-180| access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes in modern technology now allow computers to play an increasingly important role in healthcare decision making. Examples of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that is being used in healthcare include IBM's Watson Health, which is intended to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of difficult illnesses or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ibm-and-mit-partner-on-240m-ai-lab/504725/|title=IBM and MIT partner on $240M AI lab|work=Healthcare Dive|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;One of the Watson's objectives is to highlighting findings developed by Watson's computing skills and access to everyday information and give concrete suggestions that are tailored to the expertise of the physician, type of ailment, and needed level of care.&amp;nbsp;Physicians can use ailment specific programs such as the Watson for Oncology app, which is aimed at the detection and treatment of tumors. Artificial intelligence is being used more frequently in patient participatory healthcare.

== Role of entrepreneurship ==
Entrepreneurs have led the challenge to conventional health thinking since Craig Venter took on the NIH with the&amp;nbsp;[[1000 Genomes Project]]&amp;nbsp;in 2008. Mike Milken, another entrepreneur and stock trader, founded the Santa Monica, California based Milken Institute. Following the institute's inception, Milken launched the Fastercures program, which "brings together patient advocates, researchers, investors and policymakers from every sector of the medical research and development system to eliminate the roadblocks that get in the way of a faster cure".&amp;nbsp;The Fastercures program proposes patient-center improvements and advancements in the modern healthcare arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2011/06/16/lessons-from-aidshiv-advocacy-efforts/|title=Lessons From AIDS/HIV Advocacy Efforts|last=Marcus|first=Amy Dockser|date=2011-06-16|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the U.S. Government boosted patient participation by launching its own&amp;nbsp;[[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]]. PCORI is striving to systematize its evaluation metrics to prove where results show improvement.&amp;nbsp;PCORI was created by provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The 501(c) organization has faced a great deal of scrutiny over funding, specifically when it was revealed PCORI was funded by a new tax originating from the Affordable Care Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/patient-centered-outcomes-research-institute-fee|title=Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute Fee {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precision medicine ==
Four years after the spectacular [[1000 Genomes Project]] hoped to call in a new era of [[precision medicine]] (PM), some opinion leaders have spoken up for reassessing the value of patient participation to be seen as a driver of PM. The Chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco, for instance, wrote an editorial in ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'' calling for  an amendment to the social contract to boost patient participation, citing a historical precedent: "We need only look back to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic during the 1980s to experience the power of patient advocacy combined with the dogged pursuit of scientific discovery and translation; clearly, motivated patients and scientists as well as their advocates can influence political, scientific, and regulatory agendas to drive advances in health."&lt;ref name=Desmond-Hellmann-2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desmond-Hellmann |first1=Susan  |title=Toward precision medicine: A new social contract? |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=129 |page=129ed3 |department=Editorial |date=11 April 2012 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3003473 |url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/129/129ed3 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a seminal{{peacock term|date=September 2017}} paper on the topic came out written by Hood and Friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hood |first1=Leroy |last2=Friend |first2=Stephen H. |title=Predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory (P4) cancer medicine |journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=184–187 |date=March 2011 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227 |pmid=21364692 |url=https://www.nature.com/nrclinonc/journal/v8/n3/full/nrclinonc.2010.227.html |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second success story is that of the patient John W. Walsh, who founded Alphanet, which has funnelled tens of millions of dollars into research on [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] or COPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Sam |title=John W.

A more ethically ambivalent development involving patient-funded research involves so-called [[named patient programs]] and [[expanded access]].

MHealth is bringing promising solutions to meet the growing demand for care.

== Patients as research stakeholders ==
{{See also|Health advocacy|Participatory action research}}
Patient participation can include a broad spectrum of activities for human subjects during clinical trials and has become associated with several other words such as "patient engagement" or "decision making".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahdat|first=Shaghayegh|last2=Hamzehgardeshi|first2=Leila|last3=Hessam|first3=Somayeh|last4=Hamzehgardeshi|first4=Zeinab|date=January 2014|title=Patient Involvement in Health Care Decision Making: A Review |journal=Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal|volume=16|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.5812/ircmj.12454|issn=2074-1804|pmc=3964421|pmid=24719703|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes agenda-setting, clinical guideline development and clinical trial design. 

According to early career researchers working in the field of patient engagement in research, this research approach is still in its infancy and will become mainstream in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citejournal|last1=Rouleau|first1=Geneviève|last2=Bélisle-Pipon|first2=Jean-Christophe|last3=Birko|first3=Stanislav|last4=Karazivan|first4=Philippe|last5=Fernandez|first5=Nicolas|last6=Bilodeau|first6=Karine|last7=Chao|first7=Yi-Sheng|last8=de Pokomandy|first8=Alexandra|last9=Foley|first9=Véronique|last10=Gagnon|first10=Bruno|last11=Gontijo Guerra|first11=Samantha|last12=Khanji|first12=Cynthia|last13=Lamoureux-Lamarche|first13=Catherine|last14=Lebouché|first14=Bertrand|last15=Lunghi|first15=Carlotta|last16=Menear|first16=Matthew|last17=D.Riverin|first17=Bruno|last18=Rodrigue|first18=Rodrigue|date=2018-10-09|title=Early career researchers’ perspectives and roles in patient-oriented research|journal=Research Involvement and Engagement|doi=10.1186/s40900-018-0117-z|volume=4|issue=1|url=https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40900-018-0117-z|accessdate=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical trials ===

In the US, trends in patient participation have been influenced by a variety of sources and previous political movements. One such source for patient participation in clinical research was the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. During the epidemic, the AIDS activists argued not only for new clinical trial models, but for the importance of additional social service groups to support a wider range of potential human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/1881|title=The Social Impact of AIDS in the United States|last=Council|first=National Research|date=1969-12-31|isbn=9780309046282|doi=10.17226/1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the FDA has taken several steps to include patients earlier in the drug development process. The authorization of [[Prescription Drug User Fee Act|Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) V]] in 2012 included the Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) initiative to provide the FDA with a way of hearing the patients' perspectives and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/forindustry/userfees/prescriptiondruguserfee/ucm453856.htm|title=Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) - Externally-led Patient-Focused Drug Development Meetings|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[European Medicines Agency|European Medicine Agency]] (EMA) has been attempting to incorporate patient perspectives during the evaluation of medicinal products by the EMA scientific committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2014/09/WC500173508.pdf|title=European Medicines Agency|last=|first=|date=23 October 2014|website=www.ema.europa.eu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been an increased interest among healthcare providers, such as nurses, in cultivating patient participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barello|first=Serena|last2=Graffigna|first2=Guendalina|last3=Vegni|first3=Elena|date=2012|title=Patient Engagement as an Emerging Challenge for Healthcare Services: Mapping the Literature|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/nrp/2012/905934/|journal=Nursing Research and Practice|language=en|volume=2012|pages=1–7|doi=10.1155/2012/905934|issn=2090-1429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this increased interest, studies have been done to assess the benefits and risks of patient participation and engagement in research. For benefits, patient engagement improves patient outcomes as well as clinical trial enrollment and retention.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Domecq|first=Juan Pablo|last2=Prutsky|first2=Gabriela|last3=Elraiyah|first3=Tarig|last4=Wang|first4=Zhen|last5=Nabhan|first5=Mohammed|last6=Shippee|first6=Nathan|last7=Brito|first7=Juan Pablo|last8=Boehmer|first8=Kasey|last9=Hasan|first9=Rim|date=2014-02-26|title=Patient engagement in research: a systematic review|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-89|journal=BMC Health Services Research|volume=14|pages=89|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-14-89|issn=1472-6963}}&lt;/ref&gt; For risks, it has been proposed that the inclusion of patient participation may lead to extended research times and increased funding for clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Two of the reasons to cultivate patient participation in clinical research have been the growth of patient organizations along with the development of databases and the concept of a patient or [[disease registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Sophia K.|last2=Selig|first2=Wendy|last3=Harker|first3=Matthew|last4=Roberts|first4=Jamie N.|last5=Hesterlee|first5=Sharon|last6=Leventhal|first6=David|last7=Klein|first7=Richard|last8=Patrick-Lake|first8=Bray|last9=Abernethy|first9=Amy P.|date=2015-10-14|title=Patient Engagement Practices in Clinical Research among Patient Groups, Industry, and Academia in the United States: A Survey |journal=PLoS ONE|volume=10|issue=10|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0140232|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4605726|pmid=26465328|page=e0140232}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer databases allow for the mass collection and dissemination of data. Registries, specifically, not only allow patients to access personal information but also allow physicians to review the outcomes and experiences of multiple patients who have received treatment with medicinal products .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiljer|first=David|last2=Urowitz|first2=Sara|last3=Apatu|first3=Emma|last4=DeLenardo|first4=Claudette|last5=Eysenbach|first5=Gunther|last6=Harth|first6=Tamara|last7=Pai|first7=Howard|last8=Leonard|first8=Kevin J|date=2008-10-31|title=Patient Accessible Electronic Health Records: Exploring Recommendations for Successful Implementation Strategies |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=10|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.1061|issn=1438-8871|pmc=2629367|pmid=18974036|page=e34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trotter|first=Jeffrey P.|date=2002|title=Patient Registries: A New Gold Standard for "Real World" Research |journal=The Ochsner Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=211–214|issn=1524-5012|pmc=3400525|pmid=22826660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, registries and patient participation have been particularly important to the development of rare-disease medicines. In the US, the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) was created in 2003 which includes a registry for patients afflicted with a rare-disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/|title=Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN)|website=www.rarediseasesnetwork.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867555228|title=Orphan drugs : understanding the rare disease market and its dynamics|last=Elizabeth.|first=Hernberg-Ståhl,|date=2013|publisher=WP, Woodhead Publishing|others=Reljanović, Miroslav.|isbn=9781908818393|location=Oxford|oclc=867555228}}&lt;/ref&gt; This registry provides information to the patients and allows physicians to contact potential patients for enrollment in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; "Patient registry" is a developing term, and this 2013 open-access book provides a comprehensive description of the trend toward registries and their networks, i.e. the "broader research collaboratives that connect individual registries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=TA Workman |date=2013 |chapter=Defining Patient Registries and Research Networks |title=Engaging Patients in Information Sharing and Data Collection: The Role of Patient-Powered Registries and Research Networks |location=Rockville MD |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164514/#top |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164514/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients have a new resource to help them navigate the clinical trials landscape and find lay summaries of mediTal research in the OpenTrials database launched by the [[AllTrials]] campaign in 2016 as part of [[open data]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldacre |first1=Ben |last2=Gray |first2=Jonathan |title=OpenTrials: towards a collaborative open database of all available information on all clinical trials |date=8 April 2016 |journal=Trials |volume=17 |page=164 |doi=10.1186/s13063-016-1290-8 |doi-access=free }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precision medicine will change the conduct of clinical trials, and thus the role of patients as subjects. "Key to making precision medicine mainstream is the ongoing shift in the relationship between patients and physicians" comments N.J. Schork from the Venter Institute in ''Nature''. He cites as reasons for this development a growing interest in 'omics' assays and cheap and efficient devices that collect health data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schork |first1=Nicholas J.  |title=Personalized medicine: Time for one-person trials |journal=Nature |volume=520 |issue=7549 |date=29 April 2015 |pages=609–611 |doi=10.1038/520609a |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer article in ''Nature'' outlines the conditions with which patent participation can be optimized, and it is co-authored by Jennifer Wagner et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wagner |first1=Jennifer K. |last2=Peltz-Rauchman |first2=Cathryn |last3=Rahm |first3=Alanna K. |last4=Johnson |first4=Christine C. |title=Precision engagement: the PMI's success will depend on more than genomes and big data |journal=Genetics in Medicine |volume=19 |issue=6 |year=2017 |pages=620–624 |doi=10.1038/gim.2016.165 |url=http://www.nature.com/gim/journal/v19/n6/full/gim2016165a.html |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With cancer being a prime target for precision medicine, Dr. Jennifer Carter, founder of the start-up N-of-One, recruits patients to "participate" in clinical trials to help find a cure for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Carte |first1=Jennifer Levin |last2=Cubino |first2=Jennifer|title=Call to Action: Breaking down Barriers for Patient Participation in Oncology Clinical Trials |year=2016 |website=Journal of Precision Medicine |publisher=Kneed Media | url=https://www.thejournalofprecisionmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Carter.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Placental expulsion''' (also called '''afterbirth''') occurs when the [[placenta]] comes out of the [[birth canal]] after [[childbirth]]. The period from just after the baby is expelled until just after the placenta is expelled is called the '''third stage of labor'''.

The third stage of labor can be managed actively with several standard procedures, or it can be managed expectantly (also known as ''physiological management'' or ''passive management''), the latter allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance.

Although uncommon, in some cultures the placenta is kept and consumed by the mother over the weeks following the birth. This practice is termed [[placentophagy]].

==Physiology==

=== Hormone induction of placental separation ===

As the fetal hypothalmus matures, activation of the HPA axis (hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal axis) initiates labour though two hormonal mechanisms. The end pathway of both mechanisms leads to myometrial contractions a mechanical cause of placental separation, from the shear force, contractile and involution changes in the uterus distorting the placentome.

==== Fetal [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] ====
* [[Adrenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH]] increases fetal cortisol, which acts by two mechanisms:
# Increases Prostaglandin F2α which both abolishes the progesterone block, and lowers the oxytocin receptor threshold; and increases expression of relaxin, stretching the pelvic ligaments 
# Increases expression of PTGS in the fetal trophoblast cells
* PTGS in turn produces prostaglandin E2, which is a catalyst for pregnenalone to C-19 steroids, such as estrogen. 
* Estrogen increases: 
# Vaginal lubrication
# Softening of collagen fibre structures in the cervix, vaginal, and associated tissues.
# Increases contraction associated proteins (i.e. connexins)
# Placental shedding by physiological inflammation, note pathological inflammation often leads to retention of membranes (i.e. placentitis)

==== Fetal Oxytocin ====

As the HPA axis activates the posterior pituitary of the fetus begins to increase production of oxytocin, which stimulates the maternal myometrium to contract.

=== Cellular changes of placental separation === 
In the seventh month of pregnancy the MHC-I complexes increase in the interplacentomal arcade reducs the bi- and tri-nucleate cells, a source of immune suppression in pregnancy. By the ninth month the endometrial lining has thinned (due to loss of trophoblast giant cells) which exposes the endometrium directly to the fetal trophoblast epithelium. With this exposure and the increase in maternal MHC-I, T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, and macrophages induce apoptosis of trophoblast cells and endometrial epithelial cells, facilitating placental release. Th1 cells attract an influx of phagocytic leukocytes into the placentome at separation, allowing further degration of the extracellular matrix.

===Vascular changes of placental separation ===
After delivery, loss of fetal blood return to the placenta allows for shrinkage and collapse of the cotyledonary villi with subsequent fetal membrane separation

==Active management==
Methods of active management include [[umbilical cord clamping]], stimulation of uterine contraction and cord traction.

===Umbilical cord clamping===
{{Main|Umbilical cord clamping}}
Active management routinely involves clamping of the [[umbilical cord]], often within seconds or minutes of birth.

===Uterine contraction===
[[Uterine contraction]] assists in delivering the placenta. Uterine contraction reduces the placental surface area, often forming a temporary hematoma at their former interface.  Myometrial contractions can be induced with medication, usually [[oxytocin]] via intramuscular injection. The use of [[ergometrine]], on the other hand, is associated with nausea or vomiting and hypertension.&lt;ref name="Cochrane database"/&gt;

[[Breastfeeding]] soon after birth stimulates oxytocin which increases uterine tone, and through physical mechanisms uterine massage (the [[fundus (uterus)|fundus]]) also causes uterine contractions.

===Cord traction===
Controlled cord traction (CCT) consists of pulling on the umbilical cord while applying counter pressure to help deliver the placenta.&lt;ref name="HofmeyrMshweshwe2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmeyr|first1=G Justus|last2=Mshweshwe|first2=Nolundi T|last3=Gülmezoglu|first3=A Metin|last4=Hofmeyr|first4=G Justus|title=Controlled cord traction for the third stage of labour|year=2015|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008020.pub2|pmid=25631379|volume=1|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|pages=CD008020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be uncomfortable for the mother. Its performance requires specific training. Premature cord traction can pull the placenta before it has naturally detached from the uterine wall, resulting in hemorrhage. Controlled cord traction requires the immediate clamping of the [[umbilical cord]].

A [[Cochrane review]] came to the results that controlled cord traction does not clearly reduce severe postpartum hemorrhage (defined as blood loss &gt;1000 mL) but overall resulted in a small reduction in postpartum hemorrhage (defined as blood loss &gt;500 mL) and mean blood loss. It did reduce the risk of manual placenta removal. The review concluded that use of controlled cord traction should be recommended if the care provider has the skills to administer it safely.&lt;ref name="HofmeyrMshweshwe2015"/&gt;

===Manual placenta removal===
Manual placenta removal is the evacuation of the placenta from the uterus by hand.&lt;ref name="pmid15207663"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dehbashi S, Honarvar M, Fardi FH |title=Manual removal or spontaneous placental delivery and postcesarean endometritis and bleeding |journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=12–5 |date=July 2004 |pmid=15207663 |doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2003.11.001 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002072920300482X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually carried out under [[anesthesia]] or more rarely, under [[sedation]] and [[analgesia]]. A hand is inserted through the [[vagina]] into the uterine cavity and the placenta is detached from the uterine wall and then removed manually. A placenta that does not separate easily from the uterine surface indicates the presence of [[placenta accreta]].

===Efficacy of active management===
A [[Cochrane database]] study&lt;ref name="Cochrane database"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prendiville|first1=Walter JP|last2=Elbourne|first2=Diana|last3=McDonald|first3=Susan J|last4=Begley|first4=Cecily M|title=Active versus expectant management in the third stage of labour|year=2000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000007|pmid=10908457|issue=3|pages=CD000007|journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that blood loss and the risk of [[postpartum bleeding]] will be reduced in women offered active management of the third stage of labour. A summary&lt;ref name=Chelmow/&gt; of the Cochrane study came to the results that active management of the third stage of labour, consisting of controlled cord traction, early cord clamping plus drainage, and a prophylactic oxytocic agent, reduced postpartum haemorrhage by 500 or 1000 mL or greater, as well as related morbidities including mean blood loss, incidences of postpartum haemoglobin becoming less than 9 g/dL, blood transfusion, need for supplemental iron postpartum, and length of third stage of labour. Although active management increased adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and headache, women were less likely to be dissatisfied.&lt;ref name=Chelmow&gt;''[[British Medical Journal|BMJ]]'' summary of the Cochrane group metanalysis, at [http://clinicalevidence.bmj.com/ceweb/conditions/pac/1410/1410_I1.jsp Postpartum Hemorrhage: prevention] by David Chelmow.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retained placenta==
A [[retained placenta]] is a placenta that doesn't undergo expulsion within a normal time limit. Risks of retained placenta include hemorrhage and infection. If the placenta fails to deliver in 30 minutes in a hospital environment, manual extraction may be required if heavy ongoing bleeding occurs, and very rarely a [[curettage]] is necessary to ensure that no remnants of the placenta remain (in rare conditions with very adherent placenta, [[placenta accreta]]).  However, in birth centers and attended home birth environments, it is common for licensed care providers to wait for the placenta's birth up to 2 hours in some instances.

==Non-humans==
In most mammalian species, the mother bites through the cord and consumes the placenta, primarily for the benefit of [[prostaglandin]] on the uterus after birth. This is known as [[placentophagy]].  However, it has been observed in zoology that chimpanzees apply themselves to nurturing their offspring, and keep the fetus, cord, and placenta intact until the cord dries and detaches the next day.

The placenta exists in most mammals and some reptiles.  It is probably [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], having arisen separately in evolution rather than being inherited from one distant common ancestor.

Studies on pigs indicate that the duration of placenta expulsion increases significantly with increased duration of [[farrowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |  doi = 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2003.10.008 | last1 = Rens | first1 = B. | last2 = Van Der Lende | first2 = T. | title = Parturition in gilts: duration of farrowing, birth intervals and placenta expulsion in relation to maternal, piglet and placental traits | journal = Theriogenology | volume = 62 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 331–352 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15159125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Reye syndrome''' is a rapidly progressive [[encephalopathy]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Symptoms may include [[vomiting]], personality changes, confusion, [[seizure]]s, and [[loss of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; Even though [[hepatotoxicity|liver toxicity]] typically occurs, [[jaundice]] usually does not.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Death occurs in 20–40% of those affected and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of [[brain damage]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sch2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrör|first1=K|title=Aspirin and Reye syndrome: a review of the evidence.|journal=Paediatric drugs|date=2007|volume=9|issue=3|pages=195–204|pmid=17523700|doi=10.2165/00148581-200709030-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; It usually begins shortly after recovery from a [[viral infection]], such as [[influenza]] or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009&gt;{{cite web|title=NINDS Reye's Syndrome Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm|website=NINDS|accessdate=August 8, 2016|date=September 25, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801041308/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/reyes_syndrome/reyes_syndrome.htm|archive-date=August 1, 2016|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 90% of cases in children are associated with [[aspirin]] (salicylate) use.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; [[Inborn errors of metabolism]] are also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt; Changes on blood tests may include a [[hyperammonemia|high blood ammonia level]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar level]], and prolonged [[prothrombin time]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Often the [[hepatomegaly|liver is enlarged]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is typically by avoiding the use of aspirin in children.&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; When aspirin was withdrawn for use in children a decrease of more than 90% in rates of Reye syndrome was seen.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; Early diagnosis improves outcomes.&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; Treatment is [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; [[Mannitol]] may be used to help with the [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]].&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, history, and culture --&gt;
The first detailed description of Reye syndrome was in 1963 by [[Douglas Reye]], an Australian pathologist.&lt;ref name=Os2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMillan|first1=Julia A.|last2=Feigin|first2=Ralph D.|last3=DeAngelis|first3=Catherine|last4=Jones|first4=M.

==Causes==
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; It usually begins shortly after recovery from a [[viral infection]], such as [[influenza]] or [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009/&gt; About 90% of cases in children are associated with [[aspirin]] (salicylate) use.&lt;ref name=Pug2008/&gt; [[Inborn errors of metabolism]] are also a risk factor.&lt;ref name=Sch2007/&gt;

The association with aspirin has been shown through epidemiological studies. The diagnosis of "Reye Syndrome" greatly decreased in the 1980s, when genetic testing for [[inborn errors of metabolism]] was becoming available in [[developed country|developed countries]].&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"/&gt; A retrospective study of 49 survivors of cases diagnosed as "Reye's Syndrome" showed that the majority of the surviving patients had various metabolic disorders, particularly a fatty-acid oxidation disorder [[medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orlowski JP |title=Whatever happened to Reye's syndrome?

===Aspirin===
There is an association between taking [[aspirin]] for viral illnesses and the development of Reye syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hurwitz | first1 = E. S. | title = Reye's syndrome | journal = Epidemiologic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = 249–253 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2680560}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no animal model of Reye syndrome has been developed in which aspirin causes the condition.&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR |title=Is aspirin a cause of Reye's syndrome? A case against |journal=Drug Safety |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=225–31 |year=2002 |pmid=11994026 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dsf/2002/00000025/00000004/art00001 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200225040-00001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023203232/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/dsf/2002/00000025/00000004/art00001 |archivedate=October 23, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The serious symptoms of Reye syndrome appear to result from damage to cellular [[mitochondria]],&lt;ref name="pmid18725066"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gosalakkal JA, Kamoji V |title=Reye syndrome and reye-like syndrome |journal=Pediatric Neurology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=198–200 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18725066 |doi=10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the liver, and there are a number of ways that aspirin could cause or exacerbate mitochondrial damage. A potential increased risk of developing Reye syndrome is one of the main reasons that aspirin has not been recommended for use in children and teenagers, the age group for which the risk of lasting serious effects is highest.

In some countries, oral mouthcare product [[Bonjela]] (not the form specifically designed for teething) has labeling cautioning against its use in children, given its [[salicylate]] content. There have been no cases of Reye syndrome following its use, and the measure is a precaution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON044014 |title=New advice on oral salicylate gels in under 16s |publisher=[[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426205906/http://www.mhra.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pressreleases/CON044014 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other medications containing salicylates are often similarly labeled as a precaution.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), the U.S. Surgeon General, the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be given to children under 19 years of age during episodes of fever-causing illnesses. Hence, in the [[United States]], it is advised that the opinion of a doctor or pharmacist should be obtained before anyone under 19 years of age is given any medication containing aspirin (also known on some medicine labels as acetylsalicylate, salicylate, acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, or salicylic acid).

Current advice in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] is that aspirin should not be given to those under the age of 16 years, unless specifically indicated in [[Kawasaki disease]] or in the prevention of blood clot formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[British National Formulary for Children]] |chapter=2.9 Antiplatelet drugs |year=2007 |pages=151 |publisher=British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Differential diagnosis===
Causes for similar symptoms include
* Various inborn [[metabolic disorders]]
* [[Viral encephalitis]]
* [[Drug overdose]] or [[poison]]ing
* [[Head trauma]]
* [[Liver failure]] due to other causes
* [[Meningitis]]
* [[Kidney failure]]
* [[Shaken baby syndrome]]

==Prognosis==
Documented cases of Reye syndrome in adults are rare. The recovery of adults with the syndrome is generally complete, with liver and brain function returning to normal within two weeks of onset.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In children, mild to severe permanent brain damage is possible, especially in infants.  Over thirty percent of the cases reported in the United States from 1981 through 1997 resulted in fatality.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Epidemiology==
Reye syndrome occurs almost exclusively in children.  While a few adult cases have been reported over the years, these cases do not typically show permanent neural or liver damage. Unlike in the UK, the surveillance for Reye syndrome in the US is focused on patients under 18 years of age.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1980, after the CDC began cautioning physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses, the incidence of Reye syndrome in the United States began to decline. However, the decline began prior to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s issue of warning labels on aspirin in 1986.&lt;ref name="Orlowski JP, Hanhan UA, Fiallos MR 2002 225–31"/&gt; In the United States between 1980 and 1997, the number of reported cases of Reye syndrome decreased from 555 cases in 1980 to about 2 cases per year since 1994. During this time period 93% of reported cases for which racial data were available occurred in whites and the median age was six years. In 93% of cases a viral illness had occurred  in the preceding three-week period. For the period 1991-1994, the annual rate of hospitalizations due to Reye syndrome in the US was estimated to be between 0.2 and 1.1 per million population less than 18 years of age.

During the 1980s, a case-control study carried out in the United Kingdom also demonstrated an association between Reye syndrome and aspirin exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall SM, Plaster PA, Glasgow JF, Hancock P |title=Preadmission antipyretics in Reye's syndrome |journal=Arch. Dis. Child. |volume=63 |issue=7 |pages=857–66 |year=1988 |pmid=3415311 |doi=10.1136/adc.63.7.857 |pmc=1779086}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1986, the United Kingdom [[Committee on Safety of Medicines]] issued warnings against the use of aspirin in children under 12 years of age and warning labels on aspirin-containing medications were introduced. UK surveillance for Reye syndrome documented a decline in the incidence of the illness after 1986. The reported incidence rate of Reye syndrome decreased from a high of 0.63 per 100,000 population less than 12 years of age in 1983/84 to 0.11 in 1990/91.

From November 1995 to November 1996 in France, a national survey of pediatric departments for children under 15 years of age with unexplained [[encephalopathy]] and a threefold (or greater) increase in serum aminotransferase and/or ammonia led to the identification of nine definite cases of Reye syndrome (0.79 cases per million children).  Eight of the nine children with Reye syndrome were found to have been exposed to aspirin.  In part because of this survey result, the French Medicines Agency reinforced the international attention to the relationship between aspirin and Reye syndrome by issuing its own public and professional warnings about this relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Autret-Leca E |title=Incidence of Reye's syndrome in France: a hospital-based survey |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=54 |issue=8 |pages=857–62 |year=2001 |pmid=11470397|doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(00)00366-8 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Jonville-Béra AP |author3=Llau ME |display-authors=3 |last4=Bavoux |first4=F |last5=Saudubray |first5=JM |last6=Laugier |first6=J |last7=Devictor |first7=D |last8=Barbier |first8=P |last9=French Departments Of |first9=Paediatrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The syndrome is named after Dr. [[Douglas Reye]], who, along with fellow physicians Drs. Graeme Morgan and Jim Baral, published the first study of the syndrome in 1963 in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reye RD, Morgan G, Baral J |title=Encephalopathy and fatty degeneration of the viscera.

Also in 1964, Dr. George Johnson and colleagues published an investigation of an outbreak of influenza B that described 16 children who developed neurological problems, four of whom had a profile remarkably similar to Reye syndrome.  Some investigators refer to this disorder as Reye-Johnson syndrome, although it is more commonly called Reye syndrome. In 1979, Dr. Karen Starko and colleagues conducted a case-control study in Phoenix, Arizona and found the first statistically-significant link between aspirin use and Reye syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Starko KM, Ray CG, Dominguez LB, Stromberg WL, Woodall DF |title=Reye's syndrome and salicylate use| journal=Pediatrics|date=December 1980| volume=66|issue=6| pages=859–864|pmid=7454476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in Ohio and Michigan soon confirmed her findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mortimor|first=Edward A., Jr.|title=Reye Syndrome-Ohio, Michigan|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|issue=29|date=June 1, 1980|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/6/810|pmid=7079050|volume=69|pages=532, 810–2|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611051716/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/69/6/810|archivedate=June 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to the use of aspirin during an upper respiratory tract or chickenpox infection as a possible trigger of the syndrome.  Beginning in 1980, the CDC cautioned physicians and parents about the association between Reye syndrome and the use of salicylates in children and teenagers with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses.  In 1982 the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory, and in 1986 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] required a Reye syndrome-related warning label for all aspirin-containing medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Aspirin Labels to Warn About Reye Syndrome|author=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/aspirin-labels-to-warn-about-reye-syndrome.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 8, 1986|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064153/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/aspirin-labels-to-warn-about-reye-syndrome.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SPIRAL: Selected Patient Information Resources in Asian Languages''' is a web resource that connects people to authoritative health information in [[Languages of Asia|Asian languages]] that is freely available on the World Wide Web. SPIRAL is currently maintained by the [[Tufts University]] Hirsh Health Sciences Library and funded by grant from the [http://nnlm.gov/ner/ New England Region of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine] under contract NLM-00-101/SMS.

The goals of the SPIRAL project are to:

:#Identify authoritative, Web-based consumer health materials in [[East Asian languages]]
:#Facilitate access to these materials via the SPIRAL Web site.
:#Promote the use of consumer health materials on the SPIRAL Web site among health care providers and patients

==History==
SPIRAL began as a collaborative endeavor between the [http://www.scchc.org/ South Cove Community Health Center], New England’s premier primary and preventative health center for Asian Americans, and the [http://www.library.tufts.edu/hhsl/ Tufts University Hirsh Health Sciences Library]. Long-time neighbors in the Chinatown section of Boston, the Tufts University Hirsh Health Sciences Library and South Cove Community Health Center entered into a collaborative partnership in 2001 to address a growing need for Asian language health information in the Boston-area. In Massachusetts alone there has been a 68% increase in the Asian population. According to [[United States Census]] data, the Asian American population in the U.S. as a whole grew 72% between 1990 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html United States Census 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

Librarians at the Tufts University Hirsh Health Sciences Library are responsible for locating authoritative information on these languages. Methods employed to locate authoritative information include utilizing popular web search engines, soliciting recommendations from health provider and consumer health professionals working with Asian-language speaking populations and consulting consumer health resources focusing on multicultural health and cultural competency (e.g., journals, listservs). Resources are considered for inclusion on the SPIRAL web site if they have English-language versions of documents available for comparison and were created by authoritative sources. Information sources are classified as authoritative if they are:
:*Government agencies, both U.S. and international (U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]; [[National Health Service]], UK)
:*Universities (Georgia State University; NYU Center for Child Study)
:*Hospitals ([[Harborview Medical Center]] in Seattle, WA)
:*Premier non-profit health agencies (American Cancer Society; [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]], UK)
:*Multi-lingual health specialists who have recommended or submitted information for inclusion

Selected resources are organized on the SPIRAL web site by health topic and by language. Qualified, volunteer translators have reproduced the SPIRAL web site and related materials into the target languages to allow native speakers to navigate the site more easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45592">The '''Seven Countries Study''' is an [[epidemiological study|epidemiological]] [[longitudinal study]] directed by [[Ancel Keys]] at what is today the [[University of Minnesota]] Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene &amp; Exercise Science (LPHES). Begun in 1956 with a yearly grant of US$200,000 from the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]], the study was first published in 1978 and then followed up on its subjects every five years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the world's first&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; multicountry epidemiological study, it systematically examined the relationships between lifestyle, diet, [[coronary heart disease]] and [[stroke]] in different populations from different regions of the world. It directed attention to the causes of coronary heart disease and stroke, but also showed that an individual’s risk can be changed.

As of 2016, heated scientific debate continues. Project officer Henry Blackburn wrote in 1975, "Two strikingly polar attitudes persist on this subject, with much talk from each and little listening between."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Taubes quotes Blackburn in ''Good Calories, Bad Calories'' p. 22, from: {{cite journal | author = Blackburn Henry | year = 1975 | title = Contrasting Professional Views on Atherosclerosis and Coronary Disease | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 292 | issue = | pages = 105–107 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197501092920214 | pmid=1109429}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Leslie]] quotes a sympathetic colleague at the University of Minnesota who said Keys was "critical to the point of skewering”.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Ian.

==History==

In the 1940s, a University of Minnesota researcher, [[Ancel Keys]], postulated that the apparent epidemic of heart attacks in middle-aged American men was related to their mode of life and possibly modifiable physical characteristics. He first explored this idea in a group of Minnesota business and professional men (executives aged 45 to 55) that he recruited into a prospective study in 1947, the first of many cohort studies eventually mounted internationally. The U.S. Public Health Service agreed to fund the study (and then set up and proceeded to fund the [[Framingham Heart Study]] on a larger scale). The Minnesota men were followed through 1981 and the first major report appeared in 1963 after the fifteen-year follow-up study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keys A, Taylor HL, Blackburn H, Brozek J, Anderson JT, Simonson E | year = 1963 | title = Coronary Heart Disease among Minnesota Business and Professional Men Followed Fifteen Years | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 381–95 | doi=10.1161/01.cir.28.3.381 | pmid=14059458}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seven-1993&gt;{{cite book|author=Keys, Ancel in Kromhout, Daan, Menotti, Alessandro, and Blackburn, Henry (eds.)|title=The Seven Countries Study: A Scientific Adventure in Cardiovascular Disease Epidemiology|year=1993|publisher=printed by Brouwer Offset bv|location=Utrecht, The Netherlands|pages=16–25|chapter=ISBN is invalid: 90-6960-048-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study contributed much to survey methods and confirmed the results of larger studies that reported earlier on the predictive value for heart attack of several characteristics measured in health, the now-traditional risk factors of blood pressure and blood cholesterol level and cigarette smoking. Keys traveled widely with his wife Margaret who tested people's serum [[cholesterol]]. They sent their samples back to Minnesota for analysis. In 1952, Keys's hypothesis that coronary heart disease could be related to diet was first published in ''Voeding'' in The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Keys, A.|title=The Cholesterol Problem|journal=Voeding|year=1952|issue=13|pages=539–555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keys's work in post-wartime [[Naples]] led him to seek organization and funding for studies of different populations, as did his subsequent work in [[Uganda]]; [[Cape Town]], South Africa; [[Sardinia]]; [[Bologna]]; and [[Ilomantsi]], Finland; and with [[Japanese people|Japanese]] men living in [[Hawaii]] and in [[Japan]]. He decided to concentrate on men living in [[village]]s, rather than those in cities where the population moved around frequently.&lt;ref name=Seven-1993 /&gt;

In the mid-1950s, with improved methods and design, Keys recruited collaborating researchers in seven countries to mount the first cross-cultural comparison of heart attack risk in populations of men engaged in traditional occupations in cultures contrasting in diet, especially in the proportion of fat calories of different composition, the Seven Countries Study still under observation today.

The Seven Countries Study was formally started in fall 1958 in [[Yugoslavia]]. In total, 12,763 males, 40–59 years of age, were enrolled as 16 cohorts, in seven countries, in four regions of the world (United States, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Japan). One cohort is in the United States, two cohorts in Finland, one in the Netherlands, three in Italy, five in Yugoslavia (two in Croatia, and three in Serbia), two in Greece, and two in Japan. The entry examinations were performed between 1958 and 1964 with an average participation rate of 90%, lowest in the USA, with 75% and highest in one of the Japanese cohorts, with 100%.&lt;ref name="Keys_(1980)"&gt;Ancel Keys (ed), ''Seven Countries: A multivariate analysis of death and coronary heart disease'', 1980.

==Major findings==

The ''Seven Countries Study'' suggested that the risk and rates of [[cardiovascular risk|heart attack and stroke]] (CVR), both at the population level and at the individual level, [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] directly and independently to the level of total serum cholesterol, in seven sampled out countries. It demonstrated that the correlation between blood cholesterol level and [[Coronary artery disease|coronary heart disease]] (CHD) risk from 5 to 40 years follow-up is found consistently across different specially selected cultures in these seven countries. Cholesterol and obesity correlated with increased mortality from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;D.

It showed that the [[mortality rate]] after a coronary heart disease event or stroke was associated with the level of hypertension. In several cohorts of the study, stroke deaths exceeded deaths from coronary heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = van den Hoogen PC, Feskens EJ, Nagelkerke NJ, Menotti A, Nissinen A, Kromhout D | date = Jan 2000 | title = The relation between blood pressure and mortality due to coronary heart disease among men in different parts of the world | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 342 | issue = 1| pages = 1–8 | doi=10.1056/nejm200001063420101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Menotti A, Jacobs DR Jr, Blackburn H, Kromhout D, Nissinen A, Nedeljkovic S, Buzina R, Mohacek I, Seccareccia F, Giampaoli S, Dontas A, Aravanis C, Toshima H | date = Mar 1996 | title = Twenty-five-year prediction of stroke deaths in the seven countries study: the role of blood pressure and its changes | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 27 | issue = 3| pages = 381–7 | doi=10.1161/01.str.27.3.381}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hinted that differences in overall mortality between the different regions of the seven countries are largely associated with variation in cardiovascular mortality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Coronary deaths in the United States and Northern Europe greatly exceeded those in Southern Europe, even when controlled for age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, physical activity, and weight.

==Criticism==

===Early criticism===
Scientists differed on the best predictors of heart disease. In 1950 in ''Science'', [[John Gofman]] described separating lipoproteins into different densities in the University of California, Berkeley, [[ultracentrifuge]].&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 as part of a panel with Keys, Gofman agreed that reducing fat in the diet might help some heart patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Katz LN, Keys A, Gofman JW | year = 1952 | title = Atherosclerosis. A Symposium: Introduction | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/5/1/98.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Circulation | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 98–100 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.5.1.98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (and in this same issue of ''Circulation'' Keys explained that dietary [[cholesterol]] is not a factor in humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keys A | year = 1952 | title = Human Atherosclerosis and the Diet | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/5/1/115.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Circulation | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 115–118 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.5.1.115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1956 Gofman wrote that an ''atherogenic index'' (the combined levels of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] and [[Very low-density lipoprotein|VLDL]]) predicted atherosclerosis and heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gofman JW, Andrus EC ''et al.'' | year = 1956 | title = Evaluation of Serum Lipoprotein and Cholesterol Measurements as Predictors of Clinical Complications of Atherosclerosis: Report of a Cooperative Study of Lipoproteins and Atherosclerosis | url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/14/4/689.short | journal = Circulation | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 689–741 | doi = 10.1161/01.CIR.14.4.689 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 he wrote, "The serum cholesterol measurement can be a dangerously misleading guide in evaluation of the effect of diet upon the serum lipids."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gofman JW | year = 1958 | title = Diet in the prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction | url = http://www.ajconline.org/article/0002-9149%2858%2990058-4/abstract | journal = The American Journal of Cardiology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 271–283 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9149(58)90058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some offered hypotheses opposed to Keys. In 1966, based on their work and writing since 1956, George Campbell and [[Thomas L. Cleave]] published ''Diabetes, Coronary Thrombosis and the Saccharine Disease''. They argued that the [[lifestyle disease|chronic Western diseases]] such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, peptic ulcers and appendicitis are caused by one thing: "refined carbohydrate disease".&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 a distinguished pioneer in lipid research, Edward H. "Pete" Ahrens Jr. warned of oversimplifying the problem of diet and heart disease, saying the cause could be fat and cholesterol or it could be carbohydrates and triglycerides. Until evidence was produced, he questioned "the wisdom of prescribing low-fat diets for the general population."&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the study had begun, there had been criticism of its methods. Jacob Yerushalmy and Herman E. Hilleboe pointed out that, for an earlier study demonstrating this association (Atherosclerosis, a problem in newer public health), Keys had selected six countries out of 21 for which data were available. Analysis of the full dataset made the analysis between fat intake and heart disease less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yerushalmy J, Hilleboe HE | year = 1957 | title = Fat in the diet and mortality from heart disease. A methodologic note | url = | journal = NY State J Med | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 2343–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 when they published their critique,&lt;ref&gt;Weaver Jr., Warren (July 16, 1957) [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/07/16/93213608.pdf "2 Doubt Fat's Tie to Heart Disease"] The New York Times, retrieved February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Yerushalmy and Hilleboe seemed to some to be lecturing, "the association between the percentage of fat calories... and mortality from... heart disease is not valid" and then they call Keys's work a "tenuous association".&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Henry. [http://www.epi.umn.edu/cvdepi/essay/famous-polemics-on-diet-heart-theory/ "Famous Polemics on Diet-Heart Theory"] Regents of the University of Minnesota, retrieved February 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Keys, who was one of the first nutrition epidemiologists, wrote in every journal article that "causal relationships are not claimed". His reaction was to mount the Seven Countries Study, the first multicountry epidemiological study ever done.&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, pp. 44, 72, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary criticism===
Several scientists stepped forward at the time to disagree with Keys's conclusions. Published in 1973 and including his critique of Keys's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reiser Raymond | year = 1973 | title = Saturated fat in the diet and serum cholesterol concentration: a critical examination of the literature | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/26/5/524.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 524–555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Reiser found methodological and interpretational errors in a review of forty feeding trials of the relationship between saturated fat and circulating lipoproteins, notably confounding with [[trans-fatty acids|''trans''-fatty acids]].&lt;ref&gt;De Meester, Fabien, Sherma Zibadi and Ronald Ross Watson (June 7, 2010).

Mann, writing in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' (NEJM) in 1977, dismissed Keys's 1953 Mt.

Mann studied the mainly meat diet of Alaskan Eskimos, Congolese pygmies, and the Maasai of Tanzania and Kenya, and thought other factors like lack of exercise were responsible for heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?pid=166056385 "George V.

[[John Yudkin]] thought that sugar, not fat, was at the root of heart disease and other human ills. Keys wrote and promoted his disagreement in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keys A | year = 1971 | title = Sucrose in the diet and coronary heart disease | url = http://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/0021-9150%2871%2990049-9/abstract | journal = Atherosclerosis | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 193–202 | doi = 10.1016/0021-9150(71)90049-9 | pmid=4940760}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year Yudkin retired to write ''Pure, White and Deadly''.&lt;ref name=Yudkin&gt;Yudkin, John.

===Debate since 2000===
Controversy continues about the study itself,&lt;ref&gt;Taubes (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and about the strength and causality of the association between dietary fat and heart mortality, particularly as the study of cholesterol has become more sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Ravnskov (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Uffe Ravnskov]] (MD, PhD) published his book ''The Cholesterol Myths''&lt;ref&gt;[[Uffe Ravnskov]] (MD, PhD)''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMf3aFSdNag Cholesterol Myths]'' lecture via YouTube, retrieved October 31, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to found [[The International Network of Cholesterol Skeptics]].&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 article in [[Science (journal)|Science]] magazine entitled ''Nutrition: The Soft Science of Dietary Fat'', [[Gary Taubes]] wrote "it is still a debatable proposition whether the consumption of saturated fats above recommended levels (..) by anyone who's not already at high risk of heart disease will increase the likelihood of untimely death (..) [n]or have hundreds of millions of dollars in trials managed to generate compelling evidence that healthy individuals can extend their lives by more than a few weeks, if that, by eating less fat".&lt;ref&gt;Taubes (2001) ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCBMV6d9HSg Gary Taubes on Cholesterol and Science Practices]''; interview via YouTube, retrieved October 31, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taubes_(2001)"&gt;Taubes, Gary (2001).

Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A further critical analysis of the ''Seven Countries Study'' was undertaken by Taubes in his bestselling book ''[[Good Calories, Bad Calories]]'' (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Taubes (2007) ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6vpFV6Wkl4 Good Calories, Bad Calories]''; Talks at Google via YouTube, retrieved October 31, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by ''[[Why We Get Fat]]'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Taubes, Gary (2010) ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDneyrETR2o Why We Get Fat]''; Santa Cruz County Office of Education via YouTube, retrieved October 31, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Good Calories, Bad Calories'', Taubes wrote that the ''Seven Countries Study'' "was fatally flawed (..) Keys chose seven countries he knew in advance would support his hypothesis (..) [that] coronary heart disease is strongly influenced by the fats in the diet (..) [n]o consideration was given to alternative hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;Taubes (2007) pp.31-3, p.22, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2016 book ''The Case against Sugar'', Taubes states that "of all the factors measured in these populations, the two that tracked best with heart disease—as [[John Yudkin|Yudkin]] might have predicted—were sugar and saturated fat (..) and because populations in the study that ate a lot of one tended also to eat a lot of the other, Keys now suggested that this was ″adequate to explain the observed relationship between sucrose and [coronary heart disease] without recourse to the idea that sucrose″ (..) caused it. This was speculation (..) researchers typically assumed that if Keyes was right, Yudkin was wrong, and vice versa (..) [w]hen researchers realized that the French had relatively low rates of heart disease despite a diet that was rich in saturated fats, they wrote it off as an inexplicable ″[[French paradox|paradox]],″ and ignored the fact that the French traditionally consumed far less sugar than did populations—the Americans and British, most notably—in which coronary disease seemed to be a scourge."&lt;ref name="Taubes_(2016)"&gt;Taubes (2016) p.166ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Frank Hu]] led the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's report on saturated fat and cardiovascular disease, and [[Alice H. Lichtenstein]] said that the consensus is that a low-fat diet is "probably not a good idea" and that it might induce [[dyslipidemia]]. She said that the guidelines had changed (formerly recommending low fat, and now moderate fat) in 2000, and that the [[American Heart Association]] and the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] had revised guidelines as of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Hu and Alice Lichtenstein (September 16–17, 2014) in [http://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?File=18613 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Meeting 5] (event starts at 4:14) and [http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/DGAC-Meeting-5-Summary-508.pdf Day 1 Meeting Summary] (PDF).

'''Sexual masochism disorder''' (SMD) is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense [[sexual arousal]] in response to enduring moderate or extreme pain, suffering, or [[humiliation]].&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.).'' Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] ([[DSM-5]]) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] indicates that a person may have a masochistic sexual interest but that the diagnosis of Sexual Masochism Disorder would only apply to individuals  who also report psychosocial difficulties because of it.

==Related terms and conditions==

===Current terminology===
''Sexual masochism disorder'' is the term employed by the current version of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] ([[DSM-5]]) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;  It refers to the “recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors” (p.&amp;nbsp;694).  It is classified as one of the [[paraphilia]]s, called an “[[algolagnia|algolagnic disorder]]” (p.&amp;nbsp;685), which is one of the “anomalous activity preferences” (p.&amp;nbsp;685).  The formal diagnosis of ''Sexual Masochism Disorder'' would apply only if the individual experiences clinically significant distress to the individual or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

''Sadomasochism'' appears in the current version of the [[ICD|International Classification of Diseases]] ([[ICD-10]]) of the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name =ICD10&gt;World Health Organization. (2007). ''International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems'' (10th rev., version for 2007). Retrieved from http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/index.htm?gf60.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  It refers to the “preference for sexual activity that involves bondage or the infliction of pain or humiliation” (p.&amp;nbsp;172), and divides sadomasochism into ''masochism'' and ''sadism'' according to whether the individual prefers to be the recipient  or provider of it.  The ICD-10 specifies that mild forms of sadomasochism “are commonly used to enhance otherwise normal sexual activity” (p.&amp;nbsp;172), and that the diagnosis would apply only if the behavior is preferred or required for sexual gratification.  The condition is classified as one of the disorders of sexual preference, which includes the paraphilias (p.&amp;nbsp;170).

''[[BDSM]]'' is a colloquial term relating to individuals who willingly engage in consenting forms of pain or humiliation, typically for sexual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, A. (2009). ''Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices.'' New York: Taylor &amp; Francis. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not currently a diagnosable condition in either the DSM or ICD system.

===Previous terminology===
''Sexual masochism'' was the term employed in the DSM-III,&lt;ref name = DSM3&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1980). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; DSM-IV,&lt;ref name= DSM4&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1994). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; DSM-IV-TR.&lt;ref name = DSM4TR&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; Each manual noted that the condition referred to real rather than simulated or fantasized pain or humiliation.

''[[Sadomasochism|Masochism]]'' was the term employed by the DSM-II.&lt;ref name = DSM2&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1968). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2nd ed.).'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt;  In that manual, the condition was classified as a sexual deviation, which was used to describe “individuals whose sexual interests are directed primarily toward…coitus performed under bizarre circumstances” (p.&amp;nbsp;44).  The term “paraphilia” did not exist in the DSM-II, and diagnoses did not have specific criteria until DSM-III.

Although ''Sexual sadism'' was mentioned in DSM-I as one of the sexual deviations&lt;ref name = DSM1&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1952). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: Mental Disorders.'' Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;39), sexual masochism was not.

==Features==
The prevalence of Sexual Masochism disorder in the population is unknown, but the DSM-5 estimates 2.2% among males and 1.3% among females.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Extensive use of pornography depicting humiliation is sometimes associated with Sexual Masochism Disorder.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt;

Behaviors associated with Sexual Masochism Disorder can be acted out alone (e.g., binding, self-sticking pins, self-administration of electric shock, or self-mutilation) or with a partner (e.g., physical restraint, blindfolding, paddling, spanking, whipping, beating, electric shock, cutting, pinning and piercing, and humiliation such as by being urinated or defecated upon, being forced to crawl and bark like a dog, or being subjected to verbal abuse).&lt;ref name = DSM4TR/&gt; Behaviors sometimes include being forced to cross-dress or being treated like an infant.&lt;ref name = DSM4TR/&gt;

In extreme cases, accidental deaths can occur, such as from engaging in self-application of electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;Cairnes, F. J., &amp; Rainer, S. P. (1981). Death from electrocution during auto-erotic procedures. ''New Zealand Medical Journal, 94,'' 259-260.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most extreme cases of masochism was Bernd Brandes, who answered a person ad from [[Armin Meiwes]], who was seeking someone who wanted to be slaughtered and eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, J. M., &amp; Sutton, K. S. (2014). Paraphilia, gender dysphoria, and hypersexuality. In P. H. Blaney &amp; T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford textbook of psychopathology'' (3rd ed.) (pp. 589–614). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a phenomenological study of individual involved in sexual masochistic sessions,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, H., &amp; Ronel, N. (in print). Addicted to Pain. International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual Masochism was described as an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal.  It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much as described in the descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;Bensimon, M., Baruch, A., &amp; Ronel, N. (2013). The experience of gambling in an illegal casino: The gambling spin process. European Journal of Criminology, 10(1), 3–21.&lt;/ref&gt; A behavioral spin is described as a process one goes through that is characterized by a behavior growing in frequency and magnitude, as indicated by the Criminal Spin theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ronel, N. (2011). Criminal behavior, criminal mind: Being caught in a criminal spin. International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, 55(8), 1208 - 1233.&lt;/ref&gt; As it develops, it gains its own momentum which the individual finds almost impossible to terminate even when faced with known unwanted outcomes. For the participants in sexual masochistic sessions, the behavioral spin is manifested as a continuously reinforced process leading the masochist to engage in masochistic activity, perpetuating itself, and binding the addict to his/her behavior.

'''Sigmoidocele''' (also known as [[Pouch of Douglas]] descent) refers to a condition where the [[sigmoid colon]] descends (prolapses) into the [[lower pelvic]] cavity. &lt;ref name=Coloproctology&gt;{{cite book|last=Wexner|first=edited by Andrew P. Zbar, Steven D.|title=Coloproctology|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84882-755-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can obstruct the rectum and cause symptoms of obstructed defecation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/pelvic-relaxation-syndromes/cystoceles,-urethroceles,-enteroceles,-and-rectoceles|title=Cystoceles, Urethroceles, Enteroceles, and Rectoceles - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

Sigmoidocele normally occurs in females, and is uncommon. &lt;ref name=Coloproctology /&gt; 

==Pathophysiology==

The phenomenon is caused by a weak section of [[fascia| fascial supports]] of the vagina (the uterosacral cardinal ligament
complex and rectal vaginal septum), which allows a section of peritoneum containing the sigmoid colon to prolapse out of normal position and fall between the rectum and the vagina.&lt;ref name=ASCRS&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=senior editors, Bruce G. Wolff ... [et|title=The ASCRS textbook of colon and rectal surgery|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=0-387-24846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Diagnosis==
It is not possible to differentiate between a [[rectocele]] and a sigmoidocele on [[vaginal examination]]. [[Defecating proctogram| Defecating proctography]] will demonstrate a sigmoidocele during straining.

A '''smart gun''', by popular usage, is a [[Gun|firearm]] that is smart but only in the sense that it can detect its authorized user(s) or something that is normally only possessed by its authorized user(s). It is also called a ''personalized gun.''

Smart guns have one or more systems that allow them to fire only when activated by an authorized user. Those systems typically employ [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] chips or other proximity tokens, [[fingerprint recognition]], magnetic rings, or mechanical locks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/04/63066/|title=No Chip in Arm, No Shot From Gun|date=|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;     They can thereby prevent accidental shootings, gun thefts, and criminal usage by persons not authorized to use the guns.

Note that smart guns, per se, will allow their authorized users to commit many gun crimes such as armed robberies, drive-by shootings, assassinations, and massacres. However, as with other guns, adding [[locationized gun]] circuitry to smart guns will prevent their usage for those crimes.

Related to smart guns are other smart firearms safety devices such as biometric or RFID activated accessories and safes.

=== Biofire Technologies ===
Biofire Technologies is a Boston-based startup developing smart guns, started by young founder Kai Kloepfer, that aims to reduce the risk of accidental shootings and firearm suicides with technology. They have a working smart gun prototype that uses a fingerprint sensor to unlock the firearm for use. It can be programmed to register a range of fingerprints so that the gun would be able to be used, for example, by a spouse or trusted friend in addition to the owner.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Geoffrey A.|title=A 19-Year-Old Just Built the First Fingerprint-Reading Smart Gun|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-19-year-old-just-built-the-first-fingerprint-reading-smart-gun-1475850207|work=Wall Street Journal|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== iGun Technology Corp. ===
Led by Jonathan Mossberg, iGun Technology Corporation has developed a 12-gauge shotgun that uses magnetic spectrum token technology, similar in function to RFID, to secure the gun. The shotgun is activated when in close proximity to a ring worn on the trigger hand of the user. A 2013 report by the [[National Institute of Justice]] stated that iGun's product "could be considered the first personalized firearm to go beyond a prototype to an actual commercializable or production-ready product."&lt;ref name="NatInstituteJustice"&gt;Greene, Mark (June 2013).

=== Safe Gun Technology Co. ===
Safe Gun Technology Co., led by CEO Tom Lynch, is developing a variation on the traditional smart gun in the form of fingerprint retrofit kits for installation on home defense guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Safe Gun Technology - Where Freedom Meets Safety|url = http://www.safeguntechnology.co/|website = Safe Gun Technology - Where Freedom Meets Safety|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their retrofit technology, once installed, required an authorized user's fingerprint to unlock the gun and make it ready to fire. Safe Gun Tech is currently field-testing their fingerprint retrofit kit on an AR-15 rifle.

=== New Jersey Institute of Technology ===
[[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT)'s smart gun relies on [[biometric]] sensors in the grip and [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]] that can track a gun owner's hand size, strength, and Dynamic grip style, also known as (DGR) Dynamic Grip Recognition. The gun is programmed to recognize only the owner or anyone whom the owner wishes to authorize.&lt;ref name="Carter2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Gregg Lee|title=Gun Control in the United States: A Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DhRzjUeZK4oC&amp;pg=PA373|date= 2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-760-9|pages=373–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TriggerSmart ===
TriggerSmart has developed a personalised childproof smart gun using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Basically, only the authorised user can fire the weapon and the gun is safe in the hands of a child or an intruder in the home. Triggersmart is an Irish company that patented and achieved a working prototype of a smart gun, or "personalized gun", that uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|EcIpmAaFjGE|TriggerSmart Childproof RFID Smart Gun}}&lt;/ref&gt; TriggerSmart has also patented and developed Wide Area Control ( WAC) where weapons can be remotely enabled and disabled using various wireless protocols. Safe zones can be created around schools and airports so that only authorised guns can operate in the designated area. Alternatively,  when authorised guns leave the authorised area they can be tracked and disabled outside the safe zone. GPS and GSM capability can be added so data regarding, where and when, fired can be recorded and electronic notifications be sent to authorised partners. WAC can also be employed to help prevent Green on Blue fire or so called 'Friendly fire'.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Reception ==
Smart guns have been criticized by the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Friess |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/04/63066 |title=No Chip in Arm, No Shot From Gun|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while being supported by an anti-gun-violence campaign connected to the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, which says "it has 80 law enforcement agencies interested in the technology."&lt;ref name="rpush"/&gt;

The NRA and its membership boycotted [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] after it was revealed in 1999 that the company was developing a smart gun for the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="verge-smartguns" /&gt;&lt;ref name="njcom-smartguns" /&gt;  The official policy of the [[NRA-ILA]], the lobbying arm of the NRA, with regards to smart guns, is as follows: "The NRA doesn't oppose the development of "smart" guns, nor the ability of Americans to voluntarily acquire them. However, NRA opposes any law prohibiting Americans from acquiring or possessing firearms that don't possess "smart" gun technology."&lt;ref&gt;NRA-ILA Issues.

Retrieved April 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  There has been scattered support for voluntary test programs from some law enforcement leaders, including San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr, who has said, "Officer safety is huge, so you wouldn't want to compel that upon officers.  But we have so many officers who are so into technology, I am all but certain there are officers that would be willing to do such a pilot.".&lt;ref&gt;BENNY EVANGELISTA.

Richard Beary, president of the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]], said there would be "plenty of agencies interested in beta testing the technology" and that "[a smart gun] can't be 99 percent accurate, it has to be 100 percent accurate. It has to work every single time."&lt;ref name="rpush"&gt;Michael S. Rosenwald.

=== New Jersey mandate ===
In the United States, [[New Jersey]] passed the [[New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law|Childproof Handgun Bill]] into state law on December 23, 2002, which will eventually require that all guns sold in the state of New Jersey have a mechanism to prevent unauthorized users from firing it, taking effect three years after such a smart gun is approved by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20022003/A1000/700_S1.PDF ASSEMBLY LAW AND PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE STATEMENT TO ASSEMBLY, No. 700 with committee amendments]&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons used by law enforcement officers would be exempt from the smart gun requirement.&lt;ref name="verge-smartguns"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gun control: the NRA wants to take America's smart guns away|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/5/5683504/gun-control-the-nra-wants-to-take-smart-guns-away|work=The Verge|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="njcom-smartguns"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nix, Naomi|date=October 14, 2013|title=Could 'smart-guns' finally hit New Jersey stores?|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/could_smart-guns_finally_hit_new_jersey_stores.html|publisher=[[NJ.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-smartguns"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearce|first=Jeremy|title=Smart Guns, A Clever Bit of Legislating|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/12/nyregion/smart-guns-a-clever-bit-of-legislating.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=1 December 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, New Jersey State Senate Majority leader, [[Loretta Weinberg]], who had originally sponsored the New Jersey bill while serving in the State Assembly, stated that she would consider repealing the law if, after doing so, the [[National Rifle Association]] would agree not to impede the development of better smart guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all/democrat-we-will-reverse-smart-gun-law|title=N.J.

The potential effects of New Jersey's smart gun law has also influenced opposition to the technology in the United States; two attempts to sell the [[Armatix iP1]] smart gun in California and Maryland were met with opposition from gun rights groups, who argued that allowing the gun to be sold in the United States would trigger the law.&lt;ref name="verge-smartguns"/&gt; In December 2014, the Attorney General of New Jersey determined that the Armatix iP1 would not meet the legal criteria sufficient to trigger the mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NOT SO SMART: New Jersey AG Rejects Brady Attempt to Trigger "Smart Gun" Law - Bearing Arms - new jersey, Smart Guns|url = http://bearingarms.com/smart-new-jersey-ag-rejects-brady-attempt-trigger-smart-gun-law/|website = Bearing Arms|accessdate = 2015-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reliability Concerns===
Many firearm enthusiasts object to smart guns on a philosophical and regulatory basis. Gun ownership advocate [[Kenneth W. Royce]], writing under the pen name of "Boston T. Party", wrote that "no defensive firearm should ever rely upon any technology more advanced than [[Newtonian physics]]. That includes batteries, radio links, encryption, scanning devices and microcomputers."&lt;ref name="Party2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Party|first=Boston T.|title=Boston's Gun Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZoNAAAACAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Javelin Press|isbn=978-1-888766-06-6|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]] told a House appropriations subcommittee that his agency is exploring smart gun technology as a means for curbing gun violence. The Justice Department requested $382.1 million in increased spending for its fiscal year 2014 budget for "gun safety," a figure which includes $2 million for "Gun Safety Technology" grants, which would award prizes for technologies that are "proven to be reliable and effective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/holder-we-want-to-explore-gun-tracking-bracelets/|publisher=[[Washington Free Beacon]]accessdate=April 11, 2014|title=Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets |date=April 7, 2014|author=Elizabeth Harrington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013 the [[European Commission]] published a document by commissioner [[Cecilia Malmström]], stating that "the Commission will work with the firearms industry to explore technological solutions, such as biometric sensors where personal data is stored in the firearm, for ensuring that purchased firearms may only be used by their legal owner. It will carry out a detailed cost-benefit analysis on the question of making such 'smart gun' security features mandatory for firearms lawfully sold in the EU."&lt;ref&gt;European Commission: [http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/trafficking-in-firearms/docs/1_en_act_part1_v12.pdf ''Firearms and the internal security of the EU: protecting citizens and disrupting illegal trafficking''], published October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential disadvantages ==
Joseph Steinberg writes that "biometrics take time to process and are often inaccurate – especially when a user is under duress – as is likely going to be the case in any situation in which he needs to brandish a gun.... it is not ideal to add a requirement for power to devices utilized in cases of emergency that did not need electricity previously. How many fire codes allow fire extinguishers that require a battery to operate?" Steinberg further writes that "smartguns might be hackable" or "susceptible to government tracking or jamming...Firearms must be able to be disassembled in order to be cleaned and maintained. One of the principles of information security is that someone who has physical access to a machine can undermine its security."&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg Joseph (May 4, 2014). [https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/05/04/smartguns/ "Forbes: Why You Should Be Concerned About The New 'Smart Guns' (Whether You Love Or Hate Guns)"]. ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow up piece published in January 2016, Steinberg noted that smartguns that utilize wireless communications to detect that the shooter is wearing a watch, bracelet, or other device may "allow criminals (and police) to identify who is carrying a weapon" undermining "one of the reasons that some states require people to carry their weapons concealed; if all civilian-carried guns are concealed criminals do not know who is carrying and who is not, so they have to fear mugging everyone, which protects the unarmed as well as the armed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.inc.com/joseph-steinberg/smartguns-why-police-dont-want-them-and-neither-should-you.html |work=Inc. | title=Smartguns: Why Police Don't Want Them and Neither Should You | date=January 11, 2016 | accessdate=January 11, 2016 |author=Joseph Steinberg |authorlink=Joseph Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an article on an [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] website, other concerns are that smart guns may make a firearm more likely to fail when needed for self-defense.  "Batteries go dead, temperature or moisture can harm electronics and many 'smart gun' designs, such as Armatix's iP1, require that a person wear a watch, bracelet, or other device." Smart guns may also take considerable time to be ready for firing from a "cold start."&lt;ref&gt;Miniter, Frank.

[[File:Mole2.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Lazzaretto of Ancona]] is an 18th-century building constructed on an artificial island to serve as a [[quarantine station]] and [[leprosarium]] for the port town of [[Ancona]], Italy.]]'''Social distancing''' is a term applied to certain nonpharmaceutical [[infection control]] actions that are taken by [[public health]] officials to stop or slow down the spread of a highly [[infection|contagious disease]]. The objective of social distancing is to reduce the probability of contact between persons carrying an infection, and others who are not infected, so as to minimize [[Transmission (medicine)|disease transmission]], morbidity and ultimately, [[Mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/english/safety/pandemic-planning-social-distancing.pdf?lang=eng Pandemic Planning - Social Distancing Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social distancing is most effective when the infection can be transmitted via droplet contact (coughing or sneezing); direct physical contact, including sexual contact; indirect physical contact (e.g. by touching a contaminated surface such as a [[fomite]]); or airborne transmission (if the microorganism can survive in the air for long periods).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/php/185/185_factsheet_social_distancing.pdf "Information about Social Distancing," Santa Clara Public Health Department.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social distancing may be less effective in cases where the infection is transmitted primarily via [[fecal-oral transmission|contaminated water or food]] or by [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] such as mosquitoes or other insects, and less frequently from person to person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/community_mitigation-sm.pdf "Interim Pre-Pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States—Early, Targeted, Layered Use of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions," CDC, Feb 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest references to social distancing dates to the seventh century BC in the [[Book of Leviticus]], 13:46: "And the leper in whom the plague is...he shall dwell alone; [outside] the camp shall his habitation be."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+13&amp;version=AKJV Bible Gateway, Authorized King James Version, Leviticus 13:46]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[leper colonies]] and [[lazaretto]]s were established as a means of preventing the spread of [[leprosy]] and other contagious diseases through social distancing,&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Leprosy Charles Léon Souvay, "Leprosy," Catholic Encyclopedia (1913), Volume 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; until transmission was understood and effective treatments were invented.

== Examples ==
Some examples of social distancing used to control the spread of contagious illnesses include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/panflu_ethic_guidelines.pdf Kathy Kinlaw, Robert Levine, "Ethical Guidelines on Pandemic Influenza," ''CDC'', December 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

* "self-shielding" measures for individuals include limiting face-to-face contacts, conducting business by phone or online, avoiding public places and reducing unnecessary travel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/11/06-0255_article Glass RJ, Glass LM, Beyeler WE, Min HJ.

==Effectiveness==
Research indicates that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately in order to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maharaj S, Kleczkowski A | year = 2012 | title = Controlling epidemic spread by social distancing: Do it well or not at all | url = https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-679 | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 12 | issue = 1| page = 679 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-12-679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1918 flu pandemic]], authorities in the US implemented school closures, bans on public gatherings, and other social distancing interventions in Philadelphia and in St. Louis, but in Philadelphia the delay of five days in initiating these measures allowed transmission rates to double three to five times, whereas a more immediate response in St. Louis was significant in reducing transmission there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hatchett RJ, Mecher CE, Lipsitch M |title=Public health interventions and epidemic intensity during the 1918 influenza pandemic |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/18/7582 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7582–7587 |year=2007 |pmid=17416679 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0610941104 |pmc=1849867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bootsma and Ferguson analyzed social distancing interventions in 16 US cities during the 1918 epidemic and found that time-limited interventions reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10–30%), and that the impact was often very limited because the interventions were introduced too late and lifted too early. It was observed that several cities experienced a second epidemic peak after social distancing controls were lifted, because susceptible individuals who had been protected were now exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bootsma MC, Ferguson NM |title=The effect of public health measures on the 1918 influenza pandemic in U.S. cities |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/18/7588 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7588–7593 |year=2007 |pmid=17416677 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0611071104 |pmc=1849868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School closures===
School closures were shown to reduce [[morbidity]] from the [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|Asian Flu]] by 90% during the 1957-58 outbreak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chin TD, Foley JF, Doto IL, Gravelle CR, Weston J | year = 1960 | title = Morbidity and mortality characteristics of Asian strain influenza | url = | journal = Public Health Rep. | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 148–58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the US, 2004-2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheeler CC, Erhart LM, Jehn ML | year = 2010 | title = Effect of school closure on the incidence of influenza among school -age children in Arizona | url = | journal = Public Health Reports | volume = 125 | issue = 6| pages = 851–859 | doi=10.1177/003335491012500612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates during the [[2009 influenza pandemic|2009 flu epidemic]] in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/flu-pandemic-study-supports-social-distancing  Flu Pandemic Study Supports Social Distancing," ''NIH Research Matters,'' June 6, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace closures===
[[Modeling and simulation]] studies based on US data suggest that if 10% of affected workplaces are closed, the overall infection transmission rate is around 11.9% and the epidemic peak time is slightly delayed. In contrast, if 33% of affected workplaces are closed, the attack rate decreases to 4.9%, and the peak time is delayed by 1 week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rousculp MD, Johnston SS, Palmer LA, Chu BC, Mahadevia PJ, Nichol KL | year = 2010 | title = Attending work while sick: implication of flexible sick leave policies | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 10| pages = 1009–1013 | doi=10.1097/jom.0b013e3181f43844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quarantine of contacts and suspected cases===
During the 2003 [[SARS]] outbreak in Singapore, some 8,000 persons were subjected to mandatory home quarantine and an additional 4,300 were required to self-monitor for symptoms and make daily telephone contact with health authorities as a means of controlling the epidemic. Although only 58 of these individuals were eventually diagnosed with SARS, public health officials were satisfied that this measure assisted in preventing further spread of the infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/sites/default/files/downloads/sars_outbreak_lessons.pdf Chorh-Chuan Tan, "SARS in Singapore – Key Lessons from an Epidemic," ''Annals Academy of Medicine,'' May 2006, Vol. 35 No.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary self-isolation may have helped reduce transmission of influenza in Texas in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teh B, Olsen K, Black J, Cheng AC, Aboltins C, Bull K ''et al.'' | year = 2012 | title = Impact of swine influenza and quarantine measures on patients and households during the H1N1/09 pandemic | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 44 | issue = 4| pages = 289–296 | doi=10.3109/00365548.2011.631572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cordon sanitaire===
In 1995 a ''cordon sanitaire'' was used to control an outbreak of [[Ebola virus disease]] in [[Kikwit]], [[Zaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/119085/ebola-cordon-sanitaire-when-it-worked-congo-1995 Laurie Garrett, "Heartless but Effective: I've Seen 'Cordon Sanitaire' Work Against Ebola," ''The New Republic,'' August 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00037078.htm "Outbreak of Ebola Viral Hemorrhagic Fever -- Zaire, 1995" ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,'' May 19, 1995 / 44(19);381-382]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kaplan"&gt;[http://www.clinicalcorrelations.org/?p=8357 Rachel Kaplan Hoffmann and Keith Hoffmann, "Ethical Considerations in the Use of Cordons Sanitaires," ''Clinical Correlations,'' February 19, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] surrounded the town with troops and suspended all flights into the community. Inside Kikwit, the [[World Health Organization]] and Zaire medical teams erected further ''cordons sanitaires,'' isolating burial and treatment zones from the general population and successfully containing the infection.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Garrett, ''Betrayal of Trust: The Collapse of Global Public Health,'' Hachette Books, 2011 {{ISBN|1401303862}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Timeline of the SARS outbreak|2003 SARS outbreak]] in Canada, "community quarantine" was used to reduce transmission of the disease with moderate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=20034405 | doi=10.1186/1471-2458-9-488 | pmc=2808319 | volume=9 | title=Quantifying the impact of community quarantine on SARS transmission in Ontario: estimation of secondary case count difference and number needed to quarantine | year=2009 | journal=BMC Public Health | page=488 | vauthors=Bondy SJ, Russell ML, Laflèche JM, Rea E | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protective sequestration===
During the 1918 influenza epidemic the town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]] isolated itself for two months to prevent an introduction of the infection. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chm.med.umich.edu/research/1918-influenza-escape-communities/gunnison/ Gunnison: Case Study], University of Michigan Medical School, Center for the History of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; Several other communities adopted similar measures.&lt;ref name = "Markel"&gt;[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/12/pdfs/06-0506.pdf H. Markel, A.M. Stern,  J. A. Navarro, J. R. Michalsen, A. S. Monto, and C. DiGiovanni, "Nonpharmaceutical Influenza Mitigation Strategies, US Communities, 1918–1920 Pandemic," ''Emerging Infectious Diseases,'' Vol. 12, No. 12, December 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canceling mass gatherings===
Evidence suggesting that mass gatherings increase the potential for infectious disease transmission is inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.556.2672&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Thomas V. Inglersby et al, "Disease Mitigation Measures in the Control of Pandemic Influenza," ''Biosecurity and Bioterrorism Biodefense Strategy &amp; Science,'' Volume 4, Number 4,2006]&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that certain types of mass gatherings may be associated with increased risk of [[Influenza#Transmission|influenza transmission]]. They may also "seed" new strains into an area, and may instigate community transmission in a [[pandemic]]. Restricting mass gatherings, in combination with other social distancing interventions, may help reduce transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishola DA, Phin N | year = 2011 | title = Could influenza transmission be reduced by restricting mass gatherings?

===Travel restrictions===
Border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay an epidemic by more than 2–3 weeks unless implemented with over 99% coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson NM, Cummings DA, Fraser C, Cajka JC, Cooley PC, Burke DS | year = 2006 | title = Strategies for mitigating an influenza pandemic | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v442/n7101/abs/nature04795.html | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7101| pages = 448–52 | doi=10.1038/nature04795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Airport screening was found to be ineffective in preventing viral transmission during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell DM, World , Community  | year = 2004 | title = Public health interventions and SARS spread, 2003 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no11/04-0729.htm | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 10 | issue = 11| pages = 1900–1906 | doi=10.3201/eid1011.040729}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92450/ Martin Cetron, et al.

The '''soft palate''' (also known as the '''velum''', '''palatal velum''', or '''muscular palate''') is, in [[mammal]]s, the soft [[biological tissue|tissue]] constituting the back of the roof of the [[mouth]].  The soft palate is part of the [[palate]] of the mouth; the other part is the [[hard palate]]. The soft palate is distinguished from the hard palate at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain [[bone]].

==Structure==

===Muscles===
[[File:Gray1028.png|thumbnail|Dissection of the muscles of the palate from behind.]]

The five muscles of the soft palate play important roles in swallowing and breathing. The muscles are: 
# [[Tensor veli palatini]], which is involved in [[swallowing]]
# [[Palatoglossus]], involved in [[swallowing]]
# [[Palatopharyngeus]], involved in [[breathing]]
# [[Levator veli palatini]], involved in [[swallowing]]
# [[Musculus uvulae]], which moves the [[palatine uvula|uvula]]

These muscles are innervated by the [[pharyngeal plexus of vagus nerve|pharyngeal plexus]] via the [[vagus nerve]], with the exception of the [[tensor veli palatini]]. The tensor veli palatini is innervated by the [[mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve]] (V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=GRAYS2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake|first=Richard L.|title=Gray's anatomy for students|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8089-2306-0|author2=Vogl, Wayne |author3=Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell  |author4=illustrations by Richard |author5= Richardson, Paul |page=1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The soft palate is moveable, consisting of [[muscle]] fibers sheathed in [[mucous membrane]]. It is responsible for closing off the [[Respiratory system|nasal passages]] during the act of [[swallowing]], and also for closing off the airway. During sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a portion of the excreted substance to the mouth.

In [[human]]s, the [[palatine uvula|uvula]] hangs from the end of the soft palate. Touching the uvula or the end of the soft palate evokes a strong [[pharyngeal reflex|gag reflex]] in most people.

===Speech===
A speech sound made with the middle part of the [[tongue]] (dorsum) touching the soft palate is known as a [[velar consonant]].

It is possible for the soft palate to retract and elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity in order to produce the oral speech sounds. If this separation is incomplete, air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as [[Nasalization|nasal]].

===Modelling===

Within the microstructure of the soft palate lie a variety of variably-oriented fibers that create a nonuniform surface with a nonuniform density distribution. The tissue has been characterized as viscoelastic, nonlinear, and anisotropic in the direction of the fibers. [[Young modulus]] values range from 585&amp;nbsp;Pa at the posterior free edge of the soft palate to 1409&amp;nbsp;Pa where the soft palate attaches to the maxilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1597/08-012.1 |pmid=19642755 |title=Biomechanical Properties of the Human Soft Palate |journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=268–74 |year=2009 |last1=Birch |first1=M. J. |last2=Srodon |first2=P. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties are useful when quantifying the effects of corrective orthopedic devices such as the Hotz Plate on cleft lip.

Quantitative analyses have been done on bilateral and unilateral cleft palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate throughout the course of its development and correction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4524356 |year=1974 |author1=Berkowitz |first1=S |title=Quantitative analysis of cleft palate casts. A geometric study |journal=The Cleft palate journal |volume=11 |pages=134–61 |last2=Krischer |first2=J |last3=Pruzansky |first3=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficulty in finding common, comparable landmarks between normal soft palates and cleft palates, analytical methods have been devised to assess differences in degree of curvature of the alveolar crest, two-dimensional and three-dimensional surface area, and slope of the alveolar crest.

Finite element analysis has demonstrated effective modeling of soft-palate extension and movement. It has also been an effective tool for evaluating the craniofacial effects of corrective orthopedic devices and cleft lip.

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===
{{main|Oral pathology}}
Pathology of the soft palate includes [[mucosa]]l lesions such as [[pemphigus vulgaris]], [[herpangina]] and [[migratory stomatitis]],&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2010.04.016 |pmid=21763590 |title=Migratory stomatitis (ectopic geographic tongue) on the floor of the mouth |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=459–60 |year=2011 |last1=Zadik |first1=Yehuda |last2=Drucker |first2=Scott |last3=Pallmon |first3=Sarit }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[muscle|muscular]] conditions such as the [[birth defect|congenital]] [[cleft palate]] and [[cleft uvula]].

[[Israel]]'s [[standard of living]] is significantly higher than that of most other countries in the region, and is comparable to that of other highly developed countries. Israel was ranked 19th on the 2016 UN [[Human Development Index]], indicating "very high" development. It is considered a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income country]] by the [[World Bank]]. Israel also has a very high [[life expectancy]] at birth. The population still suffers from poverty, though these rates vary.

==History==
Following Israel's [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment]] in 1948 and victory in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] which began immediately afterward, the country was impoverished and lacking in foreign currency reserves. Living standards saw some increase in the first year after independence. Israel had to recover from the effects of the war, and saw a wave of mass Jewish immigration from post-war Europe, as well as Arab and Muslim countries, doubling the Jewish population in three years. The country was financially overwhelmed, and faced a deep economic crisis. As a result, a strict regime of [[Austerity in Israel|austerity]] was put in place. Food, furniture, and footwear were heavily rationed. Rationing allowed for a meager 1,600 calories a day, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women. Throughout the austerity period, living standards were preserved at tolerable levels, and the regime of strict rationing enabled the Israeli government to ensure that the entire population was adequately fed, clothed, and sheltered.

In 1952, Israel and West Germany signed a [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations agreement]]. West Germany agreed to pay Israel financial reparations for the Holocaust, ultimately paying over 3&amp;nbsp;billion [[Deutsche Mark|marks]] over a period of 14 years. The agreement went to force in 1953, when the first reparations payments arrived. As a result, most austerity restrictions were lifted that year; some remained in place, and would be gradually lifted throughout the following years. The families receiving the reparations payments saw a considerable increase in their standard of living; on average, they doubled their incomes.&lt;ref name=ginor/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, Israel was heavily reliant on reparations payments from West Germany, and on financial donations from Jews around the world, especially American Jews. Israel used these sources to invest in its infrastructure and in industrial and agricultural development projects, which allowed the country to become economically self-sufficient. Due to this commitment to development in its first two decades of existence, Israel experienced economic growth rates that exceeded 10% annually. Average living standards rose steadily; between 1950 and 1963, the expenditure of an average wage-earner's family rose 97% in real terms.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge Of Israel by Misha Louvish&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1955 and 1966, per capita consumption in Israel rose by 221% and in 1963, 93% of the population had electricity and 97% had running water.&lt;ref&gt;Israel: A History by Anita Shapira&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli historian [[Tom Segev]] described the improvement in living conditions during the 1950s due to the rapid development of the country:&lt;ref&gt;Segev, Tom: ''The Seventh Million: The Israelis and the Holocaust''. (2000, {{ISBN|0-8050-6660-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The new industrial and agricultural equipment created better conditions for the worker and the farmer. Soon, display windows began showing merchandise long absent; fruits, vegetables, and various food products. People were able to enjoy apples again and spread their bread with butter instead of margarine. Now it was possible to choose from a variety of clothes, shoes, furniture, paper goods, and electrical equipment. The supply did not equal what was available in developed countries, but it was enough to give the impression that the country was finally emerging from austerity... New power stations arrived, and there were fewer electrical outages. People could now have their own telephone lines and travel on railroad cars offering almost European comfort and luxury.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1950 to 1976, Israel managed to raise its standard of living threefold. For instance, consumption of animal protein per capita rose from {{convert|32.2|to|49.4|g|oz}} per day, while during that same period, the percentage of families owning an electric refrigerator increased from 2.4% to 99.0%. Family ownership of other durables also showed increases. From 1970 to 1976, the percentage of families owning a gas/electric range and oven rose from 5% to 51.8%, and a television set from 49.7% to 89.5%. From 1957 to 1976, the percentage of families owning an electric washing machine rose from 6.9% to 74.6%, and from 1955 to 1976, the percentage of families owning a radio rose from 54.7% to 84.2%. The percentage of families owning a car also increased, from 4.1% in 1962 to 31.2% in 1976.&lt;ref name=ginor&gt;{{cite book|title=Socio-Economic Disparities in Israel|author=Ginor, F.|date=1979|publisher=David Horowitz Institute for the Research of Developing Countries, Tel Aviv University|isbn=9781412834636|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ec7R_6gzk2AC|page=57|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One aspect of daily life in Israel that set it apart from much of the world for many years was the absence of television, and then of color television. Television was only introduced in 1966, in schools as an educational tool,&lt;ref name="ynetnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3534623,00.html |title=Good evening from Jerusalem - Israel News, Ynetnews &amp;#124; Good evening from Jerusalem |publisher=ynetnews.com|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=29 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regular public transmissions began in 1968. Even then, all television broadcasts were in black and white, at a time when American and European stations were switching to full-scale color transmissions. Color transmissions were initially banned due to fears of social inequality, although ordinary citizens found ways around this ban, and were only gradually introduced around 1980.

In the 1970s, Israeli living standards were comparable with those of some Western European countries. However, the years following the [[Yom Kippur War]] saw stalled economic growth and increased inflation. Economic growth was on average 0.4% annually, and living standards saw minimal growth, and eventually became completely stagnant. This continued into the 1980s; the Israeli economy was in a dire situation following a [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|financial crisis]] in 1983, and was saved by a 1985 [[1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan|economic stabilization plan]] which saw [[market economy|market-oriented]] reforms to Israel's economy, which had previously been heavily regulated. Despite these reforms, there was no immediate growth in quality of life; by 1989, living standards in Israel had not increased in more than a decade.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2004&amp;dat=19890115&amp;id=CroiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QbUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1512,2911584 |title=Allegheny Times - Google News Archive Search &amp;#124; Israel is a socialist basket case |accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 1985 stabilization plan, [[1990s Post-Soviet aliyah|mass Jewish immigration]] from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s brought many highly educated and skilled immigrants to Israel, and the Israeli government implemented effective macroeconomic policies. As a result, Israel experienced an economic boom, and living standards rose. In 2002, Israeli living standards began climbing rapidly, and the gap between Israel and many other Western nations in quality of life began to narrow.&lt;ref name=fischer/&gt;

In the early 2000s, Israeli living standards were comparable with those of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Mort, Jo-Ann and Brenner, Gary:''Our Hearts Invented a Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive in Today's Israel?'' (2003), Preface&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Israel was rated as having the 23rd-highest quality of life in the world by the [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3326496,00.html UN report: Israel 23rd on quality of life list] - Ynetnews&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Israel was ranked 15th in quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3980019,00.html Israel ranked 15th in quality of life] - Ynetnews&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Bank of Israel]] Governor [[Stanley Fischer]] said that Israel had a standard of living two-thirds as high as that of the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=fischer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/150826#.UqTxdvRDsaw |title=Israel Narrowing Standard of Living Gap with US - Inside Israel - News - Arutz Sheva &amp;#124; Israel Narrowing Standard of Living Gap with US |publisher=israelnationalnews.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|social justice protests]] broke out across the country over the high cost of living. In 2012, a report issued by the Taub Center stated that while living standards in Israel were rising, they were rising more slowly than those of other Western countries.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Israel-falling-behind-Western-living-standards |title='Israel falling behind Western living standards' - National News - Jerusalem Post &amp;#124; 'Israel falling behind Western living standards' |publisher=jpost.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, the Israeli government approved a series of measures to lower the country's high cost of living. A law was passed to break up large conglomerates and end economic concentration, so as to encourage economic competition. A new committee was also formed to remove import barriers and lower prices, making them more comparable to prices abroad.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/competition-committee-to-fight-high-cost-of-living/ |title=Competition committee to fight high cost of living &amp;#124; The Times of Israel |publisher=timesofisrael.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4457842,00.html |title=Finance panel okays plan to end economic concentration - Israel Business |publisher=ynetnews.com|accessdate=7 June 2015|date= 26 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Israel}}

According to census, Israel's population is 75.4% [[Jews|Jewish]], and 20.5% [[Arab]], predominantly [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]], as well as [[Bedouin]]s and [[Druze]]. About 4,000 [[Armenians]] and 4,000 [[Circassians]] live in Israel. There are smaller numbers of people of Jewish heritage or spouses of Jews, non-Arab Christians, and non-Arab Muslims. 3.7% of people are not classified by religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==In numbers==
Israel was ranked 47 out of 194 nations in the Annual Standard of Living Index published by the International Living Magazine in 2010. This index is produced by a consideration of "nine categories: cost of living, culture and leisure, economy, environment, freedom, health, infrastructure, safety and risk, and climate, and also its editors opinions"&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3830832,00.html|title=Israel ranked 47th in standard of living index - Israel News, Ynetnews|publisher=ynetnews.com|accessdate=7 June 2015|date= 6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these is scored on a scale of 0–100, with 100 marking the highest standard. Israel's lower scores were for infrastructure (36) cost of living (39), economy (61), environment (68) and safety (71). Its higher scores were for freedom (92), health (85), climate (84), and culture and leisure (83).&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"/&gt;

Israel was ranked 19th out of 188 nations in the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) 2016 ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Modern standard of living==
===Wealth and income distribution===
A 2013 [[Gallup survey]] of [[median household income]] among countries (though without taking taxes and social contributions into account), based on data collected from 2006 to 2012, found Israel to have the 21st highest median household income in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx | title=Worldwide, Median Household Income About $10,000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[Credit Suisse]] report found Israelis to be prosperous by world standards. Defining "wealth" as financial resources (cash, stocks, and bonds) and owned property, adjusted to deduct debt, the report found residents of Israel to be the sixth wealthiest people on average in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific region, trailing only [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Taiwan]]. The report also found that average Israeli wealth slightly exceeds average European wealth. However, the national wealth was found to be distributed slightly more inequitably than in most industrialized countries, although wealth distribution was found to be on par with some industrialized European countries and more equitable than in the [[United States]], with about 67.3% of national assets held by the richest 10% of the population. This is roughly on par with some European countries, including [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Norway]], and [[Germany]], as well as [[China]], [[Mexico]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], while wealth is distributed more equitably across most other European countries.&lt;ref name=rich&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israelis-as-rich-as-most-europeans-report/ | title=Israelis as rich as most Europeans – report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gini Coefficient]], Israel has high income inequality, and is one of the most unequal among 34 [[OECD]] countries. A 2014 Taub Center report likewise found Israel second only to the [[United States]] in [[disposable income]] inequality after taxes and government transfers among 22 OECD countries, based on statistics from the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=taub&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://taubcenter.org.il/gaping-gaps-income-inequality-in-israel/ | title=Gaping Gaps: Income Inequality in Israel| date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradiction may be explained by the presence of the [[black market|black]] and [[grey market|grey]] market economies, which the Gini Coefficient does not take into account. Some estimates suggest up to a quarter of economic activity in Israel goes unreported to tax authorities and statisticians.&lt;ref name=rich/&gt;

A 2015 OECD report found that the Israeli tax burden was slightly lower than average among OECD countries, with Israelis paying an average of 31.4% of their income in taxes, slightly lower than the OECD average of 34.4%, although this is still significantly higher than the tax burden in the United States, Mexico, and Chile. The report also found Israeli salaries to be lower than the OECD average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-tax-burden-not-too-onerous-after-all-economic-report/ | title=Israeli tax burden not too onerous after all, report shows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite high levels of wealth, a major factor affecting purchasing power is the high cost of living in Israel, which is higher than the OECD average. This is seen as having a significant impact on the middle and working classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4754743,00.html | title=The cost of living in Israel: It's as bad as you thought| date= 19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the cost of living is on the decline.&lt;ref name=decline&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Israels-cost-of-living-on-the-decline-study-finds-448173 | title=Israel's cost of living on the decline, study finds - Business &amp; Innovation - Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing===
Most Israelis live in [[apartment]]s. According to the Israeli [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]], 33% live in three-room apartments, 28% in four-room apartments, and 13% in five-room apartments. CBS statistics also showed that 5% live in one-room apartments, while only 0.6% of Israelis live in a property with eight rooms or more.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3884633,00.html|title=Census figures: 2.2 kids, 2.1 cell phones per family - Israel News, Ynetnews|publisher=ynetnews.com|accessdate=7 June 2015|date= 4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBS also reports that Israeli households contain .8 persons per room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton.html?num_tab=st05_23&amp;CYear=2017|title="HOUSEHOLDS, BY HOUSING DENSITY, TYPE OF LOCALITY OF RESIDENCE AND POPULATION GROUP", Statistical Abstract of Israel 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cbs.gov.il|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the OECD, the average number of rooms per person is 1.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/how_life-2017-en/1/2/5/17/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/how_life-2017-en&amp;_csp_=e18e4e8261127f589d5a9bb9a671c8b0#sec1-000080|title=How's Life? 2017: Measuring Well-being|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[home ownership]] in Israel stood at 67.3% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader/newhodaot/hodaa_template.html?hodaa=201515313&lt;/ref&gt; This figure stood behind many other developed and developing countries, although still higher than some other developed countries including the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[Germany]]. Housing in the country is notoriously expensive, with homes costing an average of 148 monthly salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/why-do-israels-apartment-prices-keep-going-up/ | title=Four years after tent protests, hope in short supply for would-be homebuyers}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 report found home ownership was found to have noticeably declined between 1997 and 2012. Many Israelis require mortgages to purchase homes, although mortgages are easy to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.anglo-list.com/general-3/housing/property-housing-renting-in-israel | title=Housing &amp; Real Estate in Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Health care in Israel}}

Israel has a system of [[universal health care]] run by semi-private non-profit corporations heavily regulated by the government, whereas all citizens are entitled to the same Uniform Benefit Package. All Israeli citizens are required to have membership in one of four Health Maintenance Organizations which are subsidized by taxpayer funds. According to a 2000 study by the [[World Health Organization]], Israel had the 28th best health care system in the world.&lt;ref name="newvoices.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvoices.org/campus?id=0075|title=Surviving Israeli Health Care &amp;#124; New Voices|publisher=newvoices.org|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] ranked Israel as having the fourth most efficient healthcare system in the world, surpassed only by [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-ranks-4th-globally-in-health-care-efficiency/ | title=Israel ranks 4th globally in health care efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's medical facilities are recognized worldwide for their high standards of health services, top-quality medical resources and research, modern hospital facilities, and an impressive ratio of physicians and specialists to the population. Israeli doctors make [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 20,000–24,000 (US$ $5,000–$6,000) per month.&lt;ref name="newvoices.org"/&gt;

Israel has one of the highest life expectancies at birth in the world, ranking 8 out of 224 nations (2009), with an average life expectancy of 80.73.&lt;ref&gt;CIA Country Comparison: Life expectancy at birth https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html?countryName=Israel&amp;countryCode=is&amp;regionCode=me&amp;rank=13#is date accessed: January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, Israel's Arab population has a life expectancy of 75.9 years for males, and 79.7 years for females. Israel's [[infant mortality rate]] is also extremely low, with 2.2 per 1,000 live births for Jews, and 6.4 for Arabs.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-israel-infant-mortality-rate-3-times-higher-among-arabs/ | title=In Israel, infant mortality rate 3 times higher among Arabs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency medical services]] are generally provided by [[Magen David Adom]], Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance, and blood bank service. In some areas, it is supplemented by [[Hatzalah]] and the [[Palestine Red Crescent Society]].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Israel}}

According to a 2014 OECD survey, Israel is the fourth most educated country in the world, with about 46% of adults achieving a tertiary qualification. Only [[Russia]], [[Canada]], and [[Japan]] exceed Israel's figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.israel21c.org/israel-is-4th-most-educated-country-in-the-world/ | title=Israel is 4th most educated country in the world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's educational expenditures comprise 6.9% of its GDP (2004), placing Israel 25th out of 182 on the CIA World Factbook's country comparison of educational expenditures as a percent of GDP.

23.9% of Israel's adult population (age 25+) has achieved a low attainment level of education, 33.1% has achieved a medium attainment level of education, and 39.7% has achieved a high attainment level of education. Israel's literacy rate is 97.1% (2004 est.)&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook: Israel https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html date accessed: January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Development Report 2009: Illiteracy Rate http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/99.html date accessed: January 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli schools are divided into four tracks: public, state-run schools, state-funded [[yeshiva]]s, Arab schools, and bilingual schools for both Jewish and Arab children. Secondary education prepares students for matriculation exams known as [[Bagrut]]. If a student passes, he or she receives a matriculation certificate.

Many Jewish schools in Israel have highly developed special education programs for disabled children, libraries, computers, science laboratories, and film editing studios.&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/77140/section/2|title=SECOND CLASS &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch|publisher=hrw.org|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2001-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, after a student graduates, he or she will be conscripted into the [[Israel Defense Forces]], [[Israel Border Police]], or [[Israel Prison Service]], although most Arabs are exempt. A student may, however, request to be drafted at a later date to study at a college or university, or a school known as a [[Mechina]], which prepares them for military or national service. Those who study in a university at this stage do so under a contract in which the Army will pay for their [[Bachelor's degree]], but will extend their service by 2–3 years. Universities generally require a number of matriculation units, a certain [[grade point average]], and a good grade on the [[Psychometric Entrance Test]]. Israel currently has nine public universities, and a number of smaller colleges. According to [[Webometrics]], six Israeli universities are among the top 100 universities in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=asia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004094313/http://www.webometrics.info/top100_continent.asp?cont=asia |archivedate=4 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All nine Israeli public universities and some colleges are heavily subsidized, and pupils pay only a small part of the actual tuition.

===Social classes===
====Wealthy====
In 2013, Israel ranked 10th in the world in percentage of millionaires among the population, with 3.8% of households holding assets in excess of $1 million, and eighth in the percentage of households holding assets in excess of $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.527417 {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle class====
A Taub Center report from 2014 notes that the Israeli middle class is divided into the lower and upper middle classes, with a large income gap between them. The lower middle class, comprising about 40% of the population, has a monthly per capita wage range of NIS 1,950 to NIS 5,000. The upper middle class, which comprises about 29% of the population, has a monthly per capita wage range of NIS 5,100 to NIS 12,540.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/Business-News/Study-finds-major-gap-between-upper-and-lower-middle-class-in-Israel-352795 | title=Study finds major gap between upper and lower middle class in Israel - Business - Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poverty====
Estimates of the Israeli poverty rate vary. Israel's poverty levels are commonly viewed as high in comparison with other developed countries, although it has been speculated that poverty rates are significantly lower than officially reported due to the presence of a large [[underground economy]] in Israel.

A report issued by the OECD in 2016 ranks Israel as the country with the highest rates of poverty among its members. Approximately 21 percent of Israelis were found to be living under the poverty line – more than in countries such as Mexico, Turkey, and Chile. The OECD average is a poverty rate of 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4753118,00.html Israel's poverty rates highest among OECD nations] YNET, 14 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This poverty rate is largely the result of the socioeconomic disadvantages and high unemployment rates experienced by the [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arab]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi-Jewish populations]].

However, it has also been suggested that Israel's true poverty rate is in fact far lower, and the statistics are skewed by significant underreporting of income, as [[World Bank]] research shows Israel as having one of the largest underground economies in the developed world. One former [[Bank of Israel]] chief noted a significant underreporting of income among Arabs and Haredim, and said that based on surveys of household spending rather than income, Israel's actual core poverty rate is around 12% of households.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.691766?v=98AFF2BAF151F4B81301C55CCA12F8C4 | title=Fuzzy Math Exaggerates Israel's Working-poor Problem| newspaper=Haaretz| date=2015-12-15| last1=Shtrasler| first1=Nehemia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s and 1990s, poverty rates in Israel fluctuated (according to one estimate) from 12.8% in 1989 to 18% in 1994, before falling to about 16% in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://micro5.mscc.huji.ac.il/~inequality/LewinStier_WelfareState.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report published by the National Insurance Institute (NII) indicates that poverty levels remained relatively stable in 2006–2007. Roughly 20.5% of Israeli families were found to be living below the poverty line in 2008, a slight increase from the previous year's 20%. Moreover, 24.7% of Israel's residents and 35.9% of its children lived in impoverished conditions.&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3506852,00.html ynet] ynet (02.14.08, 17:31), accessed 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data for the 2006–2007 NII survey indicates that 420,000 [[Poverty threshold|impoverished families]] resided in Israel (1.5&amp;nbsp;million people&lt;ref name=amit.org.il&gt;[http://www.amit.org.il/Learning/English/Poverty/index.htm [[AMIT]].org.il] amit.org.il (02.14.08, 17:31), accessed 18 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;), including some 805,000 children. Poverty indicators for families with a [[Minimum wage|single wage-earner]] have risen from 22.6% during the last NII survey to 23.9% in the current one.&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt;

Poverty is high among [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arabs]]. According to a March 2011 report by [[Adalah]], over half of all Arab families in Israel lived in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adalah.org/upfiles/2011/Adalah_The_Inequality_Report_March_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, of the 40 towns in Israel with the highest unemployment rates, 36 were Arab towns. The total employment rate for Arabs is 68% of the employment rate for Jews. Among Israeli-Arabs [[Druze]] and [[Palestinian Christians|Christian Arabs]] have a higher employment rate than [[Muslim]]s do. Poverty rates are also high among [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]], as a result of many Haredi men being voluntarily unemployed and opting for religious studies while relying on social assistance instead of working, as well as underemployment due to Haredi schools being exempt from the core curriculum. In 2011, 70% of Haredim and 57% of Arabs were living under the market income poverty line, while 57% of Haredim and 50% of Arabs were living under the disposable income poverty line.&lt;ref name=taub/&gt;

The Israeli welfare system is less effective than most OECD countries. While the median poverty reduction rate through taxes and welfare among OECD countries is 40%, the figure stands at 25% in Israel, the second-lowest rate in the OECD, behind only the United States.&lt;ref name=taub/&gt;

[[Homelessness]] is a rare phenomenon. A December 2015 study found there to be about 2,300 homeless people in Israel, out of a population of about 8.5 million. The most common reason for homelessness was substance abuse or alcoholism, followed by financial problems and mental illness.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt;

===Social mobility===
[[Social mobility]] in Israel is high by Western standards. According to statistics from the late 1990s, which, based on other tests, are not believed to have changed significantly, class mobility rates in Israel are between 72–74%, higher than in other developed countries including the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[France]]. Although there is relatively high equality of opportunity, there are still significant differences that remain. [[Ashkenazi Jews]] were found to be wealthier on average than [[Mizrahi Jews]], who were in turn wealthier than Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.655339?v=398884667B2493C6ECCDEC8CA41B18FC | title=Class Mobility is Relatively High in Israel – at Least Among Jews| newspaper=Haaretz| date=2015-05-07| last1=Sadeh| first1=Shuki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel is cited as having high social mobility due to the volume of Jewish immigrants in recent history. The current state of Israel shows fluid mobility among these Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaish|first=Meir|date=June 2000|title=The Consequences of Immigration for Social Mobility: The Experience of Israel|jstor=3559547 |journal=European Sociological Review|volume=18|pages=449–471}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible reason for this ethnic difference in mobility is the relatively young age of the state of Israel and how it has changed economically and demographically through 21st century [[Industrialisation|industrialization]]. Traditionally, there have been three endogenous demographics of Israel. These are Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Arabs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin-Epstein and  Semyonov|first=Noah and Moshe|date=June 1986|title=Ethnic Group Mobility in the Israeli Labor Market|url=|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=51|issue=3|pages=342–352|doi=10.2307/2095306|jstor=2095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the state of Israel was largely established as a home for Jewish people, immigrants of the religion rapidly migrated to Israel over the course of the 20th century. In terms of numbered population, there were 650,000 Jews in Israel in 1948; however, by 1964 there were over 2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodge|first=Robert|date=May 1973|title=Review: Social Mobility in Israel Society. by Moshe Lissak and Batya Stein|url=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1584–1587|doi=10.1086/225497}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple arguments to how this mobility through industrialization occurred. The "liberal thesis of industrialization" argues that industrialization will provide a higher rate of upward mobility over downward mobility as well as improved [[social equality]]. The view favored by marxists opposes the liberal thesis, arguing that while industrialization did create increased social mobility in Israel, it has lessened over time and only remained for select groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaish|first=Meir|date=June 2000|title=Old Debate, New Evidence: Class Mobility Trends in Israeli Society, 1974–1991|url=|journal=European Sociological Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=159–183|doi=10.1093/esr/16.2.159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these views show that there has indeed been a history of high social mobility in Israel in comparison to other developed countries; however, the absolute distribution and application of this high rate to all citizens is likely not fully universal.

An additional factor in social mobility is [[Education in Israel|education]]. From the below table, average years of schooling are listed for workers, managers, self-employed, and employers. Because there is a significant difference between self-employed and employers (Owners) and managers,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuchtman-Yaar|first=Ephraim|date=Spring–Autumn 1985|title=Differences in Ethnic Patterns of Socioeconomic Achievements in Israel -- A Neglected Aspect of Structured Inequality|url=|journal=International Review of Modern Sociology|volume=15|pages=99–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; it should be evident that less education does not provide a statistical disadvantage in obtaining higher positions of ownership and consequently higher socioeconomic status.

In general, Israel is considered a highly educated state and ranks well among [[Modern capitalism|modern capitalist]] countries. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ([[OECD]]) ranks Israel 2nd in the world for countries with a percentage of working adults who have achieved tertiary education (46%), significantly higher than the average at 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/Israel_EAG2013%20Country%20Note.pdf|title=ISRAEL - Education at a Glance 2013|author=Andreas Schleicher|date=2013|publisher=OECD|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely a significant reason to why social mobility is relatively high in Israel. However, in most recent social mobility has been declining for many and income inequality has been rising.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Class, and Affirmative Action|last=Alon|first=Sigal|publisher=Russel Sage Foundation|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2017}} As stated above, high levels of social mobility have not typically been applying to all demographic sectors of Israel, such as Arabs. The four highest ranked universities in Israel have chosen to combat this in an effort to improve social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X11001037|title=The Diversity Dividends of a Need-blind and Color-blind Affirmative Action Policy|author=Alon, Sigal|year=2011|journal=Social Science Research, 40(6):1494-1505.|doi=10.1016/j.ssresearch.2011.05.005|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1494–1505}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, affirmative action exists for these universities. Applicants for affirmative action are college applicant students who are Arabs, women, blacks, or disabled.&lt;ref name="che.org.il2"&gt;http://che.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/%D7%94%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A1-1-%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%93.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are two programs with the intention of increasing social mobility behind this academic affirmative action. First, affirmative action provides some disadvantaged youth with increased chances of attending top-tier university. Second, it gives some college students an advantage into getting to specific prestige programs at their university.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The two programs can fundamentally alter and improve the lives of youth in Israel, who may have otherwise earned less prestigious merit from their college experiences or not have gone to college at all. Consequently, the policy of affirmative action delivers recipients with a premium degree that will enable them to enjoy a higher probability of economic success, as well as improving the social perception of different ethnic and gender demographics in Israel as class leaders.

[[Occupational mobility|Ethnic occupational mobility]] in Israel has been viewed as a ladder between the three stratified groups, Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Arabs. Higher populations of a group are correlated with larger social communities; therefore, the potential to promote occupational and social mobility are increased.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Occupations associated with yielding [[Economic mobility|intergenerational mobility]] vary. Men in Israel who pursue professional or technical careers are often met with improvement for intergenerational occupational mobility.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matras|first=Judah|date=November 1963|title=Some Data on Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in Israel|url=|journal=Population Studies|volume=17|issue=2|pages=167–186|doi=10.1080/00324728.1963.10405763}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very evident today, with the development of "[[Silicon Wadi]]", a cluster of software and other global high tech industries near [[Tel Aviv]]. Whereas employment in this sector of Israel is highly associated mobility, employment in administrative and unskilled occupations are associated with a decline in mobility. For women, service sector occupation and social workers show higher levels of mobility compared to those in agricultural related occupations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, means of [[Social Welfare|social welfare]] have been instituted to better promote mobility through the provision of housing, education, health care, social services, and employment. These welfare programs were started in the 1970s as a means of combatting stratified ethnic class structure with the intended goal of social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Chaim|date=February 1974|title=Social Stratification and Education in Israel|url=|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=18|pages=10–23|doi=10.1086/445752}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these programs have prevented critical dangers such as mass hunger or homelessness, it is difficult to prove they have sealed the gap in terms of endogenous ethnic-class structure in Israeli society.

===Work and leisure time===
Israeli work hours are long by Western standards. The official Israeli workweek is 43 hours, with employers legally prohibited from compelling employees to work more than 47 hours per week. Among men, the average workweek is 45.8 hours, with the average workweek for women at 37.1 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.624900&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Israeli workers also perform work, largely through answering emails, messages, and phone calls, on evenings, weekends, and vacations, though many do so voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-work-invading-israelis-home-lives-1000934456&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Israelis received 19 vacation days on average, less than in Europe but more than in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000659766&lt;/ref&gt; Most Israelis can afford to take vacations abroad. In 2013, 65% of Israelis vacationed abroad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000910682&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infrastructure===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Israel|Transport in Israel}}
Israel has 42 designated highways, and an advanced [[Roads in Israel|road network]] which spans over 17,870 kilometers, including over 230 kilometers of freeway. [[Israel Railways]] is Israel's government-owned railway network, which is responsible for all [[inter-city rail|inter city]] and [[suburban rail|suburban]] passenger railways, and for all [[freight]] rail traffic in the country. The network is centered in Israel's densely populated coastal plain, and runs through much of the country. The railway has seen investment and growth since the 1990s after decades of neglect and low passenger numbers. There are also six [[Aerial lift|cable car]] systems, and 47 airports in Israel, as well as seven seaports. Israel also has 176 kilometers of gas pipelines and 261 kilometers of pipelines for refined products. [[Bus]]es are the country's main form of public transport, and the country has a popular [[share taxi]] service. Jerusalem has the country's only tram system – the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]], while a second system, the [[Tel Aviv Light Rail]] is under construction. [[Haifa]] has the country's only [[subway (rail)|subway]] system – the [[Carmelit]].

Israel has tapped conventional water resources, but relies heavily on [[reclaimed water]] treated in the 120 wastewater treatment plants across the country, and desalinated seawater. 57% of water in Israel is for agriculture, 36% for domestic and public use, and 7% for industrial use. Average domestic water consumption in Israel is 250 liters per person per day, which is higher than in most of Europe, but lower than the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vague.eurecom.fr/countries/SEMIDE/PDF/Sogesid-israel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127232948/http://vague.eurecom.fr/countries/semide/PDF/Sogesid-israel |archivedate=27 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ministry of Environment, 97.9% of all tests of water complied with drinking water standards. Israel also has a modern sanitation system, particularly in major Jewish cities and towns. An estimated 500,000 homes in Israel are not linked to a sewage system, the vast majority of them Arab homes, where waste is expelled into cesspits or the environment.&lt;ref name="haaretz2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1155407.html|title=&amp;nbsp;Advertisement|publisher=haaretz.com|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urban life==
Israel is a highly [[urbanization|urbanized]] nation, with 92 percent of its population living in urban areas. To be granted [[City council (Israel)|city status]], a municipality must have a population of at least 20,000.&lt;ref name="mfa.g"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il |title=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp;#124; Israeli Democracy – How does it Work? |publisher=mfa.gov.il|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 78 cities in Israel, and 14 of them have populations over 100,000. Other urban municipalities are towns. Towns in Israel are given [[Local council (Israel)|local council]] status if they have a population over 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;Troen, Selwyn Ilan; Noah Lucas. ''Israel: The First Decade of Independence''. SUNY Press, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, most residential areas are separated from industrial and commercial zones, and there are also numerous, well-tended parks and playgrounds within the city or town limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il Looking at Israel- Urban and Rural Life] - Israeli Foreign Ministry (2 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural life==
Israelis who live in rural areas primarily live on [[kibbutz]]im or [[moshav]]im. A kibbutz is a [[intentional community|collective communities]], where the residents work for the benefit of the community. Although many kibbutzim have been privatized, residents typically live communally. Kibbutzim are for the most part self-sufficient, and have their own schools. Most kibbutzim are agricultural, though some have switched to industry.

A moshav is also a collective community, but the land is divided among the residents, who each receive an equal amount, and must grow their own produce. The community is supported by a collective tax, which is equal for all the residents, thus leaving good farmers better off than bad ones.

A [[moshava]] is another type of rural agricultural community in Israel, but unlike kibbutzim or moshavim, all the land is privately owned. A [[moshav shitufi]] is another type of cooperative village in Israel, where all production and services are handled collectively, while consumption decisions remain the responsibilities of individual households.

[[Community settlement (Israel)|Communal settlement]]s are rural or [[commuter town|exurban]] towns where the entire population is organized in a [[cooperative]], and can veto the sale of any home or property to an undesirable buyer, typically work outside the town, and must pay only a small property tax to sustain the town and its public facilities. Most homes are [[Single-family detached home|single-family home]]s, although some have [[apartment]]s. Due to the rigorous selection process when selling property, most residents of a communal settlement share a single shared ideology, religious perspective, desired lifestyle, and some will only accept young couples with children. Other Israelis who live in rural areas live in homes and small communities founded by the [[Jewish National Fund]] and located in the [[Negev]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1404">'''Summer fallow''', sometimes called '''fallow cropland''', is cropland that is purposely kept out of production during a regular growing season.  Resting the ground in this manner allows one crop to be grown using the moisture and nutrients of more than one crop cycle.  The summer fallow technique provides enough extra moisture and nutrients to allow the growth of crops which might otherwise not be possible and is closely associated with [[dryland farming]].

Usually this is done in semi-arid regions in order to conserve moisture for the next season.  It also provides additional time for crop residues to break down and return nutrients to the soil for the subsequent crop, though this function has become less important since the widespread adoption of [[chemical fertilizers]] enabled farmers to artificially add vital nutrients. Fields which are fallow may be tilled or sprayed to control weeds and conserve moisture in the soil. The 1997 [[United States Census of Agriculture|Census of Agriculture]] reported that {{convert|20900000|acre|km2}}, almost 5% of the {{convert|431|e6acre|km2}} of all cropland, was fallow that year.

'''Swaziland Beverages Ltd (SBL)''', a subsidiary of [[SABMiller]], is a beverage and brewing company in [[Matsapha]], [[Swaziland|Eswatini]]. The company was formed in 1995 by the merger of Eswatini Breweries, Ngwane Breweries, and Eswatini Bottlers. SBL produces and markets soft drinks, beer, and other alcoholic drinks.&lt;ref name=sab&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sabmiller.com/about-us/where-we-operate#q=SZ&amp;id=6d75f971-2c9d-6131-b545-ff00002059a6&amp;type=Country | archive-url=https://archive.is/20140621123425/http://www.sabmiller.com/about-us/where-we-operate%23q=SZ&amp;id=6d75f971-2c9d-6131-b545-ff00002059a6&amp;type=Country#q=SZ&amp;id=6d75f971-2c9d-6131-b545-ff00002059a6&amp;type=Country | dead-url=yes| title=SABMiller/Explore beer/Swaziland | publisher=[[SABMiller]] | accessdate=June 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swazi beer produced is '''Sibebe Premium Lager''' named after the [[Sibebe Survivor|Sibebe rock]], but other beers are brewed as well including [[Castle Lager]]. SBL dominates the beer market in Eswatini with a market share of 87%; in 2014 227 hl of [[lager beer]] were sold.&lt;ref name=sab/&gt;

The '''Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital''' ({{lang-my|ဝါးချက်ဇီဝိတဒါနသံဃာ့ဆေးရုံ}}) is a monastic hospital located in Wachet, [[Myanmar]]. It was founded on 20 October 1984 by Sayadaw U Lakkhana (also known as Badandha Lakkhana Sayadaw), an [[abbot]] of the Kyaswa Gyaug Monastery in [[Sagaing]], using donations from [[Monk|monks]], [[Nun|nuns]], and others in the village of Wachet.

The hospital was established as a charitable institution to provide free medical treatment to monks and nuns. After 19 years, a committee of monks from Kyaswa Monastery decided to modernize the small facility. Since then, it has been significantly upgraded and expanded with local, national, and foreign aid. When first opened, it was a two-story clinic with four rooms. Today, it is a four-story, 50-bed facility&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dhammaweb.net/lakkhana.html |title= Ven. Sayadaw U Lakkhana (1935-) |publisher= Dhamma Web |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides low-cost health services to the general public as well as to monks and nuns. The hospital provides both [[Medicine|Western medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]], including [[acupuncture]].

==Location==

Wachet is a village in the Sagaing region of [[Upper Myanmar]], along the [[Ayeyarwady River]]. The hospital is located north of the Kyaswa Monastery, west of the Sagaing Hills, and east of the Ayeyarwady River.

==Kyaswa Monastery and Sayadaw U Lakkhana==

The Kyaswa Monastery was founded in the [[14th century]] and is located in Wachet.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vipassanahawaii.org/mettadana/ |title= MettaDana |publisher= Vipassana Hawai’i |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayadaw U Lakkhana, the founder of Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital, was the abbot of the monastery when the hospital was founded in 1984, and was known both in Myanmar and abroad as a [[meditation]] teacher and spiritual leader. He traveled extensively to lead [[Satipatthana]] meditation retreats, including in [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Nepal]], [[Singapore]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1988, the Myanmar government awarded him the title of Agga Maha Kammathanacarriya, its highest honor for meditation instruction. The resulting publicity helped him garner support for community projects. In addition to founding Wachet Jivitadana Sangha Hospital, Sayadaw U Lakkhana and the Kyaswa Monastery opened a primary school in Wachet, provided grants for students, and delivered humanitarian relief to civilians after [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Sayadaw U Lakkhana died in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vipassanahawaii.org/sayadaw-u-lakkhana/ |title= MettaDana |publisher= Vipassana Hawai’i |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities and services==

The hospital has 50 beds, but often accommodates up to 200 patients.

In 2014, according to a hospital pamphlet, the average number of medical outpatients per month was 131. The average numbers of dental, ENT, and [[Dermatology|dermatological]] cases were 341, 59, and 34 per month, respectively. An average of 322 patients per month received acupuncture, and an average of 284 were treated with other forms of traditional medicine.

There are about 50 permanent staff members, including one doctor, five [[Nursing|nurses]], nine [[Paramedic|paramedics]], and five administrators. The hospital has three [[Operating theater|operating theatres]],&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fXlQl1dyVg|title=MRTV Web Portal – The Wachet Jivitadana Hospital (I)|date=|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; one laser treatment room in the outpatient department, and five [[Dental engine|dental chairs]]. Additional facilities include a laboratory, a [[radiology]] department, and a traditional medicine and acupuncture unit. Four [[Air conditioning|air conditioned]] rooms with attached bathrooms, as well as five beds and bathrooms in the main hall, are reserved for [[Very important person|VIP]] patients.

The hospital provides a variety of health services throughout the week, but certain procedures that must be performed by specialists are only available during certain days and times.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; [[Physician|Physicians]], [[Surgeon|surgeons]], and [[Dental surgery|dental surgeons]] from [[Mandalay]] are available Sunday mornings; the dental surgeons are also available on Saturdays. An acupuncture team from Mandalay provides services on Wednesdays and Saturdays. [[Ophthalmology|Eye specialists]] and [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose, and throat]] (ENT) teams from Mandalay come on Thursdays.

For billing purposes, the hospital divides patients into three categories. Those in the first category, including monks, nuns, and [[Yogi|yogis]], receive treatment free of charge. Those in the second category—low-income or otherwise disadvantaged patients—are responsible for a small portion of their treatment costs. All other patients are responsible for the total cost of their treatment, or most of it.

==Affiliated organizations==

Wachet does not receive funding from the Myanmar government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OURTYytKuzU |title=  MRTV Web Portal – The Wachet Jivitadana Hospital (II) |publisher= YouTube |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is supported by donations and volunteers from both domestic and international organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.myanmaracupunctureproject.org/ |title= MettaDana |publisher= Vipassana Hawai’i |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Japan Heart, the RANZCO Eye Foundation, the Brighter Future Foundation, and Vipassana Hawai’i.

===Japan Heart===

Japan Heart, a volunteer-based international health care organization based in [[Tokyo]], was founded in 2004 by Dr. Hideto Yoshioka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.japanheart.org/en/about/ |title= About Us |publisher= Japan Heart International Medical Volunteers |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization operates in both Myanmar and [[Cambodia]], and began working with Wachet Hospital in May 2004. Japanese doctors and nurses assist local staff members in treating patients, and also work to improve the medical techniques used at the hospital. In Myanmar, Japan Heart volunteers help treat approximately 10,000 outpatients and perform up to 2,000 surgical operations per year.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.japanheart.org/en/myanmar/ |title= Myanmar |publisher= Japan Heart International Medical Volunteers |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, its medical volunteers conducted, on average, 1,001 outpatient procedures and 154 operations per month. Its other initiatives in Myanmar include the Dream Development Center, or "Dream Train", a child development center in [[Yangon]] founded in 2010. Also in 2010, with funding from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Japan Heart opened a [[Vocational education|vocational training]] center for the [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] in Myanmar.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

===RANZCO Eye Foundation===

The RANZCO Eye Foundation is a nonprofit organization, founded in 2002,&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eyefoundation.org.au/about/what-we-do |title= What We Do |publisher= RANZCO Eye Foundation |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; that represents over 800 [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It funds a number of initiatives, including sustainable eye care programs in disadvantaged communities in both countries, research on the causes of vision loss, and community awareness campaigns about eye health.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; It works with Wachet Hospital on the [[Myanmar Eye Care Project]] (MECP), which aims to reduce preventable vision loss and improve eye care in rural Myanmar. MECP is led by Dr. Geoff Cohn, a [[Sydney]]-based ophthalmologist.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eyefoundation.org.au/projects/sustainable-development/96-the-myanmar-program |title= The Myanmar Eye Care Program |publisher= RANZCO Eye Foundation |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight times per year, Dr. Cohn leads a team of over 40 Australian ophthalmologists, technicians, and support staff to the hospital to treat eye diseases such as [[Cataract|cataracts]] and [[glaucoma]]. The foundation also provides ophthalmic surgical equipment to the hospital and trains local specialists to perform eye care procedures in the absence of the Australian team. MECP has performed over 12,000 surgeries and currently performs 5,000 per year throughout Myanmar.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; In 2014, at Wachet Hospital alone, MECP treated 1,500 patients. It has also provided services to four other monastery-based eye care centers and one non-monastery-based clinic in Myanmar.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

===Brighter Future Foundation===

The Brighter Future Foundation (BFF) is a nonprofit organization founded by Zwe Nanda and Dr. Thinn Thinn Hlaing in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brighterfuturefoundation.org/bff-history |title= History of BFF |publisher=  Brighter Future Foundation |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides health services and equipment to public hospitals, helps educate health care professionals, and supports undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Myanmar. In July 2013, its doctors and volunteers provided free [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] care to 270 patients at Wachet Hospital, offering each patient [[Blood test|blood tests]] (to measure kidney function, [[lipid profile]], [[glycated hemoglobin]] (HbA1c), and [[blood sugar]]), [[Clinical urine tests|urine tests]], and a one-week supply of medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brighterfuturefoundation.org/apps/photos/album?albumid=15030730 |title= Free Diabetes Clinic |publisher=  Brighter Future Foundation |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the team made another visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brighterfuturefoundation.org/apps/photos/album?albumid=15714171 |title= Free Diabetes Clinic Wachet Hospital 2014 |publisher=  Brighter Future Foundation |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also gave the hospital an Afinion HbA1c analyzer, which measures glycated hemoglobin levels in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://afinion.net/tests/afinion_HbA1c |title= Afnion HbA1c |publisher=  Afnion |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vipassana Hawai’i/MettaDana Project===

Vipassana Hawai’i, based in [[Hawaii]], promotes the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as preserved in the [[Pāli Canon]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vipassanahawaii.org/about-us/ |title= About Us |publisher=  Vipassana Hawai’i |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Steven Smith of Vipassana, in collaboration with Sayadaw U Lakkhana and the Kyaswa Monastery, started the MettaDana Project, which provides funding, staff support, medicines, and other supplies to Wachet Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Queen | first= Christopher| date= 2003 | title= Action Dharma: New Studies in Engaged Buddhism | url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hjum-VG8pTsC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=wachet+hospital&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sb-_yPmbyI&amp;sig=J_1_Euu7bjxx2KH3ha1Ca6q3IWw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XNv9VMCWKsaUuASWvoGwBg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=wachet%20hospital&amp;f=false | publisher= Psychology Press | page= 210 | isbn= 9780700715947| access-date= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has arranged a public health training program on [[HIV/AIDS]] and funded additional training programs for the hospital’s technical and clerical workers.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vipassanahawaii.org/mettadana/ |title= MettaDana |publisher=  Vipassana Hawai’i |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Vipassana helped establish the acupuncture training and treatment program at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.myanmaracupunctureproject.org/3/The-History.html |title= History |publisher=  The Myanmar Acupuncture Project |date= |accessdate= 2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MettaDana Project collects charitable donations, which are then distributed to communities in Myanmar through the Kyaswa Monastery. In addition to its support for the hospital, it has provided educational grants to approximately 300 primary school students in Wachet, helped fund a new primary school in Wachet village, and assisted with humanitarian relief after Cyclone Nargis.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;

A '''vaccination schedule''' is a series of [[vaccination]]s, including the timing of all doses, which may be either recommended or compulsory, depending on the country of residence. This topic can cause much controversy over whether or not it could impact health after dosage at an early age.

A [[vaccine]] is an [[antigen]]ic preparation used to produce active immunity to a [[disease]], in order to prevent or reduce the effects of [[infection]] by any natural or "wild" [[pathogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/vaccines/understanding/Pages/whatVaccine.aspx |title=What Is a Vaccine |format= |work= [[NIAID]] |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness, either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over time. For example, tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = Mayo Clinic | date = 2006-09-21 | accessdate = 2008-07-17 | title = Tetanus: Prevention | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/tetanus/DS00227/DSECTION=prevention | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactions. Over the past two decades, the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developed.&lt;ref name= History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chop.edu/service/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-schedule/history-of-vaccine-schedule.html |title=History of Vaccine Schedule &amp;#124; The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia |work= |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some vaccines are recommended only in certain areas (countries, sub national areas, or at-risk populations) where a disease is common. For instance, [[yellow fever]] vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana, is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Update on Yellow Fever in the Americas, http://www.paho.org/english/SHA/be_v21n2-yellowfever.htm, the Epidemiological Bulletin, Vol. 21 No. 2, June 2000, Pan American Health Organization, accessed July 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In developing countries, vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access, the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storage. Sample vaccination schedules discussed by the [[World Health Organization]] show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a child's life and uses vaccines which cost over $700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only $25.&lt;ref name="WHO2"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241563864_eng.pdf State of the World's Vaccines and Immunizations (pdf)] from the [[World Health Organization]] (2003 edition)&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is due to the lower cost of health care, the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations, and that more expensive vaccines, often for less common diseases, are not utilized.

==Worldwide==
The [[World Health Organization]] monitors vaccination schedules across the world, noting what vaccines are included in each country's program, the coverage rates achieved and various auditing measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=WHO Vaccine Preventable Diseases Monitoring System | url=http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/en/ | date=22 December 2006 | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows the types of vaccines given in example countries. The WHO publishes on its website current vaccination schedules for all WHO member states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/data/en/ Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals: Data, statistics and graphics], [[World Health Organization]] (accessed August 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional vaccines are given to individuals that are much more likely to come into contact with certain diseases due to their occupation or travel to regions where the disease is present (including members of the military), or only after potentially infectious exposure. Examples include [[rabies vaccine]], [[anthrax vaccine]], [[cholera vaccine]] and [[smallpox vaccine]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/vpd-list.htm |title=Vaccines: VPD-VAC/List of VPDs |work= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-routine vaccinations====
Some children may receive vaccines in addition to those listed in the table: 
*[[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG]] vaccine is given at birth "to babies who are more likely to come into contact with [[Tuberculosis]] than the general population."
*[[Hepatitis B vaccine]] is given at birth "to babies whose mothers are hepatitis B positive."

====Adult vaccinations====
The five scheduled childhood tetanus vaccinations are thought to generally confer lifelong immunity; thus, no routine [[booster dose]]s are given in adulthood. Those adults at risk of contaminated cuts (e.g., gardeners) may have booster tetanus vaccination every ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/Td_IPV/FAQs/Will_I_need_more_boosters_in_the_future |title=Immunisation &amp;ndash; FAQs &amp;ndash; Will I need more boosters in the future? |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114001648/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/Td_IPV/FAQs/Will_I_need_more_boosters_in_the_future |archivedate=January 14, 2010 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pneumococcal]] vaccinations (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine/PPV) are recommended for those over 65 and for people without a functional spleen ([[asplenia]]), either because the spleen has been removed or does not work properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/Pneumococcal/FAQs/How_often_will_I_need_this_vaccine |title=Immunisation&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; FAQs&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; How often will I need this vaccine? |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112214042/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/Pneumococcal/FAQs/How_often_will_I_need_this_vaccine|archivedate=2008-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it should be noted that current CDC guidelines recommend that if not previously vaccinated, administer PCV13 first and give PPSV23 6–12 months after, but if previously received PPSV23, administer PCV13 ≥12 months after &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immunization Schedules|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/adult.html|website=Center for Disease Control|publisher=center for disease control and prevention|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flu vaccine]] is recommended for anyone who is aged 65 years and over, people with certain long-term medical conditions, health and social care professionals and [[poultry]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/Flu/Having_the_vaccination |title=Immunisation &amp;ndash; Having the vaccination &amp;ndash; Who is the vaccine for? |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218232406/http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk/Vaccines/Flu/Having_the_vaccination |archivedate=February 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The most up-to-date schedules are available from CDC's [[National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases]]. In the US, the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] requires all health-care providers to provide parents or patients with copies of Vaccine Information Statements before administering vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-instructions.pdf |title=Vaccine Information Statements: Instructions |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== During pregnancy ====
The CDC recommends pregnant women receive some vaccines, such as the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine a month or more before pregnancy. The Tdap vaccine (to help protect against whooping cough) is recommended '''during''' pregnancy. Other vaccines, like the flu shot, can be given before or during pregnancy, depending on whether or not it is flu season. Vacinnation is safe right after giving birth, even while breastfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/pregnant-women/index.html|title=Pregnancy and Vaccination {{!}} Vaccines for Pregnant Women {{!}} CDC|date=2017-07-20|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-28}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant/mom/get-vaccinated.html|title=Get the Whooping Cough Vaccine While You Are Pregnant|date=2017-07-24|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-02-28|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Obstetric_Practice/Update_on_Immunization_and_Pregnancy_Tetanus_Diphtheria-and-Pertussis-Vaccination|title=Update on Immunization and Pregnancy Tetanus Diphtheria and Pertussis Vaccination - ACOG|website=www.acog.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.midwife.org/ACNM/files/ACNMLibraryData/UPLOADFILENAME/000000000289/Immunization-in-Pregnancy-and-Postpartum-May-2014.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1900, the [[smallpox vaccine]] was the only one administered to children. By the early 1950s, children routinely received three vaccines, for protection against [[diphtheria]], [[pertussis]], [[tetanus]] and [[smallpox]], and as many as five shots by two years of age.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Since the mid-1980s, many vaccines have been added to the schedule. In 2009 the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommended [[vaccination]] against at least fourteen diseases. By two years of age, U.S. children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections, and might receive up to five shots during one visit to the doctor.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The use of combination vaccine products means that, {{As of|2013|lc=on}}, the [[United Kingdom]]'s immunization program consists of 9 injections by the age of two, rather than 22 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection.&lt;ref name="UKvaccines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/vaccination-schedule-age-checklist.aspx|title=Immunisation schedule|work=|format=|accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5720">'''WHOLE''' is a British anti-stigma [[mental health]] campaign developed in partnership with the [[NHS]] and [[YMCA]]. It first launched in 2016 and is fronted by one half of [[Rizzle Kicks]], Jordan Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McKinlay |first1=Rob |title=Rizzle Kicks star launches #IAMWHOLE mental health campaign with music video |url=https://www.prweek.com/article/1411521/watch-rizzle-kicks-star-launches-iamwhole-mental-health-campaign-music-video |website=PR Week |publisher=PR Week |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wilkins |first1=Andy |title=South Bucks mum is behind #IAMWHOLE campaign to reduce stigma around young people and mental health |url=https://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/14800386.South_Bucks_mum_is_behind__IAMWHOLE_campaign_to_reduce_stigma_around_young_people_and_mental_health/ |website=Slough Observer |publisher=Slough Observer |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2016, Spirit Media, the NHS and YMCA developed the #IAMWHOLE campaign for [[Brighton &amp; Hove]] City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=#IAMWHOLE |url=https://www.brightonandhovelscb.org.uk/i-am-whole/ |website=Brighton &amp; Hove LSCB |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for the campaign was inspired by Jordan Stephens’ track ‘Whole’, for which Spirit Media was filming the music video at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rizzle Kicks singer Jordan Stephens fronts mental health campaign |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-37592478/rizzle-kicks-singer-jordan-stephens-fronts-mental-health-campaign |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016 saw the launch of the campaign on World Mental Health Day at Brighton’s [[British Airways i360]] tower. The day also saw then Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt visit a local school to meet pupils and discuss mental health with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=#IAMWHOLE |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-37607562/iamwhole |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=le Duc |first1=Frank |title=Cabinet minister visits Hove school to hear about mental health campaign |url=https://www.brightonandhovenews.org/2016/10/14/cabinet-minister-visits-hove-school-to-hear-about-mental-health-campaign/ |website=Brighton &amp; Hove News |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove News |accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2016-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British [[alternative rock]] band [[Nothing But Thieves]] joined WHOLE for its second year, recording an acoustic version of their single "[[Broken Machine (album)|Broken Machine]]" exclusively for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Trendell |first1=Andrew |title=Nothing But Thieves discuss why it's time to change the way we talk about mental health |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/nothing-thieves-lead-new-campaign-change-way-talk-mental-health-2148504 |website=NME |publisher=NME |accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2017-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Go behind the scenes for Nothing But Thieves' #IAmWhole Mental Health Day video |url=https://www.readdork.com/features/go-behind-the-scenes-for-nothing-but-thieves-iamwhole-mental-health-day-video/ |website=Dork |publisher=Dork |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mason |first1=Conor |title=World Mental Health Day: Nothing But Thieves frontman Conor Mason writes for #IAMWHOLE campaign |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/world-mental-health-day-nothing-but-thieves-conor-mason-iamwhole-campaign-charity-band-tour-anxiety-a7990826.html |website=Independent |publisher=Independent |accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2017-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music video was launched on [[World Mental Health Day]] atop the [[BT Tower]], with Nothing But Thieves performing an acoustic gig to an intimate audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Levine |first1=Nick |title=Nothing But Thieves to perform atop London's BT Tower on World Mental Health Day |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/nothing-but-thieves-to-mark-world-mental-health-day-with-special-gig-atop-bt-tower-2146431 |website=NME |publisher=NME |accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2017-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women Health and Action Research Centre''' is a Nigerian non-profit and [[Foundation (nonprofit)|charitable organization]] based in [[Benin City]], [[Edo State]] to promote reproductive health through research and advocacy.&lt;ref name="(Nigeria)2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Women's Health and Action Research Centre (Nigeria)|title=HIV/AIDS in Nigeria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TjkgAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Women's Health and Action Research Centre|isbn=978-978-35481-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization was founded in 1993 by Professor [[Friday Okonofua]] as a means to provide lasting solutions to female reproductive related problems.&lt;ref name="OkonofuaOdunsi2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Friday Okonofua|author2=Kunle Odunsi|title=Contemporary Obstetrics and Gynaecology for Developing Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQAKAQAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Women's Health and Action Research Centre|isbn=978-978-35481-1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal==
The goal of the organization is to promote accessibility of women and adolescents to basic reproductive health. Women Health and Action Research Centre also aims to improve the social well-being and reproductive health of adolescents and women across African countries.&lt;ref name="Okonofua"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friday Okonofua|title=Confronting the Challenge of Reproductive Health in Africa: A Textbook for Students and Development Practitioners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POWRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|publisher=Universal-Publishers|isbn=978-1-62734-508-8|pages=35–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the key objective of Women Health and Action Research Centre is to reduce maternal mortality in the country and to design programs for promoting maternal health in Africa as well as advocacy for policies that will improve maternal health.&lt;ref name="Stringer2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernest T. Stringer|title=Action Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=url7ay18Ev8C&amp;pg=PA257|date=20 March 2007|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-8571-9|pages=257–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
===In general===
The Women Health and Action Research Centre relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.
The continued research growth and development of the organization is dependent mostly on donations but the organization also increases its revenue by alternative means of funding such as [[federal grant|grants]] and sponsorship.&lt;ref name=Women&gt;{{cite book|author=Women's Health and Action Research Centre (Nigeria)|title=Profile of the sexual and reproductive health of adolescents and young adults in Edo State, Nigeria: a situation analysis report of the Young Adults and Adolescent Reproductive Health (YAARH) initiative of Policy Project/USAID and Women's Health and Action Research Centre (WHARC).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-iFAAAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Women's Health and Action Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, [[MacArthur Foundation]] awarded a research grant of $250,000 to the organization in support of research to improve policies and programs for promoting maternal health in six states of Nigeria.
Between 2002 and 2015, the Women Health and Action Research Centre had received a grant of $550,000 from the MacArthur Foundation.&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macfound.org/grantees/884/|title=Women's Health and Action Research Centre|work=macfound.org|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
