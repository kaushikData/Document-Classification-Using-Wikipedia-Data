He was head astrologer to [[John II of Aragon|King John II]] of Aragon, father of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].

He could remove [[cataracts]] by a surgical procedure known as [[cataract surgery|couching]]. In 1468 he restored the eyesight of King John in two simple operations, who was completely blind before the surgeries.

Crescas was a leader of Aragon's Jewish community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">An '''agent of record''' ('''AOR''') is an individual or a legal entity with a duly executed contractual agreement with an [[insurance policy]] owner, in line with the prevailing legal norms and regulations of the region in which the contract was entered. The agent of record has a legal right to receive commissions from the respective insurance policy.

The individual or [[Legal personality|legal entity]] is authorized to represent an insured party in purchasing, servicing, and maintaining insurance coverage with a designated insurer. The majority of insurance companies will not disclose information or discuss an insured party's account with an agent other than the Agent of Record. An insured party wishing to change [[insurance agent]](s) must submit a revised agent of record letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluestarbenefits.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/agent-of-record-letter/ Agent of record letter]&lt;/ref&gt; to the respective insurer authorizing said insurer to release the insured party's information and to discuss the insured party's coverage with the newly appointed agent.

Relevant documents may be executed via hard copy documents or, alternatively, electronically in jurisdictions where electronic execution is legal. Applications may be made electronically, as well as in physical form.

An Agent of Record letter can, in some cases, be used as an insurance sales tool, though some question its legality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-12937881.html/ Agent of Record letters can lock in business accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disambiguation==
In the advertising and marketing industry, AOR stands for "Agency of Record." In this context, an AOR is an agency that is authorized to purchase advertising time (for radio or television advertising) or space (for print or web advertising) on behalf of the company with which they have an agency contract.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allbusiness.com/barrons_dictionary/dictionary-agency-of-record-4962111-1.html agency of record | Barrons Dictionary | AllBusiness.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8942">'''Alfred Maria Willner''' (11 July 1859 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1929) was an Austrian [[writer]], [[philosopher]], [[musicologist]], [[composer]] and [[librettist]].

Willner was born and died in Vienna.  He began composing mostly music for the piano before making a career writing librettos for [[ballet]]s, [[opera]]s and [[operetta]]s. One of his early operettas was [[Johann Strauss II]]’s ''Die Göttin der Vernunft'', a commitment that Strauss regretted. Strauss was forced to complete the commission only by the threat of a lawsuit and declined to attend a performance. Later the libretto and score were legally separated, and Willner revised the libretto for [[Franz Lehár]] as ''[[Der Graf von Luxemburg]]''.

Willner's first big success was his libretto for [[Leo Fall]]’s ''[[Die Dollarprinzessin]]'' and Willner soon became a much sought-after operetta librettist. He wrote several successful librettos for Lehár operettas, particularly in collaboration with {{Interlanguage link multi|Heinz Reichert|de}}. The two also collaborated on highly successful adaptations of music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], such as ''[[Das Dreimäderlhaus]]'', and by [[Johann Strauss I|Johann Strauss father]] and son, such as ''Walzer aus Wien''. In addition, Willner and Reichert were the contracted librettists for [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera ''[[La rondine]]'' which was later adapted by [[Giuseppe Adami]].

The '''Book of Nature''' is a religious and philosophical concept originating in the Latin [[Middle Ages]] which views nature as a book to be read for knowledge and understanding. There also was a book written by [[Conrad of Megenberg]] in the 14th century with the original German title of "Buch der Natur".&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite book |url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=rbc3&amp;fileName=rbc0001_2008rosen0080page.db&amp;recNum=0 |title = Book of Nature  |date =20 August 1481 |publisher = Library of Congress |accessdate = 2015-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early theologians{{who|date=July 2017}} believed the Book of Nature was a source of God's revelation to mankind: when read alongside sacred [[scripture]], the "book" of nature and the study of God's creations would lead to a knowledge of God himself. The concept corresponds to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|early Greek philosophical]] belief that man, as part of a coherent universe, is capable of understanding the design of the [[natural environment|natural world]] through reason. The concept is frequently deployed by philosophers, theologians, and scholars.

The first use of the phrase is unknown. However, [[Galileo]] used the phrase, quoting [[Tertullian]], when he wrote of how " “We conclude that God is known first through Nature, and then again, more particularly, by doctrine; by Nature in His works, and by doctrine in His revealed word.” (5) (5) Adversus Marcionem,  I, 18.."&lt;ref&gt;Galileo, Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina of Tuscany, 1615, Verses 272-279&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
From the earliest times in known civilizations, events in the natural world were expressed through a collection of stories concerning everyday life. In ancient times, a mortal world existed alongside an upper world of spirits and gods acting through nature to create a unified and intersecting moral and natural cosmos. Humans, living in a world that was acted upon by free acting and conspiring [[gods of nature]], attempted to understand their world and the actions of the divine by observing and correctly interpreting natural phenomena, such as the motion and position of stars and planets. Efforts to interpret and understand divine intentions led mortals to believe that intervention and influence over godly acts was possible—either through religious persuasion, such as prayer or gifts, or through magic, which depended on sorcery and the manipulation of nature in order to bend the will of the gods. Knowing divine intentions and anticipating divine actions through the manipulation of the natural world was believed achievable and the most effective approach. Thus, mankind had a reason to know nature.&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen (1992), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the sixth century BC, man’s relationship with the deities and nature began to change. Greek philosophers, such as [[Thales of Miletus]],  no longer viewed natural phenomena as the result of free acting, omnipotent gods. Rather, natural forces resided within nature, which was an integral part of a created world, and appeared under certain conditions that had little to do with the manipulative tendencies of personal deities. Furthermore, the Greeks believed that natural phenomena occurred by “necessity” through intersecting chains of “cause” and “effect.” Greek philosophers, however, lacked a technical vocabulary to express such abstract concepts as “necessity” or “cause” and consequently co-opted words available in the Greek language to refer metaphorically to the new [[philosophy of nature]]. Accordingly, the Greeks conceptualized the natural world in more specific terms that aligned with a new philosophy that viewed nature as immanent in which natural phenomena occurred by necessity.[2]

In Christianity early Church Fathers appeared to use the idea of a book of nature, librum naturae, as part of a two-book theology: "Among the Fathers of the Church, explicit references to the Book of Nature can be found, in St. Basil, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Augustine, John Cassian, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ephrem the Syrian, St. Maximus the Confessor." &lt;ref&gt;"The two books prior to the scientific revolution." Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith (2005): 4-5. Link: http://inters.org/tanzella-nitti/pdf/9.TwoBooks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Aristotelian corpus==
The Greek concept of nature, metaphorically expressed in the Book of Nature, gave birth to three philosophical traditions that became the wellspring for [[natural philosophy]] and early scientific thinking. Among the three traditions inspired by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Pythagoras]], the [[Aristotelian corpus]] became a pervasive force in natural philosophy until it was challenged in early modern times.[3]  Natural philosophy, which encompassed a body of work whose purpose was to describe and explain the natural world, derived its foremost authority from Aristotle, who viewed natural philosophy as a doctrine intended to explain natural events in terms of readily understood causes. In contrast, Aristotle considered the purely abstract mathematical constructs by Plato and Pythagoras inadequate for knowing the natural world because of their inability to provide causal explanations.

Aristotle reasoned that knowledge of natural phenomena was derived by abstraction from a sensory awareness of the natural world—in short, knowledge was obtained through sensory experience.[4]  A world constructed by abstract ideas alone could not exist. Furthermore, the structures inherent in nature are revealed through this process of abstraction, which may result in metaphysical principles that can be used to explain a variety of natural phenomena, including their causes and effects. Events that have no identifiable cause happen by chance and reside outside the boundaries of natural philosophy. The search for causal explanations became a dominant focus in natural philosophy whose origins lay in the Book of Nature as conceived by the earliest Greek philosophers.[5]

==Rediscovering God==
The Greeks succeeded in constructing a view of the natural world in which all references to [[mythological]] origins and causes were removed. By abandoning ancient ties to free acting, conspiring gods of nature, Greek philosophers inadvertently left the upper world vacant. The new philosophy of nature made unseen mythological forces irrelevant. While some philosophers drifted toward [[atheism]], others worked within the new philosophy to reconstitute the concept of a divine being. Consequently, the new outlook toward the natural world inspired the belief for a supreme force that was compatible with the new philosophy—in other words, [[monotheistic]]. However, the path leading from nature to rediscovering a divine being was uncertain. Once again, the Book of Nature was consulted, and it was Aristotle who interpreted its spoken text.[6]

The belief in causality in nature implied an endless, interconnected chain of causation acting upon the natural world. It is presumed, however, that Greek thought denied the existence of a natural world where causality was infinite, which gave rise to Aristotle's doctrine of "[[efficient cause]]," or “[[first cause]]," upon which the order of other causes must rely. The pathway to heaven became clear: “the First Cause is also the [[primum movens|Prime Mover]] of the world; and, since motion is a fact revealed by the senses, the Prime Mover must exist by necessity, a being unable to be otherwise than it is. Consequently, it is also perfect and thus the ultimate object of desire, or the ‘Supreme Good’. And, since nature operates for a purpose, the Prime Mover must also be intelligent. Being eternal it is divine…” and we now know of it as “God.”[7]  The ultimate cause, or source, of all natural phenomena occurring in the natural world had been discovered. There was but one God, and He has created all that resides in the Book of Nature.[8]

==Christianity and Greek culture==
The first contact between Christianity and Greek culture occurred in Athens in the first century A.D. Christian theologians viewed the Greeks as a pagan culture whose philosophers were obsessed with the wonders of the material, or natural, world. Observation and explanation of natural phenomena were of little value to the Church. Consequently, early Christian theologians dismissed Greek knowledge as being perishable in contrast to true knowledge derived from sacred Scripture. Yet, the Church Fathers struggled with questions concerning the natural world and its creation that reflected the concerns of Greek philosophers. Despite their rejection of pagan thinking, the Church Fathers benefited from Greek dialectic and ontology by inheriting a technical language that could help express solutions to their concerns.[9]  As Peter Harrison observes, “in the application of the principles of pagan philosophy to the raw materials of a faith, the content of which was expressed in those documents which were to become the New Testament, we can discern the beginnings of Christian theology.”[10]  Eventually, Church Fathers would recognize the value of the natural world because it provided a means of deciphering God’s work and acquiring true knowledge of Him. In other words, God has infused the material world with symbolic meaning, which if understood by man, reveals higher spiritual truths.[11]  For the moment, however, the Church’s indifference to nature would prevail in ecclesiastical matters.

What the Church Fathers needed, and did not inherit from the early Greek philosophers, was a method of interpreting the symbolic meanings embedded in the material world. According to Harrison, it was Church Father [[Origen]] in the third century who perfected a [[hermeneutical]] method that was first developed by the [[Platonists]] of the [[Alexandrian school]] by which the natural world could be persuaded to give up hidden meanings.[12]  “This universal hermeneutic was to provide interpretive strategies for dealing with both texts and objects in the physical world. It lay at the foundation of the ‘symbolist mentality’ of the [[middle ages]], and was the ''sine qua non'' of the medieval image of the ‘book of nature’."[13]

For their part, the Platonists believed the visible world reveals knowledge about the invisible world, which in turn, reveals truth and knowledge of the Creator. Origen then demonstrated how the natural world could be made intelligible to man through a process that exposed the spiritual realities which the material world signified. Thus, if the natural world was created to minister to the physical and spiritual needs of mankind, reading the Book of Nature ensured both needs could be fulfilled, in part through what the visible world signifies.[14]  The importance of reading the Book of Nature alongside sacred Scripture became evident because references to the natural world in sacred text were unintelligible unless the reader was knowledgeable about the Book of Nature in order to understand these references and interpret their meaning. However, whereas the Book of Nature served Scripture well, it lacked internal order and discernible relationships between the objects it represented thereby reducing nature to an inchoate and unintelligible language. The Book of Nature required substantial editing and revision, which would not occur for another nine hundred years.[15]

==Rediscovering the natural world==
By the twelfth century, a renewed study of nature was beginning to emerge along with the recovered works of ancient philosophers, which were being translated from Arabic and original Greek. The writings of Aristotle were among the most important of the ancient texts and had a remarkable influence among intellectuals. Interest in the material world, in conjunction with the doctrines of Aristotle, elevated sensory experience to new levels of importance. Earlier teachings concerning the relationship between God and man’s knowledge of material things were giving way to a world in which knowledge of the material world conveyed knowledge of God. Whereas scholars and theologians once held a symbolist mentality of the natural world as expressive of spiritual realities, intellectual thinking now regarded nature as a “coherent entity which could be systematically investigated by the senses. The idea of nature is that of a particular ordering of natural objects, and the study of nature the systematic investigation of that order.”[16]

The notion of order in nature implied a structure to the physical world whereby relationships between objects could be defined. According to Harrison, the twelfth century marked an important time in the Christian era when the world became invested with its own patterns of order—patterns based on networks of likeness or similarities among material things, which served to determine the character of a pre-modern knowledge of nature. While God has made all things that reside in the Book of Nature, certain objects in nature share similar characteristics with other objects, which delineates the sphere of nature and “establishes the systematising principles upon which knowledge of the natural world is based.”[17]  Thus, the Book of Nature was acquiring a table of contents and its subject matter could now be indexed. No longer a catalogue of religious symbols, the Book of Nature attained a unified and coherent whole in which the meaning of its contents was discernible.[18]  Indeed, nature could now be read like a book.

==Reading the Book of Nature==
Scholars, natural philosophers, emerging naturalists, and other readers of the new Book of Nature enthusiastically renewed their investigation of the natural world. Alongside sacred Scripture, the Book of Nature also became a font of divine revelation and a source of knowledge of God. This also implied that for mankind, nature itself became a new authority concerning the divine. There now existed two ways of knowing God—two texts, or two "books"—sacred Scripture and the Book of Nature, and two separate authorities, which was disquieting to many contemporary observers. Which textual authority took precedence? How would inconsistencies between the two texts be resolved? Who would mediate between the two books and exercise final interpretive authority? As Harrison points out, the exegesis of the Book of Nature became a critical concern, especially to the Church.[19]  Religious indifference to the material world, which had survived for centuries, came to an end by the thirteenth century. Interest in nature by Church Fathers would transform the study of nature into a theological enterprise. The Book of Nature became a bestseller among clerics and theologians anxious for its knowledge in their search for divine truth and concern for preserving and strengthening the authority of the Church in all matters ecclesiastical, which now included the Book of Nature.[20]

==Two books — two worlds?==
By the sixteenth century, discord between traditional authorities was beginning to surface. Ancient texts and doctrines were disputed, knowledge of the natural world was found to be incomplete, interpretation of Scripture was being challenged, and Greek philosophy, which helped draft the Book of Nature, and Scripture were viewed as fundamentally opposed.[21]  The Book of Nature was acquiring greater authority, for its wisdom and as an unmediated source of natural and divine knowledge. As a source of revelation, the Book of Nature remained moored to the Christian faith and occupied a prominent location in Western culture alongside sacred Scripture. The concern that these two books would eventually collide, however, was becoming increasingly evident among scholars, natural philosophers, and theologians, who viewed with trepidation the possibility of two separate and incompatible worlds—one determined to possess nature, and the other determined to uphold Christian faith. The social and religious transformations already underway in European society and western culture would shove these two diverging worlds even farther apart. The purpose for which the Book of Nature was written and the emerging confrontation between natural science and religion over the locus of authority on matters of truth and ideological certitude were fundamental issues that mankind, perched on the threshold of modernity, would be forced to contemplate.

{{italicize title}}
A '''''cacique''''' ({{IPA-es|kaˈθike|lang}}; {{IPA-pt|kɐˈsikɨ, kaˈsiki|lang}}; feminine form: '''''cacica''''') is a leader of an indigenous group, derived from the [[Taíno language|Taíno]] word ''kasikɛ'' for the [[pre-Columbian]] [[tribal chiefs]] in the [[Bahamas]], the [[Greater Antilles]], and the northern [[Lesser Antilles]].  In the colonial era, Spaniards extended the word as a title for the leaders of practically all indigenous groups that they encountered in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]], the term also has come to mean a [[political boss]] or leader who exercises significant power in the political system known as '''''caciquismo'''''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kern, ''The caciques: oligarchical politics and the system of caciquismo in the Luso-Hispanic world''. Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press [1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish colonial-era ''caciques''==
''Cacique'' comes from the [[Taíno language|Taíno]] word ''kassiquan'', meaning "to keep house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Catastrophe of Modernity: Tragedy and the Nation in Latin American Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13ogR22rwocC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=978-0-8387-5561-7|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Taíno culture, the ''cacique'' rank was apparently established through democratic means. His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his warlord skills since the Taínos were mostly a peaceable culture. They also enjoyed several privileges for their standing: they lived in a larger rectangular hut in the centre of the village, rather than the circular huts of other villagers, and they had a special sitting place for the ''areytos'' (ceremonial dances) and the ceremonial ball game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuertorico.org/reference/taino.shtml |title=Taíno Indians Culture |publisher=Topuertorico.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TupacAmaruII.jpg|thumb|[[Tupac Amaru II]], Andean ''cacique'' who led a massive rebellion in 1781.]]

Spaniards extended the usage of ''cacique'' to refer to leaders at the town or village level in virtually all indigenous groups in [[Spanish America]].&lt;ref&gt;Murdo J. MacLeod, "Cacique, Caciquismo" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture''. Vol. 1, p. 505. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Caribbean caciques who did not initially oppose the Spanish were co-opted into being intermediaries between the Spanish and their communities, but their cooperation was transitional and most revolted, resulting in their deaths in battle or by execution.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, "Caciques, Caciquismo", p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; Two famous early colonial-era ''caciques'' are [[Hatuey]] (Cuba) and [[Enriquillo]] (Hispaniola)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ida Altman]], "The Revolt of Enriquillo and the Historiography of Early Spanish America," ''The Americas'' vol. 63(4)2007, 587-614.&lt;/ref&gt;  who are now national heroes in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. At the base of the monument to Hatuey the historical plaque reads: "To the memory of Chief Hatuey, unforgettable native, precursor of the Cuban fight for freedom, he offered his life, glorifying his ideals while tormented by the flames on 2/2/1512. Monuments Delegation of [[Yara, Cuba|Yara]], 1999". Hatuey was a historical character in the 2010 film ''[[Even the Rain]]''.

In [[Mesoamerica|central Mexico]] in the colonial era, the Spanish more successfully utilized the leaders of the much more hierarchically organized indigenous peoples to function as intermediaries in the system of colonial rule. The hierarchy and nomenclature of indigenous leadership there might survive internally within communities, but the Spaniards' designation of ''caciques'' did not necessarily correspond to the hereditary indigenous system of leadership.

Elite indigenous men willing to cooperate with the colonial rule replaced those with hereditary and traditional claims to leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Charles Gibson]], ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish recognized the indigenous nobility as nobles within newly established colonial system, and ''caciques''' status along with their families was reinforced by their being allowed to hold the Spanish noble honorific ''[[don (honorific)|don]]'' and ''doña''. Some ''caciques'' had entailed estates called '''''[[cacicazgo]]s'''''. The records of many of these Mexican estates are held in the Mexican national archives in a section ''Vínculos'' ("entails").&lt;ref&gt;Guillermo S. Fernández de Recas, ''Cacicazgos y Nobiliario Indígena de la Nueva España'', Mexico: Biblioteca Nacional de México, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.L. Cline, "A ''Cacicazgo'' in the seventeenth century: The case of Xochimilco" in ''Land and Politics in the Valley of Mexico: A two-thousand-year perspective''. Ed. H.R. Harvey. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guido Münch, ''El cacicazgo de San Juan Teotihuacan durante la colonia, 1521-1821''. Mexico City: SEP, Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, Centro de Investigaciones Superiores 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of Spanish-style town government [''cabildos''] was used as a mechanism to replace traditional rule. Spanish manipulation of cabildo elections.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haskett, ''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas the traditional, members hereditary lineages became office holders on the town councils.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, "Cacique, Caciquismo", p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late colonial era in central Mexico, the term ''cacique'' had lost its dynastic meaning in many areas; "cacique status could in some degree buttress a family's prestige, but it could no longer in itself be regarded as a rank of major authority."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1769 appeal to the [[Viceroy of New Spain]] by a ''cacique'' family for restoration of its privileges, they were enumerated: that the cacique should be seated separately from commoners at public functions; he was excused from serving in town government; he was exempted from tribute and other exactions; he was excused from Sunday worship and payments of the half real; his servants were not liable for community labor; he was exempt from incarceration for debt and his property from sequestration; he could be imprisoned for serious crime but not jailed in the public jail; the caciques' names were to be listed among the nobles in official registers; and "all these privileges are to apply equally to the caciques' wives and widows." With Mexican independence in 1821, the special privileges of colonial-era caciques were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, "The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule," pp. 164-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Andes|Andean region]], the term ''[[kuraka]]'' was also used as an alternative to ''cacique''.  In Peru, the Spaniards had allowed the ''caciques'' to maintain their titles of nobility and perquisites of local rule so long as they were loyal to the Spanish monarch. In the late eighteenth century, a massive uprising, the [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II|Tupac Amaru rebellion]] (1781), often called the "Great Rebellion," was led by [[Tupac Amaru II]], a  ''cacique'' who claimed to be a descendant of the Inca royal line.  At independence in 1825, [[Simón Bolívar]] abolished noble titles, but the power and prestige of the ''caciques'' was already in decline following the Great Rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Méndez, ''The Plebeian Republic: The Huanta Rebellion and the Making of the Peruvian State''. Durham: Duke University Press 2005, pp. 102-05.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the early Caribbean ''caciques'' who rebelled shortly after the imposition of Spanish rule, the Tupac Amaru rebellion came after 250 years of colonial rule.

==''Caciquismo'' and ''Caudillismo''==
An extension of the term ''cacique'', '''''Caciquismo''''' ("boss rule") can refer to a political system dominated by the power of local [[political bosses]], the ''caciques''. In the post-independence period in Mexico, the term retained its meaning of "indigenous" leaders, but also took on a more general usage of a "local" or "regional" leader as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America: 1800-1850''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Wasserman, ''Capitalists, caciques, and revolution: the native elite and foreign enterprise in Chihuahua, Mexico, 1854-1911''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars make a distinction between ''[[caudillos]]'' ([[strongman (political)|political strongmen]]) and their rule, '''''caudillismo''''', and ''caciques'' and ''caciquismo''.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Díaz Díaz, ''Caudillos y caciques: Antonio López de Santa Anna y Juan Álvarez''. Mexico, 1972, 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; One Argentine intellectual, Carlos Octavio Bunge viewed ''caciquismo'' as emerging from anarchy and political disruption and then evolving into a "pacific" form of "civilized caciquismo," such as Mexico's [[Porfirio Díaz]] (r. 1876-1911).&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Octavio Bunge, "Caciquismo in Our America" (1918), in Hugh M. Hamill, ed. ''Caudillos: Dictators in Spanish America''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1992, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine writer Fernando N.A. Cuevillas views ''caciquismo'' as being "nothing more than a special brand of tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;Fernando N.A. Cuevillas, "A Case for Caudillaje and Juan Perón" in Hugh M. Hamill, ed. ''Caudillos'', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, ''caciquismo'' appeared in [[Spain under the Restoration|late 19th-century Spain and early 20th-century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= José|last= Varela Ortega|title= El poder de la influencia: Geografía del caciquismo en España: (1875–1923)|publisher= Centro de Estudios Políticos y Constitucionales|year= 2001|isbn= 978-84-259-1152-1|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QY99T3Mg5ykC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Writer Ramón Akal González views [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in northwest of Spain, as having remained in a continual state of strangulated growth over centuries as a result of ''caciquismo'' and nepotism. "Galicia still suffers from this anachronistic caste of caciques."&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Akal González, ''Obra Completa II'', 1977, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish strongman [[Caudillo|El Caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]] (1892-1975) was born in [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] in Galicia.

In the Philippines, the term ''cacique democracy'' was coined by [[Benedict Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Anderson, '[https://newleftreview.org/I/169/benedict-anderson-cacique-democracy-and-the-philippines-origins-and-dreams Cacique Democracy in the Philippines: Origins and Dreams]', ''New Left Review'', I (169), May–June 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used to describe the political system where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers.&lt;ref&gt;Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, [http://whynationsfail.com/blog/2012/12/26/cacique-democracy.html Cacique Democracy']&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines was a colony of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] from the late sixteenth century until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, when the United States assumed control. The U.S. administration subsequently introduced many commercial, political and administrative reforms. They were sometimes quite progressive and directed towards the modernization of government and commerce in the Philippines. However, the local traditional Filipino elites, being better educated and better connected than much of the local population, were often able to take advantage of the changes to bolster their positions.

There is no consensus in the scholarly literature about the origins of ''caciquismo''. [[Murdo J. MacLeod]] suggests that the terms ''cacique'' and ''caudillo'' "either require further scrutiny or, perhaps, they have become so stretched by the diversity of explanations and processes packed into them that they have become somewhat empty generalizations."&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, "Cacique, Caciquismo", p. 506&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Codex Tchacos''' is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[papyrus]], which contains early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] texts from approximately 300 [[AD]]: the [[Letter of Peter to Philip]], the [[First Apocalypse of James]], the [[Gospel of Judas]], and a fragment of the Book of Allogenes (or the Book of the Stranger, this is different from the previously known Nag Hammadi text [[Allogenes]]).

The Codex Tchacos is important, because it contains the first known surviving copy of the Gospel of Judas, a text that was rejected as heresy by the early Christian church and lost for 1700 years. The Gospel of Judas was mentioned and summarized by the Church Father [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] in his work ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Against Heresies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;c. 180, Adv. Haer. 1.31.1.&lt;/ref&gt; This would make the Gospel of Judas older than the codex. 

==The Codex==
[[File:Codex Tchacos p33.jpg|thumb|left|First page of the [[Gospel of Judas]] (p. 33)]]
The [[codex]] was rediscovered near [[El Minya]], [[Egypt]], during the 1970s, and stored in a variety of unorthodox ways by various dealers who had little experience with antiquities. One stored it in a [[safe deposit box]] and another actually froze the documents, causing a unique and difficult kind of decay that makes the papyrus appear sandblasted.  (Archivists can do nothing to remedy this damage since it is caused by the outer layers of the papyrus flaking off—taking ink with them.)  Scholars heard rumors of the text from the 1980s onward as dealers periodically offered it for sale (displaying portions of the text or photographs of portions of the text in the process.)  It was not examined and translated until 2001 after its current owner, Frieda Nussberger-Tchacos, concerned with its deteriorating condition, transferred it to the [[Maecenas Foundation for Ancient Art]] in [[Basel, Switzerland]]. She named it in honor of her father, Dimaratos Tchacos.

Roughly a dozen pages of the original manuscript, seen briefly by scholars in the 1970s, are missing from the Codex today; it is believed that they were sold secretly to dealers, but none have come forward.  According to National Geographic's website, fragments purported to be from the codex may also be part of an Ohio antiquities dealer's estate.

In April 2006, a complete translation of the text, with extensive footnotes, was released by the [[National Geographic Society]]: ''The Gospel Of Judas'' ({{ISBN|1-4262-0042-0}}, April 2006). The Society also created a two-hour television documentary, ''The Gospel of Judas'', which aired worldwide on the [[National Geographic Channel]] on April 9, 2006.  A special issue of ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazine was also devoted to the Gospel of Judas.  A critical edition of the Codex Tchacos, including complete, near life-sized color photographs of 26 pages, a revised transcription of the Coptic, and complete translation of the codex was published by National Geographic Society in 2007.  The team also hopes to look at the cartonnage (a sort of paper-mâché used to stiffen the codex's cover) in order to find clues about who made the codex and when/where.  (As a book the Tchacos Codex may be older than the twelve surviving volumes of the Nag Hammadi Library.)

[[April DeConick|April D. DeConick]] (the Isla Carroll and Percy E. Turner Professor of Biblical Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at Rice University) has published a book, ''The Thirteenth Apostle:  What the Gospel of Judas Really Says'', questioning both the ''National Geographic's'' handling of the Gospel of Judas' publication and the veracity of its translation.  She has argued both that ''National Geographic'' denied competent scholars access and that the scholars who were granted access to the Codex Tchacos were not able to go about their work properly due to the constraints put upon them, accusations similar to those leveled at the guardians of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].  Most notably, she points out that the first ''National Geographic'' translation omitted a "not," reversing the meaning of the text.  In an opinion piece in the ''New York Times'' (December 1, 2007), she wrote:
:According to the National Geographic translation, Judas’s ascent to the holy generation would be cursed. But it’s clear from the transcription that the scholars altered the Coptic original, which eliminated a negative from the original sentence. In fact, the original states that Judas will "not ascend to the holy generation."

The importance of the Codex Tchacos is not in doubt, but work has only begun in understanding its true influence and origin.

'''''Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Abner Kneeland''''' was an 1838 Massachusetts state court case, notable for being the last time a court in the United States jailed a defendant for [[blasphemy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard W. Levy|Levy, Leonard]].  ''Blasphemy in Massachusetts: Freedom of Conscience and the Abner Kneeland Case.'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The defendant, [[Abner Kneeland]], was a mercurial preacher who had been a [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist]], but had since converted to a form of [[pantheism]].  He published letters in which he expounded on his recently adopted pantheist philosophy, denying any God other than Nature as well as the uniquely particular divinity of Jesus Christ.  Already a controversial figure, he was taken to court after he admitted having written these statements.  The legal indictment was for "willfully blaspheming the holy name of God" and for his public disavowal of Christ.  Though the statements used for the prosecution were written in 1833, delays and restarts of the trial meant that the final case was heard in 1838.

At trial, Kneeland raised three defenses of his actions:

# Kneeland claimed he never denied the existence of ''God'', merely the existence of "a" God.  Therefore, he was not an atheist.
# The law itself was invalid and should be overturned, as it was in violation with the [[Massachusetts Constitution]]'s guarantee of religious freedom.
# The law also violated the guarantee of freedom of the press.

The court was unconvinced by Kneeland's claims.  It ruled that regardless of his beliefs, he had libeled God's name with malicious intent, rendering Kneeland's first point moot.  As for the second, the court examined other states' colonial charters and pointed out that they too had reconciled blasphemy laws with guarantees of religious freedom, and that the law "was passed very soon after the adoption of the constitution, and no doubt, many members of the convention which framed the constitution, were members of the legislature which passed this law."  Therefore, they must not conflict.  The court dismissed the third claim out of hand, saying that if unlimited freedom of the press was allowed,

:''the article in question become a general license for scandal, calumny and falsehood against individuals, institutions and governments, in the form of publication ... but all incitation to treason, assassination, and all other crimes however atrocious, if conveyed in printed language, would be dispunishable.''

Kneeland was sentenced to sixty days in prison. In his support, a petition was put forward by for his pardon under grounds of free speech by [[William Ellery Channing]], signed by various prominent people including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]]. However, a counter-petition was signed with even more signatures; Kneeland stayed in prison and served his entire term.

'''''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments''''' ({{lang-da|Afsluttende uvidenskabelig Efterskrift til de philosophiske Smuler}}) is a major work thought to be by [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. The work is a poignant attack against [[Hegelianism]], the philosophy of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], especially Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic]]''. The work is also famous for its dictum, ''Subjectivity is Truth''. It was an attack on what Kierkegaard saw as Hegel's [[determinism|deterministic]] philosophy. Against Hegel's system, Kierkegaard is often interpreted as taking the side of [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]] or [[freewill]], though it has been argued that an [[incompatibilist]] conception of free will is not essential to Kierkegaard's formulation of existentialism.

As the title suggests, the Postscript is sequel to the earlier ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]''. The title of the work is ironic because the Postscript is almost five times larger than the Fragments. The Postscript credits "Johannes Climacus" as the author and Kierkegaard as its editor. Like his other pseudonymous works, the Postscript is not a reflection of Kierkegaard's own beliefs. However, unlike his other pseudonymous works, Kierkegaard attaches his name as editor to this work, showing the importance of the Postscript to Kierkegaard's overall authorship.

==Contrasts in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! '''Objectivity'''
! '''Subjectivity'''
|-
| '''Objective truth''' is that which relates to propositions, that which has no relation to the existence of the knower. History, science, and speculative philosophy all deal with objective knowledge. According to Climacus, all objective knowledge is subject to doubt. Focuses on what is asserted.
| '''Subjective truth''' is essential or ethico-religious truth. It is not composed of propositions or perceptions of the external world, but of introspection, experiences, and especially one's relationship with God.
|-
| '''Direct communication''' consists of statements that can be communicated and understood without appropriation, that is, without experiencing personally what is being communicated. Objective knowledge can be communicated directly.
| '''Indirect communication''' requires appropriation on the part of the receiver.  The receiver must experience or have experienced what is being communicated, not just hear it.

{{Quotation|When I began as an author of Either/Or, I no doubt had a far more profound impression of the terror of Christianity than any clergyman in the country. I had a fear and trembling such as perhaps no one else had. Not that I therefore wanted to relinquish Christianity. No, I had another interpretation of it. For one thing I had in fact learned very early that there are men who seem to be selected for suffering, and, for another thing, I was conscious of having sinned much and therefore supposed that Christianity had to appear to me in the form of this terror. But how cruel and false of you, I thought, if you use it to terrify others, perhaps upset every so many happy, loving lives that may very well be truly Christian.

It was as alien as it could possibly be to my nature to want to terrify others, and therefore I both sadly and perhaps also a bit proudly found my joy in comforting others and in being gentleness itself to them-hiding the terror in my own interior being.

So my idea was to give my contemporaries (whether or not they themselves would want to understand) a hint in humorous form (in order to achieve a lighter tone) that a much greater pressure was needed-but then no more; I aimed to keep my heavy burden to myself, as my cross. I have often taken exception to anyone who was a sinner in the strictest sense and then promptly got busy terrifying others. Here is where Concluding Postscript comes in.

Soren Kierkegaard, Journal and Papers, VI 6444 (Pap. X1 A541) (1849) (Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 451-452)}}

==Reception==
Eduard Geismar was an early lecturer on the works of Soren Kierkegaard. He gave lectures at [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in March 1936 and states this about Johannes Climacus: {{Quotation|Johannes Climacus has so delineated the ethico-religious life that Christianity becomes an intensification of subjectivity and its pathos. Through the discipline of resignation, aiming at an absolute commitment  to the highest good, through the discipline of suffering, through the consciousness of guilt, the way leads step by step to a more profound pathos, until by a leap we reach the absolute maximum of subjectivity in the Christian consciousness of sin, with its imperative need for a new departure. The Christian revelation is not a set of propositions, but a creative act of the individual who has been prepared to receive it in part by the very discipline of human idealism, and who through this creative act becomes a new creature. But no birth is without birth-pangs and no revelation is without an experience of suffering. The way to Christianity goes through a decision, a crucial decision in the temporal moment; faith is an existential leap. The necessity of this leap is what gives offense to man and to all human idealism. Eduard Geismar, ''Lectures on the Religious Thought of Soren Kierkegaard'', p. 57 Augsburg Publishing House, Minneapolis 1937}}
[[Emil Brunner]] mentioned Kierkegaard 51 times in his 1937 book ''Man in Revolt'' and wrote a semi-serious parody of Kierkegaard's idea of truth as subjectivity by making truth objectivity in 1947. {{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;The phrase Everything is relative is spoken emphatically by the very people for whom the atom or its elements are still the ultimate reality. Everything is relative, they say, but at the same time they declare as indubitable truth that the mind is nothing but a product of cerebral processes. This combination of gross objectivism and bottomless subjectivism represents a synthesis of logically irreconcilable, contradictory principles of thought, which is equally unfortunate from the point of view of philosophical consistency and from that ethical and cultural value. Apart from this last sceptical stage, it must be said that modem spiritual evolution has been taking unambiguously the line of a more or less materialistic objectivism. This chapter of human history could be headed — to parody Kierkegaard's phrase — The object is the truth! &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot, then, be a surprise to see man more and more engulfed in the object, in things, in material being, in economic life, in technics, in a one-sided, quantitative manner of thinking, and in quantitative standards of value. In the sphere of material being the quantum is the only differentiating factor. Material being is merely quantitative being. An objectivist understanding of truth expresses itself, therefore, not merely in terms of practical materialism, but also in a general quantification of all life, as it may be seen in the craving for records in sport, in pride in the growth of cities of millions of inhabitants, in respect for the multi-millionaire, in admiration for great political power. Reverence for the quantum is, so to speak, the new version of the worship of the golden calf. It is an inevitable consequence of the objectivist conception of truth: The object is the truth.

The question as to whether Kierkegaard was an existentialist was brought up by Libuse Lukas Miller. She wrote the following in 1957: {{Quotation|Kierkegaard, who is falsely hailed as the father of modern existentialism, used the existential “dialectic” never as an end in itself but always as an offensive and defensive weapon in a battle on behalf of the Christian faith deliberately planned to meet what he thought were the special apologetic and evangelistic needs of his historical situation, and, therefore, the Kierkegaardian existentialism should be regarded rather as the exception than the rule in existential philosophizing. And Kierkegaard himself should not be called the father of modern existentialism. The Christian and the World of Unbelief 1957 by Libuse Lukas Miller p. 78}}

In 1963 Kenneth Hamilton described [[Paul Tillich]] as an individual who was as anti-Hegel as Kierkegaard was. He was referring to Kierkegaard's distrust of system builders which he discussed in ''The Concluding Unscientific Postscript'' (p. 13-15, 106-112.) {{Quotation|The first total opponent of Hegel's standpoint was Soren Kierkegaard, father of modern existentialism. Hegel had many critics in his lifetime, but they were mostly those who attacked his system because they believed that they could construct a better one themselves. But his Danish critic attacked him for being the most consistent system-builder among system-builders. In the name of Christian faith Kierkegaard rejected not this or that element in [[Hegelianism]] but the whole, referring to it in mockery as c the System. So it happens that the issue of system versus the Christian faith has been debated more than a hundred years ago. And that encounter between system and anti-system is very relevant to any examination of philosophical theology to-day.  Certainly Tillich, who is often critical of Hegel, nearly always speaks in praise of Kierkegaard, and he gives such an important place in his own thinking to the category of existence that he seems at times to be travelling in the Danish thinker's footsteps. ''The System and the Gospel A Critique Of Paul Tillich'' by Kenneth Hamilton 1963 MacMillan Press p. 37}}

'''Cosmography''' is the science that [[map]]s the general features of the [[cosmos]] or [[universe]], describing both [[heaven]] and [[Earth]] (but without encroaching on [[geography]] or [[astronomy]]). The 14th-century work ''[['Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat]]'' by [[Persian people|Persian]] physician [[Zakariya al-Qazwini]] is considered to be an early work of cosmography.

Traditional Hindu, Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] cosmography schematize a universe centered on [[Mount Meru]] surrounded by rivers, continents and seas.  These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.
[[File:Peasants spinning.png|thumb|left|Sedentary Occupations of Peasants&lt;!---Facsimile from 
an Engraving on Wood, attributed to---&gt; &amp;ndash; by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], in the "Cosmographie" of Munster (Basle, 1552, folio).]]
In 1551, [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]], from [[Zaragoza]], Spain, published ''[[Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar]]''. Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.

[[Peter Heylin]]'s 1652 book ''Cosmographie'' (enlarged from his ''Microcosmos'' of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of [[Australia]] and among the first of [[California]]. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on ''[[Terra incognita|Terra Incognita]]'', including Australia, and extending to [[Utopia]], [[Álfheimr|Fairyland]], and the "Land of [[Chivalry|Chivalrie]]".

In 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive ''Compendious Description of the Whole World'', which also included a [[chronology]] of world events from [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] forward. These were all part of a major trend in the [[European Renaissance]] to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.

The word was also commonly used by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his lectures.

In [[astrophysics]], the term "cosmography" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|matter distribution]] and [[kinematics]] of the [[universe|observable universe]], dependent on the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] but independent of the temporal dependence of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14860">'''Countergradient variation''' is a type of [[phenotypic plasticity]] that occurs when the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] variation determined by a biological population's [[genotype|genetic]] components opposes the phenotypic variation caused by an environmental gradient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conover|first=David|last2=Schultz|first2=Eric|year=1995|title=Phenotypic similarity and the evolutionary significance of countergradient variation|url=|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=10|pages=248–252|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can cause different populations of the same organism to display similar phenotypes regardless of their underlying genetics and differences in their environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

To illustrate a common example known as countergradient growth rate, consider two populations. The two populations live in different environments that affect growth differently due to many ecological factors, such as the temperature and available food. One population is genetically predisposed to have an increased growth rate but inhabits an environment that reduces growth rate, such as a cool environment, and thereby limits the opportunities to take full advantage of any genetic predisposition. The second population is genetically predisposed to have a decreased growth rate but inhabits an environment that supports an increased growth rate, such as a warm environment, and allows members of the population to grow faster despite their genetic disadvantage. Since the genetic influence directly counteracts the environmental influence in each population, both populations will have a similar intermediate growth rate. Countergradient variation can reduce apparent variability by creating similar phenotypes, but it is still possible for the two populations to show phenotypic diversity if either the genetic gradient or the environmental gradient has a stronger influence.

Many examples of countergradient variation have been discovered through the use of [[transplant experiments]]. Countergradient variation of growth rate is one of the most common examples. Growth rate and body size have important ecological implications, such as how they impact an organism's survival, life history, and [[fecundity]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yampolsky|first=Lev Y.|last2=Scheiner|first2=Samuel M.|date=1996|title=Why Larger Offspring at Lower Temperatures? A Demographic Approach|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/285841|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=147|issue=1|pages=86–100|doi=10.1086/285841|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Countergradient variation has been described in many [[ectotherm]]ic animals, since ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic rates, and thus, their growth rates. Ectotherms grow at a slower rate as latitude increases due to this impact of temperature. However, under countergradient variation, when these same animals are placed in a common environment with their low-latitude relatives, they grow faster relative to the low-latitude population. These studies are useful in predicting how animals can adapt to and will survive in different environmental conditions.

==History==
[[File:Male Green Frog - Hunterdon County, NJ.jpg|thumb|Green frog ''[[Lithobates clamitans]]'' unexpectedly grows faster in montane populations]]
Countergradient variation, originally termed "contra-gradient variation", was coined by [[Richard Levins]] in his 1968 book ''Evolution in Changing Environments.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution in Changing Environments|last=Levins|first=Richard |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1968|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levins first used the term when describing patterns of body size across an altitudinal gradient in populations of ''Drosophila'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levins|first=Richard =|year=1969|title=Thermal Acclimation and Heat Resistance in Drosophila Species|jstor=2459410 |journal=The American Naturalist|volume=103|issue=933|pages=483–499|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then many other instances of countergradient variation have been discovered. A study by Keith Berven and others was the first to find countergradient variation in a vertebrate.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berven|first=Keith A. |last2=Gill|first2=Douglas E.|last3=Smith-Gill|first3=Sandra J.|date=1979|year=|title=Countergradient Selection in the Green Frog, Rana clamitans |jstor=2407784|journal=Evolution |volume=33 |issue=2|pages=609–623 |doi=10.2307/2407784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they found that in comparing montane, high altitude, populations to lowland, low altitude populations of the green frog (''[[Lithobates clamitans]]'', formerly ''Rana clamitans''), rates of growth and development were higher in the montane populations. This is counter to what is expected since high altitude populations grow slower than low altitude ones in their respective environments. Similar to the results of this study, most of the known instances of countergradient variation are associated with a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient having an effect on growth rate (see Examples section).

==Mechanisms==
Countergradient variation is the opposite of [[cogradient variation]], in which the environmental effect on the phenotype enhances the genetic effect on the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One common way to test for both of these patterns is with [[transplant experiments]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By bringing the two populations to the same environment, the environmental effect on phenotype is eliminated and only the genetic effect will cause variation. If cogradient variation is occurring, the same relationship will be seen in the common environment as the two natural environments. However, if countergradient variation is occurring the opposite relationship of what is seen in the natural environments will be seen in the common environment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arendt |first=Jeffrey D. |year=1997 |title=Adaptive Intrinsic Growth Rates: An Integration Across Taxa|jstor=3036336 |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=72|issue=2|pages=149–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if Population 1 has higher growth than Population 2 in their respective natural environments, countergradient variation can be detected if, when brought to the same environment, Population 1 now has lower growth than Population 2. Many of the examples listed above were discovered through these types of experiments. However, the mechanisms of how these differential growth rates arise is not fully understood.

Take the example of ''[[Eastern fence lizard|Sceloporus undulatus]],'' the eastern fence lizard. These lizards demonstrate countergradient variation in growth rate across a latitudinal gradient. That is, in a common environment eggs from populations from the northern part of their range hatch out sooner than the eggs from populations at a more southern range.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is opposite the pattern seen in their native habitats. One explanation for this could be that the northern eggs are also naturally larger, so they have more yolk energy available. Originally this maternal investment in larger eggs was thought to support increased developmental rate. However when yolk is removed from the eggs so that the populations have equal energy sources, there is still a substantial difference in growth.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; Therefore, the mechanism behind this differential growth rate may lie in the efficiency of energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Storm |first=Melissa|last2=Angilletta|first2=Michael|year=2007|title=Rapid assimilation of yolk enhances growth and development of lizard embryos from a cold environment |url=http://angilletta.lab.asu.edu/Publications/Storm%20&amp;%20Angilletta%202007.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=210 |pages=3415–3421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological relevance==
Populations that inhabit high latitudes experience shorter growing seasons than those that inhabit low latitudes due to the differences in seasonality. Because of this, it is thought that countergradient variation of growth is a means to compensate for the short amount of time juveniles have to prepare for winter.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With a genetic disposition to grow faster, these individuals can reach a large enough body size to survive through the winter. Increased body size is also associated with higher reproductive output.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, when countergradient variation acts on developmental rates, embryos that develop sooner or hatch out larger will have more time to grow or require less resources, respectively.

Since these inherently fast growth rates are not observed in all populations, it seems there are potential trade-offs that would prevent this from being beneficial in low latitude populations. One proposed detriment of enhanced embryonic growth is that animals use too much of their supplied nutrients or yolk during development. In some species of lizards the yolk remaining after hatching is absorbed into the body and used as energy for growth as a hatchling.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Troyer|first=Katherine|date=1987|year=|title=Posthatching Yolk in a Lizard: Internalization and Contribution to Growth |jstor=1564470 |journal=Journal of Herpetology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=102–106|doi=10.2307/1564470}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of more yolk energy during development diminishes the reserves available for hatchling growth and can impact hatchling survival.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinervo|first=Barry|date=1990|year=|title=The Evolution of Maternal Investment in Lizards: An Experimental and Comparative Analysis of Egg Size and Its Effects on Offspring Performance|jstor=2409407 |journal=Evolution |volume=44|issue=2 |pages=279–294|doi=10.2307/2409407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis is that animals that grow quickly do not expend as much energy on differentiation or cellular maintenance because they have shorter incubation times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This allows more energy to be used for growth, but less energy for differentiation. Increased growth has been shown to lead to higher occurrences of defects or complications that cause higher rates of mortality. Some examples include rapid growth leading to bone deformities in sandhill cranes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serafin|first=J. A.|date=1982-01-01|title=The Influence of Diet Composition upon Growth and Development of Sandhill Cranes|jstor=1367448|journal=The Condor|volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=427–434|doi=10.2307/1367448}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased risk of cardiovascular problems in Atlantic salmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=R. L.|last2=Farrell|first2=A. P.|last3=Knox|first3=D. E.|date=1992|title=Progression of Coronary Arterial Lesions in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) as a Function of Growth Rate|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f92-098|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=49 |issue=5|pages=878–884 |doi=10.1139/f92-098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals are able to employ different strategies for growth and development to counteract environmental challenges. However, the fact that all individuals do not grow faster and the presence of the mentioned potential fitness trade-offs show that there must be some limit to how much animals can use countergradient growth to compensate for environmental conditions that cause slow growth. Studies of countergradient variation are being explored as a useful way to predict the evolutionary constraints animals face in differing environmental conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6225">'''David Braybrooke''' (October 18, 1924 – August 7, 2013) was a [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]] and professor emeritus at both [[Dalhousie University]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].

==Biography and Education==
Braybrooke was born in [[Hackettstown, New Jersey]]. He graduated from Boonton High School in 1942 and volunteered for the Army. After the war, he received a BA in Economics from [[Harvard]] in 1948, followed by a MA in Philosophy from [[Cornell University]], and a Ph.D. in Philosophy at Cornell in 1953, where he wrote a dissertation on welfare and happiness. He also studied English for a term under [[F. R. Leavis]] at [[Downing College, Cambridge]].

==Academic career==

Braybrooke was an instructor of philosophy at the [[University of Michigan]] (1953–54) and [[Bowdoin College]] (1954-56), and assistant professor at [[Yale University]] (1956–63), where he taught in an interdisciplinary economics and politics program. He also continued post-graduate studies at [[New College, Oxford]] (American Council Learned Societies Fellow, 1953) and at [[Balliol College]], Oxford (Rockefeller Foundation grantee, 1959–60). In 1962, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and in 1963 he began teaching at Dalhousie, where he remained until his retirement in 1990, after which he was made McCulloch Professor of Philosophy and Politics Emeritus.

He continued to teach until 2005, at the University of Texas at Austin, holding the Centennial Commission Chair in the Liberal Arts as a Professor of Government and Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquiswhoswho.com |title=Marquis Who's Who |publisher=Marquiswhoswho.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Dalhousie, he was visiting professor at  [[University of Pittsburgh]] (1965–66); the [[University of Toronto]] (1966-67); the [[University of Minnesota]] (1971); the [[University of California at Irvine]] (1980); the [[University of Chicago]] (1984); [[Tulane University]] (1988). He was also a visiting fellow at [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]], Cambridge (1985–86); Cecil H. &amp; Ida Green Visiting Professor of Philosophy, [[University of British Columbia]] (Oct. 1986); John Milton Scott Visiting Professor of Philosophy, [[Queen's University]] (Oct. 1988).

==Research==
Braybrooke's research interests included problems in [[ethics]], [[philosophy]], and [[political science|political]] and [[social science]], and he authored over 150 articles, book chapters and scholarly reviews, and 11 books, including ''A Strategy of Decision'' (with C. E. Lindblom) (1963), ''Three Tests for Democracy'' (1967), ''Philosophy of Social Science'' (1987), ''Meeting Needs'' (1987), and ''Logic on the Track of Social Change'' (with Bryson Brown and Peter K. Schotch) (1995). Another book in which he had a large part, ''Social Rules'', came out in 1996. The [[University of Toronto Press]] published a collection of his essays, ''Moral Objectives, Rules, and the Forms of Social Change'', in 1998, and, in 2001, ''Natural Law Modernized'', came out at the same press, as did ''Utilitarianism: Restorations; Repairs; Renovations'' in 2004. University of Toronto Press published a fourth book in this series in 2006, ''Analytical Political Philosophy: From Discourse, Edification''.

As Susan Sherwin wrote in the introduction to ''Engaged Philosophy: Essays in Honour of David Braybrooke'', his "aim is to help guide policy debates by allowing participants to determine appropriate rules for attending to the needs of citizens of nations and of the world in a fair and achievable way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherwin|first1=edited by Susan|last2=Schotch|first2=Peter K.|title=Engaged philosophy : essays in honour of David Braybrooke|date=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=0802038905|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
Braybrooke was President of the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] (1974–75), President of the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] (1971–72), and Vice President of the [[American Political Science Association]] (1981–82).  He was elected to the [[Royal Society of Canada]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.dal.ca/DUASC/FindingAids/MS_2_641/ |title=The Archives of David Braybrooke: A Guide Collection Number: MS-2-641 |publisher=Library.dal.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226123445/http://www.library.dal.ca/DUASC/FindingAids/MS_2_641/ |archivedate=2014-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalhousie University awarded Braybrooke the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/academics/convocation/ceremonies/honorary_degree_recipients/hon_degree_2011/david_braybrooke.html|title=David Braybrooke|publisher=Dalhousie University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dmitry Sergeyevich Likhachov''' ({{lang-ru|Дми́трий Серге́евич Лихачёв}}, also ''Dmitri Likhachev'' or ''Likhachyov''; {{OldStyleDate|28 November|1906|15 November}} – 30 September 1999) was [[Russian people|Russian]] [[medievalist]], [[linguist]], and [[concentration camp]] survivor. During his lifetime, Likhachov was considered the world's foremost scholar of the [[Old Russian language]] and its literature.

He was revered as "the last of old St Petersburgers", and as "a guardian of national culture". Due to his high profile as a [[Soviet dissident]] during his later life, Likhachov was often referred to as "Russia's conscience".

==Life and career==
Dmitry Likhachov was born in [[Saint Petersburg]]. From his early childhood he had a passion for literature, even though his parents did not approve of this interest.

In a 1987 interview with [[David Remnick]], Likhachov recalled how he had, "watched the February and [[October Revolution]]s from his window."&lt;ref name="Remnick 104"&gt;David Remnick (1994), ''Lenin's Tomb: The Last Days of the Soviet Empire'', page 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, at only 16 years old, Likhachov entered the Department of Linguistics and Literature of [[Leningrad State University]]. He attended the Roman-Germanic and Slavic-Russian sections at the same time, undertaking two diplomas. At the university the young Likhachov met many outstanding scientists and developed his own way of thinking. Likhachov graduated in 1928 from the [[Leningrad University]]. In 1928, at the end of his studies, Likhachyov was arrested and accused of being a member of what Remnick called, "a students' literary group called the Cosmic Academy of Sciences", which "posed about as great a threat to the [[Kremlin]] as the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' does to the [[White House]]."&lt;ref name="Remnick 104"/&gt;

For his election as an [[Academician]], Likhachyov had presented a short report, in which he poked fun at the [[Reforms of Russian orthography|new spelling rules of 1918]] and urged that they be "reformed" by restoring the banned letter "Yat". After his arrest, Likhachyov was confronted with the paper by a [[Soviet secret police]] interrogator, who screamed, "What do you mean by language reform? Perhaps we won't even have any language at all under Socialism!"&lt;ref name="Remnick 104"/&gt;

After nine months in jail, the young scientist was unlawfully exiled without trial and spent five years in the USSR's [[Solovki prison camp|first concentration camp]], located on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the White Sea.

Deported to the [[Solovki Special Purpose Camp]], he spent 5 years studying  "criminal folklore" (as he termed it). Dmitry Likhachov wrote his first scientific article, "Card Games of Criminals", in the camp. He didn't play cards himself, but was a keen observer. He also gathered much material about the language of thieves and later published articles and a book about thieves' slang and customs.

At the camp, hard work, poor living conditions and illness dramatically damaged Likhachov's health, but he survived. On the Solovetsky Islands he met both exiled Russian intellectuals and real criminals, who happened to save his life. As Dmitry Likhachov said many years later, "At the Solovki, I understood that every person is a person."

Whilst on the islands, for some period of time Dmitry Likhachov worked as a member of the Criminological Cabinet, organizing a labor colony for teenagers and saving them from death caused by hunger, drugs, and cold.

On the night of 28 October 1929, he was summoned from a visit with his parents and ordered to join a party of 300 prisoners destined for execution. Wishing to spare his parents the trauma, Likhachyov told them that he had been summoned for night work and that they should not wait for him. He then hid behind a wood pile and listened as the three hundred prisoners were shot and thrown into a [[mass grave]]. The next morning, Likhachyov returned from his hiding place as a completely different man. In a 1987 interview with David Remnick, Likhachyov recalled the events of that night and concluded, "The executioner is older than me, and he is still alive."&lt;ref&gt;Remnick (1994), pages 104-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931, Likhachov was a worker on the construction of the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal|Stalin White Sea–Baltic Canal]] until his release.

Likhachyov returned to Leningrad and started his spectacular scholarly career in the [[Pushkin House]] (as the Russian Literature Institute is known), which spanned more than 60 years and saw the publication of more than 500 scholarly works. Likhachov didn't stop his work even during the [[Siege of Leningrad]]. He believed that Russia was an integral and indivisible part of European civilization, contrary to "Euroasiatic" views of Russia popular with [[Lev Gumilev]], [[Boris Rybakov]], and many other contemporaries.

Likhachov worked for five years as a proofreader in the publishing house of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]]. In 1936, thanks to petitions by the president of the Academy of Sciences, [[Alexander Karpinsky|Aleksandr Karpinsky]], Dmitry Likhachyov's criminal record was cleared. In 1938 the talented scientist was noticed{{by whom|date=September 2015}} and invited to the Department of Old Russian Literature of the [[Institute of Russian Literature]] (known as the Pushkin House). Dmitry Likhachyov worked here until the end of his life.

[[Old Russian literature]], which at that time did not receive much academic attention, became the main scientific interest of Dmitry Likhachyov who, by the beginning of the 1940s, was one of the most renowned specialists in this sphere. In 1941 Likhachyov presented his thesis "The Novgorod Annalistic Corpus of the 12th Century".

World War II brought new trials. Likhachov, together with his wife and twin daughters, survived the horrors of the [[siege of Leningrad]] (1941-1944). He described his experience in a story, full of harsh details, exposing different types of people and their heroic or appalling behavior when faced with starvation and death. In 1942, completely exhausted by hunger and cold, Dmitry Likhachyov started to gather materials on medieval poetry and soon published the book ''Defense of the Old Russian Cities''. In 1943 Likhachyov and his entire family were exiled to Kazan, supposedly because of the "connection with the Solovetsky Camp". But by the end of the war they had returned to Leningrad.

In 1947 Dmitry Likhachov received his Doctorate in Philology, having presented his thesis "Essays on the History of Annalistic Literary Forms of the 11th–16th Centuries". Three years later he became a professor at the Leningrad State University. From 1953 he was a corresponding member - and from 1970 a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Dmitry Likhachyov's conquest of the scientific world was definitely a triumphant one.

1950 marked the publication of Likhachov’s two-volume edition containing unique, important literary works translated into the modern Russian language: ''The [[Primary Chronicle]]'', a history of Kievan Rus' from the 9th to the 12th centuries, and ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|The Lay of the Host of Igor]]'', an account based on a failed raid by Prince [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] of [[Principality of Novgorod-Seversk|Novgorod-Seversk]] against the [[Cumans]] in 1185.

Dmitry Likhachov was not a scientist detached from everyday life. From the 1950s he began a campaign to save the wooden temples of the Russian North and to preserve the historical appearance of Russian cities. He helped found the [[Dostoevsky Museum|museums of Dostoevsky]], Pushkin and Pasternak.

In 1953 Likhachov was admitted into the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] as a [[corresponding member]]. He defended [[Andrei Sakharov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and other dissidents during their persecution by Soviet authorities.

In the 1960s Likhachyov was one of the initiators of the movement for the protection of historical monuments, libraries and archives. Thanks to Likhachyov many monuments were saved, including [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]'s flat in Moscow, the [[Nevsky Prospect]] in Leningrad (which was supposed to be turned into a shopping street) and [[Alexander Garden (disambiguation)|Aleksandr's Garden]]. In the 1980s he headed the Soviet (later renamed Russian) Cultural Fund, supporting the process of the Orthodox Church's reclaiming of its temples, formerly appropriated by the Soviet government. The scientist also participated in the preservation of [[national minority|national minorities]] in danger of dying out while aiding the return to Russia of émigré public and cultural figures.

In 1980 Likhachov was one of the members of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] who refused to sign a letter requesting the expulsion the famous scientist [[Andrei Sakharov]] from the Academy because of Sakharov's public disapproval of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|dispatch of Soviet troops to Afghanistan]] in 1979.

Despite his busy social life, Likhachov still spent a lot of time on scientific work. Focusing on Old Russian literature, he developed the concept of [[artistic time]] and space. In 1969 the researcher was awarded with the [[USSR State Prize]] for his work "Poetics of Old Russian Literature".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Dmitry Likhachov gained worldwide recognition as a theorist of culture and as a publicist. In the 1980s he developed a concept that considered the problems of humanization and the reorientation of educational goals and ideas. The scientist viewed culture as a historical memory, as a process of accumulation, rather than consecutive changes. This was also the theoretical basis for Likhachov’s attention to ancient monuments, especially in architecture. Inspired by the works of [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], Dmitry Likhachov suggested the idea of a “homosphere”- a human sphere of the Earth. His original contribution to general science was also the development of a new discipline called the [[ecology of culture]], which was defined as an essential sphere of human life.

One of the ideas of Likhachov's concept was the correlation between culture and nature. In his book ''Poetics of the Gardens'' (1982), park and garden art was for the first time considered as a [[semiotic]] reflection of major cultural and artistic styles and their corresponding ideologies.

In Moscow and St. Petersburg, in 1986 he created the International Association of intellectuals and creative "Myr Culture", with the writer Nicolaj Sanvelian,  the Italian economist and writer Giancarlo Pallavicini
and other leading writers, artists and scientists, he was inspiring and President for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Various editions of the World of Culture Association have been published, and "Forum of the artistic intelligentsia of Russia, Moscow, Boltscioj Theatre, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 he was elected the first President of the [[Russian Cultural Fund]]. In his 1980s and 1990s, he became more of a public figure, serving as an informal advisor to St. Petersburg Mayor [[Anatoly Sobchak]] and Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]]. In October 1993 he signed the [[Letter of Forty-Two]].&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Писатели требуют от правительства решительных действий |url=http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |accessdate=21 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Izvestia]] |date=5 October 1993 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716043414/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he became the first person to be named an Honorary Citizen of St Petersburg. He also presided over the commission set up to prepare for [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s bicentenary.

Likhachov thought about his [[life journey]] as a vertical movement, towards the heavenly home. The reflections of his experience as a person are written in the book “Reminiscences” (1995).

During the first visit to Rome Gorbachev, Myr Culture has officially handed over, on behalf of the intellectual-creative in the world, a cultural program, called "Manifesto of the three" by the signatories founders of the association, the Russian spokesman Zagladin presented the world's press at the Foro Italico, in 1998, as an instance of cultural freedom for Russia and for the world, signed by Dmitry Likhachov, Nicolaj Sanvelian e Giancarlo Pallavicini.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giancarlopallavicini.it/cultura/myr-cultura-in-italia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last works by Dmitry Likhachov gathered together his general ideas about his native country. The book ''Thoughts About Russia'', completed in 1999, a few days before the author's death, is devoted to Russia'’s place in world history, its myths and its most characteristic features. The edition ''Russian Culture'' was published posthumously in 2000.

As a great scientist, Likhachov was a foreign member of the Academies of Sciences of Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia and a corresponding member of the Austrian, American, British, Italian and Göttingen Academies. In 1984 the minor planet 2877 was named after Likhachyov.

A year before his death, Likhachov became the very first recipient of the reinstated [[Order of St. Andrew]].

Dmitry Likhachov died on 30 September 1999.

In 2001 Likhachyov's daughter and [[George Soros]] established the [http://lfond.spb.ru/ Likhachov Philanthropic Fund].

== Family ==
Likhachov married Zinaida Makarova, who devoted her entire life to her husband. They had twin daughters, Vera and Lyudmila.

==Legacy==
A [[minor planet]] [[2877 Likhachev]] discovered in 1969 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Lyudmila Chernykh]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher = Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2877+Likhachev+TR2 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3

'''Eugene Halliday''' (1911–1987) was a British [[artist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenehalliday.net/|title=Eugene Halliday - Artist - Eugene Halliday|work=Eugene Halliday|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[writer]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugenehallidayarchive.info/text_ish.htm,&lt;/ref&gt; and teacher. For a large part of his life he lived and taught in [[Manchester]] and [[Altrincham]], [[England]], lecturing (in Manchester and Liverpool), running groups and giving personal tuition to a large number of interested people.  He was a gifted artist, a writer of books, plays and poetry as well as possessing a profound understanding of [[philosophy]], [[religion]] and the [[science]] of his day.  Much of his work centred on his interpretation of the esoteric ideas behind religion. He practised and taught an approach to [[psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugenehallidayarchive.info/Text_ish/techniques_of_psychic_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend of the artist [[Käthe Schuftan]], giving the tribute at her funeral in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;The Halliday Review Vol 2, Issue 2, Page 21 (22 of pdf) http://www.eugenehalliday.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Halliday-Review-Winter-2012-2013-Vol-2-Issue-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
Halliday gave the term "absolute sentient power" to what we would call God and said that sentience and thus [[consciousness]] was an inherent quality of this power and by extension of all substances and created beings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugenehallidayarchive.info/Text_ish/structure_of_the_psyche.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Beings, including ourselves are modalities of this power which we feel as a field of energy, from which and through which we are informed about ourselves and the world.  The goal and purpose of life is to grow towards an awareness of our true nature which is not different from this field and the absolute sentient power itself.  This consciousness he called "[[reflexive self-consciousness]]" (''resec'' for short). The force which calls and drives beings to work towards ''resec'' is Love – which he defined as "a will to work for the development of the potentialities of all beings."&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, Eugene: ''Contributions From a Potential Corpse'' Book 1, Melchisedec Press 1990, {{ISBN|1-872240-03-8}}, page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melchisedecpress.net/?page_id=31&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his own understanding and wisdom he valued individuality and encouraged others to discover their own valid way to reveal reflexivity to themselves. His extraordinary breadth of knowledge allowed him to interpret ideas from a variety of sources and made him a true renaissance man.

==International Hermeneutic Society (IHS)==
The IHS was founded by Eugene Halliday and Khen Ratcliffe. It is a study and meditation centre (in Tan y Garth Hall) dedicated to the teachings of Eugene Halliday. Under the guidance of its tutors, Tan y Garth Hall offers the opportunity for students and teachers from all denominations and walks of life to come together and study the hermeneutic techniques and principles of Yoga both East and West. Eugene Halliday's books and talks are available from the IHS at Tan y Garth Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermeneutic.co.uk/Ihs_about.html  International Hermeneutic Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

===What Is Hermeneutics?===
Hermeneutics is the art of interpretation; the theory of the discovery and communication of the concepts and teachings of the scriptures of the world;  the science of attaining clarity, by comprehending, explaining and establishing the sense of both traditional and biblical authors. It looks to the individual's own apprehension rather than the conveyance of the meaning ascertained to others, thereby enabling individuals to interpret for themselves in the light of their own experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hermeneutics?s=t|title=Hermeneutics - Define Hermeneutics at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Institute for the Study of Hierological Values (ISHVAL)==
Eugene Halliday's work was wide ranging in scope, and he brought together into a coherent whole concepts from [[hierology]] (sacred texts), [[art]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[science]]. From his insight into human thought and motivation, he stated that no school of thought has access to the only truth about reality, that no one religion possesses the only true path to the divine. "Each great philosopher has been a doorway for a part of Truth".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.melchisedecpress.net/?page_id=31 (Reflexive Self-Consciousness, p 4)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 Eugene Halliday founded the Charity ISHVAL, together with the Liverpool businessman and philanthropist [[Fred Freeman]] and his wife Yvonne, and the actors [[David Mahlowe]] and Zero Mahlowe. ISHVAL, the Institute for the Study of Hierological Values, had as its aims and objectives:
a) The promotion and propagation of the principles of [[Truth]] in all Religions in order to achieve unity in interpretations of Sacred Writings between all denominations and mutual understanding and practice of the principles of Truth in a true spirit of [[ecumenism]].
b) The instruction and education of all persons desirous of learning in the study of hierological values in relation to religion and philosophy for the better appreciation and enjoyment of art and science and the purpose of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenehalliday.net/?page_id=210|title=Ishval - Eugene Halliday Society - Eugene Halliday|work=Eugene Halliday|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What Is Hierology?===
Hierology is from the Greek hieros, priest, and logy, meaning "a speaking, discourse, treatise, doctrine, theory, science,". It is defined as sacred literature, learning or a body of knowledge regarding sacred things, the literary or traditional embodiment of the religious beliefs of a people. For example, the sacred texts of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hierology?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hierology&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenism and the principles of truth in all religions===
Halliday's [[ecumenism]] was of the most universal variety. While at the core of his teaching was the concept of the primacy of [[Jesus Christ]], it came from an inner understanding of the nature of Love, and transcended the bounds of any religious orthodoxy. He had an integrated view of the development of world religions. "India's religion ([[Hinduism]]) is non-historical, concerns itself with the [[Eternal return|Eternal Recurrence]], the Great Cycle, Days and Nights of Brahma that endlessly follow each other: [[Yoga]] is aimed to break the cycle by releasing the individual from [[Manvantara]] into eternal [[Nirvana]]." In Judaism, a select group of people were separated from the mass of animal-men and subjected to pressures which led to the attainment of group consciousness; their commandments were negative "Thou shalt not". [[Jesus Christ]] "presents the first true individuated person able to stand against the elect group". The commandments of Christianity were positive, "Thou shalt love". Having taught his disciples, he left them "so that they too may find themselves and become authors of their own being". "In Islam is no barrier of race or colour or class. The goal was not the individual as such, but the individual-able-to-relate-to-all-beings without self-loss or regression". "The one Eternal Religion which [[Hindu]] thought intuited appears in its historical aspect in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, as Law (Father), Love (Son) and Illuminative Knowledge (Holy Ghost). The Fourth Revelation ([[Maitreya]]) will but put these three together as of equal validity in the cosmic plan."&lt;ref&gt;(The Halliday Review, Spring 2006, 'Religion – Eternity and Time') http://www.eugenehalliday.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Halliday-Review-Spring-2006-Vol-1-No-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eugene Halliday Association==
ISHVAL closed as a charity in 2015, its work being continuous with the newly formed, more simply administered, not-for-profit organisation, Eugene Halliday Association. Its members recognise that Eugene Halliday worked to enable the development of potential of himself and all those who are willing to work with him. He left a legacy of written, artistic and spoken work setting out his principles of self-development, the way to [[reflexive self-consciousness]] and an understanding of how to live in the world. Its aims and objectives are:
1) To educate ourselves through studying and engaging with the work of Eugene Halliday, artist and writer, and the principles he taught. 2) To establish and communicate a wider awareness of the legacy of Eugene Halliday and to encourage and support others who are interested to study and engage with his work. 3) To investigate areas of study to which Eugene Halliday introduced us, and other appropriate areas which may be worthy of  investigation. These include art, religion, philosophy and science. Its mission is: 'Our purpose is self-development: to centre and balance ourselves through the intelligent co-ordination of clear thought, sensitive feeling and action of good will; to work to develop our creative potential and that of our fellow beings.'

==Central concepts in the work of Eugene Halliday==

===Reflexive Self-Consciousness===

[[Reflexive self-consciousness]] is perhaps the most important and core concept in Eugene Halliday's work. In his book, "Reflexive Self-Consciousness", published in the 1950s, he sets out a way by which we can develop the ability to respond adequately to the demands life makes of us, the ability to assimilate the shocks and blows of experience, so we can live a whole and balanced life. The way to this balance is through an understanding of the centre of our own being, our consciousness, and through this, finding our place in relation to the universe.

===Advaita, or non-dualism===

Halliday's philosophy is non-dualist, as in the [[Hindu]] concept of [[advaita]], expounded by [[Adi Shankara]] and other advaitin philosophers. [[Advaita]] is sometimes described as a monistic philosophy, but Halliday is careful to distinguish it both from monism and pluralism, as a description of the nature of the universe, and our relationship to 'God' or 'absolute sentient power' (see above) (A.S.P.). "Infinity is not comprehensible in a monistic concept, for monism implies circumscription, which is encapsulation or finitisation [making finite]. Non-dualism and Non-pluralism refer to the Infinity of the Absolute Sentient Power (A.S.P.), the infinite modalising activities of which generate all [[noumena]] and [[phenomena]]. Monism is an attempt to grasp in a knowable concept that which is of itself unknowable, for to know is to finite form within the A.S.P."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugenehallidayarchive.info/Text_ish/v4-contributions_from_a_potential_corpse-b2.pdf  (Contributions from a Potential Corpse, Book II, p 101&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Adi Shankara]]'s [[Advaita Vedanta]], [[Brahman]] (God, or the Supreme Cosmic Spirit) is the only reality; [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is the illusionary power of [[Brahman]] "which causes the Brahman to be seen as the illusory world"; the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] ([[soul]] or self) is not different from Brahman (see Wikipedia article [[Advaita Vedanta]]).

Halliday's concept of 'A.S.P.' is related to the Hindu concept of [[Brahman]], and to the Greek philosopher [[Anaximander]]'s ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'', the 'limitless or boundless' source of the world. "The Absolute is an infinite sentient power, an eternal continuum of motion. Because it is sentient it feels its own motion. Its motion is the content of its sentiency. It is from this fact that is derived the principle that says that a being knows only the modifications of its own substance; or consciousness is aware only of its own modalities".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugenehallidayarchive.info/Text_ish/v2-reflexive_self-consciousness.pdf  (Reflexive Self-Consciousness, p 10&lt;/ref&gt; Individual beings are rotatory motions, or modalities, within the A.S.P., and are not-different from It. And not only individual beings but all phenomena: "Ultimately we have to say that all things we know, all the ideas we think, and all the feeling states we experience, the totality of phenomena of all worlds, are merely modalities of the motion initiated and sustained by the Infinite Sentient Power we call God".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugenehallidayarchive.info/Text_ish/v4-contributions_from_a_potential_corpse-b1.pdf (Halliday, Eugene: ''Contributions From a Potential Corpse'' Book 1, Melchisedec Press 1990, {{ISBN|1-872240-03-8}}, p 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related Concepts==

===Panentheism===

Although he does not seem to have employed the term, Halliday's religious philosophy can be described as one of [[Panentheism]] (pan-en-theism, all-within-god),{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} the view that the universe is within God and that God also transcends the universe. The term was coined by German idealist philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832). Halliday did not hold with the view of pantheism, which sees the universe as identical with God.&lt;ref&gt;"The Supreme Coherence of a Little Known Sage", MA Dissertation, Carol Parkes, Exeter University, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; He was well-versed both in comparative religion and the science of his day, and wrote extensively on the relation between the different religions, and between science and religion. He often quoted Einstein's famous equation and explained "We all know today, as a matter of fact, not fantasy, that matter can be broken down and demonstrated to be energy".&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of "Corks", a lecture by Eugene Halliday, Track 2, http://www.eugene-halliday.net/html/EH_Corks_81_ml/EH_Corks_81_ml.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of the authors he recommended was [[Alfred North Whitehead]], mathematician and philosopher of science, who had noted that the dominant model for the natural world had moved from mechanism to organism during the 19th century. In panentheism is found a concept of God in which natural laws and processes are respected.&lt;ref&gt;"Some connections with science", http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Panentheism.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''evo-devo gene toolkit''' is the small subset of [[gene]]s in an organism's [[genome]] whose products control the organism's [[developmental biology|embryonic development]]. '''Toolkit genes''' are central to the synthesis of [[molecular genetics]], [[palaeontology]], [[evolution]] and developmental biology in the science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

==Toolkit==

Toolkit genes are highly [[conserved sequence|conserved]] among [[Phylum|phyla]], meaning that they are ancient, dating back to the [[Urbilaterian|last common ancestor of bilaterian animals]]. For example, that ancestor had at least 7 [[Pax genes]] for [[transcription factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedrich|first1=Markus|title=Evo-Devo gene toolkit update: at least seven Pax transcription factor subfamilies in the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals Authors|journal=Evolution &amp; Development|date=2015|volume=17|issue=5|pages=255–257|doi=10.1111/ede.12137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts.  The majority of toolkit genes are components of signaling pathways, and encode for the production of transcription factors, [[cell adhesion]] proteins, cell surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins (and signalling [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind to them), and secreted [[morphogens]], all of these participate in defining the fate of undifferentiated cells, generating spatial and temporal patterns, which in turn form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Among the most important of the toolkit genes are those of the [[Hox gene]] cluster, or complex. Hox genes, transcription factors containing the more broadly distributed [[homeobox]] protein-binding DNA motif, function in patterning the body axis. Thus, by combinatorial specifying the identity of particular body regions, Hox genes determine where [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and other [[Anatomy|body]] segments will grow in a developing [[embryo]] or [[larva]]. A [[wikt:paradigm|paradigm]]atic toolkit gene is ''Pax6/eyeless'', which controls [[eye]] formation in all animals. It has been found to produce eyes in mice and ''[[Drosophila]]'', even if mouse ''Pax6/eyeless'' was expressed in ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xu, P.X. |author2=Woo, I. |author3=Her, H. |author4=Beier, D.R. |author5=Maas, R.L. |year=1997 |title=Mouse Eya homologues of the Drosophila eyes absent gene require Pax6 for expression in lens and nasal placode |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=1 |pmid=9006082 |pages=219–231 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that a big part of the morphological evolution undergone by organisms is a product of variation in the genetic toolkit, either by the genes changing their expression pattern or acquiring new functions. A good example of the first is the enlargement of the beak in Darwin's large ground-finch ([[large ground-finch|''Geospiza magnirostris'']]), in which the gene ''[[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]]'' is responsible for the larger beak of this bird, relative to the other finches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abzhanov, A. |author2=Protas, M. |author3=Grant, B.R. |author4=Grant, P.R. |author5=Tabin, C.J. |year=2004 |title=Bmp4 and Morphological Variation of Beaks in Darwin's Finches |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5689| doi=10.1126/science.1098095 |pages=1462–1465 |pmid=15353802 |bibcode=2004Sci...305.1462A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of legs in [[snake]]s and other [[Squamata|squamates]] is another good example of genes changing their expression pattern. In this case the gene ''[[Dlx (gene)|Distal-less]]'' is very under-expressed, or not expressed at all, in the regions where limbs would form in other [[tetrapod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohn, M.J. |author2=Tickle, C. |title=Developmental basis of limblessness and axial patterning in snakes |year=1999 |journal=Nature |volume=399 |pages=474–479 |pmid=10365960 |issue=6735 |doi=10.1038/20944 |bibcode=1999Natur.399..474C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994, [[Sean B. Carroll]]'s team made the "groundbreaking" discovery that this same gene determines the [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot pattern]] in [[butterfly]] [[wing]]s, showing that toolbox genes can change their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beldade, P. |author2=Brakefield, P.M. |author3=Long, A.D. |year=2002 |title=Contribution of Distal-less to quantitative variation in butterfly eyespots |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6869 |pages=315–318 |pmid=11797007 |doi=10.1038/415315a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Thomas|title=Leopard Spots and Zebra Stripes on Fruit Fly Wings|journal=Nature Education|date=2015|volume=8|issue=2|page=3|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-131087142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean B. et al|title=Pattern formation and eyespot determination in butterfly wings|journal=Science|date=1994|volume=265|pages=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toolkit genes, as well as being highly conserved, also tend to evolve the same function [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or [[Parallel Evolution|in parallel]]. Classic examples of this are the already mentioned ''Distal-less'' gene, which is responsible for appendage formation in both tetrapods and insects, or, at a finer scale, the generation of wing patterns in the butterflies ''[[Heliconius erato]]'' and ''[[Heliconius melpomene]]''. These butterflies&lt;!--just mentioned butterfly eyespots above, the same species??

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12525">In [[logic]], a '''finite-valued logic''' (also '''finitely many-valued logic''') is a [[propositional calculus]] in which [[truth values]] are [[continuous or discrete variable|discrete]]. Traditionally, in [[Aristotle's logic]], the [[principle of bivalence|bivalent logic]], also known as binary logic was the norm, as the [[law of the excluded middle]] precluded more than two possible values (i.e., "true" and "false") for any [[proposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Weisstein| first=Eric| title=Law of the Excluded Middle| publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource| year=2018| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LawoftheExcludedMiddle.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[three-valued logic]] (ternary logic) allows for an additional possible truth value (i.e. "undecided").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Weisstein| first=Eric| title=Three-Valued Logic| publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource| year=2018| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Three-ValuedLogic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''finitely many-valued logic''' is typically used to describe [[many-valued logic]] having three or more, but not infinite, truth values. The term '''finite-valued logic''' encompasses both finitely many-valued logic and bivalent logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kretzmann| first=Norman| title=William of Sherwood's Treatise on Syncategorematic Words| chapter=IV, section 2.

A finite-valued logic is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]] (sure to determine outcomes of the logic when it is applied to [[proposition]]s) if and only if it has a [[computational semantics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work= Journal of Philosophical Logic| volume=18| number=3| pages=257-274| year=1989| last=Stachniak| first=Zbigniew| title=Many-valued computational logics| url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/37812/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Aristotle]]'s collected works regarding logic, known as the ''[[Organon]]'', describe bivalent logic primarily, though Aristotle's views may have allowed for propositions that are not actually true or false. The ''Organon'' influenced philosophers and mathematicians throughout the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Folse| first=Henry| title=The Aristotelian Theory of Knowledge| publisher=Department of Philosophy, College of Arts and Sciences, Loyola University| url=http://people.loyno.edu/~folse/arisepis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| work=Topics in Philosophical Logic| last=Rescher| first=Nicholas| publisher=Humanities Press Synthese Library volume 17| year=1968| title=Many-Valued Logic| url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-3546-9_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Boole]] developed an [[algebraic structure]] and an [[algorithm]]ic [[probability theory]] based on bivalent logic in the [[19th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| work=Lessons in Electric Circuits| volume=4| chapter=7| last=Kuphaldt| first=Tony| title=Introduction to Boolean Algebra| url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/digital/chpt-7/introduction-boolean-algebra/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Łukasiewicz]] developed a system of three-valued logic in 1920. [[Emil Leon Post]] introduced further truth degrees in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Many-Valued Logic| last=Gottwald| first=Siegfried| title=5. History of Many-Valued Logic| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| year=2015| url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-manyvalued/#HisManValLog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Cole Kleene]] and U. Blau expanded the three-valued logic system of Łukasiewicz, for [[computer]] applications and for [[natural language]] analyses, repectively. Nuel Belnap and J. Michael Dunn developed a four-valued logic for computer applications in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Many-Valued Logic| last=Gottwald| first=Siegfried| title=3. Systems of Many-Valued Logic| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| year=2015| url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-manyvalued/#SysManValLog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1970s, various procedures for providing arbitrary finite-valued logics have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| work=Logic, Language, Information and Computation, 16th International Workshop, WoLLIC 2009, Tokyo, Japan, June 21-24, 2009. Proceedings| last1=Caleiro| first1=Carlos| last2=Marcos| first2=João| section=Background| pages=268-280| publisher=Springer| year=2009| title=Classic-Like Analytic Tableaux for Finite-Valued Logics| url=http://sqig.math.ist.utl.pt/pub/MarcosJ/09-CM-ClATab4FVL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

In [[linguistics]], finite-valued logic is used to treat [[presuppositions]] as [[computational linguistics|product systems]] with ordered pairs of truth degrees, or [[truth tables]]. This enables assumptions built into verbal or written statements to be associated with varying degrees of truth values in the course of [[natural-language processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Dubois| first=Didier| title=Uncertainty Theories, Degrees of Truth and Epistemic States| publisher=International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence| year=2011| url=http://www.icaart.org/Documents/Previous_Invited_Speakers/2011/ICAART2011_Dubois.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[formal language]]s, finite-valued logic has shown that encapsulating a [[truth predicate]] in a language can render the language [[consistency|inconsistent]]. [[Saul Kripke]] has built on work pioneered by [[Alfred Tarski]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| publisher=Princeton University Press| last=Rucker| first=Rudy| title= Infinity and the Mind| url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/infinityandthemind/#calibre_link-655}}, section 655 "What is Truth?"&lt;/ref&gt; to demonstrate that such a truth predicate can be modeled using three-valued logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=The Journal of Philosophy| volume=72| number=19| pages=690-716| year=1975| last=Kripke| first=Saul| title=Outline of a Theory of Truth| publisher=Polish Institute of Mathematics| url=https://www.impan.pl/~kz/truthseminar/Kripke_Outline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical questions, including the [[Sorites paradox]], have been considered based on a finite-valued logic known as fuzzy plurivaluationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=| last=Behounek| first=Libor| title=In Which Sense Is Fuzzy Logic a Logic for Vagueness?| publisher=CEUR Workshop Proceedings| year=2011| url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1205/00010026.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorites paradox suggests that if adding a grain of sand to something that is not a heap cannot create a heap, then a heap of sand cannot be created. A logical model of a heap in which there are as many truth degrees as grains of sand tends to refute that suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Fuzzy Sets and Systems| volume=113| year=2000| pages=7-18| last=Fisher| first=Peter| title=Sorites Paradox and Vague Geographies| url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.409.905&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electronic circuit design|electronics design]], a logical model of the [[steady state (electronics)|stable states]] of a circuit, in which there are as many truth degrees as there are states, serves as a model for finite-valued switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Krupinski| first=Joseph| title=Logic Design for Tristable Devices| publisher=Defense Technical Information Center| year=1962| url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/295097.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-valued operators can be realized in [[CMOS|integrated circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=MVL '76 Proceedings of the sixth international symposium on Multiple-valued logic| pages=123-126| last=Mouftah| first=H.T.| title=A study on the implementation of three-valued logic| year=1976| url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=803598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[fuzzy logic]], typically applied for [[t-norm fuzzy logics|approximate reasoning]], a finitely-valued logic can represent propositions that may acquire values within a finite [[set theory|set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Fuzzy Sets and Systems| volume=157| year=2006| page=608| last1=Behounek| first1=Libor| last2=Cintula| first2=Pitr| title=Fuzzy logics as the logics of chains| url=http://neuron.csie.ntust.edu.tw/homework/94/fuzzy/homework/homework1/M9412004/Fuzzy%20logics%20as%20the%20logics%20of%20chains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], logical [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] having multiple truth degrees are used to model systems of [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Many-Valued Logic| last=Gottwald| first=Siegfried| title=4. Applications of Many-Valued Logic| publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| year=2015| url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-manyvalued/#AppManValLog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biophysics|Biophysical]] indications suggest that in the [[brain]], [[synapse|synaptic]] charge injections occur in finite steps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and Multi-Scale Communications| volume=2| issue=2| year=2016| last1=Levy| first1=William| last2=Berger| first2=Toby| last3=Sungka| first3=Mustafa| pages=154-165| title=Neural computation from first principles: Using the maximum entropy method to obtain an optimal bits-per-joule neuron| url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1606/1606.03063.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[neuron]] arrangements can be modeled based on the [[probability distribution]] of a finitely valued [[random variable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| work=Biostatistics| volume=11| issue=4| year=2010| pages=631–643| last1=Choudhury| first1=Kingshuk| last2=Deacon| first2=Pearl| last3=Barrett| first3=Rob| last4=McDermott| first4=Kieran| title=Hypothesis testing for neural cell growth experiments using a hybrid branching process model| url=https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/11/4/631/372720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of [[logic]] itself, finite-valued logic has served as an aid to understand the nature and existence of [[infinite-valued logic]]. [[Kurt Gödel]] attempted to comprehend the human ability for [[logical intuition]] in terms of finite-valued logic before concluding that the ability is based on infinite-valued logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Burgess| first=John| title=Intuitions of Three Kinds in Gödel's Views on the Continuum| url=https://www.princeton.edu/~jburgess/Goedel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilbert Simondon''' ({{IPA-fr|simɔ̃dɔ̃|lang}}; 2 October 1924 &amp;ndash; 7 February 1989) was a French [[philosopher]] best known for his theory of [[individuation]], a major source of inspiration for [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Bernard Stiegler]].

== Career ==
Born in [[Saint-Étienne]], Simondon was a student of philosopher of science [[Georges Canguilhem]], philosopher [[Martial Guéroult]], and phenomenologist [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. He studied at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] and the [[Sorbonne]]. He defended his doctoral dissertations in 1958 at the [[University of Paris]]. His main thesis, ''L'individuation à la lumière des notions de Forme et d'Information'' (''Individuation in the light of the notions of Form and Information''), was published in two parts, the first in 1964 under the title ''L'individu et sa génèse physico-biologique'' (''Individuation and its physical-biological genesis'') at the Presses Universitaires de France, while it is only in 1989 that Aubier published the second part, ''L'individuation psychique et collective'' (''Psychic and collective individuation''). While his main thesis, which laid the foundations of his thinking, was not widely read until it was commented upon by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and, more recently, [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Bernard Stiegler]], his complementary thesis, ''Du mode d'existence des objets techniques'' (''On the mode of existence of technical objects'') was published by Aubier immediately after being completed (in 1958) and had an instant impact on a wide audience. It was only in 2005 that Jérôme Millon published a complete edition of the main thesis.

== Individuation and technology ==
In ''L'individuation psychique et collective'', Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective [[individuation]], in which the individual [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is considered as an effect of individuation, rather than as a cause. Thus the individual atom is replaced by the neverending process of individuation. Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" as the funds making individuation itself possible. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left-over, itself making possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual and a collective subject, which individuate themselves together. Simondon criticized [[Norbert Wiener]]'s theory of [[cybernetics]], arguing that "Right from the start, Cybernetics has accepted what all theory of technology must refuse: a classification of technological objects conducted by means of established criteria and following genera and species." Simondon aimed to overcome the shortcomings of cybernetics by developing a "general [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]" of machines.

== Influence ==
Simondon's theory of [[individuation]] through [[Transduction (psychology)|transduction]] in a [[metastable]] environment was an important influence on the thought of [[Gilles Deleuze]], whose ''[[Difference and Repetition|Différence et répétition]]'' (1968), ''[[The Logic of Sense|Logique du sens
]]'' (1969) and ''L'île déserte'' (2002) make explicit reference to Simondon's work. ''Gilbert Simondon: une pensée de l'individuation et de la technique'' (1994), the proceedings of the first conference devoted to Simondon's work, further charts his influence on such thinkers as [[François Laruelle]], [[Gilles Châtelet]], [[Anne Fagot-Largeau]], [[Yves Deforge]], [[René Thom]], and [[Bernard Stiegler]] (the latter having placed Simondon's theory of individuation at the very heart of his ongoing and multi-volume philosophical project). Another contributor to ''Gilbert Simondon: une pensée de l'individuation et de la technique'', Simondon's friend [[John Hart (computer scientist)|John Hart]], was the instigator of the very first translation—from French into English c.1980—of Simondon's work (this at University of Western Ontario in Canada where Hart had founded both a Department of Computer Science and a Simondon-inspired network: the ATN, or [[Audio Tactile Network]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hayward and Ghislain Thibault, 'Machinic Milieus: Simondon, John Hart and Mechanology',From Disability History Newsletter, Fall 2013&lt;/ref&gt;). Currently, Simondon can be seen as a major influence on the work of such scholars as [[Paolo Virno]], [[Jean-Hugues Barthélémy]], [[Thierry Bardini]], [[Luciana Parisi]], [[Brian Massumi]], [[Adrian Mackenzie]], [[Muriel Combes]], [[Carl Mitcham]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Isabelle Stengers]], [[Thomas LaMarre]], [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Anne Sauvagnargues]].

'''Harald Lesch''' (born 28 July 1960 in [[Gießen]], [[Hessen]]) is a [[Germany|German]] physicist, astronomer, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], author, television presenter, professor of physics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] (LMU) and professor of natural philosophy at the [[Munich University of Philosophy]]. In the German speaking world, Lesch plays a similar role to that of [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]],{{cn|date=July 2017}} as a bridge between the scientific community and the public.

==Education==

After completing secondary school in 1978 at the Theo-Koch-Schule in [[Grünberg, Hesse]], Lesch studied physics at the [[University of Giessen]], then at the [[University of Bonn]], where he completed his doctoral degree in 1987 and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy.  From 1988 to 1991 he was a research assistant at the state observatory at [[Heidelberg]]-Königstuhl.  In 1992 he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Toronto]].  In 1994 he was [[Habilitation|habilitated]] at the [[University of Bonn]].

==Work==
[[File:Harald Lesch Hannover 1.jpg|thumb|Lesch during a public lecture in 2010]]
Since 1995 Lesch has been a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the LMU Munich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de./people/lesch/lesch.html|title=Prof. Dr. Harald Lesch|publisher=LMU|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he teaches [[natural philosophy]] at the University for Philosophy in Munich.  His main areas of research are cosmic [[plasma physics]], [[black hole]]s, and [[neutron star]]s.  He is the expert on astrophysics in the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (DFG) (German Research Society) and a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft (Astronomical Society). He is also a textbook author.

Lesch has made television appearances for the longstanding, self-presented production of the channel [[BR-alpha]]: alpha-Centauri, Lesch &amp; Co., Denker des Abendlandes (Thinkers of the Western World), and Alpha bis Omega (From Alpha to Omega). He also presented shorter television series.  His presentations attempt to make complex physical or philosophical issues more accessible to the public. In 2005 he was awarded the Communicator Prize by the DFG and the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Foundation for German Scholarship) for his television appearances and publications. To honor his work on making scientific findings understandable to the broad public, the Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Emden (nature research society) awarded him an honorary membership on March 15, 2011.

==Television appearances==
For many years, Lesch has presented a number of television series for the channel BR-alpha, beginning with alpha-Centauri, in which he is to be seen since 1998. In "Lesch &amp; Co." and "Denker des Abendlandes" (thinkers of the occident), he converses with the philosophy professor [[Wilhelm Vossenkuhl]] about philosophical topics. Alpha bis Omega deals with contradiction and consistency of religion and natural science, through conversations between Lesch and the Catholic theologist Thomas Schwartz.

In celebration of the Year of Einstein 2005, BR-alpha aired the 8-part series The Physics of [[Albert Einstein]], where in each episode, one single scientific finding of Einstein was introduced by Lesch, who explained its significance. Starting in August 2007, the 16-part program The 4 Elements was aired weekly, which deals with the structure of the world, and in addition to scientific aspects, also handles cultural-historical aspects.

For the Pay-TV channel ''Syfy'' he differentiates scientifically based and fictional components of Star Trek in the series ''Star Trek – Science vs. Fiction''. From April to the end of 2007, Lesch moderated  the weekly 5-minute program sci_xpert for this channel, which dealt with viewer questions, which mostly had to do with feasibility of science fiction concepts (such as "How realistic are the huge spaceships from Independence Day?"), but which also addressed purely scientific topics (for example "What is gravity?"), which were handled in the tradition of alpha-Centauri.  There were a total of 35 episodes.

Since September 2008 Lesch has been presenting the [[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen|ZDF]] scholarly magazine ''Abenteuer Forschung'' (Adventures in Research). His predecessor was Joachim Bublath, who presented the show for many years.

At the start of the "International Year of Astronomy 2009", Lesch moderated in ZDF the 2½ hour special “How Light Was Born: the Long Night with Harald Lesch”, in which he, between short documentary films, led conversations with the cabaret artist and hobby-philosopher [[Christoph Süß]], the physics professor Günther Hasinger, and the theology professor Thomas Schwartz.

Since 2010, Lesch presents the show "Lesch's Kosmos", a 15-minute programme on the German documentary channel ZDFneo that deals with issues from various scientific fields.

'''Isabelle Stengers''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|ŋ|ər|s}}; {{IPA-fr|stɑ̃ɡɛʁs|lang}}; born 1949) is a [[Belgian]] [[philosopher]], noted for her work in the [[philosophy of science]]. 

==Work==
Stengers has written books on [[chaos theory]] with [[Ilya Prigogine]], the Russian-Belgian physical chemist and Nobel Laureate noted for his work on dissipative structures, complex systems, and irreversibility, especially ''Order out of Chaos'' and ''The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos and the New Laws of Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;''Order out of Chaos'', University of Michigan: Bantam Books (1984) and ''The End of Certainty: Time, Chaos and the New Laws of Nature'', Free Press (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Stengers and Prigogine often draw from the work of [[Gilles Deleuze]], treating him as an important philosophical source to think through questions regarding irreversibility and the universe as an open system. Stengers' most recent work has turned to her proposition of Cosmopolitics, a key aspect of which [[Bruno Latour]] refers to as the "progressive composition of a common world" in which the non-human and the human are intimately entwined, and secondly, her revisiting and pragmatic modulation of the speculative philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. ''Cosmopolitics'' won the [[Ludwik Fleck Prize]] in 1993.

==Biography==

== Biography ==

Jiří Vacek was born in 1931 in Slaný (a town near Prague) on Whit Monday, a day belonging to Whitsuntide – a significant feast of the liturgical year (the feast of the Holy Spirit). His childhood was affected by the German occupation of the Czechoslovakia during the World War II, when the whole Czech nation suffered greatly under the Nazi rule.
 
The beginnings of his interest in the spiritual life date back to as early as 1945. The very first spiritual book J. Vacek encountered, which influenced him greatly, was the Burning Bush (subtitled the ''[[Revealed Mystic Path]]'') by [[Karel Weinfurter]]. According to this book, J. Vacek started practising mystic exercises, namely the mantra repetition (IEOUA mantra) and silent concentration on the spiritual heart.

From the very start, he also felt attracted to the personality of [[Ramana Maharshi]], a spiritual teacher and sage from the 19th to 20th century, whose [[atma-vichara]] (the path of [[Self-enquiry]]) J. Vacek practiced from the end of the 1950s. His other spiritual masters, who he was personally in touch with, were Jaroslav Kočí from Ostrava and later [[Míla Tomášová]].

During the communist regime, Jiří Vacek was interrogated by the State Security (communist secret police) owing to his spiritual interests and even sentenced for "disturbing the socialistic way of life". Consequently, he was also sacked from work for a few times. Despite all that, he kept spreading both his original works and translations in the form of so-called [[samizdat]]s .

After the fall of the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia in 1989, J. Vacek began to operate in public and published translations of many spiritual books, especially the works with the teachings of [[Ramana Maharshi]] and also the books dealing with the non-dualistic realization – [[Advaita]]. He even translated several works from Christianity and [[Zen Buddhism]]. Altogether, he has so far published over 100 of his own original works and more than 30 translations from the English language.

Being retired, J. Vacek dedicates his free time to public meditations and meditations with his friends/students.

== Essence of Teaching ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is the Path?
The path lies in turning away from the changing forms to their unchanging nature, which is their source. It lies in the withdrawal of consciousness´ attention from observed objects and its turning to the observer or witness, the consciousness itself, which leads to the realization of our true Nature, the Self, as pure consciousness and destruction of the illusion that we are a being limited by mind and body – ego. This way, it leads to liberation from worldly suffering and the rebirth cycle, countless lives and deaths in it, and to the restoration of the natural and original unlimited bliss of pure being. It removes the illusion of diversity and leads to the realization of the Unity, which is the highest Truth, the Lord, the eternal life and true happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří. ''Jnana Gita''. Translated to English by Martin Tomeš (2013). Published as a part of the collection Handful of Gems. Prague: Krutina Jiří – Vacek. {{ISBN|978-80-87493-53-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The spiritual practice as presented by Jiří Vacek is primarily based on the teaching of [[Ramana Maharshi]].&lt;ref&gt;Godman, David. ''Rozhovory s Ramanou Mahárišim 1.-3. díl'' (Original name: ''Talks with Ramana Maharshi''). Translation from English by Jiří Vacek. Prague: self-published (1998). (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří (1994). ''Život a učení Ramany Mahárišiho (Life and Teaching of Ramana Maharshi)'', Prague: self-published. (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sri Ramanasramam. ''Kdo jsem Já?'' (Original name: ''Who am I?''). Translation from English Jiří Vacek. Prague: self-published (1994). (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; Just as him, Jiří Vacek teaches that the basis of the spiritual life lies in finding our true existence in the self-aware consciousness or, in other words, in the realisation of our [[true Self]]. The easiest way how to realise our true Self is to follow the "footprint" of the [[Observation|observer]], since it is always true that to be able to observe anything, we – consciousness, that observes or is aware of observed objects, must be present here. In the consciousness of the observer, we continuously distinguish ourselves from all the observed/observable objects, which are: our body, the creations of our mind including our feelings, and the surrounding world. Simultaneously and directly, without words or thinking, we try to realise and experience that we are the non-material consciousness, which is aware of these observed objects. This is the most important element of the spiritual practice that we can and should practice permanently, even during all of our common daily activities. By the consciousness of the self-aware observer, we introduce the divine life into our day-to-day life. Then, we do not need to divide our life into the worldly activities and the spiritual ones, although formal meditation is still the basis. We simply try to carry out with all of our activities while being consciously aware of our true Self, our divine nature. This gradually makes all our activities easier since the level of our awareness rises and we can concentrate better and better on condition that we do not forget about our Self – us being different from anything that can be observed. This practice also enables us to work on the second crucial element of the spiritual practice, which is the dissolution of vasanas, tendencies of our mind directed towards our body and our world separated/fallen off from God.&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří (2015). ''Observation and concentration on observer.'' Translation to English by Martin Tomeš. Prague: self-published from the series ''Spiritual Scripts''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří (1995). ''Učebnice átmavičáry (Textbook of Atma-Vichara)''. Prague: self-published. (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří (1994). ''Džňána jóga (Jnana Yoga)''. Prague: self-published. (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; This practice, focused mostly on the static aspect of the Reality, was supplemented by Jiří Vacek with another inseparable element, which is so called inner [[pranayama]]. This meditation concentrates on the divine creative power and perfectly complements static, silent meditations so that both the aspects of the Reality – static and dynamic can be developed simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří (2012). ''Stezka světla (Path of Light)''. Prague: Krutina Jiří – Vacek. {{ISBN|978-80-87493-37-3}}. (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vacek, Jiří (1993). ''Stezka síly – Šakti jóga (Path of the spiritual Power – Shakti Yoga)''. Prague: self-published. (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Jiří Vacek is the author of more than 100 original titles on various topics of [[yoga]] and [[mysticism]] and more than 30 translations from various spiritual paths and directions. Other spiritual authors often quote or draw inspiration from his writings, e.g. Vojtěch Steiner in ''History of Yoga''&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Vojtěch (2011). ''Dějiny jógy (History of Yoga)''. Prague: published by Mladá fronta. {{ISBN|978-80-204-2392-4}}. (Czech)&lt;/ref&gt; or the authors of the Russian edition of ''Talks with Ramana Maharshi''&lt;ref&gt;''БЕСЕДЫ с Шри Раманой Махарши (Talks with Ramana Maharshi)'' (2006). Moscow: published by Ramanasramam in association with Ganga. {{ISBN|5-98882-004-2}}. (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; and many others.

== Public Activities ==

Jiří Vacek teaches the practice of the inner spiritual life in public meditations that have so far taken place in Prague, Brno, Olomouc and Hradec Králové (and before that even all over Slovakia) as well as in week-long meditation retreats that are held in various places in the Czech Republic.

'''Julius Tomin''' (born 2 December 1938) is a Czech philosopher. He became known in the 1970s and 1980s for his involvement with the [[Jan Hus Educational Foundation]], which ran an underground education network in the former [[Czechoslovakia]], offering seminars in philosophy in people's homes.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Barbara. ''The Velvet Philosophers''. The Claridge Press, 1999, p. 18ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Day writes that Tomin studied English and Russian in the 1940s and 50s. He agreed with [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s and [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s views on non-violence, and refused to do military service, for which he served a prison sentence. He then tried to leave the country for Sweden, but was caught and served an additional year. He took a job as a forester when released, and worked as a ward assistant in a psychiatric hospital, where he met his first wife, a therapist, whom he married in 1962.&lt;ref name=Day18&gt;Day, 1999, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was interested in philosophy, and wrote to [[Milan Machovec]] of [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]], [[Prague]], who arranged for him to register for a doctorate. He obtained his PhD and became a junior fellow in the university's philosophy department from 1966 to 1970. In 1969–1970 he held a visiting professorship at the University of Hawaii. Day writes that he was refused an academic position when he returned, after associating himself with the reform Communists. He worked instead as a turbine operator, but according to Day was sacked when he was discovered teaching philosophy to his colleagues. He then worked as a nightwatchman in a zoo.&lt;ref name=Day18/&gt;

He became a signatory to [[Charter 77]] in December 1976, which made him a further target of suspicion, and began holding philosophy seminars in his apartment in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, John. ''Heroes''. South End Press, 2002, p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; After asking for academic support for his seminars in 1978 from universities in England, Germany, and the United States, philosophers from the University of Oxford set up the Jan Hus Educational Foundation to help send books and speakers. Several of the philosophers who attended these home seminars, including [[Jacques Derrida]], were detained by the police and asked to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Nicholas.

Tomin travelled with his family to the UK in August 1980, with the help of [[Kathy Wilkes]], the Oxford philosopher, after receiving permission to study abroad. In May 1981 his Czech passport was removed by the Czech Embassy in London, and he was told he and his wife no longer had Czech citizenship. As of 2011 he remains a British resident.&lt;ref&gt;For the passport and citizenship, see Pilger 2002, p. 472.

[[File:PriestleyUnbeliever.jpg|thumb|right|Title page from [[Joseph Priestley|Joseph Priestley's]] ''Letters'']]

'''''Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever''''' (1780) is a multi-volume series of books on [[metaphysics]] by eighteenth-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]].

Priestley wrote a series of important metaphysics works during the years he spent serving as [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne's]] assistant and companion. In a set of five works written during this time he argued for a [[materialist]] philosophy, even though such a position "entailed denial of [[free will]] and the [[soul]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Shelburne's companion, Priestley had accompanied him on a tour of Europe in 1774; they spent quite a bit of time in Paris and the unsettling conversations Priestley had with the French ''[[philosophes]]'' there prompted him to write ''Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever'', the last of his series of major metaphysical works.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 4–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley recalled the trip in his ''Memoirs'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As I chose on all occasions to appear as a [[Christian]], I was told by some of them [''[[philosophes]]''], that I was the only person they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe [[Christianity]]. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I thought I should be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a [[God]] and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [sic] of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In ''Letters'', he continued to defend his thesis, begun in ''[[Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit]]'' and ''[[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated]]'', that [[materialism]] and [[determinism]] can be reconciled with a belief in [[God]]. The text addresses those whose faith is shaped by books and fashion; Priestley draws an analogy between the skepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses. He again argues for the [[existence of God]] using what Schofield calls "the classic [[argument from design]] ... leading from the necessary existence of a creator-designer to his self-comprehension, eternal existence, infinite power, omnipresence, and boundless benevolence."&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the three volumes, Priestley discusses, among many other works, [[Baron d'Holbach|Baron d'Holbach's]] ''[[The System of Nature|Systeme de la Nature]]''. He claimed that d'Holbach's "energy of nature," though it lacked intelligence or purpose, was really a description of God. Priestley believed that [[David Hume|David Hume's]] style in the ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) was just as dangerous as its ideas; he feared the open-endedness of the Humean dialogue&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 320; Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 111; Schofield, 37–42; Holt, 93-94; 139-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and writings==
During World War II, she lived in South Africa, but later returned to Paris, where she encountered a cousin who had survived [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/hitler-and-the-battle-of-kurukshetra/776742/ The Indian Express: Hitler and the Battle of Kurukshetra]&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to understand why things went wrong led her, at the age of seventeen, to discover the works of [[Sri Aurobindo]]. In 1959, married and once again living in Africa, she decided to leave her husband and family and, after some attempts to dissuade her, went to the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in [[Puducherry]], India, where she still lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlives.freeola.net/interviews/23_maggi_lidchi.php] Interview 23, ''Maggi Lidchi'' in: Malcolm Tillis: ''New Lives: 50 Westerners Search for Themselves in Sacred India''. Indica Books (2004). {{ISBN|81-8656-949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the editor of ''Domani'' (Tomorrow), a quarterly journal in Italian that has been published by the ashram since 1968.

She prefers to write in English, and has produced many novels, short stories, poems and plays. Her book, ''The Light That Shone into the Dark Abyss'', includes a refutation of the purported relationship between Aurobindo's vision of higher mental/spiritual development for humanity and the [[Nazi]] concept of a "[[Master Race]]".

Her most recent book, ''The Great Golden Sacrifice of the Mahabharata'', is a retelling of the epic from the viewpoint of [[Arjuna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svabhinava.org/hinducivilization/ChitraRaman/MahabharataLegend-frame.php] Review of ''The Great Golden Sacrifice'' by Chitra Raman, Published in ''The Book Review'', Vasant Enclave, New Delhi, Volume XXI Number 3, March 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marco Alexander Pallis''' (1895 – 5 June 1989) was a [[Greeks|Greek]]-[[England|British]] author and mountaineer with close affiliations to the [[Traditionalist School]]. He wrote works on the religion and culture of [[Tibet]].

==Early life: Education, Travels, and Wartime Experiences==
Born in [[Liverpool]] on 19 June 1895, he was the youngest son of wealthy and cosmopolitan [[Greeks|Greek]] parents.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Pallis’ family see Laura Cameron and David Matless, “Marietta Pallis,” in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; Pallis was educated at [[Harrow School]] and the [[University of Liverpool]], where he studied [[entomology]].&lt;ref&gt;See Thomas Merton, ''The Asian Journal of Thomas Merton'' (New York: New Directions Books, 1975), p. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 he traveled to [[British Guiana]] to study insects, and in 1912, he joined the Greek campaign against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the first of the [[Balkan Wars]]. During the siege of [[Ioannina]], the ancestral town of the Pallis family, he worked at a field hospital in [[Arta, Greece|Arta]].

During the [[World War I|First World War]], Pallis, initially aided the [[Salvation Army]] in the region along the [[Sava|Sava River]] in [[Serbia]]. In 1916 he enlisted in the [[British Army]] and received a commission as an army interpreter in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. [[Malaria]] and a severe inflammation of his right eye cut short his Macedonian service. After a lengthy convalescence in [[Malta]], Pallis applied to and was accepted by the Grenadier Guards. He received basic training, then advanced training as a machine-gunner. In 1918, as a second lieutenant, he was sent to fight in the trenches of the Western Front. During the battle of [[Cambrai]], in a charge that killed his captain and first lieutenant, Pallis was shot through the knee and was forced to retire from combat.

==Mountaineering, the Himalayas, and Introduction to Buddhism==
Following the war, Pallis climbed and explored against doctor's orders for his injured knee.&lt;ref&gt;According to one of his Himalayan climbing partners, “Pallis hides a good deal of determination behind his mild manner” (F. Spencer Chapman, Helvellyn to Himalaya: Including an Account of the First Ascent of Chomolhari [London: The Travel Book Club, 1941], p. 84).&lt;/ref&gt; He went on expeditions to the [[Arctic]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Dolomites]], and [[Snowdonia]], the [[Peak District]], and the [[Scottish Highlands]] when closer to home. In 1933 Pallis led a small mountaineering party to the area of [[Kinnaur]], one of the Himalayan borderlands. Near the village of Nako, at the border with Tibet, Pallis and his team succeeded in making the first ascent of [[Leo Pargial]] (22,280 feet).&lt;ref&gt;The Pallis led ascent is cited by Stephen Venables, Everest: Summit of Achievement (London: Royal Geographic Society, 2003); Walt Unsworth, Everest: The Mountaineering History (Seattle: The Mountaineers, 2000); and Harish Kapadia, Trekking and Climbing in the Indian Himalaya (London: New Holland Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Pallis returned to the [[Himalayas]] at the head of another expedition. His party traveled first to [[Sikkim]], an “antechamber of Tibet”, where their failure to scale the summit of Simvu (22,360 feet) was, at least for Pallis, more than made up for by their encounter with the saintly abbot of [[Lachhen]], in whom, according to Pallis, “intelligence, compassion, and initiatic authority were reflected in equal degree”.&lt;ref&gt;Peaks and Lamas, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Sikkim Pallis had hoped to cross the border into Tibet proper, but due to political circumstances it was impossible to obtain the necessary permissions. Forced to alter his plans, he decided instead to make his way to [[Ladakh]]. He was accompanied by his close friend Richard Nicholson&lt;ref&gt;Pallis and Nicholson met in the 1920s when both were pupils of Arnold Dolmetsch, and remained thereafter life-long friends. They were frequent climbing partners before traveling together to the Himalayas.&lt;/ref&gt; and one other member of their climbing party, Dr. Robert Roaf. Once in Ladakh, they discarded Western clothes in favor of the ''[[chuba]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The traditional dress of Tibetan men. Made of wool and often fur-lined, the chuba is a long-sleeved and ankle-length robe that is worn belted at the waist.&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed as much as possible a Tibetan manner of living. “It was our way of saying to our hosts: ‘We wish to be as one of you. Please make no unusual arrangements on our behalf. We love your tradition, and hope it will not be rashly changed. We have found means of attuning ourselves to its ways.’”&lt;ref&gt;Peaks and Lamas, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pallis by now saw himself as a “pilgrim” of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and in both Sikkim and Ladakh he received his religious education directly from qualified instructors within the living tradition. He dedicates his ''Peaks and Lamas'' to four teachers in particular, “the great contemplator, abbot of Lachhen, the venerable Dawa, bursar of [[Spituk]], the venerable Konchhog Gyaltsan of P’hiyang, and the venerable Geshe Wangyal of [[Drepung]], Lhasa who for my benefit and for the good of all creatures set in motion the Wheel of the Doctrine”.&lt;ref&gt;Peaks and Lamas, Dedication&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The diversity of Pallis’ instructors is further indicated in a story told by [[Arnaud Desjardins]], the French writer and filmmaker. Guided in the early 1960s by the [[Dalai Lama]]’s personal interpreter, Desjardins met and interviewed many of the most respected Tibetan spiritual leaders, then in exile. He relates: “I remember a conversation, one evening in Sikkim, when the question which arose was of Westerners who had really come near enough to tantrayana to understand something more than words and formulas. One such person, of whom those present spoke with the greatest regard and deference, was repeatedly referred to in this conversation by the English word ‘Tradition.’ ‘Tradition’ had spent some time with such-and-such a guru; ‘Tradition’ has visited such-and-such a monastery. And all of a sudden it became apparent to me that this Mr. ‘Tradition’ was Marco Pallis (under his Tibetan name of Thubden Tendzin). . .” (Arnaud Desjardins, The Message of the Tibetans [London: Stuart &amp; Watkins, 1969], p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second World War]]&lt;ref&gt;Pallis served as a Liverpool police officer during World War II.&lt;/ref&gt;  prevented further travels until 1947, when Pallis and Richard Nicholson were able to visit the Tibetan heartland before the coming Chinese invasion. They traveled widely throughout Tibet’s [[Ü-Tsang|Tsang]] province, seeking to fulfill their shared desire to “absorb the spirit of the Tradition by direct experience”.&lt;ref&gt;Peaks and Lamas, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of their stay they were able to make contact with each of the four major schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Gelugpa]], [[Nyingmapa]], [[Kagyudpa]], and [[Sakyapa]]), visiting such holy sites as the ancient [[Sakya Monastery|Pel Sakya monastery]], seat of the Sakyapa and “a treasure-house of all the arts at their very best”,&lt;ref&gt;Marco Pallis, “The Marriage of Wisdom and Method”, The Middle Way: Journal of the Buddhist Society, Vol. XXXVI, No. 2, August 1961, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Tashilhunpo]] monastery, seat of the [[Panchen Lama]] and one of the four great monasteries of the Gelugpa.

After his departure from the Tibetan plateau, Pallis lived in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], for nearly four years&lt;ref&gt;A fellow English expatriate and acquaintance of Pallis, the then novice monk Urgyen Sangharakshita (born [[Dennis Lingwood]]), provides us with a brief but informative glimpse into Pallis’ domestic life in Kalimpong: “The bungalow was situated at the top of a flight of irregular stone steps, and what with trees looming up behind and shrubs pressing in on either side it was a sufficiently quiet and secluded place. Here Thubden La, as he liked to be called, lived with his friend Richard Nicholson, otherwise known as Thubden Shedub, the companion of the travels recorded in Peaks and Lamas. As lunch was not quite ready, he showed me around the place. Tibetan painted scrolls hung on the walls, and the polished wooden floors were covered with Tibetan rugs. There were silver [[Butter lamp|butter-lamps]] on the altar, and massive copper teapots on the [[sideboard]], all gleaming in the shuttered semi-darkness. In one room I could just make out the unfamiliar shape of a harpsichord” (Sangharakshita (D.P.E. Lingwood), Facing Mount Kanchenjunga: An English Buddhist in the Eastern Himalayas [Glasgow: Windhorse Publications, 1991], p. 173).&lt;/ref&gt;  before returning to England in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;In 1959, Pallis made a return visit to northern India and Sikkim.&lt;/ref&gt; Kalimpong was then a center of literary and cultural activity, as well as a refuge for many of those who were being forced to leave Tibet. Pallis formed many lasting relationships during this time, including an acquaintance with the then queen of Bhutan and her family, whom he later visited in England, and with the Dalai Lama’s former tutor [[Heinrich Harrer]], with whom Pallis later collaborated in exposing the fraudulent writer Cyril Hoskin, alias “[[Lobsang Rampa]]”.&lt;ref&gt;See “Private v. Third Eye”, Time Magazine, Monday, 17 Feb. 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Kalimpong, Pallis also met with the Dalai Lama’s Great Royal Mother, and he developed a close relationship with the abbot of the nearby Tharpa Choling monastery.

After the political upheavals in Tibet in the 1950s, Pallis became active in the affairs of the [[Tibetan Society]], the first Western support group created for the Tibetan people. Pallis also was able to house members of the [[Tibetan diaspora]] in his London flat. Pallis also formed a relationship with the young [[Chögyam Trungpa]], who had just arrived in England.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the relationship between Trungpa and Pallis, see Pallis’ article “Discovering the Interior Life,” published in The Sword of Gnosis: Metaphysics, Cosmology, Tradition, Symbolism (New York, NY: Penguin, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa asked Pallis to write the foreword to Trungpa’s first, autobiographical book, Born in Tibet. In his acknowledgment, Trungpa offers Pallis his “grateful thanks” for the “great help” that Pallis provided in bringing the book to completion. He goes on to say that “Mr. Pallis when consenting to write the foreword, devoted many weeks to the work of finally putting the book in order”.&lt;ref&gt;Chögyam Trungpa, Born in Tibet (Boston, MA: Shambhala, 2000), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Pallis studied music under [[Arnold Dolmetsch]], the distinguished reviver of early English music, composer, and performer,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Dolmetsch (1858-1940), was a true pioneer in his field. His circle of friends and collaborators extended to many of the major literary and artistic figures of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, including William Morris, George Bernard Shaw, Ezra Pound, and W.B Yeats. See Margaret Campbell, ''Dolmetsch: The Man and His Work'' (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered “one of Dolmetsch's most devoted protégés”.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Haskell, The Early Music Revival: A History (New York: Dover Publication, 1996), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Pallis soon discovered a love of early music—in particular chamber music of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—and for the [[viola da gamba]]. Even while climbing in the region of the Satlej-Ganges watershed, he and his musically-minded friends did not fail to bring their instruments.

Pallis taught viol at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], and reconstituted ''The English Consort of Viols'', an ensemble he had first formed in the 1930s. It was one of the first professional performing groups dedicated to the preservation of early English music. They released three records&lt;ref&gt;''The Music of Their Royal Courts'' (Saga Records, London, 1967); ''To Us a Child. . .'' (Abbey “Pan” Records, Eynsham, Oxford, 1968); and ''Music with her Silver Sound. . .'' (Decca “Turnabout/Vox” Records, London, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; and made several concert tours in England and two tours to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;When on their second tour in 1964, Pallis had the opportunity to meet with the Catholic writer [[Thomas Merton]] at the Abbey of Gethsemane in Kentucky, where they spoke of Zen, Shiva, and the plight of the exiled Tibetan government. See Thomas Merton, Dancing in the Water of Life: Seeking Peace in the Hermitage (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 5: 1963-1965) (New York, NY: HarperSanFrancisco, 1998), p. 157; and Thomas Merton, A Search for Solitude: Pursuing the Monk’s True Life (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume 3: 1952-1960) (New York, NY: HarperSanFrancisco, 1996), p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New York Times review, their Town Hall concert of April 1962 “was a solid musical delight”, the players having possessed “a rhythmic fluidity that endowed the music with elegance and dignity”.&lt;ref&gt;H.K., “Viol Consort Gives Town Hall Program”, ''The New York Times'', 14 April 1963, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Pallis also published several compositions, primarily for the viol,&lt;ref&gt;His compositions, printed or recorded, include, Marco Pallis, Divisions upon a Ground: A Contemporary Work for Viol with Accompaniment for Organ or Harpsichord (London: Thames Publishing, 1980); Marco Pallis, arrangement, Renaissance Tunes: Ensemble Pieces for String Instruments (London: Thames Publishing, 1983-4); Marco Pallis, Nocturne de l’Ephémère (Wadhurst, East Sussex, England: Pearl, 1985); Marco Pallis, String Quartet in F# Minor (St. Albans: Corda Music Publications, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote on the viol’s history and its place in early English music.&lt;ref&gt;His articles include, Marco Pallis, “The Instrumentation of English Viol Consort Music”, Chelys, Vol. 1, 1969, pp. 27-35; Marco Pallis, “Tenor I or Alto? Some Thoughts on the Instrumentation of the Consort of Viols”, VdGSA Journal, Vol. 9, 1972, pp. 5-15; and Marco Pallis, “The Rebirth of Early Music”, Early Music, Vol. 6, No. 1, January, 1978, pp. 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Academy of Music, in recognition of a lifetime of contribution to the field of early music, awarded Pallis an Honorary Fellowship. At age eighty-nine his ''Nocturne de l’Ephemere'' was performed at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London; his niece writes that “he was able to go on stage to accept the applause which he did with his customary modesty.”&lt;ref&gt;Dominie Nicholls, Quite a Lot (privately published, 2002) ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; When he died he left unfinished an opera based on the life of [[Milarepa]].&lt;ref&gt;''Milarepa: Drame Spirituel en Quatre Parties'' (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings on Buddhism and Tradition==
Pallis described "tradition" as being the leitmotif of his writing. He wrote from the perspective of what has come to be called the [[traditionalist school|traditionalist]] or perennialist school of comparative religion founded by [[René Guénon]], [[Ananda K. Coomaraswamy]], and [[Frithjof Schuon]], each of whom he knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;Pallis traveled in India with Coomaraswamy's son Rama, who later also became a writer, and knew the elder Coomaraswamy through lengthy correspondence. Pallis corresponded with both Guénon and Schuon and was able in 1946 to visit Guénon at his home in Cairo; Pallis met with Schuon, either in Pallis' flat in London or in Schuon's home in [[Lausanne]], nearly every year for over thirty years.&lt;/ref&gt; As a traditionalist, Pallis assumed the "transcendent unity of religions" (the title of Schuon's landmark 1948 book) and it was in part this understanding that gave Pallis insight into the innermost nature of the spiritual tradition of Tibet, his chosen love.  He was a frequent contributor to the journal ''[[Studies in Comparative Religion]]'' (along with Schuon, Guénon, and Coomaraswamy), writings on both the topics of Tibetan culture and religious practice as well as the [[Perennialist]] philosophy.

Pallis published three books over a span of almost forty years. His first, ''Peaks and Lamas'' (1939),&lt;ref&gt;Marco Pallis, Peaks and Lamas (London: Cassell &amp; Co, 1939, 1940, 1942; London: Readers Union, 1948; New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1940, 1949; London: Woburn Press, 1974; New York: Gordon Press, 1975; Delhi: Book Faith India, 1995; and Washington, D.C.: Shoemaker &amp; Hoard, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned previously, tells the story “of how access was gained, across the varying episodes of Himalayan travel, to a traditional world, still complete and vigorous, that of Buddhism in its Tibetan branch”.&lt;ref&gt;The Way and the Mountain, p. xxxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''The Way and the Mountain'' (1960)&lt;ref&gt;Marco Pallis, The Way and the Mountain (London: Peter Owen Limited, 1960, 1991; and Bloomington, IN: World Wisdom, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''A Buddhist Spectrum'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Marco Pallis, A Buddhist Spectrum: Contributions to Buddhist-Christian Dialogue (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1980; New York: The Seabury Press, 1981; and Bloomington, IN: World Wisdom, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; both collections of essays that attempt to deal “with a number of Buddhist themes of prime importance in such a fashion as to make up . . . a coherent view of the world and of a human destiny realizable in this world as seen through Buddhist eyes”&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist Spectrum, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Pallis’ essays were also included in [[Jacob Needleman]]’s ''The Sword of Gnosis''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Needleman, The Sword of Gnosis: Metaphysics, Cosmology, Tradition, Symbolism (New York: Penguin, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; After his final journey to Tibet, while living in Kalimpong, Pallis wrote a short book in the Tibetan language addressing the dangers posed to Tibet by the encroachment of modern culture.&lt;ref&gt;See “Haven’t We Met?”, Time Magazine, Monday, 4 Dec. 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to penning his own writings, Pallis translated Buddhist texts into Greek, and translated works of fellow traditionalist writers René Guénon and Frithjof Schuon from French into English. Some of Pallis’ own works have also been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;In Italian: Marco Pallis, Il Loto e la Croce (Turin: Borla Editore, 1969). In French: Marco Pallis, Preface, Milarepa: Ses Mefaits, ses Epreuves, son Illumination, translated by Jacques Bacot (Paris: Fayard, 1971); Cimes et Lamas (Paris: Editions Albin Michel, 1955; and Paris: Editions Kailash, 1997); Lumieres Bouddhiques (Paris: Fayard, 1983); and La Vie Active, Ce qu’elle est et ce qu’elle n’est pas (Lyon: Paul Derain, 1954). In Spanish: El Camino y la Montaña (Buenos Aires: Kier Editorial, 1973, 1998); Cumbres Y Lamas (Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana, 1946). In Turkish: Yol ve Dağ  (Istanbul: Cengiz Erengil, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of his first book, sixty-six years ago, generations of scholars and students have turned to Pallis for insight into Buddhism and Tibet. His work is cited by such writers as [[Heinrich Harrer]], [[Heinrich Zimmer]], [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], and [[Huston Smith]]. Despite such scholarly acclaim, it is also true, as Harry Oldmeadow states, that “Pallis had no interest in research for its own sake, nor in any purely theoretical understanding of doctrine: his work was always attuned to the demands of the spiritual life itself. [His essays] should be of interest not only to those on the Buddhist path but to all spiritual wayfarers.”&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oldmeadow, Foreword, in Marco Pallis, The Way and the Mountain (Bloomington, IN: World Wisdom, 2008), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Huston Smith expresses a similar judgment when he declares: “Though Pallis respects scholarship, he doesn’t consider himself a Buddhist scholar. . . . What he does is focus on key Buddhist teachings and mine their essential and existential meaning. In the course of this project he regularly refers to other traditions, especially Christianity. . . . The result is completely satisfying. For insight, and the beauty insight requires if it is to be effective, I find no writer on Buddhism surpassing him.”&lt;ref&gt;Huston Smith, Review of Marco Pallis, A Buddhist Spectrum in The Eastern Buddhist Vol. 15, No. 2, Autumn 1982, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wendell Berry]], [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] gave encouragement to the reprinting of Pallis’ classic ''Peaks and Lamas'', which [[Wendell Berry]] has called, “The best book, in my limited reading, in connecting a form of Buddhism with its sustaining culture. . . . [It is] useful to anybody interested in what a traditional culture is or might be, and how such a culture might preserve itself.”&lt;ref&gt;Back cover, Marco Pallis, The Way and the Mountain (Bloomington, IN: World Wisdom, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Marco Pallis “retired to the Heavenly Fields” on 5 June 1989. Writing for the ''Independent'', Peter Talbot Wilcox concludes the obituary of his friend with these words:

It remains to risk a brief comment: that he was and remains a great teacher . . . who made sense of life and of the life to come; in whose presence insuperable difficulties became less daunting; who took endless troubles to help those who brought their problems to him; someone to whom the spiritual quest in prayer was the one thing needful, who by his own life demonstrated the validity and truth of traditional teachings; and that, however emasculated by modernism, these remain the only valid criteria for those who, as he would put it, have ears to hear. His life was a celebration of “The Marriage of Wisdom and Method”: which is the title of one of his essays.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Talbot Wilcox,  The Independent, London, June 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Landmann''' (16 December 1913 in [[Basel]] – 25 January 1984 in [[Haifa]]) was a Swiss-Jewish philosopher.

==Life==

Landmann was the son of economist Julius Landmann and philosopher Edith Landmann. Philologist Georg Peter Landmann is his brother. His parents were friends of [[Stefan George]] and were connected to the ''Georgekreis'', a circle of writers inspired by George.

Since his father had worked in [[Kiel]], Landmann attended a gymnasium there from 1927 to 1933. Having returned to Switzerland, he studied philosophy, psychology and German studies at the [[University of Basel]]. Herman Schmalenbach, Paul Häberlin und Walter Muschg were among his teachers. 1939 he received his doctorate with a thesis on Socratic philosophy as an ethic of values (''Der Sokratismus als Wertethik''). After assisting Schmalenbach and [[Karl Jaspers]], Landmann earned his habilitation under the mentorship of [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]] at the [[University of Mainz]]. From 1951 till 1978 Michael Landmann was Professor of philosophy at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. His main field of study was [[philosophical anthropology]]

Since 1939, Michael Landmann was married to the Jewish writer [[Salcia Landmann]], born Passweg.

'''Midrash''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɪ|d|r|ɑː|ʃ}};&lt;ref name=RandomHouse&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/midrash "midrash"]. ''Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-he-n|מִדְרָשׁ}}; pl. {{lang-he-n|מִדְרָשִׁים}} ''{{lang|he-latn|midrashim}}'') is [[Bible|biblical]] [[exegesis]] by ancient [[Judaism|Judaic]] authorities,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e-CPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22simply+biblical+exegesis%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLibrTtsHcAhXKL8AKHRMlAIgQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22simply%20biblical%20exegesis%22&amp;f=false Jacob Neusner, ''What Is Midrash'' (Wipf and Stock 2014), p. xi]&lt;/ref&gt; using a mode of interpretation prominent in the [[Talmud]]. The term is also used of a [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic work]] that interprets Scripture in that manner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Midrash ''Encyclopædia Britannica'': Midrash]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10812-midrashim-smaller ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' (1906): "Midrashim, Smaller"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such works contain early interpretations and commentaries on the [[Written Torah]] and [[Oral Torah]] (spoken law and sermons), as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature (''{{lang|he-latn|[[aggadah|haggadah]]}}'') and occasionally Jewish religious laws (''{{lang|he-latn|[[halakha]]}}''), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture (''{{lang|he-latn|[[Tanakh]]}}'').&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14, pg 182, Moshe David Herr&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Midrash", especially if capitalized, can refer to a specific compilation of these rabbinic writings composed between 400 and 1200 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name=RandomHouse/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/midrash Collins English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gary Porson and [[Jacob Neusner]], "midrash" has three technical meanings: 1) Judaic biblical interpretation; 2) the method used in interpreting; 3) a collection of such interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/26814/02chapters3-4.pdf?sequence=3 Chan Man Ki, "A Comparative Study of Jewish Commentaries and Patristic Literature on the Book of Ruth" (University of Pretoria 2010), p. 112], citing Gary G. Porton, "Rabbinic Midrash" in Jacob Neusner, ''Judaism in Late Antiquity'' Vol. 1, p. 217; and Jacob Neusner, ''Questions and Answers: Intellectual Foundations of Judaism'' (Hendrickson 2005), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}
The Hebrew word ''midrash'' is derived from the root of the verb ''darash'' ({{hebrew|דָּרַשׁ}}), which means "resort to, seek, seek with care, enquire, require",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/hebrew/nas/darash.html Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon: Darash]&lt;/ref&gt; forms of which appear frequently in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brown–Driver–Briggs]]'': [http://biblehub.com/bdb/1875.htm 1875. darash]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''midrash'' occurs twice in the [[Hebrew Bible]]: 2 [[Book of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 13:22 "in the ''midrash'' of the prophet [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo]]", and 24:27 "in the ''midrash'' of the book of the kings". [[KJV]] and [[ESV]] translate the word as "story" in both instances; the [[Septuagint]] translates it as βιβλίον (book) in the first, as γραφή (writing) in the second. The meaning of the Hebrew word in these contexts is uncertain: it has been interpreted as referring to "a body of authoritative narratives, or interpretations thereof, concerning historically important figures"&lt;ref name=ODJR&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA493&amp;lpg=PA493&amp;dq=oxford+jewish+%22body+of+authoritative%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=daE79j9KvU&amp;sig=AwoKfYVncWc1d069VCeLjH6SVmY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi7mKuI3sTcAhVRQMAKHULVBZUQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=oxford%20jewish%20%22body%20of%20authoritative%22&amp;f=false ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'' (Oxford University Press 2011): "Midrash and midrashic literature"]&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to refer to a "book", perhaps even a "book of interpretation", which might make its use a foreshadowing of the technical sense that the rabbis later gave to the word.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aOVOYrZkrBoC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=%22midrash+by+the+rabbis%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qBldY4IcIj&amp;sig=Py6345_im03dnxnMCJOLwEMPMA8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEieW2kcLcAhUJC8AKHUEwDH0Q6AEwAXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22midrash%20by%20the%20rabbis%22&amp;f=false Lieve M. Teugels, ''Bible and Midrash: The Story of "The Wooing of Rebekah" (Gen. 24)'' (Peeters 2004), p. 162]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early Middle Ages the function of much of midrashic interpretation has been distinguished from that of ''peshat'', straight or direct interpretation aiming at the original literal meaning of a scriptural text.&lt;ref name=ODJR/&gt;

== Midrash as method ==
Midrash is now viewed more as method than genre, although the rabbinic midrashim do constitute a distinct literary genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLvrV1dnBOUC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=evans+%22more+as+method%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWrrvZncLcAhUUQMAKHU_CCaAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=evans%20%22more%20as%20method%22&amp;f=false Craig A.

Nkoma, ''Significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other Essays'' (African Books Collective 2013), p. 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], "Midrash was initially a philological method of interpreting the literal meaning of biblical texts. In time it developed into a sophisticated interpretive system that reconciled apparent biblical contradictions, established the scriptural basis of new laws, and enriched biblical content with new meaning. Midrashic creativity reached its peak in the schools of [[Rabbi Ishmael]] and [[Rabbi Akiva|Akiba]], where two different hermeneutic methods were applied. The first was primarily logically oriented, making inferences based upon similarity of content and analogy. The second rested largely upon textual scrutiny, assuming that words and letters that seem superfluous teach something not openly stated in the text."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Talmud#ref34866 ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''. article "Talmud and Midrash", section "Modes of interpretation and thought"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different exegetical methods are employed in an effort to derive deeper meaning from a text. This is not limited to the traditional [[Rabbi Ishmael#Hermeneutic rules|thirteen textual tools]] attributed to the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Rabbi Ishmael]], which are used in the interpretation of ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law). The presence of words or letters which are seen to be apparently superfluous, and the chronology of events, parallel narratives or what are seen as other textual "anomalies" are often used as a springboard for interpretation of segments of Biblical text. In many cases, a handful of lines in the Biblical narrative may become a long philosophical discussion

Jacob Neusner distinguishes three midrash processes:
# paraphrase: recounting the content of the biblical text in different language that may change the sense;
# prophecy: reading the text as an account of something happening or about to happen in the interpreter's time;
# parable or allegory: indicating deeper meanings of the words of the text as speaking of something other than the superficial meaning of the words or of everyday reality, as when the love of man and woman in the Song of Songs is interpreted as referring to the love between God and Israel or the Church as in {{bibleverse|Isaiah|5:1-6}} and in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e-CPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22types+of+midrash-processes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUjIzOwMLcAhUrKcAKHagfA1EQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22types%20of%20midrash-processes%22&amp;f=false Jacob Neusner, ''What Is Midrash'' (Wipf and Stock 2014), pp. 1−2 and 7−8]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jewish midrashic literature ==

Numerous Jewish midrashim previously preserved in manuscript form have been published in print, including those denominated as [[smaller midrashim|smaller]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10812-midrashim-smaller Jewish Encycopedia (1905): "Midrashim, Smaller"]&lt;/ref&gt; or minor midrashim. Bernard H. Mehlman and Seth M. Limmer deprecate this usage on the grounds that the term "minor" seems judgmental and "small" is inappropriate for midrashim some of which are lengthy. They propose instead the term "medieval midrashim", since the period of their production extended from the twilight of the rabbinic age to the dawn of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MvY6DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=midrash+%22created+between%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi76LPf_8TcAhWTa8AKHfcEBZIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=midrash%20%22created%20between%22&amp;f=false Bernard H. Mehlman, Seth M. Limmer, ''Medieval Midrash: The House for Inspired Innovation'' (BRILL 2016), p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, rabbinic midrashim either focus on religious law and practice (''[[halakha]]'') or interpret biblical narrative in relation to non-legal ethics or theology, creating homilies and parables based on the text. In the latter case they are described as ''[[Aggadah|aggadic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/midrash-101/ My Jewish Learning: What Is Midrash?]&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Halakhic midrashim ===
{{Rabbinical Literature}}
''[[Midrash halakha]]'' is the name given to a group of tannaitic expositions on the first four books of the  [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14, pg 193&lt;/ref&gt; These midrashim, written in Mishnahic Hebrew, clearly distinguish between the Biblical texts that they discuss, and the rabbinic interpretation of that text. They often go well beyond simple interpretation and derive or provide support for [[halakha]]. This work is based on pre-set assumptions about the sacred and divine nature of the text, and the belief in the legitimacy that accords with rabbinic interpretation.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14, pg 194&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although this material treats the biblical texts as the authoritative word of God, it is clear that not all of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was fixed in its wording at this time, as some verses that are cited differ from the [[Masoretic]], and accord with the Septuagint, or Samaritan Torah instead.&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14, pg 195&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Origins ===
With the growing canonization of the contents of the [[Hebrew Bible]], both in terms of the books that it contained, and the version of the text in them, and an acceptance that new texts could not be added, there came a need to produce material that would clearly differentiate between that text, and rabbinic interpretation of it.  By collecting and compiling these thoughts they could be presented in a manner which helped to refute claims that they were only human interpretations. The argument being that by presenting the various collections of different schools of thought each of which relied upon close study of the text, the growing difference between early biblical law, and its later rabbinic interpretation could be reconciled.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Aggadic midrashim ===
{{main|Aggadah}}
Midrashim which seek to explain the non-legal portions of the Hebrew Bible are sometimes referred to as ''aggadah'' or ''haggadah''.&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPAEDIA JUDAICA, Second Edition, Volume 14, pg 183&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggadic discussions of the non-legal parts of Scripture are characterized by a much greater freedom of exposition than the halakhic midrashim (midrashim on Jewish law). Aggadic expositors availed themselves of various techniques, including sayings of prominent rabbis. These aggadic explanations could be philosophical or mystical disquisitions concerning [[angel]]s, [[demon]]s, [[paradise]], [[hell]], the [[messiah]], [[Satan]], feasts and fasts, [[parable]]s, legends, satirical assaults on those who practice [[idolatry]], etc.

Some of these midrashim entail mystical teachings. The presentation is such that the midrash is a simple lesson to the uninitiated, and a direct allusion, or analogy, to a mystical teaching for those educated in this area.

An example of a midrashic interpretation:

:"And God saw all that He had made, and found it very good. And there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:31)—Midrash: ''Rabbi Nahman said in Rabbi Samuel's name: "Behold, it was very good" refers to the Good Desire; "AND behold, it was very good" refers to the Evil Desire. Can then the Evil Desire be very good? That would be extraordinary! But without the Evil Desire, however, no man would build a house, take a wife and beget children; and thus said Solomon: "Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man's rivalry with his neighbour." (Kohelet IV, 4)''.&lt;ref&gt;(''Genesis Rabbah'' 9:7, translation from Soncino Publications)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical compilations ==
{{Eras of the Halakha}}
{{see also|Rabbinical literature}}

=== Tannaitic ===
* '''Mekhilta'''. The Mekhilta essentially functions as a commentary on the [[Book of Exodus]]. There are two versions of this midrash collection. One is ''Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael'', the other is ''Mekhilta de Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai''. The former is still studied today, while the latter was used by many medieval Jewish authorities. While the latter (bar Yohai) text was popularly circulated in manuscript form from the 11th to 16th centuries, it was lost for all practical purposes until it was rediscovered and printed in the 19th century.
** [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael]]. This is a halakhic commentary on Exodus, concentrating on the legal sections, from Exodus 12 to 35. It derives halakha from Biblical verses. This midrash collection was redacted into its final form around the 3rd or 4th century; its contents indicate that its sources are some of the oldest midrashim, dating back possibly to the time of Rabbi Akiva. The midrash on Exodus that was known to the Amoraim is not the same as our current mekhilta; their version was only the core of what later grew into the present form.
** [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Shimon|Mekhilta de Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai]]. Based on the same core material as Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, it followed a second route of commentary and editing, and eventually emerged as a distinct work. The Mekhilta de Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai is an exegetical midrash on Exodus 3 to 35, and is very roughly dated to near the 4th century.
* '''[[Sifra]]''' on [[Leviticus]]. The Sifra work follows the tradition of Rabbi Akiva with additions from the School of Rabbi Ishmael. References in the [[Talmud]] to the Sifra are ambiguous; It is uncertain whether the texts mentioned in the Talmud are to an earlier version of our Sifra, or to the sources that the Sifra also drew upon. References to the Sifra from the time of the early medieval rabbis (and after) are to the text extant today. The core of this text developed in the mid-3rd century as a critique and commentary of the Mishnah, although subsequent additions and editing went on for some time afterwards.
* '''[[Sifre]]''' on [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]], going back mainly to the schools of the same two Rabbis. This work is mainly a halakhic midrash, yet includes a long haggadic piece in sections 78-106. References in the Talmud, and in the later Geonic literature, indicate that the original core of Sifre was on the [[Book of Numbers]], Exodus and [[Deuteronomy]]. However, transmission of the text was imperfect, and by the Middle Ages, only the commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy remained. The core material was redacted around the middle of the 3rd century.
* '''[[Sifre Zutta]]''' (The small Sifre). This work is a halakhic commentary on the book of Numbers. The text of this midrash is only partially preserved in medieval works, while other portions were discovered by [[Solomon Schechter]] in his research in the famed [[Cairo Geniza]]. It seems to be older than most other midrash, coming from the early 3rd century.

=== Post-Talmudic ===
* ''Midrash Qohelet'', on [[Ecclesiastes]] (probably before middle of 9th century).
* ''[[Midrash Esther]]'', on [[Book of Esther|Esther]] (940 CE).
* The ''Pesikta'', a compilation of homilies on special Pentateuchal and Prophetic lessons (early 8th century), in two versions:
** [[Pesikta Rabbati]]
** [[Pesikta de-Rav Kahana]]
* '''[[Pirqe Rabbi Eliezer]]''' (not before 8th century), a midrashic narrative of the more important events of the Pentateuch.
* '''[[Tanchuma]]''' or '''[[Yelammedenu]]''' (9th century) on the whole Pentateuch; its homilies often consist of a halakhic introduction, followed by several poems, exposition of the opening verses, and the Messianic conclusion. There are actually a number of different Midrash Tanhuma collections. The two most important are ''[[Midrash Tanhuma Ha Nidpas]]'', literally the published text. This is also sometimes referred to as ''[[Midrash Tanhuma Yelamdenu]]''. The other is based on a manuscript published by [[Solomon Buber]] and is usually known as ''[[Midrash Tanhuma Buber]]'', much to many students' confusion, this too is sometimes referred to as ''Midrash Tanhuma Yelamdenu.'' Although the first is the one most widely distributed today, when the medieval authors refer to Midrash Tanchuma, they usually mean the second.
* '''[[Midrash Shmuel (aggadah)|Midrash Shmuel]]''', on the first two Books of Kings (I, II Samuel).
* ''[[Midrash Tehillim]]'', on the [[Psalms]].
* '''[[Midrash Mishle|Midrash Mishlé]]''', a commentary on the book of Proverbs.
* '''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]''' (or simply '''Seder Olam'''). Traditionally attributed to the Tannaitic Rabbi [[Yose ben Halafta]]. This work covers topics from the creation of the universe to the construction of the Second [[Temple in Jerusalem]].
* '''[[Yalkut Shimoni]]'''. A collection of midrash on the entire Hebrew Scriptures ([[Tanakh]]) containing both [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggadah|aggadic]] midrash. It was compiled by Shimon ha-Darshan in the 13th century CE and is collected from over 50 other midrashic works.
* '''[[Tanna Devei Eliyahu]]'''. This work that stresses the reasons underlying the commandments, the importance of knowing Torah, prayer, and repentance, and the ethical and religious values that are learned through the Bible. It consists of two sections, Seder Eliyahu Rabbah and Seder Eliyahu Zuta. It is not a compilation but a uniform work with a single author.
* ''[[Alphabet of Akiba ben Joseph]]'', a midrash on the names of the letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]
* ''[[Midrash Tadshe]]'' (also called [[Baraita de-Rabbi Pinehas ben Yair]]):

=== Midrash Rabbah ===
* '''[[Midrash Rabbah]]''' — widely studied are the ''Rabboth'' (great commentaries), a collection of ten midrashim on different books of the Bible (namely, the five books of the [[Torah]] and the [[Five Scrolls]]). Although referred to collectively as the Midrash Rabbah, they are not a cohesive work, being written by different authors in different locales in different historical eras. The ones on Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are chiefly made up of homilies on the Scripture sections for the Sabbath or festival, while the others are rather of an exegetical nature.
** ''[[Genesis Rabba|Bereshith Rabba]]'', ''Genesis Rabbah''. This text dates from the sixth century.  A midrash on Genesis, it offers explanations of words and sentences and [[Haggada|haggadic]] interpretations and expositions, many of which are only loosely tied to the text.  It is often interlaced with maxims and parables. Its redactor drew upon earlier rabbinic sources, including the Mishnah, Tosefta, the halakhic midrashim the Targums. It apparently drew upon a version of Talmud Yerushalmi that resembles, yet was not identical to, the text that survived to present times. It was redacted sometime in the early fifth century.
** ''[[Exodus Rabbah|Shemot Rabba]]'', ''Exodus Rabbah'' (tenth or eleventh and twelfth century)
** ''[[Leviticus Rabbah|Vayyiqra Rabba]]'', ''Leviticus Rabbah'' (middle seventh century)
** ''[[Numbers Rabbah|Bamidbar Rabba]]'', ''Numbers Rabbah'' (twelfth century)
** ''[[Deuteronomy Rabbah|Devarim Rabba]]'', ''Deuteronomy Rabbah'' (tenth century)
** ''[[Song of Songs Rabbah|Shir Hashirim Rabba]]'', ''Song of Songs Rabbah'' (probably before the middle of ninth century)
** ''[[Ruth Rabbah|Ruth Rabba]]'', (probably before the middle of ninth century)
** ''[[Lamentations Rabbah|Eicha Rabba]]'', ''Lamentations Rabbah'' (seventh century). ''Lamentations Rabbah'' has been transmitted in two versions. One edition is represented by the first printed edition (at Pesaro in 1519); the other is the [[Salomon Buber]] edition, based on manuscript J.I.4 from the Biblioteca Casanatense in Rome. This latter version (Buber's) is quoted by the [[Shulkhan Arukh]], as well as medieval Jewish authorities. It was probably redacted sometime in the fifth century.
** ''[[Esther Rabbah]]''
** ''[[Kohelet Rabbah]]''

== Contemporary Jewish midrash ==
A wealth of literature and artwork has been created in the 20th and 21st centuries by people aspiring to create "contemporary midrash".  Forms include poetry, prose, Bibliodrama (the acting out of Bible stories), murals, masks, and  music, among others. [http://www.icmidrash.org/ The Institute for Contemporary Midrash] was formed to facilitate these reinterpretations of sacred texts. The institute hosted several week-long intensives between 1995 and 2004, and published eight issues of ''Living Text: The Journal of Contemporary Midrash'' from 1997 to 2000.

==Contemporary views==
According to Carol Bakhos, recent studies that use literary-critical tools to concentrate on the cultural and literary aspects of midrash have led to a rediscovery of the importance of these texts for finding insights into the rabbinic culture that created them. Midrash is increasingly seen as a literary and cultural construction, responsive to literary means of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''Narratology, Hermeneutics, and Midrash: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Narratives from the Late Antique Period Through to Modern Times'', ed  Constanza Cordoni, Gerhard Langer, V&amp;R unipress GmbH, 2014, pg 71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Kermode]] has written that midrash is an imaginative way of "updating, enhancing, augmenting, explaining, and justifying the sacred text". Because the Tanakh came to be seen as unintelligible or even offensive, midrash could be used as a means of rewriting it in a way that both makes it more acceptable to later ethical standards and renders it less obviously implausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1998/04/23/the-midrash-mishmash/|title=The Midrash Mishmash|first=Frank|last=Kermode|website=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James L. Kugel, in ''The Bible as It Was'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1997), examines a number of early Jewish and Christian texts that comment on, expand, or re-interpret passages from the first five books of the Tanakh between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Kugel traces how and why biblical interpreters produced new meanings by the use of exegesis on ambiguities, syntactical details, unusual or awkward vocabulary, repetitions, etc. in the text. As an example, Kugel examines the different ways in which the biblical story that God's instructions are not to be found in heaven (Deut 30:12) has been interpreted. Baruch 3:29-4:1 states that this means that divine wisdom is not available anywhere other than in the Torah. Targum Neophyti (Deut 30:12) and b. Baba Metzia 59b claim that this text means that Torah is no longer hidden away, but has been given to humans who are then responsible for following it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhsonline.org/reviews/review014.htm|title=Review of J.

'''Nakkirar II''', also spelled '''Nakkeerar''', was a medieval Tamil poet from [[Madurai]]. He is renowned for his most famous work, the ''[[Tirumurugatruppadai]]''.&lt;ref name="The Tamils Eighteen Hundred Years Ago"&gt;The Tamils Eighteen Hundred Years Ago By V. Kanakasabhai&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the author&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Shulman |title=Tamil: A Biography | year=2016 | publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of a detailed commentary of another work called ''[[Iraiyanar Akapporul]]''. He should not be confused with the [[Sangam period]] writer [[Nakkirar I]] (c. 250 CE), who composed  anthologies like the ''[[Neṭunalvāṭai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamil Zvelebil |title=The Smile of Murugan: On Tamil Literature of South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=degUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA155 |year=1973 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-03591-5 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the prominent characters in the ''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam''. The Thiruvilaiyadal episodes of the confrontation of Sundareswarar ([[Shiva]]) with Nakkeerar are enacted as a part of the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] festival traditions of [[Madurai]].

Nakkeerar is the author of an epic titled ''Sriharnipuram'' which he composed at the behest of Kulachirai Nayanar, the Prime Minister of the [[Pandya]] king Gunapandiyan.

== ''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam'' ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The ''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam'' relates an incident involving Nakkeerar's confrontation with [[Shiva]]. Once the Pandiyan king had a doubt as to whether the scent from a woman's hair was natural or artificial. He announced a prize of 1000 gold coins for anyone to resolve his doubt. A poor poet named Tharumi prayed to Lord Shiva to make him get the award. The Lord, who appeared in the form of a Tamil scholar, gave a poem to the poet and asked him to take it to the King. When this poem was read in the court, Poet Nakkeerar found fault with it and stopped the Pandiyan king from giving the prize. Tharumi's grief grew and he again appealed to the Lord. He said he was not worried for not receiving the prize but he could not bear anyone finding fault with the Lord's poems. Thereupon, Shiva himself came to the court as [[Iraiyanar]] and challenged Nakkeerar. But Nakkeerar was not moved. Though Shiva asked him if the hair of Ganapoongodai, the consort of Kalathinathar, whom Nakkeerar worshipped, did not have a natural scent, Nakkeerar asserted that it was so. Shiva told that because of Nakkeerar's foolishness he had done so (since Parvathy is the other part of the supreme god who dwells in everything including flowers, so it is understood that she can possess fragrance as well as other attributes of the universe) and opened the eye in his forehead (Netrikkan) which emitted fire and looked at Nakkeerar to show the poet who he was. Even then, Nakkeerar persisted in his statement. As he could not bear the scorching heat emanating from the divine eye he jumped into the water of the Golden Lotus Tank. Then at the request of the other poets, the Lord took Nakkeerar out of the tank, forgave him and made him study under 'Agasthiar', the Tamil Sage. Shiva said that there were mistakes in Nakkeerar's poetry. He asked Nakkeerar to correct his Tamil grammatical mistakes and misplaced words before writing poems again.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Cultural references ==

The episode involving Nakkeerar and the Hindu god Shiva was depicted in the Tamil film ''[[Thiruvilayadal]]'' which was based on the stories of the ''Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam''. The role of Nakkeerar was played by the director of the movie, [[A. P. Nagarajan]], himself.

'''Natural Supernaturalism''' is the name of a chapter in [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s novel [[Sartor Resartus]], which, says Dr. Stirling, "contains the very first word of a higher [[philosophy]] as yet spoken in [[Great Britain]], the very first [[English language|English]] word towards the restoration and rehabilitation of the dethroned Upper Powers."{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The [[Nuttall Encyclopaedia]] states that Natural Supernaturalism refers to the [[supernatural]] found latent in the natural, and manifesting itself in it, or of the [[miracle|miraculous]] in the common and everyday course of things.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Carlyle's theory of Natural Supernaturalism influenced [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]], two admirers of Carlyle.  It therefore contributed greatly to [[American Transcendentalism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8943">[[File:1936-003 Paalen.jpg|thumb|240px|''Verbotenes Land'' ("Forbidden Land"), 1936]]

'''Pays interdit''' (Forbidden Land) is a [[Surrealism|surrealist]] painting by [[Wolfgang Paalen]], which in the final version of 1937 shows a drop-shaped stylized idol of femininity with tentacle-like arms, that stands in precarious proximity to an abyss opening unexpected in dark-crystalline forms to the observer. Three spherical space-bodies hover in front of them, two of which are shaped like falling, burning meteorites. The painting is the first oil painting by Paalen, that is artfully based on his surrealist technique of [[Fumage]]. It explores the theme of mortal fears and primordial femininity with a hermetical iconography. The painting is actually in a private collection.

== Background  ==
Paalen started to work on this picture during the first two weeks of October 1936 after a severe psychogenic crisis. In August 1936, he had to learn that a prolonged affair of [[Pablo Picasso]] with his wife Alice ([[Alice Rahon]]) had led to a pregnancy and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Alices love correspondence with Picasso in the archives of the Musée Picasso, Paris, have been rediscovered recently by the art historian Andreas Neufert who gives insight and interpretation to it in his biography on Paalen, Neufert 2015, p. 321ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Paalen later commented on the depressions which he could finally channel into a proper furor of creation resulting in some of his best works of the surrealist period: "It was as if the fire, or the germ to it, collapsed into itself, and in its place all that is terrible comes to the fore. During the day I can hardly think out of rage, leeriness or guilt, let alone talk with anyone. At night I am dying of fear, everything could be shattered. Peace is such a distant notion, hardly recognizable during those dark days. Perhaps it will be painting that pulls me out of these blows of frightful darkness and can put together the few stones that I no longer find in the empty world. And if this does not work, at least I know for sure that it is not about to have an ego, but only to listen the call to life when faced with absolute nothingness. My vision has once more turned inward. I now can say rightly, I contemplate like the old pagan Apollonius, from within."&lt;ref&gt;WP, unpublished fragments, notebooks EP 9/1, 1937 (?), cit. Neufert 2015, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Paris after a realigning journey to Greece in October 1936, he began to work on the mysterious picture that would occupy him until the following year and should testimony this fall into the abyss of death almost solemnly described with reference to the mystic [[Apollonius of Tyana]]: an apocalyptic landscape dominated by a female deity and falling meteoric planets. ''Pays interdit'' is also the first oil painting in which the [[Fumage]] is elaborately worked into the fine crystalline structures of the lower part. Paalen designs his personal model of the permeable surreal soul-image in the form of a fragmented landscape, pulsating with a mixture of feminine mysticism and romantic shudder, reminiscent of pre-Celtic [[fairie]]s and their cosmic allusions as they are known from the lyrical tradition of [[Brittany]]. The poet friend [[André Breton]] spoke in view of this prototyp for the later great Fumages from 1937–39 of symbols for a kind of extended inner view: Paalen attempts "nothing less than to attain total lucidity by effecting the osmosis not only of the visible and visionary, but of all those mysteriously alluring entities that lurk beneath the surface of the creations of "primitive" art. (...) Paalen´s secret lies in having succeeded in seeing, in letting us see ''from the inside of the bubble''."&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, Surrealism and Painting, translated by Simon Watson Taylor. New York: Harper &amp; Row 1972, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description  ==
[[File:Wolfgang Paalen, Pays Interdit 1936-37 Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of the surrealist painting by Wolfgang Paalen]]
Striking in this picture is the colour in the upper part – subtly graded green tones, which look as if painted on gold – and in the lower part a fine execution of expanding crystalline spatial structures, suggestions of mucous membranes and moist inner tissue. The Fumage-spots are only visible in some places like black holes. The arm- and legless stone figure with its balloon-shaped body parts – belly, breasts and head – was biographically interpreted as a mythologized portrait of the friend Eva Sulzer, to whom Paalen refuged during the crisis with his wife: as a kind of Eva of the future, a woman, which was not born, but owes its life directly to the divine forces. Even unintentionally, she embodies the navel of the world where the past and the future are touching, a unity of womb, uterus and mother, or as [[James Joyce]] described it: "Heva. Naked Eva. She had no navel. Look."&lt;ref&gt;James Joyce, Ulysses, London 1922, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Paalen had previously visited the [[oracle]] in [[Delphi]] with its [[Omphalos]], the rounded, symbolic stone column for the navel of the world, that reportedly fell from the sky as a [[meteorite]] triggered by lightning and subsequently used as a sacrificial stone altar of the goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], Geographica cit. Meineke, Augustus, ed. (1877). Strabonis Geographica. Lipsiae: B.G. Teubneri, p. 5f.&lt;/ref&gt; Delphi is devoted to the earth goddess Gaia (from "delphos" – Greek womb), and with her oracle, once reconfigured by the female priestess Pythia, was surely one of the dream places on the inner map of the artist, looking for deep symbols for birth and linguistic forms for an original femininity communicating directly from the uterus. Paalen's friend, the German writer Gustav Regler, spoke in view of the image of his "realm of Amazons": "On a planet, that is circling around the great streets, quietly and musingly, lies the realm. (...) Far from there, he speaks to women, as if they belonged to his distant stars. (...) And he calls one queen, since she can not hide herself; Her tall figure turnes every branch of a tree under which she stands, into a floriferous homage, she looks to the mountains, as if they were her palaces; Shores are for her the strips of blessed amalgamation with the sun. The sea receives her like a repatriate, every time she betrays the shore, and it seems as if she were now living in the element that breathes on the pulse of the stars; (...) / time is to him invasion of space / and is to be measured according to the number of comets that hit upon her element, that made her visible and luminous, that consumed and nourished her. But the gods are creatures of these rustling streams, fragments of the falling stars, (...) His feeling that we are always on the brink of infinity, that the abyss accompanies us as a faithful shadow. (...) like meteors in the desert."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Regler]], Portrait W.P., unpublished typoskript, March–April 1945, p. 7, cit. Neufert 2015, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; The fertility symbolism of the figure and the larger, transparent one of the three spheres with the enclosed allusions for earth, femininity, erosion and an enfolding pre-birth space stand together in a compositional harmony, hieratically floating in front of the impenetrable thicket of the terrestrial abyss. The idea of the meteorite attacks had perhaps come from the reading of [[Camille Flammarion]]'s visionary novel ''La Fin du Monde'' in which Eve was destined to contemplate the dying earth after a meteorite impact until her own icing.&lt;ref&gt;Camille Flammarions popular scientific novel about a collision of the earth with a comet (La Fin du monde, Paris 1894) was published in 1925 in an illustrated new edition absorbed by Surrealists such as Max Ernst.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Sloterdijk''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|l|oʊ|t|ər|ˌ|d|aɪ|k}}; {{IPA-de|ˈsloːtɐˌdaɪk|lang}}; born 26 June 1947) is a [[German philosophy|German philosopher]] and [[cultural studies|cultural theorist]]. He is a professor of philosophy and media theory at the [[University of Art and Design Karlsruhe]]. He co-hosted the German television show ''Im Glashaus: Das Philosophische Quartett'' from 2002 until 2012.

== Biography ==

Sloterdijk's father was Dutch, his mother German. He studied philosophy, [[German studies]] and history at the [[University of Munich]] and the [[University of Hamburg]] from 1968 to 1974. In 1975 he received his PhD from the [[University of Hamburg]]. In the 1980s he worked as a freelance writer, and published his ''[[Critique of Cynical Reason|Kritik der zynischen Vernunft]]'' in 1983. He has since published a number of philosophical works acclaimed in Germany. In 2001 he was named chancellor of the University of Art and Design Karlsruhe, part of the [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe]]. His best-known Karlsruhe student and former assistant is MdB (Member of German Parliament) Dr Marc Jongen.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Rudolf Walther in ''taz'' (''die tageszeitung''), 27 May 2016;
 "Man macht sich zum Knecht" (Marc Jongen, interviewed by Jens Jessen and Ijoma Mangold), ''DIE ZEIT'', no. 23/2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Sloterdijk began to co-host ''Im Glashaus: Das Philosophische Quartett'' ("In the Glass House:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/english-german/sits.html from the old German expression ''"Wer selbst im Glashaus sitzt, sollte nicht mit Steinen werfen"'' = He who sits in a glass house should not throw stones]&lt;/ref&gt; The Philosophical Quartet"), a show on the German [[ZDF]] television channel devoted to discussing key contemporary issues in-depth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3sat.de/3sat.php?http://www.3sat.de/specials/50919/index.html Im Glashaus – Das philosophische Quartett, ZDF website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical stance ==

Sloterdijk rejects the existence of [[Mind-body dualism|dualisms]]—body and soul, subject and object, culture and nature, etc.—since their interactions, "spaces of coexistence", and common technological advancement create hybrid realities. Sloterdijk's ideas are sometimes referred to as [[posthumanism]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kempe, "Neulich im Menschenpark: Die phantastische Anthropologie des Peter Sloterdijk", in Bernhard Kleeberg ''et alii'' (eds.), ''Die List der Gene: Stratageme eines neuen Menschen'' (Tübingen: Gunter Narr, 2001), pp. 151—170, specifically pp. 162—164.&lt;/ref&gt; and seek to integrate different components that have been, in his opinion, erroneously considered detached from each other. Consequently, he proposes the creation of an "ontological constitution" that would incorporate all beings—humans, animals, plants, and machines.

== Philosophical style ==

In the style of [[Nietzsche]], Sloterdijk remains convinced that contemporary philosophers have to think dangerously and let themselves be "kidnapped" by contemporary "hyper-complexities": they must forsake our present humanist and nationalist world for a wider horizon at once ecological and global.&lt;ref&gt;Book Description for "Neither Sun Nor Death", MIT Press 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Sloterdijk's philosophical style strikes a balance between the firm academicism of a scholarly professor and a certain sense of anti-academicism (witness his ongoing interest in the ideas of [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]], of whom he became a disciple in the late seventies).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' [http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/06/13/a0226.1/text interview] dd. 13 June 2006, [http://www.lettre.de/content/hans-j%C3%BCrgen-heinrichs_kantilenen-der-zeit interview] in ''Lettre International'' {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking a sociological stance, [[Andreas Dorschel]] sees Sloterdijk's timely innovation at the beginning of the 21st century in having introduced the principles of [[celebrity]] into philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mohr/phr/2013/00000060/00000004/art00002 Andreas Dorschel, "Denktagebücher: Zur Poetik des philosophischen Journals", ''Philosophische Rundschau'' LX (2013), no. 4, pp. 264—298, specifically pp. 293—297.]&lt;/ref&gt; Sloterdijk himself, viewing exaggeration to be required in order to catch attention, describes the way he presents his ideas as "hyperbolic" (''hyperbolisch'').&lt;ref&gt;Holger von Dobeneck, ''Das Sloterdijk-Alphabet: Eine lexikalische Einführung in seinen Ideenkosmos'', 2nd. ed. (Würzburg: Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2006), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual works ==

=== Critique of Cynical Reason ===

The ''Kritik der zynischen Vernunft'', published by [[Suhrkamp]] in 1983 (and in English as ''[[Critique of Cynical Reason]]'', 1988), became the best-selling work on philosophy in the German language since the [[Second World War]] and launched Sloterdijk's career as an author.&lt;ref&gt;See Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, [http://www.tabvlarasa.de/20/sorgner.php "In Search of Lost Cheekiness. An Introduction to Peter Sloterdijk's ''Critique of Cynical Reason''"], in ''Tabula Rasa'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spheres ===

The trilogy ''Spheres'' is the philosopher's [[masterpiece|magnum opus]]. The first volume was published in 1998, the second in 1999, and the last in 2004.

The trilogy is notoriously erudite in its scope, but Sloterdijk is aware his books are not for everyone. This becomes clear in the introduction to the trilogy, where Sloterdijk writes about Plato's academy which allegedly denied anyone access who was not a mathematician, or a very precise scientist. However, to make clear that his book was written out of love for humanity and to find common ground, he cites the other rule of Plato's academy: anyone had to stay out who was not willing to enter into love affairs with other students. To underline this he notes that "whomever turns away from Eros deprives himself of the vital form." Aside from that his writings were conceived because of his love for philosophy, which he regards highly, as the best thing there is even: "If philosophy is regarded as something exclusive it's only because people deny for themselves the best". And lastly the books were written to express his rich and detailed worldview succinctly, hoping it would enable others to enrich their own: "The boundaries of what I'm able to express (or: of what I'm able to transmit) are the boundaries of my world. [...] If I were to keep anyone away from my trilogy it would only be those who are not willing to transmit (what they have learned or experienced) in order to subsequently lessen loneliness."

''Spheres'' is about "spaces of coexistence", spaces commonly overlooked or taken for granted that conceal information crucial to developing an understanding of the human. The exploration of these spheres begins with the basic difference between [[mammal]]s and other animals: the biological and [[utopia]]n comfort of the mother's [[Uterus|womb]], which humans try to recreate through science, ideology, and religion. From these microspheres ([[Ontology|ontological]] relations such as [[fetus]]-[[placenta]]) to macrospheres (''macro-uteri'' such as nations or [[Sovereign state|states]]), Sloterdijk analyzes spheres where humans try but fail to dwell and traces a connection between vital crisis (e.g., emptiness and [[narcissistic]] detachment) and crises created when a sphere shatters.

Sloterdijk has said that the first paragraphs of ''Spheres'' are "the book that [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] should have written", a companion volume to ''[[Being and Time]]'', namely, "Being and Space".{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} He was referring to his initial exploration of the idea of ''[[Dasein]]'', which is then taken further as Sloterdijk distances himself from Heidegger's positions.&lt;ref&gt;In more recent years, a deepening of this take on [[Heidegger]]'s thought is given expression through a focus on the primordiality of space over time in [[fundamental ontology]] as articulated in numerous studies by the British-Lebanese philosopher and architect [[Nader El-Bizri]] in his investigation of "the place of being", of "dwelling", and primarily of [[Khôra]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Globalization ===

Sloterdijk also argues that the current concept of [[globalization]] lacks historical perspective. In his view it is merely the third wave in a process of overcoming distances (the first wave being the metaphysical globalization of the [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] [[cosmology]] and the second the nautical globalization of the 15th century). The difference for Sloterdijk is that, while the second wave created [[cosmopolitanism]], the third is creating a global [[Parochialism|provincialism]]. Sloterdijk's sketch of a philosophical history of globalization can be found in ''Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals'' (2005; translated as ''In the World Interior of Capital''), subtitled "Die letzte Kugel" ("The final sphere").

=== Rage and Time ===
{{Main|Rage and Time}}
In his ''[[Rage and Time|Zorn und Zeit]]'' (translated as ''Rage and Time''), Sloterdijk characterizes the emotion of rage as a psychopolitical force throughout human history. The political aspects are especially pronounced in the Western tradition, beginning with the opening words of [[Homer]]'s ''Iliad'', "Of the rage of Achilles, son of Peleus, sing, O Goddess...". Sloterdijk acknowledges the contributions of [[psychoanalysis]] for our understanding of strong emotional attitudes: "In conformity with its basic erotodynamic approach, psychoanalysis brought much hatred to light, the other side of life." (''Rage and Time'', p.&amp;nbsp;14) Importantly, for Sloterdijk, Judeo-Christian conceptions of God ultimately "piggyback" on the feelings of rage and resentment, creating "metaphysical revenge banks". For Sloterdijk, "God thus becomes the location of a transcendent repository of suspended human rage-savings and frozen plans of revenge." &lt;ref&gt;[http://berlinbooks.org/brb/2010/12/rage-and-time/ Francesco Klauser in ''The Berlin Review of Books'', December 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics dispute ==

Shortly after Sloterdijk conducted a symposium on philosophy and Heidegger, he stirred up controversy with his essay "Regeln für den Menschenpark" ("Rules for the Human Park").&lt;ref&gt;See Frank Mewes, [http://alcor.concordia.ca/~gnosis/vol_vi/sloterdijk.html "Regulations for the Human Park: On Peter Sloterdijk's Regeln für den Menschenpark"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215044256/http://alcor.concordia.ca/~gnosis/vol_vi/sloterdijk.html |date=15 February 2009 }}, in ''Gnosis'', Volume VI, No. 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text, Sloterdijk regards cultures and civilizations as "anthropogenic hothouses," installations for the cultivation of human beings; just as we have established wildlife preserves to protect certain animal species, so too ought we to adopt more deliberate policies to ensure the survival of [[Aristotle]]'s ''zoon politikon''.

"The taming of man has failed", Sloterdijk laments. "Civilisation's potential for barbarism is growing; the everyday bestialisation of man is on the increase."

Because of the [[Eugenics|eugenic]] policies of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Germany's recent history, such discussions are seen in Germany as carrying a sinister load. Breaking a German taboo on the discussion of genetic manipulation, Sloterdijk's essay suggests that the advent of new genetic technologies requires more forthright discussion and regulation of "bio-cultural" reproduction. In the eyes of [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]], this made Sloterdijk a "fascist". Sloterdijk replied that this was, itself, resorting to "fascist" tactics to discredit him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The core of the controversy was not only Sloterdijk's ideas but also his use of the German words ''Züchtung'' ("breeding", "cultivation") and ''Selektion'' ("selection"). Sloterdijk rejected the accusation of Nazism, which he considered alien to his historical context. Still, the paper started a controversy in which Sloterdijk was strongly criticized, both for his alleged usage of a fascist rhetoric to promote [[Plato]]'s vision of a government with absolute control over the population, and for committing a non-normative, simplistic reduction of the bioethical issue itself. This second criticism was based on the vagueness of Sloterdijk's position on how exactly society would be affected by developments in genetic science. After the controversy multiplied positions both for and against him, ''[[Die Zeit]]'' published an open letter from Sloterdijk to Habermas in which he vehemently accused Habermas of "criticizing behind his back" and espousing a view of humanism that Sloterdijk had declared dead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/anger-as-philosopher-revives-vocabulary-of-third-reich-1123225.html "Anger as philosopher revives vocabulary of Third Reich"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Welfare state dispute ==

Another dispute emerged after Sloterdijk's article "Die Revolution der gebenden Hand" (13 June 2009; transl. "The revolution of the giving hand")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub9A19C8AB8EC84EEF8640E9F05A69B915/Doc~E3E570BE344824089B6549A8283A0933B~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Peter Sloterdijk "Die Revolution der gebenden Hand"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leninunserallerlehrer.wordpress.com/2009/07/31/die-revolution-der-gebenden-hand-peter-sloterdijk-belehrt-marx-eines-richtigeren/ "Die Revolution der gebenden Hand – Peter Sloterdijk „belehrt“ Marx eines Richtigeren"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'', one of Germany's most widely read newspapers. There Sloterdijk claimed that the national [[welfare state]] is a "fiscal kleptocracy" that had transformed the country into a "swamp of resentment" and degraded its citizens into "mystified subjects of tax law".

Sloterdijk opened the text with the famous quote of [[leftism|leftist]] critics of capitalism (made famous in the 19th century by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] in his "[[What Is Property?]]") "[[Property is theft!|Property is theft]]", stating, however, that it is nowadays the modern [[State (polity)|state]] that is the biggest taker. "We are living in a fiscal grabbing semi-socialism – and nobody calls for a fiscal civil war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2009/1026/feuilleton/0007/index.html "Wo bleibt der Bürgerkrieg?"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/debatte/kommentar/artikel/1/blasen-zu-phrasen/ "Peter Sloterdijk rebelliert gegen den "Zwangssteuerstaat" – Blasen zu Phrasen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

He repeated his statements and stirred up the debate in his articles titled "Kleptokratie des Staates" (transl. "[[Kleptocracy]] of the state") and "Aufbruch der Leistungsträger" (transl. "Uprising of the performers") in the German monthly ''Cicero – Magazin für politische Kultur''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Cicero (Zeitschrift)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicero.de/97.php?ress_id=1&amp;item=3888 ''Kleptokratie des Staates'', in ''Cicero'', July 2009, p.42] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817164037/http://www.cicero.de/97.php?ress_id=1&amp;item=3888 |date=17 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicero.de/97.php?ress_id=6&amp;item=4370 "Aufbruch der Leistungsträger'', in ''Cicero'', November 2009, p.94] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129172903/http://www.cicero.de/97.php?ress_id=6&amp;item=4370 |date=29 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sloterdijk, the institutions of the welfare state lend themselves to a system that privileges the marginalized, but relies, unsustainably, on the class of citizens who are materially successful. Sloterdijk's provocative recommendation was that income taxes should be deeply reduced, the difference being made up by donations from the rich in a system that would reward higher givers with social status. Achievers would be praised for their generosity, rather than being made to feel guilty for their success, or resentful of society's dependence on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/germany/100108/welfare-state-peter-sloterdijk "Germany's welfare state under fire – One of Germany's foremost public intellectuals, Peter Sloterdijk, began the offensive on the welfare state"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, an English translation was published, titled "A Grasping Hand – The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens", in ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/27/free-market-democracy-modern-opinions-contributors-peter-sloterdijk.html "A Grasping Hand – The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Winter 2010 issue of ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_snd-democratic-state.html "The Grasping Hand-The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sloterdijk's 2010 book, ''Die nehmende Hand und die gebende Seite'', contains the texts that triggered the 2009–2010 welfare state dispute.

== Sex and feminism ==

In September 2016, Sloterdijk published the e-mail novel ''The Schelling Project''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sloterdijk, ''Das Schelling-Projekt'' (Berlin: Suhrkamp, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-autobiographical text contains a self-portrait of the author, appearing as "Peer Sloterdijk"; several of Sloterdijk's friends such as Thomas Macho, Siegfried Mauser and Michaela Boenke figure in the novel in slight disguise. Together, so the plot goes, they draft a research proposal to the German Research Funding Agency (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) on the evolution of the female [[orgasm]]. To make it look more profound and thus to impress the reviewers, the team fakes a connection of the issue to the metaphysics of the German idealist philosopher [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. The reviewers, though, see through the mystification and turn down the application. Following the rejection, the team splits and each of its members takes his or her own course. While Sloterdijk's e-mail novel about an academic hoax was rated mediocre in terms of literary quality,&lt;ref&gt;Jens Jessen in ''DIE ZEIT'' no. 37, 1 September 2016, p. 39. Sloterdijk fails to develop different voices for his characters, notes Stefan Kister in ''Stuttgarter Zeitung'', 15 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; it came to be seen more as a political statement,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Frédéric Valin in ''Der Freitag'' no. 39 (26 September 2016): "It's obvious: ''The Schelling Project'' has not even been intended as a novel; it has been launched as sheer act of provocation." ("Es liegt auf der Hand: ''Das Schelling-Projekt'' ist nicht als Roman konzipiert, es ist vielmehr als Provokation gedacht.")&lt;/ref&gt; specifically as an attack on [[gender mainstreaming]] in 21st century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Sloterdijk sees its foundation in the feminist presentation of women as "victims" ("Opfergetue"), analyzes Jens Jessen in ''DIE ZEIT'' no. 37, 1 September 2016, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Elke Schmitter]], in a review article for ''Der Spiegel'' under the heading 'Woman as an Old Boys' Joke',&lt;ref&gt;Elke Schmitter, 'Die Frau als Herrenwitz', ''Der Spiegel'', 1 September 2016. Male fantasies of women "dripping wet like a gravel lorry" ("tropfte [...] schon wie ein Kieslaster") when men come even near them are no substitute for literary imagination, Schmitter suggests.&lt;/ref&gt; described Sloterdijk's text as an anti-feminist pamphlet thinly veiled as a novel.&lt;ref&gt;A similar point is made by Stefanie Lohaus in ''DIE ZEIT'', 23 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' Sloterdijk defended himself against the charges and claimed his attitude towards women to be adoration rather than contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Vera Schroeder/David Pfeifer/Sven Michaelsen, 'Peter Sloterdijk im SZ-Gespräch', ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'', 17 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK '''Port Marine Safety Code''' (PMSC) was developed in 2000 and offers a national standard for [[port]] safety in the [[UK]] with the aim to "improve safety for those who use or work in ports, their ships, passengers and cargoes, and the environment".&lt;ref&gt;Port Marine Safety Code, 2000, foreword by Keith Hill MP&lt;/ref&gt;  

Creation of the Code was prompted by a review of the [[Pilotage Act 1987]] undertaken in 1998 by the [[Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions]] in the aftermath of the 1996 [[Sea Empress]] disaster.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Harbour]] Authorities are expected to comply with the Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marineenforcement.co.uk Marine Enforcement website]&lt;/ref&gt; As the Code is not statutory, failure to comply is not an offence in itself, but the Code does set out references to legal duties that do exist and not adhering to it may be indicative of a breach of those duties.

The Code is subject to a triennial review process by a steering group of maritime organisations. It was reissued in 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/port-marine-safety-code Port Marine Safety Code, 2016, Department for Transport]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">'''The preface paradox''', or '''the paradox of the preface''',&lt;ref&gt;Makinson, D. C., ''Paradox of the Preface'', Analysis 25 (1965) 205-207. [http://david.c.makinson.googlepages.com/MakinsonPrefaceParadox1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced by [[David Makinson]] in 1965. Similar to the [[lottery paradox]], it presents an argument according to which it can be rational to accept mutually incompatible beliefs.  While the preface paradox ''nullifies'' a claim contrary to one's belief, it is opposite to [[Moore's paradox]] which ''asserts'' a claim contrary to one's belief.

== Overview ==

The argument runs along these lines:

It is customary for authors of academic books to include in the preface of their books statements such as "any errors that remain are my sole responsibility."  Occasionally they go further and actually claim there are errors in the books, with statements such as "the errors that are found herein are mine alone." 

(1) Such an author has written a book that contains many assertions, and has factually checked each one carefully, submitted it to reviewers for comment, etc.  Thus, he has reason to believe that each assertion he has made is true. 

(2) However, he knows, having learned from experience, that, despite his best efforts, there are very likely undetected errors in his book. So he also has good reason to believe that there is at least one assertion in his book that is not true.

Thus, he has good reason, from (1), to rationally believe that each statement in his book is true, while at the same time he has good reason, from (2), to rationally believe that the book contains at least one error.  Thus he can rationally believe that the book both does and does not contain at least one error.

== Attempted solutions ==

In [[Classical logic|classical]] [[deductive logic]], a set of statements is inconsistent if it contains a contradiction. The paradox then arises from the contradiction of the author's belief that all of the statements in his book are correct (1) with his belief that at least one of them is not correct (2). To resolve the paradox, one can attack either the contradiction between statements (1) and (2), or the inconsistency of their conjunction.

Probabilistic perspective may restate the statements in other terms, thus resolving the paradox by making them non-contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, A. R., ''The Paradox of the Preface'', Philos. Sci., 53 (1986), pp. 246–258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New, C., ''A Note on the Paradox of the Preface'', The Philosophical Quarterly, vol. 28 (1978), pages 341-344&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the author is 99 % sure each single statement in his book is true (1), there can still be so many statements in the book that the aggregate probability of some of them being false (2) is very high as well. Since the principles of [[rational acceptance]] allows the author to accept a very likely statement as true, he may rationally chose to believe in (1). Same principles may make him [[Rationality|rationally believe]] also in (2).

Another way to resolve the paradox is to reject the inconsistency of both (1) and (2) being true at the same time. This is done by rejecting the [[conjunction principle]], i. e. that belief (or rational belief) in various propositions entails a belief (or rational belief) in their conjunction.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, John N..(1987). ''The Preface Paradox Dissolved'', Theoria, 53(2-3), 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Most philosophers intuitively believe the principle to be true, but some (e. g.  [[Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.|Kyburg]]) intuitively believe it to be false.&lt;ref&gt;Kyburg, H. E., ''Conjunctivitis'', reprinted in Epistemology and Inference, pp. 232-254. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to Kyburg's solution to the [[lottery paradox]].

'''Regina de Jesús Betancourt Ramírez''' (born 16 December 1936) is a Colombian self-described [[mentalist]], [[psychic]], [[Mysticism|mystic]], and [[faith healer]] who is better known to her followers as '''Regina 11'''. A now retired politician, she founded and led the [[Metapolitical Unitarian Movement]], a [[political party]] that carried her to be Councilwoman for the City Councils of [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], [[San Rafael, Antioquia|San Rafael]], [[Une]], [[Vetas]], and [[California, Santander|California]], as well as Deputy to the Departamental Assembly of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], and finally [[Senator of Colombia]]. In addition she ran as a candidate for [[President of Colombia]] in the Colombian presidential elections of [[Colombian presidential election, 1986|1986]], [[Colombian presidential election, 1990|1990]], and [[Colombian presidential election, 1994|1994]].

==Personal life==
Regina de Jesús was born on 16 December 1936 in [[Concordia, Antioquia|Concordia]], [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] to Juan de Dios Betancourt and Ermilia Ramírez, the youngest of 18 children. When she was 17 years old she married Luis Restrepo, a merchant from Antioquia with whom she had four daughters, but who died when she was only 22. On 29 February 1968 she met Daniel Jay Liska Tikalsky, an American adventurer who had travelled in motorcycle from the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[Alaska]] down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; they married later that year. With Liska she had one daughter, Johanna. She married a third time, this time on 17 October 2004 in [[Orlando]], [[Florida]] to an American man she had met online, William Coraline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mera |first=Alda |date=2004-12-18 |title='El verdadero amor es brujería' |trans-title='True love is sorcery' |journal=[[El País (Cali)|El País]] |issue= |page= |location=Cali |language=Spanish |issn=0124-891X |accessdate=2012-05-22 |url=http://historico.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Diciembre182004/reginaonce.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the marriage was short lived divorcing sixteen months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Forero Aguirre |first=Andrea |date=2009-06-06 |title='Ojalá pudiera ser bruja': Regina 11 |trans-title='I wish I could be a witch': Regina 11 |journal=[[El Espectador]] |issue= |page= |location=Bogotá |language=Spanish |issn=0122-2856 |accessdate=2012-05-22 |url=http://www.elespectador.com/impreso/politica/articuloimpreso144364-ojala-pudiera-ser-bruja-regina-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She has published over 20 books on various metaphysical and spiritual subjects, written songs and poetry, and produced videos on her teachings. She has hosted a daily radio talk show, and has worked as a television presenter.

She is the founder of the International Centre of Unity, and founder of the political party "The Metapolitical Unitarian Movement" (''Movimiento Unitario Metapolitico'').

==Controversy==
She was [[Kidnappings in Colombia|kidnapped]] for five months, and held in the mountains of Colombia. During her kidnapping she was elected to the city council of [[Bogotá]]. When she was released, she was accused of faking the kidnapping. Her husband Danny Liska died shortly after her release. Shortly after that, The Supreme Court of Justice accused her of fraud and sentenced her to home detention. While under house arrest she wrote ''Una escoba en el Monte,'' (''A Broom In the Mount''), where she related her experiences as a kidnap victim. She was given conditional freedom, but before she could publish her book she was sentenced to jail once again.

After she was released from house arrest the Supreme Court of justice found she was innocent and all charges were lifted. She then moved to live in the [[United States]], and has she travelled to [[Europe]] and [[Central America]]. She is currently back in Colombia, hosting her radio show.

'''Sacred mysteries''' are the areas of [[supernatural]] phenomena associated with a [[divinity]] or a [[religious belief|religious ideology]]. Sacred mysteries may be either: 
# Religious beliefs, [[ritual]]s or practices which are kept secret from non-believers, or lower levels of believers, who have not had an [[initiation]] into the higher levels of belief (the concealed knowledge may be called [[esoteric]]).
# Beliefs of the religion which are public knowledge but cannot be easily explained by normal rational or scientific means.
Although the term "mystery" is not often used in [[anthropology]], access by initiation or [[rite of passage]] to otherwise secret beliefs is an extremely common feature of [[indigenous religion]]s all over the world.

A [[mystagogue]] or [[hierophant]] is a holder and teacher of secret knowledge in the former sense above. Whereas, [[mysticism]] may be defined as an area of philosophical or religious thought which focuses on mysteries in the latter sense above. 
 
==Pre-Christian religious mysteries==
{{Main|Greco-Roman mysteries}}
The [[mystery religions]] of antiquity were religious cults which required [[initiation]] of an "initiate" or new member before they were accepted, and sometimes had different levels of initiation, as well as doctrines which were mysteries in the sense of requiring supernatural explanation.  In some, parts of the doctrine were apparently only known to priests. They included the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], [[Mithraism]], the  [[Isis|Cult of Isis]], the [[Sol Invictus|Cult of Sol Invictus]], and the [[Essenes]].  Mystery traditions were popular in [[ancient Greece]] and during the height of the [[Roman Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonio Virgili]], Culti misterici ed orientali a Pompei, Roma, Gangemi, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and as discussed below, parts of [[Early Christianity]] used secrecy in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Mystery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian mysteries==
&lt;!-- [[Holy Mysteries]] redirects here --&gt;
Although the term is not used equally by all Christian traditions, many if not most basic aspects of [[Christian theology]] require a supernatural explanation. To name but a few key examples, these include the nature of the [[Trinity]], the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus]]. These are mysteries in the sense that they cannot be explained or apprehended by reason alone.

The word ''mysterion'' (μυστήριον) is used 27 times in the [[New Testament]]. It denotes not so much the meaning of the modern English term ''mystery'', but rather something that is ''mystical''. In the [[biblical Greek]], the term refers to "that which awaits disclosure or interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Danker, Frederick William, ''The Concise Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament'' (University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 2009, {{ISBN|0-226-13615-9}}), Kindle location. 4417.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Catholic church the Latin term is [[The mystery of faith|''mysterium fidei'']], "mystery of faith", defined in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997) to mean a mystery hidden in God, which can never be known unless revealed by God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism_lt/p1s2c1p2_lt.htm# ''Catechismus Ecclesiae Catholicae'', 237]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] the [[First Vatican Council]] re-affirmed the existence of mysteries as a doctrine of Catholic faith as follows: "If any one say that in Divine Revelation there are contained no mysteries properly so called (''vera et proprie dicta mysteria''), but that through reason rightly developed (''per rationem rite excultam'') all the dogmas of faith can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles: let him be [[anathema]]" (Sess. III, ''De fide et ratione'', can. i).  The position, if not the terminology, of other Christian churches is essentially the same.

In parts of the [[Early Church|Early Christian Church]], many aspects of Christian theology, including some [[sacraments]] and [[sacramentals]], were kept hidden from the [[paganism|pagans]]—the so-called ''[[Disciplina arcani]]''—lest they become objects of ridicule, and were also introduced gradually to [[catechumen]]s or new converts. As the [[Persecution of Christians|Age of Persecution]] ended, the secrecy was gradually relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05032a.htm Discipline of the Secret] article in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  But the term continued to be used, and the same word is used in the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es to describe "mysteries" and "sacraments".  This is not usually so in the West, though theologically many aspects of sacraments are recognized as mysteries in the main sense described above, especially (for those churches accepting it) the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] in the [[Eucharist]].  Hence [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [[papal encyclical]] of 3 September 1965 on the Eucharist was titled, from its opening words, ''[[Mysterium fidei (encyclical)|Mysterium fidei]]''.  In the [[Roman Rite]] [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Catholic Mass]] within or immediately after the [[Words of Institution|formula of consecration]] of the wine, the celebrant says "The mystery of faith".  Originally the term "Mystery" was used for the sacraments generally in both the East and the West, as shown from the "[[Mystagogue|Mystagogical]] Homilies" of St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] and the work, ''On the Mysteries'' by St. [[Ambrose of Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3405.htm On the Mysteries] by St. Ambrose of Milan, 
[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/310119.htm Mystagogical Lectures] St. Cyril of Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all the official doctrines of Christian churches have long been fully public, the loosely defined area of Christian thought called [[Christian mysticism]] often concerns the contemplation of sacred mysteries and may include the development of personal theories about them, undertaken in the knowledge that they can never be fully apprehended by man.

===Eastern Christianity===
{{Main|Sacrament}}
The term is used in [[Eastern Christianity]] to refer to what the [[Western Church]] currently calls [[Sacraments]] and [[Sacramentals]], terms which the Western Church has carefully defined in [[Canon law|Canon Law]]. Thus, for instance, the [[Council of Trent]] declared there to be ''exactly'' [[seven sacraments]]. The [[Eastern Church]]es, in contrast, have never defined the Mysteries in such precise terms.  And, though the Western Church teaches that the [[consecrated]] bread and wine of the [[Eucharist]] are one Sacrament, the [[Divine Liturgy]] refers to the Eucharist as the ''Mysteries'', in the plural. [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christians]] have always received Holy Communion in both [[Eucharist#Eucharistic theology|species]] (both the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and the [[Blood of Christ|Blood]]), and even reserve both in the [[Church tabernacle#Eastern Orthodox Church|tabernacle]].  The Sacred Mysteries can be defined as "those holy acts through which the Holy Spirit mysteriously and invisibly confers Grace (the saving power of God) upon man".&lt;ref&gt;[[Archpriest]] Seraphim Slobodskoy, ''The Law of God'' (Printshop of St. [[Job of Pochaev]], Jordanville, NY, 1996, {{ISBN|0-88465-044-8}}), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Orthodox instructional materials may list seven Sacred Mysteries (the same as the Western seven sacraments - Western names in parentheses) - [[Baptism]], [[Chrismation]] (Confirmation), [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] (Penance, Reconciliation or Confession), [[Holy Communion]] (Eucharist or Holy Communion), [[Marriage]] (Holy Matrimony), [[Ordination]] (Holy Orders),  and [[Unction]] (Anointing of the Sick. Archaic: Extreme Unction) - it must be understood that the term is not limited to these seven. As in the West, all faithful men are expected to receive six of the seven listed above, and may or may not receive either marriage or ordination, or both; women may not be received into the priesthood, but may be given monastic orders.

Christian life is centered in the Mystery of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Christ]], the union of God and man. However, the redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective'', (St. John of Kronstadt Press, Liberty, TN, 1986), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sacraments, or Sacred Mysteries are the most important means by which the faithful may obtain union with God, provided they are received with [[faith]] after [[Eucharistic discipline#Eastern Orthodox practice|appropriate preparation]]. Christians believe that God is present everywhere and fills all things by his [[Divine grace]], and that all of creation is, in some sense, a "sacrament". However, they believe that "He is more specifically and intensively present in [those] particular and reliable manners which He Himself has established,"&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacramental Life'' (1986), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., in the Sacred Mysteries.

==Other religions ==
{{main|Esotericism}}
In several other religions, knowledge of some esoteric parts of the doctrine or teachings is reserved only for certain members. This has been a feature of [[Tantric Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Catharism]], some parts of [[Shia Islam]], and the [[Druze]] religion. In traditional [[Judaism]], study of much of the mystical tradition of [[Kabbalah]] is reserved for scholars.  Esotericism is a strong characteristic of many modern movements such as [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and [[Scientology]].

}}'''St Beuno's Jesuit Spirituality Centre''', known locally as '''St Beuno's College,''' is a spirituality and retreat centre in [[Tremeirchion]], [[Denbighshire]], Wales. Built in 1847 and opened in 1848, it served as home for the Victorian poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] during his theology studies. In 2002 St Beuno's was categorised as a Grade II* [[listed building]] and a Welsh Historic Monument (Denbighshire CC, Record No. 26459).&lt;ref name=list/&gt;

==History==
===Foundation===
[[File:St Beuno's Jesuit Spirituality Centre.jpg|thumb|left|South wing and grounds]]
Following the restoration of the English Province of the Society of Jesus in 1803 and the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Act of Catholic Emancipation]] of 1829, St Beuno's College in [[Tremeirchion]], near [[St Asaph]] in North Wales, UK, was built in 1848 as a place of study for Jesuits. It was built as a "theologate", a place where trainee priests study theology, along the lines of a small Oxbridge college. Up to this time prospective Jesuit priests had studied at [[Stonyhurst College]], near [[Clitheroe]] in rural [[Lancashire]] and for a short time abroad, but increasing numbers put a strain on the old buildings. In 1846 Fr Randal Lythgoe, the then [[Provincial superior|Superior]] of the Society in Britain, while visiting a Jesuit parish at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in [[Flintshire]], travelled to see some farm land that the Society owned near Tremeirchion, and immediately decided that this should be the site for a new theologate. In early Victorian days, when epidemics of [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]] regularly swept towns and cities killing large numbers, the fresh country air of North Wales was considered to provide a suitable environment in which to prepare young men to go and serve in the new industrial towns and cities. It was decided to dedicate the college to a local saint, [[St Beuno]], instead of a saint associated with the Society of Jesus.

===Construction===
[[File:St Beuno's courtyard - geograph.org.uk - 29546.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Courtyard]]
The architect of the building was [[Joseph Hansom|Joseph Aloysius Hansom]], best known for the [[Hansom cab]]. The outside walls were made of stone, with Gothic gargoyles and stone carving, and inside are broad corridors and large but simple rooms. [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], the Jesuit poet who studied at St Beuno's from 1874–77, described the building in a letter to his father, "It is built of limestone, decent outside, skimping within, Gothic like [[Lancing College]] done worse."&lt;ref&gt;Poems and Prose of Gerard Manley Hopkins By Gerard Manley Hopkins, W. H. Gardner p.175&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansom's St Beuno's enclosed a quadrangle garden. On the west side of the quad there was a basement corridor containing the recreation Room, a schoolroom, two private rooms and the entrance Hall. On the floor above was the library, which looks both inside and out as though it were a chapel (and is a chapel today), the rector's Room and a parlour. On the south side, the tallest side, rising higher than the tower, were three galleries which housed the teachers and the students. On the north side was the refectory with a pulpit for the reader.

===Developments===
Within 20 years of its being built the College was too small: extra rooms in the attics were added and a new North Wing was built to the left of the Tower, all very much in keeping with Hansom's original design.

In its early days heating for the lower floor was provided by heat from greenhouse below the west front being channelled into the house. Fresh water was provided from local streams and kept in tanks, which still exist above the terraces, and food was grown locally both in the college's grounds and on the adjacent college farm. The college had its own gas works. There was also a school built for local children.

=== Tertianship===

The college remained as a theologate until 1926 when the students were moved to [[Heythrop Hall#Heythrop College|Heythrop College]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. It then became a place of study for the last year of Jesuit training, the [[tertianship]]. During the [[Second World War]] it was a place of refuge to many Jesuit novices who were sent from [[London]] during and after [[the Blitz]]. After the War it reverted to being a place of tertianship.
[[File:Tremeirchion cross 003.jpg|thumb|right|Dedication of Tremeirchion Rood Cross in 2004]]
===Retreat centre===
From 1970 the house had begun to open to [[religious sisters]] on first 8-day and then 30-day retreats. During the 1970s, as those engaged in the tertianship became increasingly uneasy living in the countryside, the retreat work grew from strength to strength. In 1980, St Beuno's became a retreat centre.

St Beuno's has a programme of retreats all the year round, from weekends to 30 days. It also offers courses in [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatian Spirituality]] from one to six months' duration.&lt;ref&gt;Dates and Historical details from "Canute's Tower St Beuno's" by Paul Edwards, Published by Gracewing in 1990, {{ISBN|0-85244-151-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tremeirchion Rood Cross ==
In 1862 the College was presented with a medieval cross by a Mr Hynde, who bought it for £5 from the Anglicans at Corpus Christi, Tremeirchion. The Tremeirchion Rood of Grace stood for 140 years on a plinth at the entrance to St Beuno's before being restored and then translated back to Tremeirchion churchyard as a Millennium gift. It now stands beneath the yew under which in the mid-19th century it had been found buried.

== Rock Chapel ==

In 1866 the 'Rock Chapel', was built on a wooded hill to the south of St Beuno's. It was designed by a Jesuit student, [[Ignatius Scoles]], who had followed the footsteps of his father, [[Joseph John Scoles]], and trained as an architect before joining the Jesuits to become a priest. He went on to design [[St Wilfrid's Church, Preston|St Wilfrid's Church]] in [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].

'''Stefano Gualeni''' is an Italian [[philosopher]] and [[game designer]] who created [[videogame]]s such as ''[[Tony Tough and the Night of Roasted Moths]],'' ''[[Gua-Le-Ni; or, The Horrendous Parade]],'' and ''[[Something Something Soup Something]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,87304/ MobyGames Developer's Bio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|id=1709296|name=Stefano Gualeni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventuretreff.de/artikel/interviews.php?id=40&amp;lang=eng Stefano Gualeni's Adventuretreff Interview] (18-06-2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soup.gua-le-ni.com/|title=Something Something Soup Something|website=soup.gua-le-ni.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gualeni is an [[Associate Professor]] at the [http://game.edu.mt/ Institute of Digital Games] of the [[University of Malta]], where he pursues academic research in the fields of [[philosophy of technology]], [[game design]], [[Virtual world#Research|virtual worlds research]], and [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-52177-4|location=Basingstoke (UK)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/stefanogualeni University of Malta, Dr. Stefano Gualeni profile at the University of Malta]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://game.edu.mt/people/ Dr. Stefano Gualeni profile on the website of the Institute of Digital Games]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, he is a [[Visiting Professor]] in [[Game design]] at the [[Laguna College of Art and Design]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lcad.edu/news/stefano-gualeni|title=Prof. Stefano Gualeni - Laguna College of Art and Design|last=|first=|date=June 19, 2018|work=LCAD official Website|access-date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Laguna Beach, California]].

== Background ==
Born in [[Lovere]], [[Italy]], in 1978, Gualeni graduated in 2004 in [[architecture]] at the [[Politecnico di Milano]]. His final thesis was developed in [[Mexico]] supported by [[ITESM]] (Tec de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico). He spent a year of his undergraduate career at the [[QUT]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stefano.gua-le-ni.com/%5BSG%5DCV.pdf Stefano Gualeni's CV]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gualeni was awarded his [[Master of Arts]] in 2008 at the [[Utrecht School of the Arts]]. In his thesis, he proposed a [[hermeneutic]] model for digital [[aesthetics]] inspired by [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[existential phenomenology]].

He obtained his [[Ph.D.]] in [[Philosophy]] ([[postphenomenology]], [[philosophy of technology]]) at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] in 2014. His dissertation, titled ''Augmented Ontologies'', analyse virtual worlds in their role as mediators: as interactive, artificial environments where philosophical ideas, world-views, and thought-experiments can be encountered, manipulated, and communicated experientially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repub.eur.nl/pub/51147 RePub, Erasmus University Academic Repository] (17-04-2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic work ==
Gualeni's work takes place in the intersection between [[continental philosophy]] and the design of virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=_bF9iWkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en Stefano Gualeni - Google Scholar Citations]&lt;/ref&gt; Given the practical and interdisciplinary focus of his research - and depending on the topics and the resources at hand - his output takes the form of academic texts and/or of interactive digital experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evil.gua-le-ni.com NECESSARY EVIL - a critical, self-reflexive videogame] (29-10-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In his articles and essays, he presents computers as instruments to prefigure and design ourselves and our worlds, and as gateways to experience alternative possibilities of being.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.um.edu.mt/profile/stefanogualeni University of Malta, Dr. Stefano Gualeni profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stefano.gua-le-ni.com/papers/2014%2011%20-%20Game%20Design%20as%20a%20Liberation%20Practice.pdf FREER THAN WE THINK: Game Design as a Liberation Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620231615/http://stefano.gua-le-ni.com/papers/2014%2011%20-%20Game%20Design%20as%20a%20Liberation%20Practice.pdf |date=2015-06-20 }} (16-11-2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Gualeni released the book ''Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer'' with [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. Inspired by postphenomenology and by [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[philosophy of technology]], the book attempts to answer questions such as: will experiencing worlds that are not 'actual' change our ways of structuring thought? Can virtual worlds open up new possibilities to philosophize? What does it mean to 'be' in virtual worlds?&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137521774 Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools - How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer] (16-11-2014)&lt;/ref&gt; His contributions to the edited volumes ''Experience Machines: Philosophy in Virtual Worlds''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967202186|title=Experience machines : the philosophy of virtual worlds|others=Silcox, Mark,|isbn=9781786600677|location=London|oclc=967202186}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Towards a Philosophy of Digital Media''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1036765359|title=TOWARDS A PHILOSOPHY OF DIGITAL MEDIA|date=2018|publisher=SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PU|others=Romele, Alberto., Terrone, Enrico, 1970-|isbn=9783319757599|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1036765359}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on the experiential and existential effects and possibilities disclosed by virtual technologies.

The central argument of Gualeni's work is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and that we are witnessing a technological shift in how philosophy is pursued, valued, and communicated. In that respect, Gualeni argues that digital media can complement and extend the almost exclusively linguistic approach to developing and communicating thought.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|date=2016|title=Self-reflexive videogames: observations and corollaries on virtual worlds as philosophical artifacts|url=http://www.gamejournal.it/gualeni-self-reflexive-videogames/|journal=G A M E - The Italian Journal of Game Studies|volume=1, 5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like thought experiments (where we can objectively test and evaluate possible courses of action and corresponding consequences) or in the case of philosophical enquiries concerning non-actual state of affairs and/or non-human phenomenologies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Suscipe''' is the Latin word for ‘receive.’ While the term was popularized by [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]], who incorporated it into his [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|''Spiritual Exercises'']] in the early sixteenth century, it goes back to monastic profession, in reciting [[Psalm 118]]. This article focuses rather on its popularization through the ''Exercises'' and through the ''[[Roman Missal]]'', where it introduces the [[Canon of the Mass]]. 

== In the Mass ==
The prayer ‘suscipe’ occurs at the conclusion of the Preparation of the Gifts of the Mass, in anticipation of the transformation to be sought in the [[Canon of the Mass|Eucharist Prayer]]. This prayer, translated in the current ritual as “May the Lord accept,” first appeared in [[Charles the Bald]]’s (875-877) prayer book. This follows the priest's words: "Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters), that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicbishops.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Order-of-Mass.pdf|title=Roman Missal|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=3 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Latin word ‘suscipio’ is used instead of ‘accipio’ or ‘recipio,’ which in English means ‘receive.’ This is because ‘suscipe’ includes the idea of both receiving and taking up. Christ offered Himself to the Father on the cross and His offering was not only received by the Father, but was also ‘taken up’ by the Father, as indicated by Christ’s resurrection.

== Ignatian ''Suscipe'' ==
=== Context ===
Ignatius wrote that ‘spiritual exercises’ is the name given to every way of preparing and disposing one’s soul to rid oneself of all disordered attachments, so that once rid of them one might seek and find the divine will in regard to the disposition of one’s life. The Exercises are a set of meditations and contemplations of the life of Christ to be carried out over a four-week time period, most appropriately on a secluded retreat.

The Suscipe is not found in any of the four weeks of the Spiritual Exercises, but rather was included by Ignatius as additional material in regards to the “contemplation for attaining love” at the end of the Exercises. In this section, Ignatius speaks of the immeasurable love of God that is bestowed upon all of creation, and then asks what he might offer to such a loving God:

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''(234) First Point'''

This is to recall to mind the blessings of creation and redemption, and the special favors I have received.

I will ponder with great affection how much God our Lord has done for me, and how much He has given me of what He possesses, and finally, how much, as far as He can, the same Lord desires to give Himself to me according to His divine decrees.

Then I will reflect upon myself, and consider, according to all reason and justice, what I ought to offer the Divine Majesty, that is, all I possess and myself with it. Thus, as one would do who is moved by great feeling, I will make this offering of myself:

'''Take, Lord, and Receive'''

Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding, and my entire will, all that I have and possess. Thou hast given all to me. To Thee, O Lord, I return it. All is Thine, dispose of it wholly according to Thy will. Give me Thy love and Thy grace, for this is sufficient for me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spex.ignatianspirituality.com/SpiritualExercises/Puhl#marker-p230|title=Louis J.

==== Latin ====
Suscipe, Domine, universam meam libertatem. Accipe memoriam, intellectum, atque voluntatem omnem. Quidquid habeo vel possideo mihi largitus es; id tibi totum restituo, ac tuae prorsus voluntati trado gubernandum. Amorem tui solum cum gratia tua mihi dones, et dives sum satis, nec aliud quidquam ultra posco. Amen.

==== English ====
Literal translation: Receive, O Lord, all my liberty. Take my memory, understanding, and entire will. Whatever I have or possess you have given me; I restore it all to you, and surrender it wholly to be governed by your will. Give me love for you alone along with your grace, and I am rich enough, and ask for nothing more.

==== Chinese ====

'' '奉獻身心
 
吾主天主，納我自由，
能力意志，懇請受收；
我身我靈，承恩隆厚，
報本思源，虔心奉求。
 
盡我所有，由汝支配，
聖意唯從，力行不悖；
期望我主，寵愛榮惠，
我心永潔，更無稀匱。' ''

== Act of Resignation ==
The Venerable Mother [[Catherine McAuley]], an Irish nun who founded the [[Sisters of Mercy]] in 1831, is also credited with a 'suscipe' prayer. This prayer, also known as the Act of Resignation, is one of many that she wrote but is perhaps her best known prayer.

&lt;blockquote&gt; My God, I am yours for time and eternity. Teach me to cast myself entirely into the arms of your loving Providence with a lively, unlimited confidence in your compassionate, tender pity. Grant, O most merciful Redeemer, that whatever you ordain or permit may be acceptable to me. Take from my heart all painful anxiety; let nothing sadden me but sin, nothing delight me but the hope of coming to the possession of You my God and my all, in your everlasting kingdom.  Amen. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

A setting of the Ignatian ''Suscipe'' by the British composer Howard Goodall was given its first performance in the Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, in November 2009, by the choir, orchestra, and [[gamelan]] of [[St Aloysius' College, Glasgow]], conducted by Liam Devlin, to whom the work is dedicated, as part of the Jesuit college's 150th anniversary celebrations.

In the Philippines, the [[Jesuit Music Ministry]] has produced several settings of the prayer, with those by Manoling Francisco, SJ, [[Eduardo Hontiveros]], SJ, and Fruto Ramírez, SJ,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=fllramirez|title=Take and Receive|date=2008-08-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxBcXY7T67Y|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming popular hymns.

{{for|the nickname of Karlstad|Karlstad}}
'''''The City of the Sun''''' ({{lang-it|La città del Sole}}; {{lang-la|Civitas Solis}}) is a philosophical work by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher [[Tommaso Campanella]]. It is an important early [[utopia]]n work. The work was written in Italian in 1602, shortly after Campanella's imprisonment for [[heresy]] and [[sedition]]. A [[Latin]] version was written in 1613&amp;ndash;1614 and published in [[Frankfurt]] in 1623.

==Synopsis==

The book is presented as a [[dialogue]] between "a Grandmaster of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] and a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] Sea-Captain". Inspired by [[Plato's Republic|Plato's ''Republic'']] and the description of [[Atlantis]] in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', it describes a [[theocracy|theocratic]] society where goods, women and children are held in common. It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the ''[[Picatrix]]'', an Arabic [[grimoire]] of astrological magic. In the final part of the work, Campanella prophesies&amp;mdash;in the veiled language of astrology&amp;mdash;that the [[List of Spanish monarchs|Spanish kings]], in alliance with the [[Pope]], are destined to be the instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the [[New World]], it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before ''The City of the Sun'', ''The Monarchy in Spain'', in which Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] monarchy.

== The City ==
Protected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located in a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer. One of the most significant aspects of this community is the distribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit [[polemic]] with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue.

In the City of the Sun no occupation is vile or base, and [[equality before the law|all are of equal]] [[dignity]]—in fact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as artisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants, and no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they consider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to privilege the [[decent work|dignity of work]] and to overturn an absurd conception of nobility, linked to inactivity and vice.

Thanks to the equal [[division of labour]], it is sufficient for each person to spend only four [[working time|hours a day working]]; but it is essential that they all work, because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is held in [[common ownership|common]], from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women to children.

There are “officials” in charge of the [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that this happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself. According to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces “self-love”, with all the dire consequences this generates. They live “like philosophers in common” because they are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also on the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.

One of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of the Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted walls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces are painted with images of all the arts and sciences.

Starting with the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually descending in large circles, following the order of the planets from Mercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the stars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all the marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds, until we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle the mechanical arts and their inventors are represented.

Campanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The City of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions, such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one's feet, leaving one's hands free. On the external wall legislators are depicted; and it is here, in “a place of great honor”—but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and Muhammad—that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the twelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate places such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone's eyes. Visualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more efficient form of learning, in that it is connected to the [[art of memory]], which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images. From a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge, appropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they learn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.

In addition to the [[common ownership|community of goods]] and the painted walls, another characteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as “hard and arduous”, is the community of wives. This is the solution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing the teaching of the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Ocellus Lucanus]], Campanella says that they are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses and dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a large responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is exercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of suffering.

Moreover, there is a close connection between a person's natural “complexion” or character, which is inborn and not afterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable terrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore respect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual sentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. [[Affection]] between men and women, based on friendship and respect more than sexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from sexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing. Sexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a union is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate relationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of generation and to love for the collective community.

The religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include fundamental principles of Christianity (such as the [[immortality of the soul]] and divine providence), form a [[natural religion]] that establishes a sort of [[osmosis]] between the city and the stars. The temple is open and not surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises: “I shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar”.&lt;ref&gt;''Le poesie'', 1998, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; On the vault of the temple's dome the stars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs. The altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is in the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The task of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the highest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using astronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It is their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and for agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between God and human beings.

==Trento 1602 manuscript==
[[File:Pagina di manoscritto 1602.jpg|thumb|Manuscript page (Trento) 1602]]
In [[Trento]]'s Civic Library, there is kept a 1602 manuscript of ''The City of the Sun'' (shelf mark BCT1-1538), discovered in 1943 by Italian historian [[Luigi Firpo]]. It is considered the most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to present time. The text arrived at the Library through the baron Antonio Mazzetti [https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Mazzetti] 's (1781–1841) bequest. He was a book collector and bibliophile and, as written in his will, he donated his book heritage to the Civic Library. 

The manuscript was restored in 1980. It is made of parchment tied on paperboard. It consists of two codicological unities joined together years after their writing: the first is a Venetian historical chronicle from 1297 to 1582, followed by a list of "Hospedali di Venezia" ("Hospitals in Venice"). At the bottom, it is sewed to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated: it's a copy by anonymous author of "The City of the Sun". The transcription is meticulous and there only are a few insignificant mistakes.

In 2016, the manuscript was uploaded to the digital library [[Wikisource]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:s:Indice:Campanella - La Città del Sole, manoscritto, 1602.djvu|La Città del Sole]] (Wikisource).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2799">The '''Twentieth Century New Testament''' ('''TCNT''') is an English translation of the [[New Testament]].  Originally published in three parts between 1898 and 1901, it is considered the first translation of the Bible into modern English.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cgL5JO0hm9AC&amp;pg=PA154 |Bruce, F.F.: ''The History of the Bible in English'' (Lutterworth Press, 1979), p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt; After further revisions based on suggestions from readers, the final version was published in 1904.

The Twentieth Century New Testament was produced in Britain over a period of 15 years by a group of approximately 20 people.  Although they were all fluent in the [[koine|"koine" Greek]] of the New Testament, the translators were not professional scholars but a varied cross section of society—ministers, housewives, school teachers, railroad workers, and businessmen.  However they shared the desire (as the Preface to their work puts it), "to do for the English nation what has been done already for the people of almost all other countries -- to enable Englishmen to read the most important part of their Bible in that form of their own language which they themselves use."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/thetwentiethcent00unknuoft Twentieth Century New Testament, copy in the Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the project progressed [[J. Rendel Harris]] and [[Richard Francis Weymouth]], two well known scholars of the time, voluntarily advised the group, helping to ensure scholarly integrity. Also, translation was done using the then-cutting edge [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text of the Greek New Testament, further adding to the accuracy of their rendering.

In a break with most translations, the TCNT arranges the New Testament books in the order scholars believe they were written -- [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] comes before [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], for instance. They also include brief introductions before each book. Because of the translators' meticulous attention to the best scholarship of their day, [[Bruce Metzger]] concluded that their version still holds up remarkably well today, despite the lapse of over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce: ''The Bible in Translation'' (Baker Academic, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Revision==
A modern revision of the TCNT called the [[Open English Bible]] was released in 2010 as a public domain ([[Creative Commons license#public domain|Creative Commons CC0 license]]) work.

In [[philosophy]], the '''underworld of philosophy''' consists of ideas that either violate important canons of reasoning or which are simply so far out and unfamiliar that they are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Feyerabend. Philosophy: world and underworld. In Ted Honderich (ed.) The Oxford Companion to Philosophy (2 ed.) Oxford University Press, 2005. http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001/acref-9780199264797-e-1943#&lt;/ref&gt; However the expression is often used poetically to denote other things, such as philosophy as a whole (contrasted to science), dead philosophers in [[limbo]] etc.

'''Cerro Uritorco''' is a [[mountain]] (''cerro'') and highest peak of the Sierras Chicas chain in the northwest of the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]], [[Argentina]]. It is located next to the [[Calabalumba River]], three km (1.9 miles) from the center of the city of [[Capilla del Monte]], and its summit is at 1,949 m (6,394 ft) [[above mean sea level]]. The name ''Uritu urqu'' means "Male Hill" in [[Santiago del Estero Quichua]], which is, however, not the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal]] [[Comechingón]] language.

Uritorco is under private administration, and can be accessed by the public for a small fee. It is considered a medium-difficulty ascent, taking around three hours to reach the top provided the appropriate [[hiking]] path is followed.

In 2012, the mountain was closed on December 21, as a mass suicide had been proposed on [[Facebook]] to take place there due to the [[2012 phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cerrarían el Uritorco el próximo viernes por temor a suicidio masivo|language=Spanish|newspaper=Telefe Noticias|url=http://telefenoticias.com.ar/es/news//20121217/cerrarian-uritorco-proximo-viernes-por-temor-suicidio-masivo/14489.shtml|date=17 December 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526025419/http://telefenoticias.com.ar/es/news//20121217/cerrarian-uritorco-proximo-viernes-por-temor-suicidio-masivo/14489.shtml|archive-date=26 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Valentino Bellucci''' (Weinheim, 1975) is an Italian [[philosopher]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2016/07/14/popsophia-da-pitagora-a-guerre-stellari/2905646/&lt;/ref&gt; [[sociologist]], [[poet]], [[painter]], and essayist.

== Biography ==
He taught "History and critical analysis of the video-theater" at the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Macerata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valentino Bellucci|title=Artaud, Van Gogh e le immagini divoranti|date=2005|publisher=Testo della conferenza tenuta all'Accademia delle Belle Arti di Macerata il 18/05/2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delleali.it/…/Artaud_VanGogh_e_le_immagini_divor…&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Giordano Bruno Guerri]] cita i suoi scritti su [[Van Gogh]] nella sua opera, ''Follia? Vita di Vincent Van Gogh'', Bompiani, Milano 2011, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;
He is teacher of [[history]] and [[philosophy]] at the Italian high schools and cooperates with seminars at the University of [[Urbino]].&lt;ref&gt;Valentino Bellucci, ''Riflessioni, da Merleau-Ponty a Derrida, sui rapporti tra umanità e animalità'', in Studi urbinati: Scienze umane e sociali, vol. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; After studying with the Orientalist [[Icilio Vecchiotti]], he dedicated himself to the [[oriental]] culture, especially to the [[Vaishnava]] [[Bhakti]] tradition, exploring the epistemological, historical and psychological aspects. He devotes himself to an intensive information activitiy, concerning the [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], with his publications and conferences. As painter, he follows in particular the [[figurative art|figurative]] school of [[Pietro Annigoni]]. Some of his works are displayed in some churches in the [[Marche]] region.&lt;ref&gt;1) Personale ad Urbino, sala Paolini Nezzo, 1999 ( Resto del Carlino, 25/2/99) 2) Personale a Montegridolfo, Castello, 1999 3) personale a Fano, 2002. (Il messaggero, 19/aprile/2002) 4) Personale a Fano, 2014, a cura di Gilberto Grilli, (Il resto del Carlino, 17/aprile/2014: "..l'artista è anche docente, scrittore, poeta e sociologo. La mostra, curata e presentata da Gilberto Grilli..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valentino Bellucci, ''L'odissea del volto'', in ''Pietro Annigoni a Pontassieve'', Catalogo della Mostra, 2011, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Biagetti, Resto del Carlino, 31/05/2009, ''Casavino, i colori dello spirito''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 he met [[Giovanni Raboni]] who rewarded him for a poetic composition.&lt;ref&gt;the critic noticed in his style “a 'Flemish' chiaroscuro, conferring to his elegiac momentum figurative certainty "Giovanni Raboni, in ''Introduzione'', Premio De Palchi-Raiziss, West press Editrice, Verona 2003, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(DE) LYRIKwelt - das LiteraturPortal im Internet!, su www.lyrikwelt.de.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems were recited by the actor [[Walter Maestosi]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Bellucci, recital poesie, lette da Walter Maestosi, youtube.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought ==
He developed the existential themes of [[mysticism]], both in the Western philosophical and religious tradition and in the Vaishnava Bhakti one; in the essay “Lo [[yoga]] devozionale indiano” (The Indian devotional yoga) he explains the social importance of the spirituality as existential journey rather than as institutionalized [[dogma]]. From a sociological point of view his analysis focused on the origins of the ancient [[Vedas|Vedic]] culture; in his essay about [[Varna]] he shows how the ills of modern society derive from the break with the great traditional civilizations; therefore the historical and epistemological paradigms have to be rethought in the light of the ancient wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Valentino Bellucci, ''Le strutture sociali del varnāshrama-[[dharma]]. Saggio sull'origine delle caste indiane e sui paradigmi delle società tradizionali'', Solfanelli, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valentino Bellucci, ''Che cos'è il [[Karma]]'', Harmakis, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he investigated  on the origins of [[Christianity]], inspired by the work of [[Mario Canciani]], identifying lost lifestyles and teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Valentino Bellucci, ''Cristo era vegetariano?'', Editoriale Programma, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nell'Arca di Noè'' di Mons. Mario Canciani - ''Introduzione'', cattolicivegetariani.it.&lt;/ref&gt; Bellucci proposes a critical recovery of ancient civilizations whose knowledges have a considerable social and individual value. His historical and sociological analyzes lead him to consider modernity as a mystification, a kind of collective self-deception that the society cultivates since the [[atheist]] and [[materialist]] [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; this mystification derives from an a priori rejection of the sacred, the divine, in order to follow the idols of technic and advanced [[capitalism]]. In this sense his investigation continues following in the footsteps of scholars as [[Jean Servier]] and [[Marcel de Corte]].&lt;ref&gt;Valentino Bellucci, ''Il Sutra del naufrago. Aforismi e note di un osservatore di fronte al crollo del mondo moderno'', Petite Plaisance, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Il Prof. [[Luigi Alfieri]] nella prefazione del libro ''Le strutture sociali del varnāshrama-dharma.''..pag. 7 scrive " il libro, in particolare, dice cose importanti su come dai varna vedico si sia passati al 'sistema indù delle caste'. Che non esiste, o meglio esiste come fraintendimento classificatorio di stampo positivistico e insieme come cinica prassi coloniale..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adriano Ercolani, ''La ricerca eretica di Valentino Bellucci'', in http://contezarganenko.blogspot.it/2016/05/gnosi-e-bhakti-la-ricerca-eretica-di.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veneration''' ([[Latin]] ''veneratio'' or ''dulia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:δουλεία|δουλεία]], ''douleia''), or '''veneration of saints''', is the act of honoring a [[saint]], a person who has been identified as having a high degree of sanctity or holiness.&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thomson Gale Encyclopedia of Religion|editor=Lindsay Jones|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2005|edition=Second|volume=Sainthood|pages=8033|language=TG}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angel]]s are shown similar veneration in many religions. [[Philology|Philologically]], "to venerate" derives from the [[Latin]] [[verb]], ''venerare'', meaning to regard with reverence and respect. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism,&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami1998"&gt;"Veneration of saints is a universal phenomenon. All monotheistic and polytheistic creeds contain something of its religious dimension...

Within '''Christianity''', veneration is practiced by groups such as the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], all of which have varying types of [[canonization]] or [[glorification]] procedures. In the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, veneration is shown outwardly by respectfully bowing or making the [[sign of the cross]] before a saint's [[icon]], [[relic]]s, or statue, or by going on [[pilgrimage]] to sites associated with saints. In general, veneration is not practiced by [[Protestants]].

'''Hinduism''' has a long tradition of veneration of saints, expressed toward various [[guru]]s and teachers of sanctity, both living and dead. Branches of Buddhism include formal liturgical worship of saints, with [[Mahayana Buddhism]] classifying degrees of sainthood.&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark1966"/&gt;

In '''Islam''', veneration of saints is practiced by many of the adherents of traditional [[Sunni Islam]] (Sunni [[Sufi]]s, for example) and [[Shia Islam]], and in many parts of places like Turkey, Egypt, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sufi Islam |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-sufi.htm |quote=Although frequently characterized as the mystical component of Islam, there are also "Folklorist" Sufis, and the "Traditional" Sufis...Sufism is characterized by the veneration of local saints and by brotherhoods that practice their own rituals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12792544|title=Of saints and sinners: The Islam of the Taliban is far removed from the popular Sufism practised by most South Asian Muslims |date=December 18, 2008 |publisher=[[The Economist]] |quote=In its popular form, Sufism is expressed mainly through the veneration of saints...South Asia is littered with the tombs of those saints. They include great medieval monuments, like the 13th-century shrine of Khwaja [[Moinuddin Chishti|Moinuddin Chisti]], founder of South Asia’s pre-eminent Sufi order, in [[Ajmer]]. But for every famous grave, there are thousands of roadside shrines, jutting into Delhi’s streets, or sprinkled across the craggy deserts of southern Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sects, such as [[Wahhabi]]sts etc., abhor the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/08/news/war-saudis8 |title=Saudi Shiites Take Hope From Changes Next Door |date=2003-05-08 |author=Kim Murphy |publisher=Los Angeles Times |quote=while most Sunnis view them as fellow, though possibly misguided, Muslims, Shiites are regarded as infidels by the Saudi religious establishment, which adheres to the ultraconservative and austere variation of Sunni faith known as Wahhabism. Saudi religious leaders see the Shiite veneration of saints and shrines, celebration of the prophet Muhammad's birthday and other rituals as sinful.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''Judaism''', there is no classical or formal recognition of saints, but there is a long history of reverence shown toward biblical heroes and martyrs. In some regions, for example within Judaism in Morocco, there is a long and widespread tradition of saint veneration.&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark1966"/&gt;

==Buddhism==
Both main branches of Buddhism, [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]], recognize those who have achieved a high degree of enlightenment as an [[Arhat (Buddhism)|Arhat]]. Mahayana Buddhism particularly gives emphasis to the power of saints to aid ordinary people on the path to enlightenment. Those who have reached enlightenment, and have delayed their own complete enlightenment in order to help others, are called [[Bodhisattva]]s. Mahayana Buddhism has formal liturgical practices for venerating saints, along with very specific levels of sainthood. [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] venerate especially holy [[lama]]s, such as the [[Dalai Lama]], as saints.&lt;ref name="Thomson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark1966"/&gt;

==Christianity==
Veneration towards those who were considered holy began in early Christianity, with the [[martyr]]s first being given special honor. Official church commemoration of saints in Rome beginning as early as the third century. Over time, the honor also began to be given to those Christians who lived lives of holiness and sanctity. Various denominations venerate and determine saints in different ways, with some having a formal canonization or glorification process. It is also the first step to becoming a saint. &lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;
{{Anchor|Hyperdulia}}

===Roman Catholic, Orthodox===
In Roman Catholic and Orthodox theology, veneration is a type of honor distinct from the [[worship|adoration]] due to God alone. According to Mark Miravelle of [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]], the English word "worship" has been associated with both veneration and adoration:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] once explained, adoration, which is known as [[latria]] in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves. Although we see in English a broader usage of the word “adoration” which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to God—for example, when a husband says that he “adores his wife”—in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best English denotation for the worship of latria.

Veneration, known as dulia in classical theology, is the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based on achievement in excellence.

We must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term “worship” in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Historically, schools of theology have used the term “worship” as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between “worship of adoration” and “worship of veneration.” The word “worship” (in a similar way to how the liturgical term “cult” is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term “worship” not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Devotion to Mary?|first=Mark|last=Miravalle|authorlink= Mark Miravalle|publisher=Mother of all peoples

|url=http://www.motherofallpeoples.com/2006/11/what-is-devotion-to-mary/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Church theologians have long adopted the terms ''[[latria]]'' for the type of worship due to God alone, and ''dulia'' and ''[[proskynesis]]'' for the veneration given to angels, saints, relics and icons.&lt;ref name="duliaODotCChurch"&gt;[[s.v.]] ''dulia'', {{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Third Edition|editor1-first=F.L.|editor1-last=Cross|editor2-first= E.A.|editor2-last=Livingstone|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|page=513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;s.v.

Now, the Roman Catholic tradition has a well established philosophy for the veneration of the Virgin Mary via the field of [[Mariology]] with Pontifical schools such as the [[Marianum]] specifically devoted to this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mariologicalsocietyofamerica.us |title=Mariological Society of America |publisher=Mariologicalsocietyofamerica.us |date= |accessdate=2012-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servidimaria.org/en/attualita/promotori2/promotori2.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202032938/http://www.servidimaria.org/en/attualita/promotori2/promotori2.htm |date=December 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Publisher’s Notice in the Second Italian Edition (1986), reprinted in English Edition, [[Gabriel Roschini]], O.S.M. (1989). ''The [[Virgin Mary]] in the Writings of [[Maria Valtorta]]'' (English Edition). Kolbe's Publication Inc. {{ISBN|2-920285-08-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestant===
In [[Protestantism|Protestant]]  churches, veneration is sometimes considered to amount to the heresy of [[idolatry]], and the related practice of [[canonization]] amounts to the heresy of [[apotheosis]]. Protestant theology usually denies that any real distinction between veneration and [[worship]] can be made, and claims that the practice of veneration distracts the Christian soul from its true object, the worship of God.  In his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', [[John Calvin]] writes that "(t)he distinction of what is called ''dulia'' and ''latria'' was invented for the very purpose of permitting divine honours to be paid to angels and dead men with apparent impunity".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reformed.org/books/institutes/books/book1/bk1ch12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
Hinduism has a longstanding and living tradition of reverence toward saints, with the line often blurring between humanity and divinity with some Hindu deities. The [[bhakti]] movements helped to popularize the veneration of saints and [[guru]]s as models showing the way to liberation.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark1966" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cybelle Shattuck, Hinduism (London: Routledge, 1999), page 61, https://www.questia.com/read/103395975.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
{{Main article|Wali}}

[[Islam]] has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called ''[[wali]]'', which literally means "Friend [of God]"),&lt;ref&gt;See John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of [[Salafism]]. In [[Sunni Islam]], the veneration of saints became a very common form of religious celebration early on,&lt;ref&gt;See John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of "special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles."&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., “Saint”, in: Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both "loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him."&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., “Saint”, in: Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; "Belief in the miracles of saints (''karāmāt al-awliyāʾ'') ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints," ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of [[ziyara|grave visitation]] like [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] emphatically declaring: "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The [[Quran]] has pointed to it in different places, and the [[hadith|sayings of the Prophet]] have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'' (al-Madani Publishing House, 1980), p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the [[Sufi]]s, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the [[maddhab|one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law]].&lt;ref&gt;John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Veneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the [[Salafi movement]], whose various streams regard it as "being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium."&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' (New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009), p. 600&lt;/ref&gt;  In a manner similar to the [[Protestant Reformation]],&lt;ref&gt;See Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad'' (London: Oneworld Publications, 2015), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; the specific traditional practices which [[Salafism]] has tried to curtail in both [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] contexts include those of [[wali|the veneration of saints]], [[ziyara|visiting their graves]], [[tawassul|seeking their intercession]], and [[relics|honoring their relics]]. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: "[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints…. [due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
While orthodox and organized Judaism do not countenance the veneration of saints per se, veneration and pilgrimage to burial sites of holy Jewish leaders is an ancient part of the tradition.&lt;ref name="Sharot"&gt;"....the veneration of, and pilgrimages to, saints were part of an ancient Jewish tradition."  {{cite book|last=Sharot|first=Stephen|title=Judaism: A Sociology|publisher=Holmes &amp; Meier Publishers|location=New York|year=1976|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is common for some Jews to visit the graves of many righteous Jewish leaders.&lt;ref name="De Lange"&gt;"The life of these, mainly Sephardi and Oriental (Mizrahi) communities, is marked by an unself-conscious and unquestioning commitment to deeply rooted values, where legalism often yields to common sense, and mystical piety plays an integral part, visible in such practices as veneration of tombs of patriarchs and saints, often associated with pilgrimage." {{cite book|last=De Lange|first=Nicholas|title=An Introduction to Judaism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2000|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition is particularly strong among Moroccan Jews, and Jews of Sephardi descent, although also by some Ashkenazi Jews as well. This is particularly true in Israel, where many holy Jewish leaders are buried. The [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]], [[Rachel's Tomb]] in [[Bethlehem]] and that of Maimonides in Tiberius are examples of burial sites that attract large pilgrimages in Israel.&lt;ref name="Thomson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben-Ami1998" /&gt; In America, the only such example is the grave site of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], at the [[Ohel (Chabad-Lubavitch)|Ohel]], in the cemetery in Queens where he is buried alongside his father-in-law. During his lifetime, Schneerson himself would frequently visit the gravesite (Ohel) of his father-in-law, where he would read letters and written prayers, and then place them on the grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=David M.

'''''War of the Worldviews: Science vs. Spirituality''''' is a book written by [[Deepak Chopra]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]], which was published in 2011, and is a debate between views on [[science]] and [[spirituality]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |last=Chopra |first=Deepak |title= War of the Worldviews|year=2011 |month= |publisher=[[Harmony Books]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-88688-0 |oclc= 708648095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hp11&gt;{{cite news|title=War of The Worldviews: Where Science and Spirituality Agree and Disagree|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/war-of-the-worldviews-a-s_b_1007950.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|first1=Deepak|last1=Chopra|first2=Leonard|last2=Mlodinow|date=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is written as a series of  essays by each author on a mutually-agreed-upon list of 18 questions. The science worldview is represented by Mlodinow and the spirituality worldview is represented by Chopra. Each presents his side which is followed by the other person's rebuttal.&lt;ref name=hp11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chopra|first=Deepak|title=War of the Worldviews: Let's talk evolution|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/10/10/deepak_chopra_evolution.DTL|publisher=SFGate|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review on "War of the Worldviews"|url=http://advaita-academy.org/books/War-of-the-Worldviews.ashx?m=a|first=Vemuri|last=Ramesan|publisher=Advaita Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Overall, Mlodinow suggests that "the universe operates according to laws of physics while acknowledging that science does not address why the laws exist or how they arise". Chopra says that "the laws of nature as well as mathematics share the same source as human consciousness".&lt;ref name=hp11/&gt;

'''William James''' "'''Will'''" '''Durant''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|r|æ|n|t}}; November 5, 1885 – November 7, 1981) was an American writer, historian, and philosopher. He became best known for his work ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', 11 volumes written in collaboration with his wife, [[Ariel Durant]], and published between 1935 and 1975.  He was earlier noted for ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]'' (1926), described as "a groundbreaking work that helped to popularize philosophy".&lt;ref name = Rogers&gt;{{cite book | last = Rogers |first= Will|title= The Papers of Will Rogers|year= 1966|publisher= University of Oklahoma Press|page = 393|editor-first = Steven K. | editor-last = Gragert}}{{dubious | date = December 2013}} ''The details of this book appear to be wrong – see talk page''&lt;/ref&gt;

He conceived of philosophy as total perspective or seeing things ''sub specie totius'' (a phrase inspired by [[Spinoza]]'s ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Durant |first= Will |title= What is Philosophy? |url= http://www.willdurant.com/philosophy.htm |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228120611/http://www.willdurant.com/philosophy.htm |archivedate= December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to unify and humanize the great body of historical knowledge, which had grown voluminous and become fragmented into esoteric specialties, and to vitalize it for contemporary application.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Durants were awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] in 1968 and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1977.

==Early life==
Durant was born in [[North Adams, Massachusetts|North Adams]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[French-Canadian]] [[Catholic]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://ffrf.org/news/day/dayitems/item/14888-will-durant "Will Durant"], Freedom From Religion Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; parents Joseph Durant and Mary Allard, who had been part of the [[Quebec emigration]] to the United States.

In 1900, Durant was educated by the [[Jesuits]] in [[St.&amp;nbsp;Peter's Preparatory School]] and, later, [[Saint Peter's University|Saint Peter's College]] in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. Historian Joan Rubin writes of that period, "Despite some adolescent flirtations, he began preparing for the vocation that promised to realize his mother's fondest hopes for him: the priesthood. In that way, one might argue, he embarked on a course that, while distant from [[Yale]]'s or [[Columbia University|Columbia]]'s apprenticeships in gentility, offered equivalent cultural authority within his own milieu."&lt;ref name= Rubin&gt;Rubin, Joan Shelley. ''The Making of Middlebrow Culture'', University of North Carolina Press (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, he began experimenting with socialist philosophy, but, after [[World War I]], he began recognizing that a "lust for power" underlay all forms of political behavior.&lt;ref name= Rubin /&gt; However, even before the war, "other aspects of his sensibility had competed with his radical leanings," notes Rubin. She adds that "the most concrete of those was a persistent penchant for philosophy. With his energy invested in [[Baruch Spinoza]], he made little room for the Russian anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. From then on, writes Rubin, "his retention of a model of selfhood predicated on discipline made him unsympathetic to anarchist injunctions to 'be yourself.'... To be one's 'deliberate self,' he explained, meant to 'rise above' the impulse to 'become the slaves of our passions' and instead to act with 'courageous devotion' to a moral cause."&lt;ref name=Rubin /&gt;

Durant graduated in 1907. He worked as a reporter for [[Arthur Brisbane]]'s ''[[New York Journal|New York Evening Journal]]'' for 10 dollars a week. At the ''Evening Journal'', he wrote several articles on [[sexual crime|sexual criminals]]. In 1907, he began teaching [[Latin]], French, English and [[geometry]] at [[Seton Hall University]], [[South Orange, New Jersey]]. He was also made librarian there.

==Teaching career==
[[Image:The Modern School in New York City, circa 1911-12.jpg|thumb|The Modern School in New York City, circa 1911–12. Will Durant stands with his pupils. This image was used on the cover of the first ''Modern School'' magazine.]]
In 1911, he left the seminary. He became the principal of [[Ferrer Modern School]], an advanced school intended to educate the working classes; he also taught there. Alden Freeman, a supporter of the Ferrer Modern School, sponsored him for a tour of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=Our Oriental Heritage|date=1935|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=1051}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Modern School, he fell in love with and married a 15-year-old pupil, Chaya (Ida) Kaufman, whom he later nicknamed "Ariel". The Durants had one daughter, Ethel, and adopted a son, Louis.

By 1914, he began to reject "intimations of human evil", notes Rubin, and to "retreat from radical social change." She summarizes the changes in his overall philosophy:
{{Quote |Instead of tying human progress to the rise of the [[proletariat]], he made it the inevitable outcome of the laughter of young children or the endurance of his parents' marriage. As Ariel later summarized it, he had concocted, by his mid-30s, "that sentimental, idealizing blend of love, philosophy, Christianity, and socialism which dominated his spiritual chemistry" the rest of his life.

The attributes ultimately propelled him away from radicalism as a substitute faith and from teaching young anarchists as an alternative vocation. Instead, late in 1913 he embarked on a different pursuit: the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name=Rubin/&gt;}}

In 1913, he resigned his post as teacher. To support themselves, he began lecturing in a Presbyterian church for $5 and $10; the material for the lectures became the starting point for ''The Story of Civilization''.

==Author==
In 1917, while working on a doctorate in philosophy at [[Columbia University]], he wrote his first book, ''Philosophy and the Social Problem''. He discussed the idea that philosophy had not grown because it avoided the actual problems of society. He received his doctorate that same year from Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2011-spring/a-symphony-of-history-will-durants-the-story-of-civilization/ | title = A Symphony of History: Will Durant’s The Story of Civilization | journal = The Objective Standard |first = Dan |last = Norton |date=Spring 2011 | volume = 6 | number = 1 | at = 3rd paragraph | accessdate = May 29, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an instructor at the university.

===''The Story of Philosophy''===
''[[The Story of Philosophy]]'' originated as a series of [[Little Blue Books]] (educational pamphlets aimed at workers) and was so popular it was republished in 1926 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] as a hardcover book&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://ktwu.wuacc.edu/journeys/scripts/412b.html | title = WUACC | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310234115/http://ktwu.wuacc.edu/journeys/scripts/412b.html | archivedate = March 10, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and became a bestseller, giving the Durants the financial independence that would allow them to travel the world several times and spend four decades writing ''[[The Story of Civilization]]''. Will left teaching and began work on the 11-volume ''Story of Civilization''.

=== ''The Story of Civilization''===
The Durants strove throughout ''The Story of Civilization'' to create what they called "integral history." They opposed it to the "specialization" of history, an anticipatory rejection of what some have called the "cult of the expert." Their goal was to write a "biography" of a civilization, in this case, the West, including not just the usual wars, politics and biography of greatness and villainy but also the culture, art, philosophy, religion, and the rise of mass communication. Much of ''The Story'' considers the living conditions of everyday people throughout the 2500 year period that their "story" of the West covers. They also bring an unabashedly moral framework to their accounts, constantly stressing the "dominance of strong over the weak, the clever over the simple." ''The Story of Civilization'' is the most successful [[historiography|historiographical]] series in history. It has been said that the series "put [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] on the map" as a publishing house. In the 1990s, an unabridged audiobook production of all 11 volumes was produced by [[Books On Tape]] read by Alexander Adams ([[Grover Gardner]]).

For ''Rousseau and Revolution'' (1967), the 10th volume of ''The Story of Civilization'', the Durants were awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for literature. In 1977, it was followed by one of the two highest awards granted by the United States government to civilians, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], awarded by [[Gerald Ford]].

The first volume of ''The Story of Civilization'' series, called ''Our Oriental Heritage'' (1935), is divided into an introduction and three books. The introduction takes the reader through the different aspects of civilization (economical, political, moral and mental). Book One is dedicated to the civilizations of the [[Near East]] (''[[Sumer]]ia'', ''[[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]'', ''[[Babylonia]]'', ''[[Assyria]]'', ''[[Judea]]'' and ''[[Persian Empire|Persia]]''). Book two is "''[[India]]'' and Her Neighbors." Book three moves deeper into the east, where the ''[[History of China|Chinese Civilization]]'' flourishes and ''[[History of Japan|Japan]]'' starts to find its place in the world's political map.

===Other works===
[[File:DeclarationofInterdependence.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A copy of the Durant Declaration of INTERdependence]]
On April 8, 1944, Durant was approached by two leaders of the Jewish and Christian faiths, [[Meyer David]] and [[Christian Richard]] about starting "a movement, to raise moral standards." He suggested instead that they start a movement against racial [[Racism|intolerance]] and outlined his ideas for a "[[Declaration of Interdependence]]". The movement for the declaration, Declaration of INTERdependence, Inc., was launched at a gala dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] on March 22, 1945, attended by over 400 people including [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Bette Davis]].&lt;ref name="Interdependence"&gt;{{Citation |title=Interdependence |url = http://www.willdurant.com/interdependence.htm |publisher=Will Durant Foundation |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310225853/http://www.willdurant.com/interdependence.htm |archivedate = March 10, 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was read into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' on October 1, 1945, by [[Ellis E.

Throughout his career, Durant made several speeches, including "Persia in the History of Civilization", which was presented as an address before the [[Iran-America Society]] in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], on April 21, 1948 and had been intended for inclusion in the ''Bulletin of the Asia Institute'' (formerly, ''Bulletin of the American Institute for Persian'', then ''Iranian, Art and Archaeology''), Vol. VII, no. 2, which never saw publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Durant|first=Will|title=Persia in the History of Civilization|url=http://www.mazdapublisher.com/Documents/Persian%20Civilization.pdf|work=Addressing Iran-America Society|format=[[Portable document format|PDF]]|publisher=Mazda Publishers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723072146/http://www.mazdapublisher.com/Documents/Persian%20Civilization.pdf|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rousseau and Revolution'' was followed by a slender volume of observations called ''[[The Lessons of History]]'', which was both a synopsis of the series as well as analysis.

Though Ariel and Will had intended to carry the work on ''The Story of Civilisation'' into the 20th century, at their now very advanced age they expected the 10th volume to be their last. However, they went on to publish a final volume, their 11th, ''The Age of Napoleon'' in 1975. They also left behind notes for a 12th volume, ''The Age of Darwin'', and an outline for a 13th, ''The Age of Einstein'', which would have taken ''The Story of Civilization'' to 1945.

Three posthumous works by Durant have been published in recent years, ''The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time'' (2002), ''Heroes of History: A Brief History of Civilization from Ancient Times to the Dawn of the Modern Age'' (2001), and ''Fallen Leaves'' (2014).

====Final years====
The Durants also shared an intense love for one another as explained in their ''Dual Autobiography''.  After Will entered the hospital, Ariel stopped eating, and died on October 25, 1981. Though their daughter, Ethel, and grandchildren strove to keep Ariel's death from the ailing Will, he learned of it on the evening news, and died two weeks later, at the age of 96, on November 7, 1981. Will was buried beside Ariel in [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]], in Los Angeles.

===Writing about Russia===
In 1933, he published ''Tragedy of Russia: Impressions from a Brief Visit'' and soon afterward ''The Lesson of Russia''.  A few years after the books were published, social commentator [[Will Rogers]] had read them and described a symposium he had attended that included Durant as one of the contributors. He later wrote of Durant, "He is just about our best writer on Russia. He is the most fearless writer that has been there. He tells you just what it's like. He makes a mighty fine talk. One of the most interesting lecturers we have, and a fine fellow."&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;

===Writing about India===
In 1930, he published ''The Case for India'' while he was on a visit to India as part of collecting data for ''The Story of Civilization''. He was so taken aback by the devastating poverty and starvation he saw as a result of British imperial policy in India that he took time off from his stated goal and instead concentrated on his polemic fiercely advocating Indian independence.

==Legacy==
Durant fought for equal wages, [[women's suffrage]] and fairer working conditions for the American labor force. Durant not only wrote on many topics but also put his ideas into effect. Durant, it has been said widely, attempted to bring philosophy to the common man.

He was trying to improve understanding of viewpoints of human beings and to have others forgive foibles and human waywardness. He chided the comfortable insularity of what is now known as [[Eurocentrism]] by pointing out in ''Our Oriental Heritage'' that Europe was only "a jagged promontory of Asia". He complained of "the provincialism of our traditional histories which began with [[Greece]] and summed up Asia in a line" and said they showed "a possibly fatal error of perspective and intelligence".

=== On decline and rebuilding of civilizations===
Much like [[Oswald Spengler]], he saw the decline of a civilization as a culmination of strife between religion and secular intellectualism, thus toppling the precarious institutions of convention and morality:
{{Quote | Hence a certain tension between religion and society marks the higher stages of every civilization. Religion begins by offering magical aid to harassed and bewildered men; it culminates by giving to a people that unity of morals and belief which seems so favorable to statesmanship and art; it ends by fighting suicidally in the lost cause of the past. For as knowledge grows or alters continually, it clashes with mythology and theology, which change with geological leisureliness. Priestly control of arts and letters is then felt as a galling shackle or hateful barrier, and intellectual history takes on the character of a "conflict between science and religion." Institutions which were at first in the hands of the clergy, like law and punishment, education and morals, marriage and divorce, tend to escape from ecclesiastical control, and become secular, perhaps profane. The intellectual classes abandon the ancient theology and—after some hesitation—the moral code allied with it; literature and philosophy become anticlerical. The movement of liberation rises to an exuberant worship of reason, and falls to a paralyzing disillusionment with every dogma and every idea. Conduct, deprived of its religious supports, deteriorates into [[epicurean]] chaos; and life itself, shorn of consoling faith, becomes a burden alike to conscious poverty and to weary wealth. In the end a society and its religion tend to fall together, like body and soul, in a harmonious death. Meanwhile among the oppressed another myth arises, gives new form to human hope, new courage to human effort, and after centuries of chaos builds another civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of Civilization'', Vol. 1, p. 71. See also this article's Discussion page.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
     
More than twenty years after his death, a quote from Durant, "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself within"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = The Story of Civilization |volume = 3 Caesar And Christ |chapter= Epilogue—Why Rome fell |quote = A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself within. The essential causes of Rome's decline lay in her people, her morals, her class struggle, her failing trade, her [[bureaucratic despotism]], her stifling taxes, her consuming wars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared as the opening graphic of [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2006 film ''[[Apocalypto]]''. Durant also served as the history consultant for [[Anthony Mann]]'s 1964 film ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. The narration at the beginning and the end of the film is taken almost directly from Durant's work ''Caesar and Christ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History, Ancient and Modern, in The Fall of the Roman Empire|last=Ward|first=Allen M.|work=The Fall of the Roman Empire: Film and History|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Winkler|editor-first=Martin M.|location=Chichester|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On religion and evolution===
In an article in 1927, he wrote his thoughts about reconciling religion and [[Darwinism]]:
{{Quote | As to harmonizing the theory of evolution with the [[Biblical account of creation]], I do not believe it can be done, and I do not see why it should be. The story of Genesis is beautiful, and profoundly significant as symbolism: there is no good reason to torture it into conformity with modern theory.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''Popular Science'', October 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On history and Bible===
In ''Our Oriental Heritage,'' Durant wrote:
{{Quote | The discoveries here summarized have restored considerable credit to those chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] that record the early traditions of the Jews. In its outlines, and barring supernatural incidents, the story of the Jews as unfolded in the [[Old Testament]] has stood the test of criticism and archeology; every year adds corroboration from documents, monuments, or excavations.... We must accept the Biblical account provisionally until it is disproved.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''Our Oriental Heritage'', 1963, MJF Books; p. 300 (footnote).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
