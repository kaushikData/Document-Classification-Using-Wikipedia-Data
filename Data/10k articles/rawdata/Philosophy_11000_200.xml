'''Achievement Ideology''' is the belief that one reaches a socially perceived definition of success through hard work and education.  In this view, factors such as [[gender]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], economic background, [[social networks]], or neighborhoods/geography are secondary to hard work and education or are altogether irrelevant in the pursuit of success.

==Contemporary analysis==
In 2002, Sandra L. Barnes,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Sandra L.  "Achievement or Ascription Ideology?: An Analysis of Attitudes about Future Success for Residents in Poor Urban Neighborhoods."  Sociological Focus.  35.2 (2002): 207-225.&lt;/ref&gt; offered that people who believe in the American achievement ideology most likely blame [[underachievement]] on attitudinal or moral differences among individuals.  For those who disagree with the achievement ideology, this difference in attitude is most likely the result of an oppositional response to negative institutional and structural forces.  In her study, Barnes found that those who most benefit from achievement ideology (white males in higher class neighborhoods, for example) are most likely to espouse the achievement ideology.  For example, African Americans are more likely than whites to believe that race is an ascribed trait that helps some achieve success more easily than others, and those with higher incomes are more likely to claim that having a strong social network is an unimportant factor for success.  All respondent groups, however, believe that education and hard work are most important for success, proving that achievement ideology is alive and well.  Ultimately, Barnes argues that success is best reached when one has an achievement-oriented attitude coupled with the actual ability to accomplish one's goals.  While most people might have the proper attitude, structural factors can keep them from achieving.

Donna Y. Ford&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Donna Y. and J. John Harris, III.  "The American Achievement Ideology and Achievement Differentials among Preadolescent Gifted and Nongifted African American Males and Females."  Journal of Negro Education.  61.1 (1992): 45-64.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to discover the differences in [[ideologies]] between male and female and [[gifted]] and nongifted African American students.  Ford describes four [[theories]] related to achievement ideology – need achievement, text anxiety, social learning and attribution theories:

===Need achievement theory===
Social scientists who advocate this theory believe that one's achievement is a product of the motivation to succeed times the motivation to avoid failure.  This means that individuals weigh their expectancy of success with the value they place on that success, or, how well an individual thinks s/he can do and how much doing well actually matters.

===Test anxiety theory===
As with need achievement theory, social scientists who support test [[anxiety]] theory look to how a student evaluates her/his ability to succeed.  Students who are preoccupied with the outcome of their performance, who fear failure or humiliation if they do not perform well, might not perform well because this anxiety stifles their performance.

===Social learning theory===
In this theory, students are [[socialized]] from an early age and hold different expectations or values based on their own experience or social situation.  According to this theory, students who are raised in an atmosphere of underachievement, who often see previous generations and family members not succeed, will most likely internalize these values and perceive their own success as unlikely.

===Attribution theory===
This theory explains a lack of motivation in students as a result of the students' belief in achievement ideology.  When students attribute their own failure to a lack of ability, they consequently are less likely to expect to do well.  If a student fully believes in the achievement ideology, failure can only be a result of lack of ability or lack of effort.

Ford claims that, while these four theories may explain underachievement in some students, they only focus on students' lack of motivation to achieve and do not consider a student's failure despite her/his desire to achieve.  She describes this as the "paradox of underachievement," a discrepancy between a student's ideology and their actual achievement (i.e., when students do not do well in school despite their support of the achievement ideology).  In her study, the majority of both gifted and nongifted African American students claimed that school is "very important."  The majority of male and female African American students alike responded that school was important or very important.  If this is true that most students are, in fact, motivated and view school as important for success, a student's failure must be explained by some other [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]—most likely ascribed variables like race/ethnicity, gender, and so on.

==Effects in the workplace==
Belief in the American achievement ideology causes employers to look to an individual's educational success as the key factor in hiring potential employees because achievement ideology perpetuates the notion that those who have succeeded educationally are the most hard working.  In ''Education and Jobs'', Ivar Berg writes, "The increase in educational requirements for middle-level jobs…may thus be taking place at some cost to a society that has historically prided itself on its mobility opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Ivar.  Education and Jobs.  New York: Praeger, 1970.  59.&lt;/ref&gt;  This process causes America's education system to act more like a "licensing agency"&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Ivar.  Education and Jobs.  New York: Praeger, 1970.  60.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than promoting education for education's sake.  This, in turn, causes many employees to be [[overqualified]] for their jobs.

When jobs gradually require higher and higher educational attainment as a prerequisite, the effort put into achieving these prerequisites (or, the effort put into school) does not equal the needed effort or skill at one's job.  Thus, workers' endorsement of achievement ideology decreases each year that s/he remains in a particular job for which s/he is overqualified.&lt;ref&gt;Vaisey, Stephen.  "Education and Its Discontents: Overqualification in America, 1972-2002."  Social Forces.  85.2 (2006): 835-864.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, employees begin to see the effort they put forth in school as unnecessary.

==Reasons for endorsing or rejecting achievement ideology==
Jay MacLeod studied two groups of boys and young men who lived in a low-income neighborhood for his book, ''Ain't No Makin' It''.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Jay.  Ain't No Makin' It.  Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Hallway Hangers," a group of mostly white boys, did not endorse meritocracy, the American achievement ideology.  MacLeod found that their skepticism was a result of several factors.  First, although the Hallway Hangers' parents wanted their children to do well, they knew from their own experience that encouraging high aspirations would only set them up for failure and disappointment.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Jay.  Ain't No Makin' It.  Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, Inc., 2004.  114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both parents and children were affected by the environment of underachievement.  

The Hallway Hangers and their parents rejected the achievement ideology because they did not see job success through hard work to be a likely outcome in their situation, a situation in which few family members ever succeeded financially, where job opportunities were few and where hard work in school rarely influenced employability.  Moreover, if the Hallway Hangers were to accept the achievement ideology, this would logically entail the belief that their parents had not succeeded financially because they were lazy or unintelligent. The Hallway Hangers knew this was not true.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Jay.  Ain't No Makin' It.  Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, Inc., 2004.  128-129&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, though the caucasian Hallway Hangers understood that the achievement ideology was false in their case, they were not able to understand that it was equally false in the case of African Americans.  The Hallway Hangers were kept from this understanding by their belief in another powerful American ideology, that of racism and the intellectual inferiority of Blacks.  Whereas the Hallway Hangers recognized that they failed to succeed financially because of their position in the lower class, they could not see that class exploitation was also responsible for the financial failure of African Americans.  In addition to attributing inferiority to African Americans, the Hallway Hangers also scapegoated them, blaming them for taking all of the jobs that they, as white, believed they deserved.

MacLeod's analysis is completed by the analysis of a second group that called itself "The Brothers".  Composed of African-American young men, The Brothers lived in the same housing project as the Hallway Hangers.  They, however, did endorse meritocracy, the American ideology of achievement.  The Brothers understood the racial situation in America to have been vastly improved since the time of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Jay.  Ain't No Makin' It.  Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, Inc., 2004.  129.&lt;/ref&gt; This led them to the belief that each generation of Blacks had worked harder than the last:  if they did the same, they would be able to do well in school and succeed in the workforce.  Though The Brothers lived in the same [[housing project]], they had done so for far less time than the Hallway Hangers:  some of their families had resided in "Clarendon Heights" for three generations.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, Jay.  Ain't No Makin' It.  Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, Inc., 2004.  130.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of The Brothers had moved to the housing project from far worse situations and even poorer neighborhoods.  Their recent arrival caused them to think that they were upwardly mobile. Due to their optimism, they were much more likely than the Hallway Hangers to find viable employment after school.  Their belief in meritocracy, and their hard work in school, allowed them to overcome the racism and class structures that defeated their aspirations in the outside world.  The Brothers knew that the Hallway Hangers' ideology of racial inferiority was false, and they were themselves saved by the ideology to which the Hallway Hangers were immune, that of meritocracy, equal opportunity for all.

In [[structural semantics]], the '''actantial model''', also called the '''actantial narrative schema''', is a tool used to analyze the [[Action (fiction)|action]] that takes place in a [[storytelling|story]], whether real or fictional.&lt;ref name="HerbertOrig"&gt;Herbert 2006 ''Tools'', Ch.5, ''Origins and function''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HerbertActantial"&gt;Herbert 2006 ''Actantial''&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in 1966 by [[semiotician]] [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Greimas, Algirdas Julien]] [1966] ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greimas (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

The model considers an action as divided into six facets, called [[actant]]s.&lt;ref name="HerbertOrig"/&gt; Those actants are a combined framework inspired mainly between [[Vladimir Propp]]'s and [[Étienne Souriau]]'s actantial theories.&lt;ref&gt;Venancio, Rafael Duarte Oliveira, Narrative between Action and Transformation: A. J. Greimas' Narratological Models (December 3, 2016). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2879907&lt;/ref&gt;

Greimas took the term ''actant'' from linguist [[Lucien Tesnière]], which coined in his discussion of the grammar of [[noun phrases]].&lt;ref&gt;David Herman, Manfred Jahn, Marie-Laure Ryan (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWNnBndF9uEC&amp;pg=PA574 ''Routledge encyclopedia of narrative theory''], p. 574&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anathon August Fredrik Aall''' (15 August 1867 – 9 January 1943) was a Norwegian academic, philosopher and psychologist. Originally educated as a [[theology|theologian]], he became a professor of [[philosophy]] at [[University of Oslo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =     http://runeberg.org/ink/1/0017.html|title=  Aall, Anathon|publisher= Illustreret norsk konversationsleksikon|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
He was born at [[Nesseby]] in [[Finnmark]], Norway. He was a son of vicar Niels Anton Aall (1833–1896) and his wife Mathilde Susanne Dahl (1842–1910).  His grandfather, Hans Cato Aall (1807-1862), was a Member of Parliament and mayor of [[Hammerfest]]. He was also a great-great-great-grandson of [[Nicolai Benjamin Aall]], and a great-great-grandnephew of [[Niels Aall|Niels]], [[Jørgen Aall|Jørgen]] and [[Jacob Aall]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Aall|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|first=Terje|last=Bratberg|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Aall|language=Norwegian|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the brother of jurist and Fascist politician  Herman Harris Aall (1871-1957).
His sister  Marna Aall (1873–1948) was married to philosopher [[Kristian Birch-Reichenwald Aars]] from 1895 to 1910. Anathon Aall biographed Aars in the first volume of the first edition of the [[biographical dictionary]] ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Career==
Aall's family moved a lot during his early years, since his father was a parish priest. Aall [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in [[Stavanger]] in 1886, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now University of Oslo) with the degree [[cand.theol.]] in 1892. From 1893 to 1897 he undertook [[religious studies]] in four European countries. In 1897 he applied for a position as professor of church history at the Royal Frederick University, but he was rejected as the assessment committee found that he was "deviating from the faith of our [[Church of Norway|Church]]", and hence was "unfit" to lecture for priestly candidates.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

After this he studied [[philosophy]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[experimental psychology]] in [[Germany]]. He was elected as a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] already in 1898. He published several works, including the 1903 [[thesis]] ''Über die Wirkung der Wiederholung eines Elementes bei gleichzeitiger Vorführung mehrerer Schriftzeichen''. He worked as a lecturer at the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] from 1904 to 1908. He was appointed as a professor of philosophy at the Royal Frederick University in 1908. In addition to researching philosophy, he published works on the [[history of ideas]], and also helped create the Department of Philosophy, which he led until his retirement in 1937. He was the [[dean (academic)|dean]] of the Faculty of Humanities from 1918 to 1921, and a [[visiting scholar]] at the [[Columbia University]] from 1924 to 1925. Aall was also involved in [[Temperance movement|temperance]] work, as well as promoting international peace.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =     http://runeberg.org/nfcn/0216.html|title=  Anathon August Fredrik|publisher= Nordisk familjebok
|accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
From 1899 he was married to Cathrine Antonie Langaard (1863–1926),  a daughter of businessman [[Conrad Langaard]]. In October 1928 he married [[Austria]]n citizen Lily Weiser (1898–1987), an [[ethnologist]]. He died in January 1943 in [[Lunner]]. 
Anathon Aall was the grandfather of  Norwegian psychologist [[Lisbeth F.K. Holter Brudal]]. His private correspondence and notes are kept by the [[National Library of Norway]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =      https://nbl.snl.no/Lily_Weiser_Aall|title=  Lily Weiser Aall|publisher= Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=Reimund Kvideland |accessdate= February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Bentley]] was a younger contemporary of [[Isaac Newton]]. After Newton had formulated his law of gravitation, he observed, in a letter to Richard Bentley, that if all the stars are drawn to each other by gravitation, they should collapse into a single point. One will be drawn to another; that star will grow and pull in still more and more. In time, everything must be drawn in. "According to Newton, each star in the universe ought to be attracted towards every other star. They should not remain motionless, at a constant distance from each other, but should all fall together to some central point. Newton admitted as much in a letter to Richard Bentley, a leading Cambridge philosopher of the time."&lt;ref&gt;"This Month in Physics History - Einstein's Biggest Blunder", APS News, Vol. 14, Nr. 7, July 2005, [http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200507/history.cfm online]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton solved the paradox by claiming that God prevented the collapse by making "constant minute corrections". Though Newton's explanation was rather unsatisfactory from a cosmological aspect, Bentley's paradox could prove to be the reason behind the "[[Big Crunch]]", the opposite phenomenon of the "[[Big Bang]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Charity''' is an English feminine given name derived from the English word ''[[charity (virtue)|charity]]''. It was used by the [[Puritans]] as a [[virtue name]]. An earlier form of the name, Caritas, was an early Christian name in use by Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Campbell |url=http://www.behindthename.com/name/charity |title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Charity |publisher=Behind the Name |date= |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity is also the usual English form of the name of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Saint Charity]], an early Christian child martyr, who was tortured to death with her sisters Faith and Hope. She is known as Agape in [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] and as Caritas in [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Church Latin]] and her name is translated differently in other languages.

Faith, Hope and Charity, the [[theological virtues|three theological virtues]], are names traditionally given to [[Multiple birth|triplet]] girls, just as Faith and Hope remain common names for [[twin]] girls. One example were the American triplets Faith, Hope and Charity Cardwell, who were born in 1899 in [[Texas]] and were recognized in 1994 by the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the world's longest lived triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe |first=Sam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/07/garden/at-home-with-faith-hope-and-charity-285-years-young.html |title=AT HOME WITH - Faith, Hope and Charity - 285 Years Young |location=Sweetwater (Tex) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1994-07-07 |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charity has never been as popular a name in the [[United States]] as [[Faith (given name)|Faith]] or [[Hope (given name)|Hope]]. It ranked in the top 500 names for American girls between 1880 and 1898 and in the top 1,000 between 1880 and 1927, when it disappeared from the top 1,000 names until it reemerged among the top 1,000 names in 1968 at No. 968. It was most popular between 1973 and 1986, when it ranked among the top 300 names in the United States. It has since declined in popularity and was ranked at No. 852 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=2015-02-12 |accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claudio Canaparo''' is a Visiting Professor in Latin American Studies at [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ Birkbeck College] in London. He has written as a [[literary criticism|literary critic]], [[epistemology|epistemologist]], [[sociology of culture]] analyst and [[philosophy|philosopher]].

==Education and career==

Canaparo was born in the city port of Campana, Argentina, to a mother of Hebrew origins and an Italian rooted father; he was a traveller, manual worker and scientific researcher before entering academia. He studied at the Faculty of Political Science at the [[National University of Rosario|University of Rosario]], at the [http://www.flacso.org/ Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLACSO)] in Buenos Aires, at the DAMS [[:it:Discipline delle Arti, della Musica e dello Spettacolo/(Discipline)|(delle arti, della musica e dello spettacolo)]] at the [http://www.unibo.it/Portale/default.htm/ Università degli Studi di Bologna], and received his Ph.D. under the supervision of William Rowe at [[King's College London]] in 2000.

Prevented from working in Europe as a philosopher or social scientist, he developed most of his projects in academia as a “Latin American specialist”. He joined the [http://www.ex.ac.uk/ Faculty of Arts at Exeter University] in 1995 where in 2004 he created the Centre for Latin American Studies. In 2009 he was appointed Visiting Professor at [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/ Birkbeck College]. He is also Associated Researcher at the [http://www.uclouvain.be/ Université Catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium].

In 2012 he started to supervise and teach within the postgraduate program from the [http://www.unaq.ar/ Universidad Nacional de Quilmes] and from [http://www.uba.edu.ar/ Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires], both in Argentina. In the same year he developed a project of teaching basic philosophy to 8–10 years old children from ‘Arc-en-Ciel’ public school of Feugarolles in France. In 2014 he started to work within a multinational team of researchers and ONGs in a multidisciplinary project about climate change in relation with colonialism and geo-epistemology. In 2015 he started also to teach philosophy at the Lycée Stendhal (Aiguillon) and at the Lycée George Sand (Nérac), both in France.

==Themes and related subjects==


'''A.''' The principal effort of his work goes to establish the relation between knowledge and conceptual evolution, mainly focused on theories and related concepts about space with peripheral areas of the planet or, more precisely, having the peripheral spaces of the planet as its main intellectual frame. Themes of his works also include sociology of knowledge (Muerte y transfiguración de la cultura rioplatense, 2005), epistemology and colonialism, authorship theory (The Manufacture of an Author, 2000; El mundo Ingaramo, 2015), and science and writing.

'''Ciencia y escritura (2003)'''
The book discusses how the activity of writing determines the notion of knowledge which supports the ‘ideology’ of scientificity. Further more, the book explores how, when and why, the laboratory becomes the center of legitimization of modern science. To illustrate the argument, specific as well as generic leading cases, were explored. An article discussing the so-called ‘two-slit experiment’ is the first leading case, and an exhaustive analysis of the journal Nature constitutes the second leading case.

'''Geo-epistemology (2009)'''
The idea that we cannot establish a critical way of thinking, at least within peripheral areas of the planet, without having a standing in biosphere terms is the main hypothesis of this book. This work attempts to show how to proceed under these premises.

'''La emancipación intelectual (2010-2011) (unpublished)'''
A tetralogy about Latin America, which concentrates in the conceptual consequences of language, knowledge, colonialism and what the author calls post-territoriality. This work also this work develops the idea of a second degree of colonialism, which refers to a number of objects, domains and concepts -highly productive in terms of knowledge and understanding- where colonialism is not usually analyzed. The first volume of these analyses on contemporary colonialism within peripheral places, from the point of view of knowledge and diaspora, is entitled ‘Viaje en Egipto. La formulación espacial del colonialismo y sus consecuencias’ [Travel within Egypt. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its consequences]. The second volume, entitled ‘El pensamiento del ojo en las colonias. La formulación espacial del colonialismo y sus visiones’ [The eye’s thought. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its visions], focus on visual perception and visual developments as a way of dominant cogito in peripheral areas. The third volume, entitled ‘El autor periférico. La formulación espacial del colonialismo y sus identidades’ [The peripheral author. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its identities], focus on the constitution of a parallel phenomenon: the constitution of the notion of self and the constitution of a narrative entity usually called authorship. Finally, the fourth volume, entitled ‘La negociación del espacio y los sentimientos bajo el colonialism’ [The negotiation of space and feelings under the colonialism], focus on the way the constitution of a sentimental life within individuals in peripheral areas of the planet is dominated by technological set-ups referred to a number of activities, from writing to learning, and from eating to building houses.

'''El imaginario Patagonia (2011)'''
How the relation between biosphere spaces and conceptual evolution works, within peripheral areas of the planet, is the main topic of this book. To explore the argument an exhaustive and length argumentation concerning Patagonia has been established as the leading case.


'''B.''' The notion of ‘pensamiento periférico’ emerges as a way to develop the ‘reversal thinking’ and proposed as a first approximation to the geo-epistemology approach,. Developed in a four-volumes series between 2015 and 2018 it has one volume dedicated to the relation of peripheral ‘pensamiento’ with the European philosophy and its history; a second volume which attempts to establish a general conceptual framework, a third volume revisiting the notion of anthropology and nature, and a final volume which explores a leading case focusing on the idea of ‘disposal, trash, rubbish, dust’ (basura, residuo) as an epistemic and anthropological problem. 

'''La cuestión periférica (forthcoming)'''
How, when and under which format the ways of thinking in peripheral areas of the planet have been colonized not only by European philosophy but mainly by the way in which such philosophy has been studied, developed and historiographisized, even locally: such questions are conceptually addressed in this book and constitute its main purpose.

'''El mundo de atrás (2018)'''
The book develops the main conceptual frame under which the ‘pensamiento’ as a way to combine a thought about ‘things’ (bodies, apparatuses, objects, mechanisms), technology and a biosphere dimension can be established in peripheral areas of the planet.

'''El fin de la naturaleza (forthcoming)'''
What is the relation between the anthropological concept of human, within peripheral areas of the planet, and a notion of nature is the main question of this book. The increasing relevance of the non-human in the definition of human is one of the phenomena explored within the arguments, as well as the radical change of the idea of ‘viviente’ (living thing).

'''El pensamiento basura (2017)'''
How the ‘basura’ (trash, disposals, rubbish) becomes a central component of our daily life is as important as its consequences in material and non-material terms. From this starting point the book explores what and in which way the ‘basura’ determines our way of thinking, our individuality, as well as our material existence in peripheral areas of the planet.

==Personal life==

In 2012, after been successively leaving in Rimini, Bologna, London, Exeter and Brussels, he moved to the countryside in South of France, where he started to rebuild a 12th-century property together with his partner and their three daughters. In March 2013 at the local French pool he postulated as candidate to the commune’s Council of the nearest [[:fr:Feugarolles|village of Feugarolles]], where was elected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7058">In [[linguistics]], '''crossover effects''' are restrictions on possible [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]] or [[coreference]] found between certain [[phrase]]s and [[pronoun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The crossover phenomenon was first explored in detail by Postal (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; Coreference (or coindexation) that is normal and natural when a pronoun follows its antecedent becomes impossible, or at best just marginally possible, when "crossover" is deemed to have occurred, e.g. ''?Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; do his&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; friends admire __&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;?'' The term itself refers to the traditional transformational analysis of sentences containing leftward [[syntactic movement|movement]] (e.g. [[wh-movement]], [[topicalization]]), whereby it appears as though the fronted constituent crosses over the expression (usually a pronoun) with which it is coindexed on its way to the front of the clause. Crossover effects are divided into strong crossover ('''SCO''') and weak crossover ('''WCO''').&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between strong and weak crossover is due to Wasow (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon occurs in English and related languages, and it may be present in all natural languages that allow fronting.

==Examples==
The following sentences illustrate crossover phenomena. The a-sentences are questions in which crossover has not occurred and are given here for the sake of comparison, and the b-sentences illustrate crossover. The subscripts mark coindexation (≈coreference); they indicate that the words bearing the subscripts are supposed to refer to the same one person. The gaps in the b-sentences mark the canonical position of the wh-expression (before movement):

::a. '''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' said '''he&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' was hungry? &lt;small&gt;– Crossover absent, intentional coreferential reading available&lt;/small&gt;
::b. *'''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did '''he&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' say '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' was hungry. &lt;small&gt;– Crossover present (strong), intentional coreferential reading unavailable&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did you say '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' likes '''his&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' parents? &lt;small&gt; – Crossover absent, intentional coreferential reading available&lt;/small&gt;
::b. ?'''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did you say '''she&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' likes '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''? &lt;small&gt;– Crossover present (strong), intentional coreferential reading unavailable&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' will call '''his&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' mother? &lt;small&gt;– Crossover absent, coreferential reading available&lt;/small&gt;
::b. ?'''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' will '''his&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' mother call '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''? &lt;small&gt;– Crossover present (weak), coreferential reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::a. '''Which student&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' called '''her&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' instructor? &lt;small&gt;– Crossover absent, coreferential reading available&lt;/small&gt;  
::b. ?'''Which student&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did '''her&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' instructor call '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' &lt;small&gt;- Crossover present (weak), coreferential reading unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

The acceptability contrast here is curious upon first analysis. In both the a- and b-sentences, the order of the wh-expression and the coindexed pronoun is the same, the wh-expression preceding the pronoun. But only the reading indicated with the a-sentences is (fully) possible. The relevant difference is that in the b-sentences, the wh-expression appears to have been moved across the pronoun on its way to the front of the sentence, whereas there is no such crossover in the a-sentences.

==Strong and weak crossover==
As just indicated by the examples, there are two types of crossover, strong and weak. The following two sections consider each of these types.

===Strong crossover===
Strong crossover occurs when the pronoun is in an argument position, i.e. it is an argument of the relevant verb. This means that it is not contained inside a noun phrase. Instances of strong crossover are clearly impossible, that is, the coreferential reading is strongly unavailable, e.g.

::a. *'''Which politician&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did '''she&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' say that they should vote for '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''? &lt;small&gt;– Strong crossover, intentional coreferential reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

::b. *'''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' do you think '''he&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' trusts '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''? &lt;small&gt;– Strong crossover, intentional coreferential reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

::c. *'''Which man&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did '''he&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' promise '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' would get a promotion? – &lt;small&gt;Strong crossover, intentional coreferential reading impossible&lt;/small&gt;

While these sentences are actually grammatical, the reading indicated by the subscripts is robustly unavailable. For instance, the first sentence (sentence a) cannot be interpreted to mean that Susan told them to vote for herself (i.e. Susan).

===Weak crossover===

Crossover is "weak" when the coreferential reading is marginal, that is, when the coreferential reading is not clearly unacceptable, but rather just quite unlikely. Typical cases of weak crossover occur when the expression that has been "crossed over" is a possessor inside a noun phrase, e.g.

::a. ?'''Which players&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' does '''their&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' coach distrust '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''? &lt;small&gt;– Weak crossover, indicated reading possible, but unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::b. ?'''Which beer&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' does '''its&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' brewer never advertise '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''? &lt;small&gt;– Weak crossover, indicated reading possible, but unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

::c. ?'''Who&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' do '''her&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' parents worship '''__&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''?  &lt;small&gt;– Weak crossover, indicated reading possible, but unlikely&lt;/small&gt;

The pronoun that has been crossed over in each of these examples is embedded inside a noun phrase. For some reason that has to do with binding possibilities, such cases of crossover are not impossible, but rather just unlikely. In other words, the coreferential reading can actually occur. Semantics and pragmatics seems to play a major role determining the likelihood of this reading.

==Comments==
Crossover is a particular manifestation of [[Binding (linguistics)|binding]], which is one of the most explored and discussed areas of theoretical syntax. The factors that determine when the coreferential reading is possible have been extensively debated. Simple linear order plays a role, but the other key factor might be [[c-command]] as associated (primarily) with [[government and binding]], or it might be o-command as associated with [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]]. Weak crossover is also interesting with respect to how it interacts with [[parasitic gap]]s. A parasitic gap can obviate what would otherwise be an occurrence of weak crossover.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5139">'''David de Rodon''' or plain '''Derodon''' (c. 1600 &amp;ndash; 1664), was a French Calvinist theologian and philosopher.
Derodon was born at [[Die, Drôme|Die]], in the Dauphiné. He had the reputation of being one of the most eminent logicians of his time. His knowledge of philosophy was both extensive and profound. He taught philosophy at Orange, at Nismes, and at Geneva. He inclined to the doctrines of Gassendi rather than to those of the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian philosophy]]. He had frequent discussions with the followers of Descartes. He kept up a close correspondence with many learned men of his time, particularly with [[Galileo]] and Descartes.

We find from his writings, that he admitted the truth of Aristotle's general principles, and made them the foundation of his public lectures on philosophy. Matter and form, the different principles of causation, the division of the soul into the vegetable, the sensitive, and the rational, may all be found in the speculations of Derodon. His great delight lay, however, in argumentation. His agreement with any system was only conditional and formal; he always had innumerable objections to every thing he seemed to acquiesce in. Hence his contention with the predicaments of Aristotle; his attempted refutation of the term universal; and the contrasts he instituted between the whole system of the Stagirite, and the philosophical opinions of Plato, Democritus, Epicurus, and many other distinguished men of antiquity.

Derodon took great delight in discussions on the nature of ''genus'' and ''species'', and on those curious and puzzling questions which go under the name of the ''Cross of Logicians''. The following are some of the debatable points. "The term genus cannot be defined, for the definition must necessarily involve the thing to be defined. Genus is an individual, for it is numerically ''one''. Genus is a species; but species is not a genus; therefore, species is more general than genus."

Derodon enters into long discussions on the nature of being, and the peculiar province of reason. His writings are both ill-arranged and obscure. In the course of his disquisitions on these points, we find the author zealously attached to the old maxim, ''that there is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the senses''. This he considers as a fundamental principle in all rational systems of speculative philosophy.

His metaphysics were, however, of a scholastic nature, and present a curious compound from the speculations of the Arabian philosophers, the early Scholastic divines, and some of the writers among the Dominicans of Spain.

He wrote a considerable number of works against the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, which had a wide circulation, and were translated into several foreign languages. Among them were ''Quatre raisons pour lesquelles on doit quitter la R. P. R.'' (Paris, 1631); ''Quatre raisons qui traitent de l'eucharistie, du purgatoire, du péché originel et de la prédestination'' (1662), and ''Le Tombeau de la Messe'' (Geneva, 1654), a translation of which was issued at London in 1673, with this rather premature title, ''The Funeral of the Mass, or the Mass Dead and Buried without Hope of Resurrection.'' The latter book was burned on March 6, 1063, by the public executioner, the author exiled, and the bookseller sentenced to a fine of 1000 livres, the loss of his license, and ten years exile. This last work procured his banishment from France, upon which he withdrew to Geneva.

He is also the author of several works on philosophical subjects, and against the atheists amongst which may be mentioned, ''Dispute de la Messe'', ''La Lumière de la raison opposée aux ténèbres de l'impiété'', ''De Existentia Dei'', ''Logica Restituta''. His complete works were collected into two volumes, and published soon after his death (''Derodonis Opera Omnia'', Geneva, 1664 and 1669, 2 vols.; the first volume contains the philosophical, and the second the theological writings).

He died at Geneva in 1664.

Pearce's ideas inspired an abolitionist school of transhumanism, or "hedonistic transhumanism", based on his idea of "paradise engineering" and his argument that the abolition of suffering—which he calls the "abolitionist project"—is a moral imperative.&lt;ref name=Thweatt-Bates2016pp50-51&gt;Thweatt-Bates, Jeanine (2016).

Strip away our ingrained anthropocentric bias, and what we do to other sentient beings is barbaric. Combating great evil justifies heroic personal sacrifice; going vegan entails mild personal inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">'''Didymus the Musician''' was a [[music]] theorist in [[Rome]] of the end of the 1st century BC or beginning of the 1st century AD, who combined elements of earlier theoretical approaches with an appreciation of the aspect of performance. Formerly assumed to be identical with the Alexandrian grammarian and lexicographer [[Didymus Chalcenterus]], because Ptolemy and Porphyry referred to him as Didymus ''ho mousikos'' (the musician), classical scholars now believe that this Didymus was a younger grammarian and musician working in Rome at the time of [[Nero]] (Richter 2001). According to Andrew Barker (1994, {{Page needed|date=January 2011}}), his intention was to revive and produce contemporary performances of the music of Greek antiquity. The [[syntonic comma]] of 81/80 is sometimes called the ''comma of Didymus'' after him (Richter 2001). 

Among his works was ''On the Difference between the [[Aristoxenus|Aristoxenians]] and the Pythagoreans'' (Περὶ τῆς διαφορᾶς τῶν Ἀριστοξενείων τε καὶ Πυθαγορείων).

[[File:GMB, EFA, MAS.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Fenech Adami]], Giuseppe Mifsud Bonnici and Mark A. Sammut, in December 2008]]

'''Giuseppe Mifsud Bonnici''' (born 1930) is a Maltese retired [[Chief Justice]], and minor [[philosopher]]. He mostly specialised in the [[philosophy of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Mifsud Bonnici was born in [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]], on July 17, 1930. He began his studies at the [[University of Malta]] from where, in 1958, he became [[Doctor of law#Malta|Doctor of Law]]. Before that, in 1955, he was [[Malta]]’s [[chess]] champion. After graduating as a [[lawyer]], he continued his studies in [[Rome]] at the Gregorio del Vecchio Institute of the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. He began teaching [[philosophy of law]] at the [[University of Malta]] in 1966, and continued teaching for three decades, right up to his retirement in 1995. He was appointed Professor of the [[Philosophy of Law]] in 1988.

Also in 1988 Mifsud Bonnici was appointed [[Judge]] of the Maltese [[Superior Court]]s. Two years later, in 1990, he was made [[Chief Justice]], and President of the [[Appeal Court|Courts of Appeal]] and President of the [[Constitutional Court]], offices he held up till his retirement in 1995. Meantime, in 1992, he served as [[Judge]] of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]], a service he maintained until 1998. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Institute for Advanced [[Legal Studies]] of [[London]], [[England]].

==Works==
Philosophically, Mifsud Bonnici is an adherent of the Aristotelian-Thomistic school of [[Scholasticism]]. Most of his published studies deal with legal matters, including [[fundamental human rights]] and [[Political freedoms|freedoms]]. Rather technical in nature, these publications do not interest [[philosophy]] directly.

Of a different nature is his 178-page book, co-authored with [[Mark A. Sammut]], '''''Il-Ligi, il-Morali u r-Raguni''''' (Law, Morality and Reason), published in 2008 (Ius Melitæ). The composition is basically a sort of dialogue between the two authors (alternatively, it is an interview with Mifsud Bonnici). It is divided in into five main parts dealing with a number of themes, from purely legal technicalities to philosophical topics. Though the style is quite loose and colloquial – with the discussion sometimes drifting into mere side observations – philosophical arguments are proposed for a number of subjects, such as [[bioethics]], [[religion]], [[matrimony]] (including [[same-sex marriage]], [[freedom of expression]], the administration of [[justice]], and the like.

Since [[Einstein]]'s work, our universe is described by [[Minkowski space|four-dimensional spacetime]] whose metric is calculable by the [[Einstein field equations]]:

While WIMPs would be [[elementary particles]] described by the [[Standard Model|standard model]] that can in principle be studied by experimentalists in laboratories such as [[CERN]], the proposed particles called GIMPs would follow the [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|Vacuum Solutions]] of Einstein's equation.

&lt;/ref&gt; makes dark matter a form of dark energy filled with singularites, i.e., an entangled dark energy. This would roughly confirm Einstein's hope in 1919&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that all particles in the universe would follow the traceless version of his equation. If we identify all matter as the sum of dark energy plus dark matter in the form of GIMPs, his expectation would turn out to have been ''almost'' right. Matter would play a similar role as the point charges in the [[Maxwell's equations|homogenous Maxwell equation]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\nabla^2 E = 0&lt;/math&gt; in which delta functions are ignored. The sum of dark matter plus dark energy makes up 76% of all matter, which is sufficient to allow computer simulations to produce a good impression of the behavior of all matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnMlSbELUh4|title=Hydrodynamical Simulations of Galaxy Formation: Progress, pitfalls, and promises|last=Springel|first=Volker|authorlink=Volker Springel|date=2016-09-27|website=YouTube|series=Joint IAS/PU Astrophysics Colloquium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Habitat conservation''' is a management practice that seeks to [[Conservation (ethic)|conserve]], protect and restore [[habitat]] areas for wild [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, especially [[conservation reliant species]], and prevent their [[extinction]], [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] or reduction in [[Range (biology)|range]].&lt;ref name="CDFG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/habcon/|title=Habitat Conservation|last=Habitat Conservation Planning Branch|publisher=California Department of Fish &amp; Game|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a priority of many groups that cannot be easily characterized in terms of any one [[ideology]].

==History of the conservation movement==

For much of human history, ''nature'' had been seen as a [[natural resource|resource]], one that could be controlled by the government and used for personal and [[profit (economics)|economic gain]]. The idea was that plants only existed to feed animals and animals only existed to feed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Keith|title=Man and the Natural World: A History of the Modern Sensibility|year=1983|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|pages=17–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The land itself had limited value only extending to the resources it could provide such as [[mining|minerals]] and [[mineral oil|oil]].

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries social views started to change and scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the [[forest]]s of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[Civic engagement|civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting Pbnjbthis ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale [[deforestation]] and [[desiccation]], and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of [[forest conservation]] activities in British India through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDYlNljAP5AC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|author=Greg Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

Rather than focusing on the economic or material benefits associated with nature, humans began to appreciate the value of nature itself and the need to protect pristine wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BC Spaces|url=http://spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 20th century countries such as the United States, Canada, and Britain understood this appreciation and instigated laws and legislation in order to ensure that the most fragile and beautiful environments would be protected for generations to come. 
Today with the help of NGO’s, [[not-for profit]] organizations and governments worldwide there is a stronger [[environmental movement|movement]] taking place, with a deeper understanding of habitat conservation with the aim of protecting delicate habitats and preserving [[biodiversity]] on a global scale.  The commitment and actions of small volunteering association in villages and towns, that endeavour to emulate the work done by well known Conservation Organisations, is paramount in ensuring generations that follow understand the importance of conserving natural resources.  A village conservation group with the mission statement "We are committed to protecting and enhancing the natural environment in and around the adjoining villages of [[Ouston, County Durham|Ouston]] and Urpeth." may one day inspire a child who becomes the employee of a worldwide conservation organisation.

== Values of natural habitat ==
{{See also|Environmental Economics}}

The [[natural environment]] is a source for a wide range of resources that can be exploited for [[economic]] profit, for example timber is harvested from forests and clean water is obtained from natural streams. However, [[land development]] from anthropogenic economic growth often causes a decline in the ecological integrity of nearby natural habitat. For instance, this was an issue in the northern rocky mountains of the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prato|first=T|title=Evaluating Tradeoffs Between Economic Value and Wildlife Habitat Suitability in Buffer Zones for Protected Areas in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA|journal=Mountain Research and Development|year=2009|volume=29|issue=1|pages=44–58|doi=10.1659/mrd.992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is also economic value in conserving natural habitats. Financial profit can be made from tourist revenue, for example in the tropics where species diversity is high, or in recreational sports which take place in natural environments such as [[hiking]] and [[mountain biking]]. The cost of repairing damaged ecosystems is considered to be much higher than the cost of conserving natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noidoo|first=R|author2=Adamowicz|title=Economic benefits of biodiversity exceed costs of conservation at an African rainforest reserve|journal=PNAS|year=2005|volume=102|issue=46|pages=16712–16716|bibcode = 2005PNAS..10216712N |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0508036102|pmid=16267131|pmc=1283836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring the worth of conserving different habitat areas is often criticized as being too utilitarian from a philosophical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=P J|author2=Abivardi|title=The value of biodiversity: where ecology and economy blend|journal=Biological Conservation|year=1998|volume=83|issue=3|pages=239–246|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(97)00141-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodiversity ==
Habitat conservation is important in maintaining [[biodiversity]], an essential part of global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on Biological Diversity|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/sbstta/sbstta-14/information/sbstta-14-inf-34-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of food loss from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants have been found to be more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why should we care about biodiversity?|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/bcn/why/biodvr2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Seed Bank Partnership|url=http://www.seedpartnership.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classifying environmental values ==
Pearce and Moran outlined the following method for classifying environmental uses:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=David|title=The economic value of biodiversity|year=1994|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:PQ5mPZssFVsJ:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi%3D10.1.1.22.2066%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+pearce+moran+economics+biodiversity&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=au&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESix7X9nKfRp-D9TYQecQSHQtQMnMJuslfDbAGoOmSAzf-E8yOWUn46b3o02guIUpP1fVGVn9i7VyiIAndu5URorZ_Gox05eOs_JO2p6UMiWumHIarvabB47HvFBU9jMlrZZFD71&amp;sig=AHIEtbRS7HHK6rvUQecNYPJumgtdCmDstQ&amp;pli=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Direct extractive uses: e.g. timber from forests, food from plants and animals
* Indirect uses: e.g. ecosystem services like flood control, pest control, erosion protection
* Optional uses: future possibilities e.g. unknown but potential use of plants in chemistry/medicine
* Non-use values:
**[[Bequest value]] (benefit of an individual who knows that others may benefit from it in future)
**Passive use value (sympathy for natural environment, enjoyment of the mere existence of a particular species)

== Impacts ==

=== Natural causes ===
[[Habitat loss]] and destruction can occur both naturally and through anthropogenic causes. Events leading to natural habitat loss include climate change, catastrophic events such as volcanic explosions and through the interactions of invasive and non-invasive species. Natural climate change, events have previously been the cause of many widespread and large scale losses in habitat. For example, some of the mass extinction events generally referred to as the "Big Five" have coincided with large scale such as the Earth entering an ice age, or alternate warming events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilf|first=P|title=Correlated terrestrial and marine evidence for global climate changes before mass extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary|journal=PNAS|year=2003|volume=100|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.1073/pnas.0234701100|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100..599W|pmid=12524455|pmc=141042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events in the big five also have their roots in natural causes, such as volcanic explosions and meteor collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hut|first=P|title=Comet showers as a cause of mass extinction|journal=Nature|year=1987|volume=329|issue=10|pages=118–126|doi=10.1038/329118a0|bibcode = 1987Natur.329..118H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=G|title=Chicxulub impact pre-dates the K-T boundary mass extinction|journal=PNAS|year=2004|volume=101|issue=11|pages=3753–3758|pmid=15004276|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400396101|pmc=374316|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.3753K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact is one such example, which has previously caused widespread losses in habitat as the Earth either received less sunlight or grew colder, causing certain fauna and flora to flourish whilst others perished.  Previously known warm areas in the tropics, the most sensitive habitats on Earth, grew colder, and areas such as Australia developed radically different flora and fauna to those seen today. The big five mass extinction events have also been linked to sea level changes, indicating that large scale marine species loss was strongly influenced by loss in marine habitats, particularly shelf habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallam|first=A|authorlink= Anthony Hallam|title=Mass extinctions and sea-level changes|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|year=1999|volume=48|pages=217–250|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(99)00055-0|bibcode=1999ESRv...48..217H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane-driven oceanic eruptions have also been shown to have caused smaller mass extinction events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryskin|first=G|title=Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions|journal=Geology|year=2003|volume=31|issue=9|pages=741–744|doi=10.1130/G19518.1|bibcode = 2003Geo....31..741R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human impacts ===
Humans have been the cause of many species’ extinction. Due to humans’ changing and modifying their environment, the habitat of other species often become altered or destroyed as a result of human actions. Even before the modern industrial era, humans were having widespread, and major effects on the environment. A good example of this is found in Aboriginal Australians and [[Australian megafauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=G|title=Ecosystem Collapse in Pleistocene Australia and a Human Role in Megafaunal Extinction|journal=Science|year=2005|volume=309|pages=287–290|doi=10.1126/science.1111288|pmid=16002615|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..287M|issue=5732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aboriginal hunting practices, which included burning large sections of forest at a time, eventually altered and changed Australia’s vegetation so much that many herbivorous megafauna species were left with no habitat and were driven into extinction. Once herbivorous megafauna species became extinct, carnivorous megafauna species soon followed.
In the recent past, humans have been responsible for causing more extinctions within a given period of time than ever before. [[Deforestation]], [[pollution]], anthropogenic [[climate change]] and human settlements have all been driving forces in altering or destroying habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnosky|first=A|title=Has the Earth’s sixth mass extinction already arrived?|journal=Nature|year=2011|volume=471|pages=51–57|bibcode = 2011Natur.471...51B |doi = 10.1038/nature09678|pmid=21368823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of ecosystems such as rainforests has resulted in countless habitats being destroyed. These [[biodiversity hotspots]] are home to millions of habitat specialists, which do not exist beyond a tiny area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=N|title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities|journal=Nature|year=2000|volume=403|pages=853–858|doi=10.1038/35002501|pmid=10706275|bibcode = 2000Natur.403..853M|issue=6772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once their habitat is destroyed, they cease to exist.This destruction has a follow-on effect, as species which coexist or depend upon the existence of other species also become extinct, eventually resulting in the collapse of an entire ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooks|first=T|title=Habitat Loss and Extinction in the Hotspots of Biodiversity|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2002|volume=16|issue=4|pages=909–923|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00530.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=R|title=The sixth mass coextinction: are most endangered species parasites and mutualists?|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2009|volume=276|issue=1670|pages=3037–3045|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0413|pmid=19474041|pmc=2817118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These time-delayed extinctions are referred to as the extinction debt, which is the result of destroying and fragmenting habitats.
As a result of anthropogenic modification of the environment, the extinction rate has climbed to the point where the Earth is now within a sixth mass extinction event, as commonly agreed by biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=M|title=Amphibian Decline or Extinction? Current Declines Dwarf Background Extinction Rate|journal=Journal of Herpetology|year=2007|volume=41|issue=3|pages=483–491|doi=10.1670/0022-1511(2007)41[483:ADOECD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been particularly evident, for example, in the rapid decline in the number of [[amphibian]] species worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wake|first=D|title=A view from the world of amphibians|journal=PNAS|year=2008|volume=105|pages=11466–11473|bibcode = 2008PNAS..10511466W |doi = 10.1073/pnas.0801921105|pmid=18695221|pmc=2556420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches and methods of habitat conservation ==
Determining the size, type and location of habitat to conserve is a complex area of conservation biology. Although difficult to measure and predict, the conservation value of a habitat is often a reflection of the quality (e.g. species abundance and diversity), endangerment of encompassing ecosystems, and spatial distribution of that habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hierfl|first=L. A.|title=Assessing and Prioritizing Ecological Communities for Monitoring in a Regional Habitat Conservation Plan|journal=Environmental Management|year=2008|volume=42|pages=165–179|bibcode = 2008EnMan..42..165H |doi = 10.1007/s00267-008-9109-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifying priority habitats for conservation ==
Habitat conservation is vital for protecting species and ecological processes. It is important to conserve and protect the space/ area in which that species occupies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shwartz|first=M. W.|title=Choosing the appropriate scale of reserves for conservation|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|year=1999|volume=30|pages=83–108|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.30.1.83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, areas classified as ‘biodiversity hotspots’, or those in which a flagship, umbrella, or endangered species inhabits are often the habitats that are given precedence over others. Species that possess an elevated risk of extinction are given the highest priority and as a result of conserving their habitat, other species in that community are protected thus serving as an element of gap analysis. In the United States of America, a [[Habitat Conservation Plan]] (HCP) is often developed to conserve the environment in which a specific species inhabits. Under the U.S. [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) the habitat that requires protection in an HCP is referred to as the ‘critical habitat’. Multiple-species HCPs are becoming more favourable than single-species HCPs as they can potentially protect an array of species before they warrant listing under the ESA, as well as being able to conserve broad ecosystem components and processes . As of January 2007, 484 HCPs were permitted across the United States, 40 of which covered 10 or more species.The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) encompasses 85 species in a total area of 26,000-km2. Its aim is to protect the habitats of multiple species and overall biodiversity by minimizing development in sensitive areas. Hi

HCPs require clearly defined goals and objectives, efficient monitoring programs, as well as successful communication and collaboration with stakeholders and land owners in the area. Reserve design is also important and requires a high level of planning and management in order to achieve the goals of the HCP. Successful reserve design often takes the form of a hierarchical system with the most valued habitats requiring high protection being surrounded by buffer habitats that have a lower protection status. Like HCPs, hierarchical reserve design is a method most often used to protect a single species, and as a result habitat corridors are maintained, edge effects are reduced and a broader suite of species are protected.

== How much habitat is needed ==
A range of methods and models currently exist that can be used to determine how much habitat is to be conserved in order to sustain a [[viable population]], including [[Resource Selection Function]] and Step Selection models. Modelling tools often rely on the spatial scale of the area as an indicator of conservation value. There has been an increase in emphasis on conserving few large areas of habitat as opposed to many small areas. This idea is often referred to as the "single large or several small", [[SLOSS debate]], and is a highly controversial area among [[conservation biologist]]s and [[ecologist]]s. The reasons behind the argument that "larger is better" include the reduction in the negative impacts of patch edge effects, the general idea that species richness increases with [[habitat area]] and the ability of larger habitats to support greater populations with lower extinction probabilities. Noss &amp; Cooperrider support the "larger is better" claim and developed a model that implies areas of habitat less than 1000ha are "tiny" and of low conservation value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noss|first=R. F.|title=Saving Nature's Legacy, Protecting and Restoring Biodiveristy|year=1994|publisher=Washington, DC|pages=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shwartz suggests that although "larger is better", this does not imply that "small is bad". Shwartz argues that human induced habitat loss leaves no alternative to conserving small areas. Furthermore, he suggests many endangered species which are of high conservation value, may only be restricted to small [[habitat fragmentation|isolated patches]] of habitat, and thus would be overlooked if larger areas were given a higher priority. The shift to conserving larger areas is somewhat justified in society by placing more value on larger vertebrate species, which naturally have larger habitat requirements.

== Examples of current conservation organizations ==

=== The Nature Conservancy ===
Since its formation in 1951 [[The Nature Conservancy]] has slowly developed into one of the world’s largest conservation organizations. Currently operating in over 30 countries, across 5 continents worldwide, The Nature Conservancy aims to protect nature and its assets for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/aboutus/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization purchases land or accepts land donations with the intension of conserving its natural resources.  In 1955 The Nature Conservancy purchased its first 60-acre plot near the New York/Connecticut border in the United States of America. Today the Conservancy has expanded to protect over 119 million acres of land, 5,000 river miles as well as participating in over 1000 marine protection programs across the globe .
Since its beginnings The Nature Conservancy has understood the benefit in taking a scientific approach towards habitat conservation. For the last decade the organization has been using a collaborative, scientific method known as ‘Conservation by Design’. By collecting and analyzing scientific data The Conservancy is able to holistically approach the protection of various ecosystems. This process determines the habitats that need protection, specific elements that should be conserved as well as monitoring progress so more efficient practices can be developed for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy |url=http://www.nature.org/ourscience/conservationbydesign/index.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916210409/http://www.nature.org/ourscience/conservationbydesign/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nature Conservancy currently has a large number of diverse projects in operation. They work with countries around the world to protect forests, river systems, oceans, deserts and grasslands.  In all cases the aim is to provide a sustainable environment for both the plant and animal life forms that depend on them as well as all future generations to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nature Conservancy|url=http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/habitats/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; turtles

=== World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ===
The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) was first formed in after a group of passionate conservationists signed what is now referred to as the Morges Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; WWF is currently operating in over 100 countries across 5 continents with a current listing of over 5 million supporters. 
One of the first projects of WWF was assisting in the creation of the Charles Darwin Research Foundation which aided in the protection of diverse range of unique species existing on the Galápagos’ Islands, Ecuador.  It was also a WWF grant that helped with the formation of the College of African Wildlife Management in Tanzania which today focuses on teaching a wide range of protected area management skills in areas such as ecology, range management and law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wildlife Fund|url=http://wwf.panda.org/who_we_are/history/50_years_of_achievements/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WWF has since gone on to aid in the protection of land in Spain, creating the [[Coto Doñana National Park]] in order to conserve migratory birds and The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], home to the world’s largest protected wetlands. The WWF also initiated a debt-for-nature concept which allows the country to put funds normally allocated to paying off national debt, into conservation programs that protect its natural landscapes. Countries currently participating include [[Madagascar]], the first country to participate which since 1989 has generated over $US50 million towards preservation, [[Bolivia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Gabon]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Zambia]].

=== Rare Conservation ===
Rare has been in operation since 1973 with current global partners in over 50 countries and offices in the United States of America, Mexico, the Philippines, China and Indonesia. Rare focuses on the human activity that threatens biodiversity and habitats such as overfishing and unsustainable agriculture.  By engaging local communities and changing behaviour Rare has been able to launch campaigns to protect areas in most need of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Conservation|url=http://rareconservation.org/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The key aspect of Rare’s methodology is their "Pride Campaign’s".  For example, in the Andes in South America, Rare has incentives to develop watershed protection practices.  In the Southeast Asia’s "coral triangle" Rare is training fishers in local communities to better manage the areas around the coral reefs in order to lessen human impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Conservation|url=http://rareconservation.org/empowering-local-communities-solve-global-conservation-challenges}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such programs last for three years with the aim of changing community attitudes so as to conserve fragile habitats and provide ecological protection for years to come.

=== WWF Netherlands ===
WWF Netherlands, along with ARK Nature, Wild Wonders of Europe and Conservation Capital have started the Rewilding Europe project. This project intents to rewild several areas in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rewildingeurope.com/ Rewilding Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3773">The '''Heinz dilemma''' is a frequently used example in many ethics and morality classes. One well-known version of the dilemma, used in [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]'s [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]], is stated as follows:

A woman was on her deathbed. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?&lt;ref name="philmoral"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kohlberg |first=Lawrence |title= Essays on Moral Development, Vol. I: The Philosophy of Moral Development |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=San Francisco, CA |year=1981 |isbn=0-06-064760-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical point of view, it is not important what the participant thinks that Heinz should ''do''. Kohlberg's theory holds that the justification the participant offers is what is significant, the ''form'' of their response. Below are some of many examples of possible arguments that belong to the six stages:

* Stage one (''obedience''): Heinz should not steal the medicine because he will consequently be put in prison which will mean he is a bad person. 
: Or: Heinz should steal the medicine because it is only worth $200 and not how much the druggist wanted for it; Heinz had even offered to pay for it and was not stealing anything else.
* Stage two (''self-interest''): Heinz should steal the medicine because he will be much happier if he saves his wife, even if he will have to serve a prison sentence.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine because prison is an awful place, and he would more likely languish in a jail cell than over his wife's death.
* Stage three (''conformity''): Heinz should steal the medicine because his wife expects it; he wants to be a good husband.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the drug because stealing is bad and he is not a criminal; he has tried to do everything he can without breaking the law, you cannot blame him.
* Stage four (''law-and-order''): Heinz should not steal the medicine because the law prohibits stealing, making it illegal.
: Or: Heinz should steal the drug for his wife but also take the prescribed punishment for the crime as well as paying the druggist what he is owed. Criminals cannot just run around without regard for the law; actions have consequences.
* Stage five (''human rights''): Heinz should steal the medicine because everyone has a right to choose life, regardless of the law.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine because the scientist has a right to fair compensation. Even if his wife is sick, it does not make his actions right.
* Stage six (''universal human ethics''): Heinz should steal the medicine, because saving a human life is a more fundamental value than the property rights of another person.
: Or: Heinz should not steal the medicine, because others may need the medicine just as badly, and their lives are equally significant.

[[File:Hermann Linde - Girl standing in a veranda wearing a Pochampalli sari (ca.1895).jpg|thumb|175px|Young girl wearing a [[Pochampally sari]] (c. 1895)]]

'''Hermann Linde''' (26 August 1863, [[Lübeck]] - 26 June 1923, [[Arlesheim]]) was a German painter in the [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] style. He specialized in "[[Orientalism|Oriental]]" themes.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

==Life and work ==
He was the son of {{ill|Hermann Linde the Elder|de|Hermann Linde der Ältere}}, a pharmacist and pioneering photographer. His brothers were [[Max Linde]], an [[ophthalmologist]] and art collector, and [[Heinrich Eduard Linde-Walther]], who also became a painter. He received his first art lessons from his grandfather {{ill|Christian Peter Wilhelm Stolle|de}}, a decorative painter.

He continued his studies at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] and the [[Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School]]. In 1890, prompted by his brother Heinrich, who had just returned from Cairo, he took a study trip to Sicily, Egypt and Tunisia. From 1892 to 1895, he worked as a free-lance painter in India.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=382 Anthroposophie (Biographien Dokumentation): Biography of Linde]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting "The [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]] Procession" won the Gold Medal of the [[Viceroy of India]]. It is currently in the collection of the [[Übersee-Museum Bremen]]. In 1896, he stayed briefly in Paris and Tunisia, then spent the next two years at the artists' colony in [[Dachau (district)|Dachau]].

Some of his father's relatives had been interested in the [[Anthroposophical Society]]. After attending a large meeting and lecture in 1906, he became a member. In 1910 he met Steiner, who invited him to paint interior murals for the [[Goetheanum#First Goetheanum|First Goetheanum]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Linde made sketches based on Goethe's ''Märchen von der Grünen Schlange und der Schönen Lilie'' (tale of "[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]"). After seeing the sketches, Steiner suggested that they be done in conjunction with scenes from Steiner's modern [[mystery play]], ''The Portal of Initiation''. Linde would work on the murals and other projects there for many years to follow.

He died six months after the First Goetheanum was destroyed by an arson fire. According to Steiner, he died of a "broken heart", because of all the years he had devoted himself entirely to the building and its artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fvn-archiv.net/PDF/GA/GA261.pdf#page=274f Rudolf Steiner: Gesamtausgabe Vorträge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional '''Japanese political values''' are commonly characterized by a strong [[community]] sense and [[Peer group|group]] [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and the importance of personal connections and [[consensus]] building. 

==Clichés and their critique==
Concerning [[Japanese values|values]], [[Politics of Japan|Japanese politics]] are generally described as pragmatic, limited by particularistic loyalties, and based on human relations rather than on [[ideology]] or principles. The quintessential Japanese leader is a network builder rather than the embodiment of [[charisma]] or ideals; more like the crafty and resourceful founder of the Tokugawa [[Shōgun|bakufu]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], than the ruthless but heroic [[Oda Nobunaga]]. Such political dynamics are evident, for example, in the workings of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]], which has remained the strongest party since 1955 despite their 3-year loss of majority control in the early 1990s.

As clichés go, the success of [[Junichiro Koizumi]] showed that Japan may have just been in waiting for a charismatic, media-savvy politician{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. In the [[Japan general election, 2005|2005 House of Representatives election]], the personal voter relationship concept was challenged for the first time. So called "assassin candidates", with a pro-[[Japan Post|postal]] privatization agenda, were set against the "postal rebels", critics of postal reform, who were cast out of the LDP but still had local ties in their voting districts. Results were mixed, with some districts taken by the "rebels" and some by the "assassins".

Furthermore, the pragmatic, personalistic view of politics cannot explain [[Japanese militarism|Japan's militaristic past]], the political crises of the 1960s, the [[Controversies regarding the role of the Emperor of Japan|controversies surrounding the emperor]], [[Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan|Article 9]], or the unwillingness of many in the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Social Democratic Party of Japan]], despite a huge political cost, to abandon their antiwar and revolutionary commitment in the early 1990s.

It also fails to account for the apparently sincerely held ideological beliefs of the wartime period. The "New Order in Greater East Asia" was legitimized on the basis of universal principles, such as "[[Pan-Asianism]]," "international justice," and "permanent peace," even if the results were quite the opposite. The non-ideological nature of mainstream Japanese politics in the postwar period reflects defeat in war, the failure after 1945 to find a national ideological consensus to replace discredited wartime beliefs, and the commitment of both elite and ordinary Japanese to expanding the economy and raising living standards. As these goals were attained, a complacent, largely apolitical "middle mass society" (a term coined by economist [[Murakami Yasusuke]]) emerged, in which 90 percent of the people in opinion polls consistently classified themselves as "[[middle class]]."

==Community and leadership==
Certain distinctive features of Japanese politics can be identified, although this is not to say that they are unique to Japan. Rather, qualities also found in other political systems, such as the importance of personal connections and consensus building, played an extraordinarily important role in Japanese politics. These features have deep historical roots and reflect values that pervade the society as a whole.

In both the feudal and the modern eras, a major problem for Japanese political leaders has been reconciling the goals of community survival and the welfare and self-respect of individuals in an environment of extreme scarcity. In recent centuries, Japan lacked the natural resources and space to accommodate its population comfortably. With the exception of [[Hokkaidō]] and colonial territories in Asia between 1895 and 1945, there was no "frontier" to absorb excess people. One solution was to ignore the welfare of large sectors of the population ([[peasant]]s and workers) and to use force when they expressed their discontent. Such coercive measures, common during both the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] and the [[World War II]] periods, largely, although not entirely, disappeared in the postwar "welfare state" (for example, farmers were evicted from their land to construct the New [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo International Airport]] at Narita Sanrizuka in the 1970s after long negotiations had failed). But non-coercive, or mostly non-coercive, methods of securing popular compliance had developed to an extraordinary degree in social and political life.

The most important such method is the promotion of a strong sense of community consciousness and group solidarity. Japanese individuals are often characterized as having a strong sense of self-sacrifice and community dedication (see [[Japanese values]]). Historians and sociologists note that both traditional and modern Japanese communities—the [[Burakumin|buraku]], the [[Han (Japan)|feudal domain]] with its retinue of [[samurai]], the large commercial houses found in [[Edo]] (the future Tokyo), [[Osaka]], and [[Kyoto]] before 1868, and modern corporations and bureaucracies with their cohorts of lifetime employees—have striven to be all-inclusive. Such groups serve a variety of functions for the individual, providing not only income and sustenance but also emotional support and individual identity. Japanese called such community inclusiveness the "octopus-pot way of life" (''takotsubo seikatsu''). Large pots with narrow openings at the top are used by fishermen to capture octopuses, and the term is used to refer to people so wrapped up in their particular social group that they cannot see the world outside its confines.

The "group consciousness" model of Japanese social life, however, has been overstressed at times. A person may often go along with group demands because they serve self-interest in the long run (for example, political contributions may help secure future favors from those in office). Historically, democratic concepts of individual rights and limited government have been deeply appealing because they, too, promise protection of individual autonomy. Despite very different ethical and political traditions, the Japanese people were very receptive to imported liberal ideas both before and after 1945. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s essay [[On Liberty]], for example, was extremely popular during the [[Meiji period|Meiji era]].

Because individual, usually passive, resistance to group demands occurs, Japanese leaders have found the creation of a strong community sense to be a difficult and time-consuming task. Harmony ([[Wa (Japanese)|wa]]), that most prized social value, is not easily attained. One mechanism for achieving wa is the use of [[ritual]]s to develop a psychological sense of group [[Cultural identity|identity]]. Political parties and factions, the offices of national and local governments, businesses, university departments, research groups, alumni associations, and other groups sponsor frequent ceremonies and more informal parties for this purpose. A group's history and identity are carefully constructed through the use of songs and symbols (often resembling, in miniature, the Meiji government's creation of symbols of [[kokutai]] in the late nineteenth century). Often, an organization's founder, especially if deceased, is regarded as something of a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] sage or a [[Shinto]] [[kami]] (deity). Group members, however, may find that pervasive ritualism allows them to "go through the motions" (such as the chanting of banzai! ([[ten thousand years]]!) at the end of political rallies, without having to make a deeper commitment to the group.

A second mechanism to promote community solidarity is the building of hierarchical relationships. In this practice, the influence of premodern ethics is readily apparent. In what anthropologist [[Nakane Chie]] calls Japan's "vertical society," human relationships are defined in terms of inequality, and people relate to each other as superiors and inferiors along a minutely differentiated gradient of social status, not only within bureaucratic organizations, where it might be expected, but also in academic, artistic, and, especially, political worlds.

Hierarchy expresses itself along two dimensions: first, an internal community differentiation of rank by seniority, education, and occupational status; and second, the distinction between "[[insider]]s" and "outsiders," between members and nonmembers of the community, along with the ranking of whole groups or communities along a vertical continuum. Although internal hierarchy can cause [[Social alienation|alienation]] as inferiors chafe under the [[authority]] of their superiors, the external kind of [[hierarchy]] tends to strengthen group cohesion as individual members work to improve their group's relative ranking. The Japanese nation as a whole has been viewed as a single group by its people in relation to other nations. Intense [[nationalism]] has frequently been a manifestation of group members' desire to "catch up and overtake" the advanced ("superior") nations of the West, while the rights of non-Western nations, like [[China]] or [[Korea]], often viewed as "inferior," have been ignored.

Like group consciousness, however, the theme of hierarchy has been overstressed. Contemporary Japanese politics show a strong consciousness of equality, and even traditional communities, such as rural villages, were often egalitarian rather than hierarchical. [[Citizen and consumer movements in Japan|Citizens' movements]] of the 1960s and 1970s differed from older political organizations in their commitment to promoting intragroup democracy. In addressing the nation, Emperor [[Akihito]] used colloquial Japanese terms that stressed equality, rather than the formal, hierarchy-laden language of his predecessors.

Two mechanisms for lessening the hierarchy-generated tensions are the [[seniority]] principle and early retirement. As men or women grow older, gaining seniority within an organization, they acquire authority and higher status. The seniority principle is reinforced by the traditional reluctance to place younger persons in positions of authority over older ones. The institution of early retirement (top-ranked businesspeople and bureaucrats commonly retired at age fifty-five or sixty) helps to the keep the promotion of others smooth and predictable. The system also helps to enable talented individuals to succeed to the most responsible positions and prevents a small group of older persons (what the Japanese call "one-man leaders") from monopolizing leadership positions and imposing increasingly outmoded ideas on the organization. Elite retirees, however, often continue to wield influence as advisers and usually pursue second careers in organizations affiliated with the one from which they retired. (see [[Elderly people in Japan]])

The circulation of elites that results from the seniority and early retirement principles ensures that everyone within the upper ranks of the hierarchy has a turn at occupying a high-status position, such as a cabinet post in the national government. This principle, in turn, enables people to reward their followers. There has been, for example, a regular turnover of [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|LDP]] leaders. No individual has served as party president (and prime minister) longer than [[Sato Eisaku]], the incumbent between 1964 and 1972. The average tenure of party presidents / prime ministers between 1964 and 1987 was slightly more than three years. Frequent cabinet reshuffling meant that the average tenure of other cabinet ministers in the same period was a little less than a year. Japan has not been beset with leaders in their seventies and eighties unwilling to give up their powerful positions.

Another mechanism reducing intragroup tensions is the strong personal, rather than legalistic or ideological, ties between superior and subordinate. These ties are typically characterized in terms of fictive familial relationships, analogous to the bonds between parents and children (the ''[[oyabun]]-kobun [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]''). The ideal leader is viewed as a paternalistic one, with a warm and personal concern for the welfare of his followers. For followers, loyalty is both morally prescribed and emotionally sustained by the system. In the political world, oyabun-kobun relationships are pervasive despite the formal commitment to universalistic, democratic values. At the same time, younger people find such relationships less appealing than their elders. The so-called ''[[shinjinrui]]'' (new human beings), born in the affluent 1960s and 1970s, were often criticized by older Japanese for being self-absorbed, egoistic, and "cool." The younger generation is inclined to view with disdain the emotional expression of paternalistic ties, such as in the 1989 television broadcasts of former Prime Minister [[Tanaka Kakuei]]'s supporters weeping profusely over his political retirement.

==Consensus Building==
The community is often demanding, but it is also fragile, because social ties are sustained not only through legal norms and common self-interest but also through the affective [[patron]]-client relationship. Open conflict poses a danger to the survival of this sort of community, and thus policy making requires elaborate consultation and consensus building, usually involving all the parties concerned in order to maintain [[Wa (Japanese culture)|wa]] (和), the notion of harmony within a group. According to political scientist [[Lewis Austin]], "everyone must be consulted informally, everyone must be heard, but not in such a way that the hearing of different opinions develops into opposition. The leader and his assistants `harmonize opinion'... in advance, using go-betweens to avert the confrontation of opposing forces." After a preliminary agreement among all has been reached, a formal meeting is held in which the agreed-upon policy will be proposed and adopted.

This process is called [[nemawashi]] (root trimming or binding), evoking the image of a gardener preparing a tree or shrub for transplanting, that is, a change in policy. Austin points out that a common Japanese verb meaning "to decide" (''matomeru'') literally means to gather or bring together. Decisions are "the sum of the contributions of all." Although consensus building is, for leaders, a time-consuming and emotionally exhausting process, it is necessary not only to promote group goals but also to respect and protect individual autonomy. In fact, the process represents reconciliation of the two. In the political system as a whole, most groups play some role in the ''nemawashi'' process. Exceptions are those groups or individuals, such as Koreans or other minority groups, who are viewed as outsiders.

Political leaders have to maintain solidarity and harmony within a single group and also secure the cooperation of different groups who are often in bitter conflict. ''Takotsubo seikatsu'' can promote destructive sectionalism. During World War II, rivalry between the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Imperial Navy]] was so intense that it was nearly impossible to coordinate their strategic operations. In the postwar political system, prime ministers have often been unable to persuade different ministries, all self-sufficient and intensely jealous "kingdoms," to go along with reforms in such areas as [[trade liberalization]]. Observers such as journalist [[Karel van Wolferen]], have concluded that Japan's political system is empty at the center, lacking real leadership or a locus of responsibility: "Statecraft in Japan is quite different from that in the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. For centuries it has entailed the preservation of a careful balance of semiautonomous groups that share power… These semiautonomous components, each endowed with great discretionary powers, are not represented in one central ruling body." This view is probably exaggerated. Leadership in other countries, including the [[United States]], has been paralyzed from time to time by powerful interest groups, and some policies in Japan requiring decisive leadership, such as the creation of [[Social welfare in Japan|social welfare]] and energy conservation policies in the 1970s and the privatization of [[Japanese public corporations|state enterprises]] in the 1980s, have been reasonably successful.

'''Kateryna Kyrylenko''' (Kateryna Mykhailivna Martyniuk; born 1971) is a Ukrainian teacher of [[philosophy]], professor of philosophy at [[Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts]] (since 2014), and the spouse of Ukrainian minister and politician [[Vyacheslav Kyrylenko]]. She became famous after getting her [[Doctor of Sciences]] degree in pedagogy in November, 2015 and opposition of Ukrainian scientific community to it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voxukraine.org/2016/08/12/argumentum-ad-absurdum-en/ Sergei Sharapov. A Lepton «God»: Proof of the Collapse in the Ukrainian Scientific Degree Awarding System. VoxUkraine, 12-08-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Kateryna Martyniuk was born in the family of university teacher {{Interlanguage link multi|Mykailo Martyniuk|uk|3=Мартинюк Михайло Тадейович}} who later became a chancellor of [[Pavlo Tychyna Uman State Pedagogical University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://gazeta.ua/articles/politics/_rektora-umanskogo-universitetu-zvilnili-bo-vin-test-kirilenka/349532 Ректора Уманського університету звільнили, бо він&amp;nbsp;— тесть Кириленка? Gazeta.ua, 03 серпня 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from {{Interlanguage link multi|Bohdan Khmelnytsky National University of Cherkasy|uk|3=Черкаський національний університет імені Богдана Хмельницького}} as a teacher of [[Russian language]]. She entered [[PhD]] program of [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]] and successfully defended her thesis "Cultural philosophy of [[Osip Mandelstam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://irbis-nbuv.gov.ua/cgi-bin/irbis_nbuv/cgiirbis_64.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EC&amp;P21DBN=EC&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=fullwebr&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=A=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=1&amp;S21STR=%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8E%D0%BA%20%D0%9A$ Мартинюк, Катерина Михайлівна.

While studying in Kyiv University Kateryna met and married her husband [[Vyacheslav Kyrylenko]]. They have a son and a daughter.

Kateryna Kyrylenko teaches philosophy in [[Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts]] (KNUCA). Since March 2014 she occupies the Chair of philosophy. She wrote an illustrated textbook, ''Philosophy: science and culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://knukim.edu.ua/novunu/eksklyuzivniy-pidruchnik-yevropeyskogo-zrazka/ Ексклюзивний підручник європейського зразка для студентів КНУКіМ. Сайт КНУКіМ, 18.12.2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thesis controversy ==
In May 2015 chief editor of "Museums of Ukraine" magazine Victor Tregub announced that Kyrylenko's textbook "Culture and science" contained plagiarism of multiple authors' texts including students' essays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum-ukraine.org.ua/?p=4089 Віктор Тригуб. Плагіат від дружини шефа Мінкульту Кириленка! Ганьба уряду Яценюка! «Музеї України», 8.05.2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2015 at [[National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine]] Kateryna Kyrylenko defended her thesis on "Theoretical and methodological basis for the formation of innovation culture of future culturologists in higher educational establishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://nubip.edu.ua/node/16445 Захист дисертації Кириленко Катерини Михайлівни на тему: «Теоретичні і методичні основи формування інноваційної культури майбутніх культурологів у вищому навчальному закладі». Сайт НУБіП]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]] approved her defence and awarded her an academic degree of [[Doktor nauk]] (Doctor of Sciences) in pedagogics.

Nevertheless, D.Sc. in philosophy Tetyana Parkhomenko found multiple [[plagiarism]] paragraphs in Kyrylenko's thesis and forced the Ministry to start an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://life.pravda.com.ua/columns/2016/01/13/206334/ Тетяна Пархоменко.

Життя, 13.01.2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Parhomenko's accusations were supported by physicists as some paragraphs contained pseudoscientific claims like "The soul is incapable of practical activity unless it is embodied in an organic form. A lepton “God”, whose mind in its original form was identical with its lepton body, creates a variety of its “bodily organs”." {{Interlanguage link multi|Vadym Loktiev|uk|3=Локтєв Вадим Михайлович}}, Academic-Secretary (chairman) of Physics and Astronomy Department in [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] asked Ministry to withdraw Kyrylenko's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://life.pravda.com.ua/culture/2016/01/25/207008/ У докторській Катерини Кириленко знайшли псевдонауку про лептони.

Псевдонаука на потоці. Дзеркало тижня, 29 січня 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kateryna Kyrylenko and her husband denied all accusations in plagiarism and described situation as political pressure. She also postulated that physicists cannot evaluate her pedagogical thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://life.pravda.com.ua/columns/2016/01/14/206454/ Катерина Кириленко.

Життя, 26.01.2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Special research council of [[H.S. Skovoroda Kharkiv National Pedagogical University]] declared in May, 2016 that Kyrylenko's thesis is a work of independent scientific research which nevertheless contains "1.4&amp;nbsp;% of unsourced text borrowings".&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/eksperti-ne-viyavili-plagiatu-u-doktorskiy-disertaciyi-druzhini-v-yacheslava-kirilenka-208150_.html Харківські експерти не виявили плагіату у докторській дисертації дружини віце-прем'єра Кириленка. Дзеркало тижня, 13 травня 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; 
On July 1, 2016 Ministry of Education and Science college refused to withdraw doctoral degree from Kateryna Kyrylenko because no specialized councils had asked the Ministry to do this, as minister [[Liliya Hrynevych]] commented.&lt;ref name="DT1_06_16"&gt;{{uk icon}}[http://dt.ua/UKRAINE/mon-ne-znayshlo-zakonnih-pidstav-dlya-pozbavlennya-druzhini-vice-prem-yera-kirilenka-doktorskogo-stupenyu-212586_.html МОН не знайшло підстав для позбавлення дружини віце-прем'єра Кириленка докторського ступеню.

Later in April, 2017 Ukrainian Language-Information Foundation of National Academy of Sciences conducted expert research of Kyrylenko's thesis and recognized 26% of whole text as plagiarism and found out 696 different mistakes as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}}{{Cite web|url=http://zn.ua/UKRAINE/okolo-30-teksta-doktorskoy-dissertacii-suprugi-vice-premera-kirilenko-yavlyaetsya-plagiatom-ekspertnoe-zaklyuchenie-244968_.html|title=Около 30% текста докторской диссертации супруги вице-премьера Кириленко является плагиатом – экспертное заключение|last=|first=|date=2017-04-08|website=zn.ua|publisher=|language=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/world-view/ukrainian-politicians-and-fake-dissertations|title=Ukrainian Politicians and Fake Dissertations|last=|first=|date=2017-05-30|website=Inside Higher Ed|publisher=Ararat L.

''Louis Groarke'' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosopher]].  He is a Professor in the Philosophy Department at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, NS and an author. Prior to his current position he taught Philosophy at several Universities and Colleges across Canada including: University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, Okanagan University-College, Humber College, Trent University, University of Prince Edward Island, and York University.&lt;ref&gt;https://louisgroarke.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/louis-groarke-curriculum-vitae-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   Groarke's writings in philosophy have focussed upon Ethics, Logic, Political Philosophy and Aesthetics. His work characteristically draws upon his broad knowledge of the history of Western philosophy, especially the thought of Aristotle, with a view to applying this to address problems in contemporary philosophy.

==Main Contributions== 
Louis Groarke's first book ''The Good Rebel'' addresses the tendency of contemporary philosophers to overly separate freedom from morality and rationality. On this model, morality and rationality appear to be constraints upon freedom.  Through the presentation of a vast array of figures in the philosophical tradition, Groarke shows that this contemporary view is a deviation from a broadly held consensus that far from being at odds with morality and rationality, freedom actually presupposes these goods.  According to this view, which Groarke defends, one cannot be authentically free without being both rational and good.&lt;ref&gt;Groarke, "The Good Rebel", Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, (December 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, Groarke has authored a significant textbook and many academic articles on ethics developing this historical methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Groarke, "Moral Reasoning: Rediscovering the Ethical Tradition," (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

His work in Logic also develops this methodology of applying lessons from the history of philosophy to offer revisionary accounts of philosophical ideas that have come to be taken for granted in much of the current philosophical discourse.  In his work "An Aristotelian Account of Induction: Creating Something from Nothing" Groarke critiques the orthodox view of Inductive logic that has been widely held since David Hume, according to whom inductive inferences can never be certain as the conclusion always extends beyond the number of observed cases.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/#HumInd&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on an Aristotelian distinction between knowledge and insight Groarke argues that sense experience can in cases give insight into the fundamental nature of a thing in a way that grounds knowledge of the universal. This alternative highlights that it is Hume's presumption of nominalism that grounds his account of the problem of induction.  Defending an Aristotelian form of essentialism Groarke argues for an account of induction that is non-fallacious and in some of its forms capable of rising to genuine knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Groarke, "An Aristotelian Account of Induction," McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Mad Pain and Martian Pain"''' is a philosophical article written by [[David Kellogg Lewis]]. Lewis argued, that a theory of pain must be able to reflect the most basic intuitions of both [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[Identity theory of mind|identity theory]]. Because of such, he proposes the existence of two beings both in [[Pain (philosophy)|pain]] – one whose physical explanation of pain differs from ours and one whose reaction to pain differs from ours. Lewis states that any complete theory of the mind should be able to explain how each being is in pain.

== Lewis's two forms of pain ==
The being with "mad pain" is a human being, except when his brain is in a state of pain, his mind turns to mathematics and he begins to snap his fingers. He is not at all inclined to prevent the pain from occurring. Lewis ultimately goes on to explain that pain is relative to a species, implying that the man who exhibits mad pain is essentially an exception. He is in pain because, instantiated in him, it is that physical state which is normally an instantiation of pain in his species (humans). In Lewis' words, "In short, he feels pain but his pain does not at all occupy the typical causal role of pain."

A being with "Martian pain" is not human but, when subject to pain, will react in the same way that humans do. He is strongly inclined to prevent whatever stimulus is causing discomfort. However, the physical explanation of Martian pain is different from that of human pain. He has a "hydraulic mind" and pain is identical with inflation of cavities in his feet. Lewis suggests that the Martian is indeed in pain, because, instantiated in him is the filler of the relevant physical instantiation of pain in that species: inflation of the cavities in the feet. In Lewis' words, "In short, he feels pain but lacks the bodily states that either are in pain or else accompany it in us."

In a postscript to "Mad Pain and Martian Pain" (published in ''Philosophical Papers'', Volume I), Lewis takes a critical view of [[qualia]]. He explicitly identifies pain with qualia, observing that, "We say to the friend of qualia that, beneath his tendentious jargon, he is just talking pain and various aspects of its functional role." (p. 130). He then lays out a response to the [[knowledge argument]] of [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]].

== Objections ==
Those who hold that the intuitions behind identity theory need not be respected are free to disagree with Lewis, and to say that "mad pain" need not be permitted or explained by a theory of pain. Equally, those who hold that the intuitions behind functionalism need not be respected are free to say that they see no reason why the Martian's 'pain' should be accepted as real pain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

'''Martin Lings''' (24 January 1909 – 12 May 2005), also known as '''Abū Bakr Sirāj ad-Dīn''', was an [[England|English]] [[Muslim]] writer, scholar, and philosopher. A student of the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[metaphysician]] [[Frithjof Schuon]]&lt;ref&gt;, a follower of the Alawiyya Sufi tariqa,[https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,1493343,00.html Islamic scholar concerned with spiritual crisis]&lt;/ref&gt; and an authority on the work of [[William Shakespeare]], he is best known as the author of ''[[Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources]]'', first published in 1983 and still in print.

== Early life and education==
Lings was born in [[Burnage]], Manchester, in 1909 to a [[Protestant]] family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The young Lings gained an introduction to travelling at a young age, spending significant time in the [[United States]] because of his father's employment. Lings attended [[Clifton College]] and went on to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he gained a BA in English Language and Literature. At Magdalen, he was a student and then a close friend of [[C. S. Lewis]]. After graduating from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] Lings went to [[Vytautas Magnus University]], in [[Lithuania]], where he taught [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Middle English]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For Lings himself, however, the most important event whilst at Oxford was his discovery of the writings of the [[René Guénon]], a French metaphysician and Muslim convert, and those of [[Frithjof Schuon]], a German spiritual authority, metaphysician and Perennialist.  In 1938, Lings went to Basle to make Schuon's acquaintance. This prompted his embracing Islam to embrace the branch of the [[Ahmad al-Alawi|Alawiyya tariqa]] led by Schuon. Thereafter, Lings remained Schuon's disciple and expositor for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lings, ''A Return to the Spirit'', Fons Vitae, Kentucky, 2005, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;



==Career==
In 1939, Lings went to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], to visit a friend who was an assistant of René Guénon. Soon after arriving in Cairo, his friend died and Lings began studying [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Cairo became his home for over a decade; he became an English language teacher at the [[University of Cairo]] and produced [[Shakespeare]] plays annually.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=Eaton|first=Gai|title=Obituary: Martin Lings|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries|accessdate=2 April 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=27 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lings married Lesley Smalley in 1944 and lived with her in a village near the [[pyramids]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Despite having settled comfortably in Egypt, Lings was forced to leave in 1952 after anti-British disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Arabic obituary in Al-Ahram International Edition, 11 June 2005. Transl. in ''A Return to the Spirit'', Fons Vitae, Kentucky, 2005, pp. 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

On returning to the United Kingdom he continued his education, earning a BA in Arabic and a PhD from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London)]]. His doctoral thesis became a well-received book on Algerian [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Ahmad al-Alawi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After completing his doctorate in 1959, Lings worked at the [[British Museum]] and later the [[British Library]], overseeing eastern manuscripts and other textual works,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/obituaries/martin-lings-a-sufi-writer-on-islamic-ideas-dies-at-96.html|title=Martin Lings, a Sufi Writer on Islamic Ideas, Dies at 96|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=2005-05-29|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; rising to the position of Keeper of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts 1970–73.  He was also a frequent contributor to the journal ''[[Studies in Comparative Religion]]''.

A writer throughout this period, Lings' output increased in the last quarter of his life.  While his thesis work on Ahmad al-Alawi had been well regarded, his most famous work was a [[Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources|biography of Muhammad]], written in 1983, which earned him acclaim in the Muslim world and prizes from the governments of [[Pakistan]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GcUFmQ-NF_0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gai+eaton&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjonqC1tO3LAhVH7Q4KHVHyAiw4ChDoAQgpMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Martin%2520Lings&amp;f=false|title=Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century|last=Sedgwick|first=Mark|date=2004-06-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199744930|page=8|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His work was hailed as the "best biography of the prophet in English" at the National Seerat Conference in [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.talkislam.com/b3800.html Muhammad : His Life Based on the Earliest Sources by Martin Lings]&lt;/ref&gt; He also continued travelling extensively, although he made his home in [[Kent]]. He died on 12 May 2005.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/may/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries|title=Martin Lings|last=Eaton|first=Gai|date=2005-05-26|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his writings on Sufism, Lings was a Shakespeare scholar. His contribution to Shakespeare scholarship was to point out the deeper esoteric meanings found in Shakespeare's plays, and the spirituality of Shakespeare himself. More recent editions of Lings's books on Shakespeare include a foreword by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret of Shakespeare: His Greatest Plays Seen in the Light of Sacred Art'', Quinta Essentia, Cambridge, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before his death he gave an interview on this topic, which was posthumously made into the film ''Shakespeare's Spirituality: A Perspective. An Interview With Dr. Martin Lings''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiusfoundation.org/?s=martin+lings Shakespeare's Spirituality: A Perspective]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Max Horkheimer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɔːr|k|ˌ|h|aɪ|m|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhɔɐ̯kˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who was famous for his work in [[critical theory]] as a member of the '[[Frankfurt School]]' of social research. Horkheimer addressed [[authoritarianism]], militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of [[mass culture]] using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include ''[[Eclipse of Reason (Horkheimer)|Eclipse of Reason]]'' (1947), ''Between Philosophy and Social Science'' (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with [[Theodor Adorno]], ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"&gt;"Horkheimer, Max". ''Dictionary of the Social Sciences''. Craig Calhoun, ed. Oxford University Press 2002. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. College of the Holy Cross. 14 October 2009 &lt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t104.e767]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
On February 14, 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy [[Orthodox Jewish]] family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of [[Stuttgart]], where Max was born.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Berendzen, J.C., "Max Horkheimer", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/horkheimer/]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max's closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, who was his father's personal secretary. Eight years Max's senior, a gentile, and of an economically lower class, Riekher (whom Max called "Maidon") was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/horkheimer/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Berendzen|first=J.C.|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"&gt;Reason, Nostalgia, and Eschatology in the Critical Theory of Max Horkheimer Brian J. Shaw The Journal of Politics, Vol. 47, No. 1 (Feb., 1985), pp. 160–181.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Horkheimer was denied service on medical grounds.

===Education===
In the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical,&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Horkheimer enrolled at [[Munich University]]. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Horkheimer, Max - Oxford Reference|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001/acref-9780199532919-e-330|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released, Horkheimer moved to [[Frankfurt am Main]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] under the respectable [[Hans Cornelius]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There, he met [[Theodor Adorno]], several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt [[psychology]], Horkheimer, with Cornelius's direction, completed his doctorate in [[philosophy]] with a 78-page dissertation titled ''The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment'' (''Zur Antinomie der teleologischen Urteilskraft'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sica 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan. ''Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to The Present''. Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, Horkheimer was [[habilitation|habilitated]] with a dissertation entitled ''Kant's Critique of Judgement as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy'' (''Über Kants Kritik der Urteilskraft als Bindeglied zwischen theoretischer und praktischer Philosophie''). Here, he met [[Friedrich Pollock]] who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed ''[[Privatdozent]].'' Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.&lt;ref name="Sica 2005"/&gt;

===Institute of Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung)===
In 1926 Horkheimer was an "unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt." Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]]. In the same year, when the [[Institute for Social Research]]'s (now known as Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) directorship became vacant, after the departure of [[Carl Grünberg]], Horkheimer was elected to the position "by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman".&lt;ref name="Sica, Alan 2005"&gt;Sica, Alan., ed. 2005. Social Thought: From the Enlightenment to the Present. Boston, MA: Pearson Education, Inc. p. 542.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute had had its beginnings in a [[Marxist]] study group started by [[Felix Weil]], a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the Institute.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Horkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise.&lt;ref name="Callinicos, Alex T 2007"&gt;Callinicos, Alex T. 2007. Social Theory: A Historical Introduction. 2nd ed.

Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Ltd. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year publication of the Institute's ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' began, with Horkheimer as its editor.&lt;ref name="marxists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/h/o.htm#horkheimer-max |title=Glossary of People: Ho |publisher=marxists.org|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the Institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis.

During the time between Horkheimer's being named Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930, the Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In the midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis' rise, Horkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the Institute out of Germany.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; Horkheimer's ''[[venia legendi]]'' was revoked by the new [[Nazi]] government because of the Marxian nature of the Institute's ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. When Hitler was named the Chancellor in 1933,&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; the Institute was thus forced to close its location in Germany. He emigrated to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] and then to [[New York City]] the following year, where Horkheimer met with the president of [[Columbia University]] to discuss hosting the Institute. To Horkheimer's surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the Institute.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6063 |title=Biography of Horkheimer at MIT Press |publisher=mitpress.mit.edu |accessdate=2015-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008093915/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6063 |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George. 2011. Sociological Theory. 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1934 Horkheimer accepted an offer from Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their buildings.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt;

In 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades]] district of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]].'' In 1942, Horkheimer assumed the directorship of the Scientific Division of the American Jewish Committee. In this capacity, he helped launch and organize a series of five Studies in Prejudice, which were published in 1949 and 1950. The most important of these was the pioneering study in social psychology entitled The Authoritarian Personality, itself a methodologically advanced reworking of some of the themes treated in a collective project produced by the Institute in its first years of exile, Studies in Authority and Family.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Martin. "Max Horkheimer (1895-1973)." ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'' 47 (1973): 219-20. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/3129918&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit ''Studies in Philosophy and Social Science'' as a continuation of the ''Zeitschrift.'' In 1949, he returned to Frankfurt where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the Institute, while Adorno became director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffst.hr/ENCYCLOPAEDIA/horkheimer.htm Biography of Horkheimer at University of Haifa]&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer and Adorno were seen as the fathers of the Institute.

===Later years===
Horkheimer continued to teach at the University until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and was later named honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/horkheimer/|title=Max Horkheimer (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to America in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]].

===Legacy===
He remained an important figure until his death in [[Nuremberg]] in 1973. Max Horkheimer with the help of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, Otto Kirchheimer, Frederick Pollock and Neumann developed "Critical Theory". According to Larry Ray "Critical Theory" has "become one of the most influential social theories of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Anthony and Larry Ray (eds.). 2003. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers Ltd. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horkheimer's thought==
{{Frankfurt School}}

Horkheimer's work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In this, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both [[neo-Kantianism]] (with its focus on concepts) and ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' (with its focus on expression and [[World disclosure|world-disclosure]]). Horkheimer did not think either was wrong, but insisted that the insights of each school on their own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures, and individual realities, concluding that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the market place. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com"/&gt;

===Critical theory===
Through [[critical theory]] (a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society), Horkheimer "attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism" and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture.&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; Horkheimer helped to create Critical Theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in "pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism".&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; Horkheimer developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980"&gt;Held, David. 1980. Introduction to Critical Theory: Horkheimer to Habermas. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convinced of the need to "examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind"&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that "the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence" was necessary along with a society that could "satisfy common needs".&lt;ref name="Reason, Nostalgia 1985 pp. 160-181"/&gt; To satisfy these needs, it would need to engage with the social conditions within which people lived and in which their concepts and actions were formed. It reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a "critique of bourgeois society through which 'ideology critique' attempted to locate the 'utopian content' of dominant systems of thought".&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996"&gt;Elliott, Anthony and Larry Ray, ed. 1996. Key Contemporary Social Theorists. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices.&lt;ref name="Held, David 1980"/&gt;

=== Writing ===
==== ''Eclipse of Reason'' ====
{{Main|Eclipse of Reason (Horkheimer)}}
Horkheimer's book, ''Eclipse of Reason'', published in 1947, is broken into five sections: Means and Ends, Conflicting Panaceas, The Revolt of Nature, The Rise and Decline of the Individual, and On the Concept of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="oxfordreference.com" /&gt; The 'Eclipse of Reason focuses on the concept of reason within the history of [[western philosophy]], which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking while also linking positivist and instrumental reason with the rise of fascism.&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996" /&gt; He distinguishes between [[objectivity (science)|objective]], [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Instrumental rationality|instrumental]] reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant – the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be "reasonable" in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be "good for something else". This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes [[ideology]]. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). Because subjective/instrumental reason rules, the [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] of a society, for example [[democratic ideals]], become dependent on the "interests" of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. In his writing Horkheimer states, "Social power is today more than ever mediated by power over things. The more intense an individual's concern with power over things, the more will things dominate him, the more will he lack any genuine individual traits, and the more will his mind be transformed into an automation of formalized reason."&lt;ref&gt;Sica, Alan 2005. "Social Thought : From the Enlightenment to The Present." (p. 542-546). Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Horkheimer admits that objective reason has its roots in Reason ("[[Logos]]" in Greek) of the subject. He concludes, "If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate – in short, the emancipation from fear – then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render."&lt;ref&gt;Eclipse of Reason, Seabury Press, 1974 [1941]. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=nuzj9LLrKlgC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=max+horkheimer#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Eclipse of Reason| isbn=9780826400093| last1=Horkheimer| first1=Max| date=1974-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Horkheimer outlined how the [[Nazis]] had been able to make their agenda appear "reasonable", but also issued a warning about the possibility of a similar occurrence happening again. Horkheimer believed that the illnesses of modern society are caused by misunderstanding reason: if people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to solve problems they may have.

Despite the explicit common referrals to "subjective" reason in the book, his frequent connecting of it with [[relativism]] could be an indication that by "subjective reason" Horkheimer also means "relativist reason".

==== Between philosophy and social science ====
"Between Philosophy and Social Science" appeared between 1930 and 1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: "Materialism and Morality", "The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research", "On the Problem of Truth", "Egoism and the Freedom Movement", "History and Psychology", "A New Concept of Ideology", "Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology", and "The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy". It also included "The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research", "Egoism and Freedom Movements" and "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History". The essays within "Between Philosophy and Social Science" were Horkheimer's attempts to "remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the [[commodification]] of everything".&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957"&gt;W. G. Regier MLN, Vol. 110, No. 4, Comparative Literature Issue (Sep., 1995), pp. 953-957 Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. In one of his writings, he states, "When we speak of an individual as a historical entity, we mean not merely the space-time and the sense existence of a particular member of the human race, but in addition, his awareness of his own individuality as a conscious human being, including recognition of his own identity.".&lt;ref&gt;Sica, Alan. 2005. "Social Thought : From the Enlightenment to The Present". (p. 542-546). Pennsylvania State University: Pearson, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Horkheimer was a strong believer in individuals becoming aware of themselves and their conscious as human beings. This is important to Horkheimer because for workers, he is aware of individuals losing their identity in products, which affects the power an individual may have of him/herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Charles. 2010. "Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings." (p. 208-212). Westview Press, A Member of the Perseus Books Group&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research" was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer's inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well.&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt;

"Egoism and Freedom Movements" and "Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History" are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained "what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving.&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt;

The volume also looks at the individual as the "troubled center of philosophy." Horkheimer expressed that "there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time".&lt;ref name="G. Regier MLN 1995 pp. 953-957" /&gt; To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself.

==== ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' ====
Max Horkheimer and [[Theodor Adorno]] collaborated to publish ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', which was originally published in 1944. The inspiration for this piece came from when Horkheimer and Adorno had to flee Germany, because of Hitler, and go to New York. They went to America and "absorbed the popular culture"; thinking that it was a form of totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. 2008. "Slamming Society: Critical Theory and Situationism." p.106 in ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Don Mills&lt;!--publisher--&gt;; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Dialectic of Enlightenment's main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the "self-destruction of enlightenment".&lt;ref name="Elliott 1996" /&gt; The work criticized popular culture as "the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing" (Lembert). Along with that, Horkheimer and Adorno had a few arguments; one being that these mass-produced products only appear to change over time. Horkheimer and Adorno stated that these products were so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They expressed, "the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 [1944]). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products within the same area are acceptable.&lt;ref name="Lembert, Charles 2010"&gt;Lembert, Charles. 2010. ''Social Theory: The Multicultural and Classic Readings''. 4th ed. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The similar patterns found in the content of popular culture (films, popular songs and radio) have the same central message; "it's all linked to "the necessity of obedience of the masses to the social hierarchy in place in advanced capitalist societies".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Douglas. 2008. "Slamming Society: Critical Theory and Situationism." p. 107 in ''Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory''. Don Mills&lt;!--publisher--&gt;; Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These products appeal to the masses and encourage conformity to the consumers. In return, capitalism remains in power while buyers continue to consume from the industry. This is dangerous because the consumers' belief that the powers of technology are liberating, starts to increase. To support their claim, Horkheimer and Adorno, "proposed an antidote: not just thinking the relations of things, but also, as an immediate second step, thinking through that thinking, self-reflectively". In other words, technology lacks self-reflectivity. Nonetheless, Horkheimer and Adorno believed that art was an exception because it "is an open-ended system with no fixed rules"; thus, it could not be an object of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Noel and Stuart Sim., ed. 1997. The A Guide to Modern Social and Political Theorists. Prentice Hall: London. pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
[[Perry Anderson]] sees Horkheimer's attempt to make the Institute purely academic as "symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a 'Western Marxism' divorced from the working-class movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the 'product of defeat'" because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggerhaus, author of ''The Frankfurt School'' believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Lukács and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, "Social Theory", Alex Callinicos claims that ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent.&lt;ref name="Callinicos, Alex T 2007"/&gt; Charles Lemert discusses in his book ''Social Theory'' that in writing ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.&lt;ref name="Lembert, Charles 2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Mind at Large''' is a [[concept]] from ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' and ''[[Heaven and Hell (essay)|Heaven and Hell]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]]. This philosophy was influenced by the ideas of [[C. D. Broad]]. [[Psychedelic drug]]s are thought to disable filters which inhibit or quell signals related to mundane functions from reaching the conscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Psychedelic Experience FAQ|url=https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_experience_faq.shtml#4f|website=Erowid|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aforementioned books, Huxley explores the idea that the human mind filters reality, partly because handling the details of all of the impressions and images coming in would be unbearable, partly because it has been taught to do so. He believes that [[psychoactive drug]]s can partly remove this filter, which leaves the drug user exposed to Mind at Large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=The Doors of Perception|date=1954|publisher=Perennial Classics|isbn=0-06-059518-3|page=6|url=https://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfPerception.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an experiment with British psychiatrist, [[Humphrey Osmond]], Huxley was administered [[mescaline]], and was prompted by Osmond to comment on the various stimuli around him, such as books and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=The Doors of Perception|date=1954|publisher=Perennial Classics|isbn=0-06-059518-3|page=5|url=https://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfPerception.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation that was recorded in Huxley's book mainly concerned his thoughts on what he said in the recordings. He observed that everyday objects lose their functionality, and suddenly exist "as such"; space and dimension become irrelevant, with perceptions seemingly being enlarged, and at times even overwhelming.

According to ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]],

{{quote|Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful. According to such a theory, each one of us is potentially Mind at Large.}}
 
In ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Huxley also stated: "In the final stage of [[ego death|egolessness]] there is an 'obscure knowledge' that All is in all—that All is actually each. This is as near, I take it, as a finite mind can ever come to 'perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.'"

The Mind at Large is also the name of a psychedelic blues band, from Greater Manchester, who have gained an audience due to their underground free acid parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://themindatlarge.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

His full name is given as '''Sayyed Mir Abulqasim Astarabadi''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: سید ابولقاسم استرآبادی), and he is famously known as Fendereski.  He lived for a while in [[Isfahan]] at the same time as [[Mir Damad]] spent a great part of his life in India among [[yogis]] and [[Zoroastrians]], and learnt certain things from them.  He was patronized by both the [[Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] courts.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mir-fendereski-sayyed-amir-abul-qasem  Encyclopedia Iranica, "Mir Fenderski" by Sajjad.

== Life ==
Mir Fendereski remains a mysterious and enigmatic figure about whom we know very little.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;  He was probably born around 1562-1563 and that he died age eighty.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

Mir Fendereski was trained in the works of [[Avicenna]] as he thought the Avicennian medical and philosophical compendiums of al-Qanun (The Canon) and Al-Shifa (The Cure) in [[Isfahan]].

== Works ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

A number of works are attributed to him, although these have not been studied in detail.  He made extensive commentary on the Persian translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (''Razm-Nama'' in Persian) and the philosophical text of the ''[[Yoga Vasistha]]''.  "Resâle Sanaie", "Resâleh dar kimiyâ"  and "Šahre ketabe mahârat", in Persian language, are some of his most famous works.  Also, his criticism of the Persian translation of the ''Yoga Vasistha'' indicates he was familiar with [[Sanskrit]].

He was also a poet and composed a long philosophical ode (qaṣida ḥekmiya) in imitation of and response to the Persian Ismaʿili thinker [[Nasir Khusraw]].  His best-known work is titled ''al-Resāla al-ṣenāʿiya'', an examination of the arts and professions within an ideal society. The importance of this treatise is that it combines a number of genres and subject areas: political and ethical thought, mirrors-for-princes, metaphysics, and the critical subject of the classifications of the sciences.&lt;ref name="Iranica"/&gt;

The '''Missionaries of the Assumption''' is a religious congregation of women. It is actually a spin-off from the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption, which was founded April 1, 1989 by Archbishop Louis Joseph Arthur Melanson in [[Campbellton, New Brunswick]], Canada. The new community started with twenty-nine Sisters from the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption whose main apostolate is education. Upon their arrival in [[Davao City]], the FMA Sisters, as they are popularly called, established schools in many parts of the then Davao Province, presently composed of Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental and the newly created Compostela Valley Province.

The sisters exposure to the harsh realities of the people they serve, many members of the FMA were challenged to discover a new meaning and insight with their [[charism]]. These sisters have an increasing desire to respond actively and creatively to the current conditions and needs of the People of God. Thus, they were driven to redefine their presence to the communities refounding an entirely new character to the congregation. 

Their charism articulated their main apostolate: "We the Missionaries of the Assumption, are called to witness to the incarnate Christ's option for the poor, through active participation in the Church's works of evangelization. In fidelity to the Church and inspired by Mary's Assumption, we live this out with hope and joy."

The twenty-nine sisters became the founding group together with the late Archbishop Antonio LI. Mabutas of the Archdiocese of Davao as canonical founder.

The Missionaries of the Assumption chose their initial as m.a. and have opted to become a [[Society of Apostolic Life]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Their constitution stresses that the sisters should be discerning and participative in the apostolic activities that bring them into solidarity with the poor in their struggle for justice, full life and total human liberation, and to participate in the missionary works that bring about the restoration of harmony and balance in the life systems of the Mother Earth.

Today the m.a. sisters are engaged in the following ministries and apostolates: Indigenous Peoples, Health, Women and Children, Parish Work, School and conducting retreats, seminars and Growth Sessions.

The sisters are present at the following ecclesiastical areas: [[Archdiocese of Davao]], Diocese of Butuan, Prelature of Marawi, Diocese of Antipolo, and the Archdiocese of Honiara in the [[Solomon Islands]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6485">'''Multiplicity''' ({{lang-fr|multiplicité}}) is an assertion that there is more than one geo-[[historical trajectory]]. It is a philosophical concept developed by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Henri Bergson]] from [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s description of the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|mathematical concept]].&lt;ref&gt;"It was Riemann in the field of physics and mathematics who dreamed about the notion of 'multiplicity' and other different kinds of multiplicities. The philosophical importance of this notion then appeared in Husserl's ''Formal and Transcendental Logic'', as well as in Bergson's ''Essay on the Immediate Given of Awareness''" (Deleuze 1986, 13).&lt;/ref&gt; It forms an important part of the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]], particularly in his collaboration with [[Félix Guattari]], ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–80). In his ''Foucault'' (1986), Deleuze describes [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969) as "the most decisive step yet taken in the theory-practice of multiplicities."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1986, 14).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The philosopher Jonathan Roffe describes Deleuze's concept of Multiplicity as follows: "A  multiplicity  is,  in  the  most  basic  sense,  a  complex  structure  that does not reference a prior unity. Multiplicities are not parts of a greater whole that have been fragmented, and they cannot be considered manifold expressions of a single concept or transcendent unity. On these grounds, Deleuze opposes the dyad One/Many, in all of its forms, with multiplicity. Further, he insists that the crucial point is to consider multiplicity in its substantive form – a multiplicity – rather than as an adjective – as multiplicity of something. Everything for Deleuze is a multiplicity in this fashion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deleuze Dictionary: the revised edition|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze argues in his commentary ''Bergsonism'' (1966) that the notion of multiplicity forms a central part of Bergson's critique of philosophical [[Negativity (philosophy)|negativity]] and the [[dialectic]]al method. The theory of multiplicities, he explains, must be distinguished from traditional philosophical problems of "the One and the Multiple."&lt;ref&gt;"Multiplicity remains completely indifferent to the traditional problems of the multiple and the one, and above all to the problem of a subject who would think through this multiplicity, give it conditions, account for its origins, and so on. There is neither one nor multiple, which would at all events entail having recourse to a consciousness that would be regulated by the one and developed by the other" (Deleuze 1986, 14).&lt;/ref&gt; By opposing "the One and the Multiple," dialectical philosophy claims "to reconstruct the real," but this claim is false, Bergson argues, since it "involves abstract concepts that are much too general."&lt;ref&gt;See Deleuze (1966, 38-47); The dialectical method "compensates for the inadequacy of a concept that is too broad or too general by invoking the opposite concept, which is no less broad and general [. . .]. The concrete will never be attained by combining the inadequacy of one concept with the inadequacy of its opposite. The singular will never be attained by correcting a generality with another generality" (Deleuze 1966, 44).&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of referring to "the Multiple in general", Bergson's theory of multiplicities distinguishes between two types of multiplicity: continuous multiplicities and discrete multiplicities (a distinction that he developed from [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]).&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze (1966, 39).&lt;/ref&gt; The features of this distinction may be tabulated as follows:

'''Murray Bookchin''' (January 14, 1921 – July 30, 2006)&lt;ref name="Guardian-20060808"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Mike |title=Murray Bookchin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/08/guardianobituaries.usa |accessdate=30 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=2006-08-08 |format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] social theorist, author, orator, historian, and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]]. A pioneer in the [[ecology movement]],&lt;ref&gt;John Muir Institute for Environmental Studies, University of New Mexico, Environmental Philosophy, Inc, [[University of Georgia]], ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' v.12 1990: 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]] and [[urban planning]], within anarchist, [[libertarian socialist]], and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]]'' (1962), ''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' (1971), ''[[The Ecology of Freedom]]'' (1982) and ''Urbanization Without Cities'' (1987). In the late-1990s he became disenchanted with the increasingly apolitical [[lifestyle anarchism|lifestylism]] of the contemporary anarchist movement, stopped referring to himself as an anarchist, and founded his own libertarian socialist ideology called [[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]], which seeks to reconcile [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. "The Future of the Left," ''The Next Revolution: Popular Assemblies and the Promise of Direct Democracy''. New York: Verso Books, 2015. pp. 157-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/janet-biehl-bookchin-breaks-with-anarchism.html Biehl, Janet. "Bookchin Breaks with Anarchism". ''Communalism'' October 2007: 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin was a prominent [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and advocate of society's [[decentralisation]] along ecological and democratic lines. His ideas have influenced social movements since the 1960s, including the New Left, the Anti-Nuclear Movement, the Anti-Globalization Movement, Occupy Wall Street, and more recently, the [[democratic confederalism]] of [[Rojava]]. He was a central figure in the American Green Movement and the Burlington Greens.

==Biography==
Bookchin was born in [[New York City]] to [[Russia]]n [[Jewish]] immigrants&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20031028142620228 ''The Murray Bookchin Reader: Introduction''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014123810/http://www.social-ecology.org/article.php?story=20031028142620228 |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/reader/intro.html |title=The Murray Bookchin Reader: Intro |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Bookchin and Rose (Kaluskaya) Bookchin. He grew up in the [[Bronx]], where his grandmother, Zeitel, a Socialist Revolutionary, imbued him with Russian populist ideas. After her death in 1930, he joined the [[Pioneer movement|Young Pioneers]], the Communist youth organization (for children 9 to 14)&lt;ref name="youtube2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd0hxVUIQvk |title=''Anarchism In America'' documentary |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Young Communist League]] (for older children) in 1935. He attended the [[New York Workers School|Workers School]] near Union Square, where he studied [[Marxism]]. In the late 1930s he broke with [[Stalinism]] and gravitated toward [[Trotskyism]], joining the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP).  In the early 1940s he worked in a foundry in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]] where he was an organizer and shop steward for the [[United Electrical Workers]] as well as a recruiter for the SWP. Within the SWP he adhered to the Goldman-[[Felix Morrow|Morrow]] faction, which broke away after the war ended. He was an auto worker and UAW member at the time of the great General Motors strike of 1945-46. In 1949, while speaking to a Zionist youth organization at City College, Bookchin met a mathematics student, Beatrice Appelstein, whom he married in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Andy. ''The Independent'' {{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/murray-bookchin-412486.html |title=Murray Bookchin, Political philosopher and activist who became a founder of the ecological movement" August 19, 2006 |accessdate=2012-11-11 | location=London |work=The Independent |date=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married for 12 years and lived together for 35, remaining close friends and political allies for the rest of his life. They had two children, Debbie, and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/us/07bookchin.html?_r=0 |title=Murray Bookchin, 85, Writer, Activist and Ecology Theorist Dies August 7, 2006 |accessdate=2012-11-11 | work=The New York Times |first=Douglas |last=Martin |date=2006-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1947, he collaborated with a fellow lapsed Trotskyist, the German expatriate Josef Weber, in New York in the [[Movement for a Democracy of Content]], a group of 20 or so post-Trotskyists who collectively edited the periodical ''[[The Movement For a Democracy of Content|Contemporary Issues – A Magazine for a Democracy of Content]]''. ''Contemporary Issues'' embraced utopianism. The periodical provided a forum for the belief that previous attempts to create utopia had foundered on the necessity of toil and drudgery; but now modern technology had obviated the need for human toil, a liberatory development. To achieve this "post-scarcity" society, Bookchin developed a theory of ecological decentralism. The magazine published Bookchin's first articles, including the pathbreaking "The Problem of Chemicals in Food" (1952). In 1958, Bookchin defined himself as an [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name="youtube2007"/&gt; seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology. His first book, ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]],'' was published under the [[pseudonym]] Lewis Herber in 1962, a few months before [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf "The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring"], Sage Open, 3(July):1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/bio1.html |title=''A Short Biography of Murray Bookchin'' by Janet Biehl |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism.

In 1964, Bookchin joined the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE), and protested racism at the [[1964 World's Fair]]. During 1964-67, while living on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]], he cofounded and was the principal figure in the New York Federation of Anarchists. His groundbreaking essay "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" introduced [[ecology]] as a concept in radical politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/ecologyandrev.html |title=Ecology and Revolution |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=2004-06-16 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he founded another group that published the influential ''Anarchos'' magazine, which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy, and on decentralization and miniaturization. Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the [[counterculture]]. His widely republished 1969 essay ''Listen, Marxist!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasalam.org/bkchn06.htm |title=Listen, Marxist! |publisher=Nasalam.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; warned [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (in vain) against an impending takeover by a Marxist group. "Once again the dead are walking in our midst," he wrote, "ironically, draped in the name of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth century. So the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody, in turn, the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 and the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] of 1918-1920, with its 'class line,' its [[Bolshevik]] Party, its '[[Dictatorship of the proletariat|proletarian dictatorship]],' its [[puritanical]] morality, and even its slogan, '[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] power'".&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2006-07-31) [http://reason.com/blog/2006/07/31/murray-bookchin-rip Murray Bookchin, RIP], ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]''&lt;/ref&gt; These and other influential 1960s essays are anthologized in ''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' (1971)

In 1969-1970, he taught at Alternate U, a counter-cultural radical school based on 14th Street in [[Manhattan]]. In 1971, he moved to Burlington, Vermont with a group of friends, to put into practice his ideas of decentralization. In the fall of 1973, he was hired by [[Goddard College]] to lecture on technology; his lectures led to a teaching position and to the creation of the Social Ecology Studies program in 1974 and the Institute for Social Ecology soon thereafter, of which he became the director. In 1974, he was hired by [[Ramapo College]] in [[Mahwah, New Jersey]], where he quickly became a full professor. The ISE was a hub for experimentation and study of [[appropriate technology]] in the 1970s. In 1977-78 he was a member of the Spruce Mountain Affinity Group of the [[Clamshell Alliance]]. Also in 1977, he published ''[[The Spanish Anarchists]]'', a history of [[anarchism in Spain|the Spanish anarchist movement]] up to the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|revolution of 1936]]. During this period, Bookchin forged some ties with the nascent [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] movement. "He spoke at a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] convention and contributed to a newsletter edited by [[Karl Hess]]. In 1976, he told a Libertarian activist that 'If I were a voting man, I'd vote for MacBride' — LP nominee [[Roger MacBride]], that is."&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt; Bookchin's affiliations to libertarianism during this period reflect his disillusionment with the authoritarianism of Marxist-Leninists, resulting in him stating in a 1979 interview with Jeff Riggenbach that he felt closer to free-market libertarians who defend the rights of the individual at least when compared to the totalitarian Marxist-Leninists.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Walker, https://reason.com/blog/2006/07/31/murray-bookchin-rip&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Bookchin rejected the types of libertarianism that advocated unconstrained individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, What is Communalism? - The Democratic Dimension of Anarchism (http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/CMMNL2.MCW.html)&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''From Urbanization to Cities'' (published in 1987 as ''The Rise of Urbanization and the Decline of Citizenship''), Bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept. A few years later, ''The Politics of Social Ecology'', written by his partner of 19 years, [[Janet Biehl]], briefly summarized these ideas.

In 1995, Bookchin lamented the decline of [[American anarchism]] into primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-situationism, individual self-expression, and "ad hoc adventurism," at the expense of forming a social movement. Arthur Verslius said, "Bookchin... describes himself as a 'social anarchist' because he looks forward to a (gentle) societal revolution.... Bookchin has lit out after those whom he terms 'lifestyle anarchists.'"&lt;ref&gt;Verslius, Arthur (2005-06-20) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/death-of-the-left/ Death of the Left?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism'' in 1995, criticizing this tendency, was startling to anarchists. Thereafter Bookchin concluded that American anarchism was essentially individualistic and broke with anarchism publicly in 1999. He placed his ideas into a new political ideology: [[Communalism (political philosophy)|Communalism]] (spelled with a capital "C" to differentiate it from other forms of communalism), a form of [[libertarian socialism]] that retains his ideas about assembly democracy and the necessity of [[decentralization]] of settlement, power/money/influence, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.

In addition to his political writings, Bookchin wrote extensively on philosophy, calling his ideas [[dialectical naturalism]].&lt;ref name="EoF-2005" /&gt;{{RP|31}} The [[dialectical]] writings of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], which articulate a developmental philosophy of change and growth, seemed to him to lend themselves to an organic, even ecological approach.&lt;ref name="EoF-2005" /&gt;{{RP|96-97}} Although Hegel "exercised a considerable influence" on Bookchin, he was not, in any sense, a Hegelian.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, Murray. ''The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism''. Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1996. p.x&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical writings emphasize [[humanism]], [[rationality]], and the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin (1982), The Ecology of Freedom, USA, Cheshire Books, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re-Enchanting Humanity'', London: Cassell, 1995, amongst other works.&lt;/ref&gt; His last major published work was ''The Third Revolution'', a four-volume history of the libertarian movements in European and American revolutions.

He continued to teach at the ISE until 2004. Bookchin died of [[congestive heart failure]] on July 30, 2006, at his home in Burlington at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murray Bookchin, visionary social theorist, dies at 85|url=http://nyc.indymedia.org/or/2006/07/74070.html|publisher=the new york city independent media center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General sociological and psychological views===
Bookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies. In ''The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy,'' he says that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My use of the word [[hierarchy]] in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a "classless" or "libertarian" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of Hierarchy. CHESHIRE BOOKS. Palo Alto. 1982. Pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ians, it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day-not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of Hierarchy. CHESHIRE BOOKS. Palo Alto. 1982. Pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Humanity's environmental predicament===
Murray Bookchin's clarion call about humanity's collision course with the natural world, [[Our Synthetic Environment]], was published six months before [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]].''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The next revolution: Popular assemblies and the promise of direct democracy (with a foreword by Ursula K. Le Guin)|last=Bookchin|first=Murray|publisher=Verso|year=2015|isbn=978-1-78168-581-5|editor-last=Bookchin, Debbie and Taylor, Blair|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin rejected [[Barry Commoner]]'s belief that the environmental crisis could be traced to technological choices, [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]]'s views that it could be traced to overpopulation, or the even more pessimistic view that traces this crisis to human nature.  Rather, Bookchin felt that our environmental predicament is the result of the cancerous logic of capitalism, a system aimed at maximizing profit instead of enriching human lives: "By the very logic of its grow-or-die imperative, capitalism may well be producing ecological crises that gravely imperil the integrity of life on this planet."

The solution to this crisis is not a return to the xenophobia and constant warfare of hunter-gatherer societies.  Bookchin likewise opposed "a politics of mere protest, lacking programmatic content, a proposed alternative, and a movement to give people direction and continuity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  We need&lt;blockquote&gt;"a constant awareness that a given society's irrationality is deep seated, that its serious pathologies are not isolated problems that can be cured piecemeal but must be solved by sweeping changes in the often hidden sources of crisis and suffering—that awareness alone is what can hold a movement together, give it continuity, preserve its message and organization beyond a given generation, and expand its ability to deal with new issues and developments."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The answer then lies in Communalism, a system encompassing a [[Direct democracy|directly democratic]] political organization anchored in loosely confederated popular assemblies, decentralization of power, absence of domination of any kind, and replacing capitalism with human-centered forms of production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Social ecology===

In the history of political ecology, social ecology is not a movement but a theory primarily associated with Bookchin and elaborated over his body of work.&lt;ref name="Light1998 p5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Light|first=Andrew|title=Social Ecology After Bookchin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUdO5qzw-rgC|year=1998|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-57230-379-9 |ref=harv |p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He presents a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third "thinking nature" beyond biochemistry and physiology, which he argues is a more complete, conscious, ethical, and rational nature. Humanity, by this line of thought, is the latest development from the long history of organic development on Earth. Bookchin's social ecology proposes ethical principles for replacing a society's propensity for hierarchy and domination with that of democracy and freedom.&lt;ref name="Stokols2018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokols|first=Daniel|title=Social Ecology in the Digital Age: Solving Complex Problems in a Globalized World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4mZDgAAQBAJ|year=2018|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-803114-8|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin wrote about the effects of urbanization on human life in the early 1960s during his participation in the civil rights and related social movements. Bookchin then began to pursue the connection between ecological and social issues, culminating with his best-known book, ''The Ecology of Freedom'', which he had developed over a decade.{{sfn|Light|1998|p=5–6}} His argument, that human domination and destruction of nature follows from social domination between humans, was a breakthrough position in the growing field of ecology. Life develops from self-organization and evolutionary cooperation ([[symbiosis]]).{{sfn|Light|1998|p=6}} Bookchin writes of preliterate societies organized around mutual need but ultimately overrun by institutions of hierarchy and domination, such as city-states and capitalist economies, which he attributes uniquely to societies of humans and not communities of animals.{{sfn|Light|1998|p=7}} He proposes confederation between communities of humans run through democracy rather than through administrative logistics.{{sfn|Light|1998|p=8}}

===Libertarian municipalism===
Starting in the 1970s, Bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the [[Municipality|municipal]] level. In "The Next Revolution", Bookchin stresses the link that libertarian municipalism has with his earlier philosophy of social ecology. He writes:

"Libertarian Municipalism constitutes the politics of social ecology, a revolutionary effort in which freedom is given institutional form in public assemblies that become decision-making bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin (2015), The Next Revolution, London, Verso Press, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin proposes that these institutional forms must take place within differently scaled local areas. In a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way: "The overriding problem is to change the structure of society so that people gain power. The best arena to do that is the municipality—the city, town, and village—where we have an opportunity to create a face-to-face democracy."&lt;ref name = Vanek&gt;Murray Bookchin, interview by David Vanek (October 1, 2001) ''[[Harbinger (zine)|Harbinger]], a Journal of Social Ecology,'' Vol. 2 No. 1. Institute for Social Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 Bookchin used the term "libertarian municipalism", to describe a system in which [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]] institutions of directly [[democracy|democratic]] assemblies would oppose and replace the [[State (polity)|state]] with a confederation of free municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (October 1991). [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/gp/perspectives24.html ''Libertarian Municipalism: An Overview.''] ''Green Perspectives,'' No. 24. Burlington, VT.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers—the municipal confederations and the nation-state—cannot coexist.&lt;ref name = Vanek/&gt; Its supporters—Communalists—believe it to be the means to achieve a rational society, and its structure becomes the organization of society.

==Legacy and influence==
Though Bookchin, by his own recognition, failed to win over a substantial body of supporters during his own lifetime, his ideas have nonetheless influenced movements and thinkers across the globe.

Notable among these is the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK), an organisation in Turkey which has [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict|fought the Turkish state]] since the 1980s to try to secure greater political and cultural rights for the country's [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]. Though founded on a rigid [[Marxist–Leninist]] ideology, the PKK has seen a shift in its thought and aims since the capture and imprisonment of its leader, [[Abdullah Öcalan]], in 1999. Öcalan began reading a variety of post-Marxist political theory while in prison, and found particular currency in Bookchin's works.&lt;ref name="biehl dialectics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/articles/bookchin-öcalan-and-dialectics-democracy|title=Bookchin, Öcalan, and the Dialectics of Democracy|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=16 February 2012|publisher=New Compass|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Jong|first1=Alex|title=The New-Old PKK|journal=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=March 2016|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/pkk-ocalan-kurdistan-isis-murray-bookchin/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Öcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with Bookchin through his lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's "student" eager to adapt his thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to accept the request. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message "My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as "one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century", and vowed to put his theory into practice.&lt;ref name="biehl dialectics"/&gt;

"Democratic Confederalism", the variation on Communalism developed by Öcalan in his writings and adopted by the PKK, does not outwardly seek Kurdish rights within the context of the formation of an independent state separate from Turkey. The PKK claims that this project is not envisioned as being only for Kurds, but rather for all peoples of the region, regardless of their ethnic, national, or religious background. Rather, it promulgates the formation of assemblies and organisations beginning at the grassroots level to enact its ideals in a non-state framework beginning at the local level. It also places a particular emphasis on securing and promoting [[women's rights]].&lt;ref name="biehl dialectics"/&gt; The PKK has had some success in implementing its programme, through organisations such as the Democratic Society Congress (DTK), which coordinates political and social activities within Turkey, and the [[Koma Civakên Kurdistan]] (KCK), which does so across all countries where Kurds live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new-compass.net/article/kurdish-communalism|title=Kurdish Communalism|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=9 October 2011|publisher=New Compass|accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3402">'''Ohio Public Interest Research Group''' ('''Ohio PIRG''') is a [[non-profit organization]] that is part of the state [[Public Interest Research Groups|PIRG]] organizations. It works on a variety of political activities. 

In the United States, Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) are [[non-profit organization]]s that employ [[grassroots]] organizing, direct advocacy, [[investigative journalism]], and [[Law suit|litigation]] to affect public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. PIRG: About Us |url=http://www.uspirg.org/page/usp/about-us |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

Ohio PIRG's mission is to deliver persistent, result-oriented public interest activism that protects our environment, encourages a fair, sustainable economy, and fosters responsive, democratic government.&lt;ref name="Project Vote Smart"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Project Vote Smart |url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/826/ohio-public-interest-research-group#.UoEDluI7eNM |title=Ohio PIRG"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. [[college]] campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book ''[[Action for a Change]]'' by [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Donald K. Ross (author)|Donald Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|author2=Donald Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other early accomplishments, the PIRGs were responsible for much of the [[Container deposit legislation#United States|Container Container Deposit Legislation in the United States]], also known as "bottle bills."&lt;ref name="Boston College, The Heights, Volume LVI, Number 4, 22 September 1975"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=bcheights19750922.2.30|title=PIRG Backs "Bottle Bill"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Sun Sentinel]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-08/news/9102150529_1_bottle-bill-beverage-containers-industry-recycling-program|title=Bottle Bill Beverage Containers Recycling Program"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations." [[Emma Goldman]]. "What it Really Stands for Anarchy" in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows "They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg."

(pg. 9)...Bakunin did not convert the League's central committee to his full program, but he did persuade them to accept a remarkably radical recommendation to the Berne Congress of September 1868, demanding economic equality and implicitly attacking authority in both Church and State."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brown |first=L.

==Anarchist schools of thought==
[[File:Anarchist flags and stars.svg|thumb|The bisected flags/stars which [[anarchist symbolism|symbolize]] various [[anarchist schools of thought]]. Note that these are not necessarily mutually exclusive; for example, a pacifist can be a communist.]]

[[Anarchist schools of thought]] – Anarchism has many heterogeneous and diverse [[schools of thought]], united by a common opposition to compulsory rule. Anarchist schools are characterized by "the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary", but may differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme [[individualism]] to complete [[collectivism]].&lt;ref name=slevin1&gt;Slevin, Carl. "Anarchism". ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics''. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, some are viewed as being compatible, and it is not uncommon for individuals to subscribe to more than one.
* [[Anarchism without adjectives]] – in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, "referred to an unhyphenated form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as communist, collectivist, mutualist, or individualist. For others, ... [it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools."&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard "Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868-1898" [p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Anarchist communism]] – theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wages and private property (while retaining respect for personal property),&lt;ref&gt;"The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people." [[Alexander Berkman]]. "[[Now and After|What Is Communist Anarchism?]]" [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Alexander_Berkman__What_Is_Communist_Anarchism_.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and in favor of common ownership of the means of production,&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Communist+anarchism+belives+in+collective+ownership |title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms Alan James Mayne Published 1999 Greenwood Publishing Group 316 pages ISBN 0-275-96151-6 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Communist+anarchism+believes+in+common+ownership#PPA13,M1 |title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls By Know-It-Alls For Know-It-Alls, For Know-It-Alls |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC. |date= January 2008|accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; direct democracy, and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need".&lt;ref&gt;Fabbri, Luigi.

* [[Anarcho-capitalism]] –  political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and open markets. Anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of statute (law by decree or legislation), society would improve itself through the discipline of the free market (or what its proponents describe as a "voluntary society").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Morris |first=Andrew |authorlink= |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |title= Anarcho-capitalism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi= 10.4135/9781412965811.n8|isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=13–14 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stringham51&gt;Edward Stringham, ''Anarchy and the law: the political economy of choice,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nft4e62nicsC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=anarcho-capitalism+libertarian&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=anarcho-capitalism%20libertarian p. 51]&lt;/ref&gt; See [[anarchism and capitalism]].
* [[Anarcha-feminism]] – combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the state.
* [[Anarcho-naturism]] – union of anarchist and naturist philosophies,&lt;ref&gt;"Anarchism and the different Naturist views have always been related."[http://www.naturismo.org/adn/ediciones/2003/invierno/7e.html "Anarchism – Nudism, Naturism" by Carlos Ortega at Asociacion para el Desarrollo Naturista de la Comunidad de Madrid.

In the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity."[http://www.radical.org.uk/nudism/radical.htm "Nudism the radical tradition" by Terry Phillips] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911041132/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radical.org.uk%2Fnudism%2Fradical.htm |date=2012-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that advocates vegetarianism, free love, nudism, hiking and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them. Anarcho-naturism also promotes an ecological worldview, small [[ecovillage]]s, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the [[artificiality]] of the [[Industrialisation|industrial]] [[mass society]] of modernity.
* [[Anarcho-pacifism]] – tendency within the [[anarchist]] movement which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change and the abolition of the state.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]].

== History of anarchism ==
[[File:HaymarketMartyrs.jpg|thumb|The execution of the Haymarket martyrs following the [[Haymarket affair]] of 1886 inspired a new generation of anarchists.]]

[[History of anarchism]] – Although social movements and philosophies with anarchic qualities predate anarchism, anarchism as a specific [[political philosophy]] began in 1840 with the publication of ''[[What Is Property?]]'' by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. In the following decades it spread from [[Western Europe]] to various regions, countries, and continents, impacting local social movements. The success of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] in [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] initiated a decline in prominence for anarchism in the mid-20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Avrich |title=[[The Russian Anarchists]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2006 |isbn=1-904859-48-8 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; roughly coinciding with the time period referred to by historians as ''[[The short twentieth century]]''. Since the late 1980s, anarchism has begun a gradual return to the world stage.

==General anarchism concepts==

[[Anarchist terminology]] –
These are concepts which, although not exclusive to [[anarchism]], are significant in historical and/or modern anarchist circles. As the anarchist milieu is philosophically [[heterogeneous]], there is disagreement over which of these concepts should play a role in anarchism.

{{French literature sidebar}}
'''Ambroise Paul Toussaint Jules Valéry''' ({{IPA-fr|pɔl valeʁi|lang}}; 30 October 1871 – 20 July 1945) was a French poet, essayist, and philosopher.  In addition to his poetry and fiction (drama and dialogues), his interests included [[aphorism]]s on art, history, letters, music, and current events. Valéry was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 12 different years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=9496&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Valéry was born to a [[Corsican people|Corsican]] father and [[Genoa|Genoese]]-[[Istria]]n mother in [[Sète]], a town on the Mediterranean coast of the [[Hérault]], but he was raised in [[Montpellier]], a larger urban center close by. After a traditional [[Roman Catholic]] education, he studied law at university and then resided in Paris for most of the remainder of his life, where he was, for a while, part of the circle of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].

In 1900, he married Jeannie Gobillard, a friend of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]'s family, who was also a niece of the painter [[Berthe Morisot]]. The wedding was a double ceremony in which the bride's cousin, Morisot's daughter, [[Julie Manet]], married the painter Ernest Rouart.&lt;ref&gt;*Manet, Julie, Rosalind de Boland Roberts, and Jane Roberts. ''Growing Up with the Impressionists: The Diary of Julie Manet''. London: Sotheby's Publications, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Valéry and Gobillard had three children: Claude, Agathe and François.

Valéry served as a juror with [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]], a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to young French painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{cite web | title = Florence Meyer Blumenthal | publisher = Jewish Women's Archive, Michele Siegel | url = http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/blumenthal-florence-meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though his earliest publications date from his mid-twenties, Valéry did not become a full-time writer until 1920, when the man for whom he worked as private secretary, a former chief executive of the [[Havas]] news agency, Edouard Lebey, died of [[Parkinson's disease]].  Until then, Valéry had, briefly, earned his living at the Ministry of War before assuming the relatively flexible post as assistant to the increasingly impaired Lebey, a job he held for some twenty years.

After his election to the [[Académie française]] in 1925, Valéry became a tireless public speaker and intellectual figure in French society, touring Europe and giving lectures on cultural and social issues as well as assuming a number of official positions eagerly offered to him by an admiring French nation. He represented France on cultural matters at the [[League of Nations]], and he served on several of its committees, including the sub-committee on Arts and Letters of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]]. The English-language collection ''The Outlook for Intelligence'' (1989) contains translations of a dozen essays related to these activities. 

In 1931, he founded the Collège International de Cannes, a private institution teaching French language and civilization. The Collège is still operating today, offering professional courses for native speakers (for educational certification, law and business) as well as courses for foreign students.

He gave the keynote address at the 1932 German national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the death of [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]. This was a fitting choice, as Valéry shared Goethe's fascination with science (specifically, [[biology]] and [[optics]]).

In addition to his activities as a member of the [[Académie française]], he was also a member of the [[Academy of Sciences of Lisbon]], and of the ''Front national des Ecrivains''. In 1937, he was appointed chief executive of what later became the [[University of Nice]]. He was the inaugural holder of the Chair of Poetics at the [[Collège de France]].

During [[World War II]], the [[Vichy regime]] stripped him of some of these jobs and distinctions because of his quiet refusal to collaborate with Vichy and the German occupation, but Valéry continued, throughout these troubled years, to publish and to be active in French cultural life, especially as a member of the [[Académie française]].

Valéry died in Paris in 1945. He is buried in the cemetery of his native town, Sète, the same cemetery celebrated in his famous poem ''Le Cimetière marin''.

==Work==

===The great silence===
Valéry is best known as a poet, and he is sometimes considered to be the last of the French [[symbolists]]. However, he published fewer than a hundred poems, and none of them drew much attention.  On the night of 4 October 1892, during a heavy storm, Paul Valéry underwent an existential crisis, an event that made a huge impact on his writing career. Eventually, around 1898, he quit writing altogether, publishing not a word for nearly twenty years. This hiatus was in part due to the death of his mentor, [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]. When, in 1917, he finally broke his 'great silence' with the publication of ''La Jeune Parque''; he was forty-six years of age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kb.nl/en/themes/koopman-collection/la-jeune-parque La jeune Parque]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''La Jeune Parque''===
This obscure, but sublimely musical, masterpiece, of 512 [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]] lines in rhyming couplets, had taken him four years to complete, and it immediately secured his fame. With "Le Cimetière marin" and "L'Ébauche d'un serpent," it is often considered one of the greatest French poems of the twentieth century.

The title was chosen late in the poem's gestation; it refers to the youngest of the three ''[[Parcae]]'' (the minor Roman deities also called ''The Fates''), though for some readers the connection with that mythological figure is tenuous and problematic.

The poem is written in the first person, and is the soliloquy of a young woman contemplating life and death, engagement and withdrawal, love and estrangement, in a setting dominated by the sea, the sky, stars, rocky cliffs, and the rising sun. However, it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe at the time of the poem's composition. The poem is not about [[World War I]], but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty, and, in this sense, it resonates with [[Ancient Greek literature|ancient Greek]] meditations on these matters, especially in the plays of [[Sophocles]] and [[Aeschylus]]. There are, therefore, evident links with ''le Cimetière marin'', which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.

===Other works===
Before ''la Jeune Parque'', Valéry's only publications of note were dialogues, articles, some poems, and a study of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. In 1920 and 1922, he published two slim collections of verses. The first, ''Album des vers anciens'' (Album of old verses), was a revision of early but beautifully wrought smaller poems, some of which had been published individually before 1900. The second, ''Charmes'' (from the Latin ''carmina'', meaning "songs" and also "incantations"), further confirmed his reputation as a major French poet.  The collection includes ''le Cimetière marin'', and many smaller poems with diverse structures. 'Le Cimetière marin' is mentioned or indirectly implied or referred to in at least four of Iris Murdoch's novels, The Unicorn, [[The Time of the Angels]], The Nice and the Good and The Sea, The Sea.

===Technique===
Valéry's technique is quite orthodox in its essentials. His verse rhymes and scans in conventional ways, and it has much in common with the work of [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]]. His poem, ''Palme'', inspired [[James Merrill]]'s celebrated 1974 poem ''[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]'', and his cerebral lyricism also influenced the American poet, [[Edgar Bowers]].

===Prose works===
His far more ample prose writings, peppered with many aphorisms and ''bons mots'', reveal a skeptical outlook on human nature, verging on the cynical. His view of state power was broadly [[liberalism|liberal]] insofar as he believed that state power and infringements on the individual should be severely limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gifford |first1=Paul |title=Reading Paul Valéry: Universe in Mind |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had flirted with nationalist ideas during the 1890s, he moved away from them by 1899, and believed that European culture owed its greatness to the ethnic diversity and universalism of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berman |first1=Paul |title=Extreme Diamonds: Paul Valéry and the Last Centennial of 1917 |url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/251734/paul-valery-and-the-last-centennial-of-1917 |website=Tablet Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denounced the myth of "racial purity" and argued that such purity, if it existed, would only lead to stagnation -- thus the mixing of races was necessary for progress and cultural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gifford |first1=Paul |title=Reading Paul Valéry: Universe in Mind |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "America as a Projection of the European Mind", Valéry remarked that whenever he despaired about Europe's situation, he could "restore some degree of hope only by thinking of
the New World" and mused on the "happy variations" which could result from European "aesthetic ideas filtering into the powerful character of native Mexican art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Valéry |first1=Paul |title=Reflections on the World Today |date=1948 |publisher=Pantheon |page=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Raymond Poincaré]], [[Louis de Broglie]], [[André Gide]], [[Henri Bergson]], and [[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref name=" references"&gt;C’est ainsi que ces interrogations sur le savoir se nourrirent chez le poète de la fréquentation de l’univers scientifique : lecteur de Bergson, d’Einstein, de Louis de Broglie et Langevin, Paul Valéry devait devenir en 1935 membre de l’Académie des Sciences de Lisbonne. [[Académie française]]'s website in French, [http://www.academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/paul-valery]&lt;/ref&gt; all respected Valéry's thinking and became friendly correspondents. Valéry was often asked to write articles on topics not of his choosing; the resulting intellectual journalism was collected in five volumes titled ''Variétés''.

===The notebooks===
Valéry's most striking achievement is perhaps his monumental intellectual diary, called the ''Cahiers'' (Notebooks). Early every morning of his adult life, he contributed something to the ''Cahiers'', prompting him to write:  "Having dedicated those hours to the life of the mind, I thereby earn the right to be stupid for the rest of the day."

The subjects of his ''Cahiers'' entries often were, surprisingly, reflections on science and mathematics. In fact, arcane topics in these domains appear to have commanded far more of his considered attention than his celebrated poetry. The ''Cahiers'' also contain the first drafts of many aphorisms he later included in his books.  To date, the ''Cahiers'' have been published in their entirety only as photostatic reproductions, and only since 1980 have they begun to receive scholarly scrutiny. The ''Cahiers'' have been translated into English in five volumes published by Peter Lang with the title ''Cahiers/Notebooks''.

In recent decades Valéry's thought has been considered a touchstone in the field of [[constructivist epistemology]], as noted, for instance, by [[Jean-Louis Le Moigne]] in his description of constructivist history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Louis Le Moigne]], ''Les épistémologies constructivistes'', 1995, PUF, " Que sais-je ? "&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other literature==

One of three epigraphs in [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s novel [[Blood Meridian]] is from Valéry's Writing at the Yalu River (1895):

"Your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint. Your acts of pity and cruelty are absurd, committed with no calm, as if they were irresistible. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Cormac|title=Blood Meridian, or, The Evening Redness in the West|date=1985|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-394-54482-X|edition=1st edition, hardback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book "El laberinto de la soledad" from Octavio Paz (postdata-third edition), we find three verses of one of Valéry's poems: 
"Je pense, sur le bord doré de l’univers
A ce gout de périr qui prend la Pythonisse
En qui mugit l’espoir que le monde finisse."
==In popular culture==
Oscar-winning Japanese director [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s 2013 film ''[[The Wind Rises]]'' and the [[The Wind Has Risen|Japanese novel of the same name]] (on which the film was partially based) take their title from Valéry's verse "Le vent se lève... il faut tenter de vivre !" ("The wind rises… We must try to live!") in the poem "Le Cimetière marin" (''The Graveyard by the Sea'').&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Tom (21 February 2014). "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/21/wind-rises-hayao-miyazaki-animated-film-review The Wind Rises: a flight into Hayao Miyazaki's magic and poetry]". ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London). Retrieved 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~cooneys/poems/fr/valery.daylewis.html "Le Cimetière marin"].&lt;/ref&gt; The same quote is used in the closing sentences of [[Anthony Burgess]]'s 1962 novel [[The Wanting Seed]].

Blond was the director of the Progressive Conservatism Project at the London-based think-tank [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]], but left due to "political and philosophical differences"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Harris|title=Phillip Blond: The man who wrote Cameron's mood music|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/aug/08/phillip-blond-conservatives-david-cameron |work=The Guardian|date=8 August 2009|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish his own think-tank, [[ResPublica]].

Blond gained prominence from a cover story in ''[[Prospect magazine|Prospect]]'' magazine in the February 2009 edition with his essay on [[Red Tory]]ism,&lt;ref name=prospect&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2009/02/riseoftheredtories|title=Rise of the red Tories |first=Phillip|last=Blond|date=28 February 2009|work=[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed a radical communitarian [[traditionalist conservatism]] that inveighed against both state and market monopoly. 

According to Blond, these two large-scale realities, while usually spoken of as diametrically opposed, are in reality the two sides of the same coin. As he explains it, modern and postmodern individualism and statism have always been connected of the hip, at least since the advent of Rousseau's thought, if not well before that in the work of Hobbes.&lt;ref&gt;Blond, Phillip (April 10, 2010).[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxMdwBL0EV4 "Red Tory: The Future of Progressive Conservatism?"].

'''Proxemic communication''' deals with the ways that what is [[communication|communicated]] in face-to-face [[conversation]]s may go beyond the overt information being imparted. The communication may be influenced by degree of proximity and by [[nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] signals including touch, and varies between different cultures. Research in this field has been carried out on [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural differences]], and on interaction in [[counseling]] and [[clinical medicine|clinical]] settings.

==The field of proxemics==
[[Proxemics]] is one of several subcategories of the study of [[nonverbal communication]].&lt;ref name="nina moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Nina|title=Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxemics can be defined as "the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture".&lt;ref name="Hidden Dimension"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hall| first = Edward T.| title = The Hidden Dimension| year = 1966| publisher = Anchor Books| isbn = 0-385-08476-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was coined in 1963 by the cultural anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]].&lt;ref name="Hall2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|title=A System for the Notation of Proxemic Behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|date=October 1963|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1003–1026|doi=10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work on proxemics, Hall separated his theory into two overarching categories: [[personal space]] and [[territory (animal)|territory]]. ''Personal space'' describes the immediate space surrounding a person, while ''territory'' refers to the area which a person may "lay claim to" and defend against others.&lt;ref name="nina moore" /&gt;

==Dimensions of nonverbal communication==
According to Xu Lin’s article on Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies, "Cultural factors have a great impact on conversational techniques",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=L.|title=Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies --Conversational Strategies Adopted in Different Cultures and the Way to Bridge the Gap.|year=2007|publisher=US-China Foreign Language|pages=71–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are two basic elements consisted in all [[conversations]]: ''informational'' and ''communicative''. The informational function deals with passing information to another individual; this is known as the information focused element. Whereas, the communicative function deals with the social principle or aim in the conversation, also known as the element that deals with social relationships and drawing closer to people. Xu Lin studies the different classifications of nonverbal communication brought forth by Edward T. Hall (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=E.|title=The Silent Language|year=1959|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different dimensions brought forth by Xu Lin and Prabhu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prabhu|first=T.T.|title=Proxemics: Some Challenges and Strategies in Nonverbal Communication.|year=2010}}Prabhu&lt;/ref&gt; include: Intimate, Personal, Social and Public Distances.

==Common methods==
One of the primary methods used among Kim, D., Pan, Y., &amp; Park, H. (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=D.|title=High- versus low-context culture: A comparison of Chinese, Korean, and American cultures|newspaper=Psychology &amp; Marketing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkin, R. S. (2006), Albas, C. (1991) and Graves, J. R., &amp; Robinson, J. D. included [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type measures of sampling. Participants would be given surveys, videotaped and observed while receiving responding to oral questions posed by formally dressed interviewers. Each study consisted of a controlled group and an experimental group and would measure each individual in a specific manner in order to bring forth accurate results. Each method included a sampling base of volunteers with cheap compensation such as a two dollar reward or extra credit in the class taking part in the experiment.

DiBiase{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} describes touch as differentiating depending on various aspects. All people touch and are touched by others, but there are vast differences in the amount of touching that people do. For example, touching appears to vary by gender, culture, and even age. Although these particular differences in touching behavior are not well understood, historically investigators have thought of touch as expressing control and dominance.

Not only does touch vary by culture, but also age and gender. They continue to explain how some researchers have suggested that some cultures, such as Middle Eastern, Latin America and Southern Europe, could be considered high-contact cultures (interact at closer distances and touch more frequently) much more in social conversations than people from non-contact cultures such as the USA and Northern Europe.

Research by Graves (1976),&lt;ref name="Graves1976"&gt;{{cite news|last=Graves|first=J.D.|title=Proxemic behavior as a function of inconsistent verbal and nonverbal messages|newspaper=Journal of Counseling Psychology|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robinson (1976),&lt;ref name="Graves1976" /&gt; suggests that an individual's nonverbal behavior is capable of communicating information about the particular individual's feelings and attitudes, regardless of the culture. However, from his research he concluded that the prominent role was in fact played by nonverbal communication in determining the total meaning of the message, and that the message being conveyed could very well differ depending on the context. Among his findings was that within the client-counselor relationship, the consistency or inconsistency between the counselor's verbal and [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] has been found to be an important determinant of the client's impressions of the counselor as well as of the client's proxemics behavior.

Albas (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albas|first=C.|title=Proxemic Behavior: A Study of Extrusion|newspaper=Journal of Social Psychology|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the comfortable proxemic distances assumed by Canadian female students. The cultural group and sex was held constant; however, the comfortable distances seemed to vary from situation to situation. Preston (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston|first=P.|title=Proxemics in Clinical and Administrative Settings|newspaper=Journal of Healthcare Management|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the proxemics in clinical and administrative settings. He came to the conclusion that the proximity of people to one another when they interact and the configuration of work areas send a message that affects people in different ways. One of his main suggestions was to use observation skills in understanding how and why others interact within or outside their own space. He claims that people choose to rely on their imagination to better receive unspoken messages sent by others through their spatial interactions.

{{Mindfulness}}

'''Sati''' (in [[Pali]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sati|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2991.pali|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212102108/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2991.pali|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-12|work=The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia, University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sanskrit]]: ''smṛti'') is '''mindfulness''' or '''awareness''', a spiritual or psychological faculty (''[[indriya]]'') that forms an essential part of [[Bhavana|Buddhist practice]]. It is the first factor of the [[Seven Factors of Enlightenment]]. "Correct" or "right" mindfulness (Pali: ''sammā-sati'', Sanskrit ''samyak-smṛti'') is the seventh element of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

==Definition==
The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term ''sati'' and in its Sanskrit counterpart [[smriti|smṛti]]. According to Robert Sharf, the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} ''Smṛti'' originally meant "to remember", "to recollect", "to bear in mind", as in the [[Vedic]] tradition of remembering sacred texts. The term ''sati'' also means "to remember". In the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta|Satipațțhāna-sutta]]'' the term ''sati'' means to maintain awareness of reality, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} Sharf refers to the [[Milindapanha]], which explained that the arisement of ''sati'' calls to mind the wholesome dhammas such as the [[Satipatthana|four establishments of mindfulness]], the [[Indriya|five faculties]], the [[Five Strengths|five powers]], the [[Seven Factors of Enlightenment|seven awakening-factors]], the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], and the [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Insight|attainment of insight]].&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = Even so, your Majesty, sati, when it arises, calls to mind dhammas that are skillful and unskillful, with faults and faultless, inferior and refined, dark and pure, together with their counterparts: these are the four establishings of mindfulness, these are the four right endeavors, these are the four bases of success, these are the five faculties, these are the five powers, these are the seven awakening-factors, this is the noble eight-factored path, this is calm, this is insight, this is knowledge, this is freedom. Thus the one who practices yoga resorts to dhammas that should be resorted to and does not resort to dhammas that should not be resorted to; he embraces dhammas that should be embraced and does not embrace dhammas that should not be embraced.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Rupert Gethin, 
{{quote|[''sati''] should be understood as what allows awareness of the full range and extent of ''dhammas''; ''sati'' is an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value. Applied to the ''satipațțhānas'', presumably what this means is that ''sati'' is what causes the practitioner of yoga to "remember" that any feeling he may experience exists in relation to a whole variety or world of feelings that may be skillful or unskillful, with faults or faultless, relatively inferior or refined, dark or pure."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}{{refn|group=note|Quotes from Gethin, Rupert M.L. (1992), ''The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study  of the Bodhi-Pakkhiȳa Dhammā''. BRILL's Indological Library, 7. Leiden and New York: BRILL}}}}

Sharf further notes that this has little to do with "bare attention", the popular contemporary interpretation of ''sati'', "since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise".{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}} According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths".{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|Frauwallner, E. (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy'', trans. V.M. Bedekar, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. Two volumes., pp.150 ff}} According to Vetter, ''dhyana'' may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term ''sati'' and in its Sanskrit counterpart ''smṛti''. Translators rendered the Sanskrit word as ''trenpa'' in Tibetan ([[Wylie transliteration|wylie]]: ''dran pa'') and as ''nian'' 念 in Chinese.

===Pali===
The Pali-language scholar [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] (1843–1922) first translated ''[[Wikt:Sati|sati]]'' in 1881 as English ''[[Wikt:mindfulness|mindfulness]]'' in ''sammā-sati'' "Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind".&lt;ref&gt;T. W. Rhys Davids, tr., 1881, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ciqzXBSFkp8C ''Buddhist Suttas''], Clarendon Press, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered ''sammā-sati'' as "Correct meditation",&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Gogerly, "On Buddhism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=5gaMCEjql_4C ''Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society''], 1845, pp. 7-28 and 90-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Davids explained, 
{{quote|''sati'' is literally 'memory' but is used with reference to the constantly repeated phrase 'mindful and thoughtful' (''sato sampajâno''); and means that activity of mind and constant presence of mind which is one of the duties most frequently inculcated on the good Buddhist."&lt;ref&gt;Davids, 1881, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Henry Alabaster]], in ''The Wheel of the Law: Buddhism Illustrated From Siamese Sources by the Modern Buddhist, A Life of Buddha, and an Account of the Phrabat'' (1871), had earlier defined "Satipatthan/Smrityupasthana" as "The act of keeping one's self mindful."&lt;ref&gt;''The Wheel of the Law: Buddhism Illustrated From Siamese Sources by the Modern Buddhist, A Life of Buddha, and an Account of the Phrabat'' by Henry Alabaster, Trubner &amp; Co., London: 1871 pg 197&lt;sup&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UcIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=mindful#v=onepage&amp;q=mindful&amp;f=false]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English language|English]] term ''mindfulness'' already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as ''myndfulness'' in 1530 ([[John Palsgrave]] translates [[French language|French]] ''[[pensee]]''), as ''mindfulnesse'' in 1561, and ''mindfulness'' in 1817. [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]] earlier terms include ''mindful'' (first recorded in 1340), ''mindfully'' (1382), and the obsolete ''mindiness'' (ca. 1200).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Dunne]], an associate professor at Emory University whose current research focuses especially on the concept of "mindfulness" in both theoretical and practical contexts, asserts that the translation of ''sati'' and  ''smṛti'' as mindfulness is confusing and that a number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish [[Recall (memory)|"retention"]] as the preferred alternative.&lt;ref&gt;
Lecture, Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, c 18:03 [http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171057/http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |date=November 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] also points to the meaning of "sati" as "memory":
{{quote|The word derives from a verb, sarati, meaning “to remember,” and occasionally in Pali sati is still explained in a way that connects it with the idea of memory. But when it is used in relation to meditation practice, we have no word in English that precisely captures what it refers to. An early translator cleverly drew upon the word mindfulness, which is not even in my dictionary. This has served its role admirably, but it does not preserve the connection with memory, sometimes needed to make sense of a passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquiringmind.com/Articles/Translator.html TRANSLATOR FOR THE BUDDHA: AN INTERVIEW WITH BHIKKHU BODHI]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sanskrit===
The [[Sanskrit]] word ''smṛti'' स्मृति (also transliterated variously as ''[[smriti]]'', ''smRti'', or ''sm'Rti'') literally means "that which is remembered", and refers both to "mindfulness" in Buddhism and "a category of metrical texts" in [[Hinduism]], considered second in authority to the ''[[Śruti]]'' scriptures.

[[Monier Monier-Williams]]'s ''Sanskrit-English Dictionary'' differentiates eight meanings of ''smṛti'' स्मृति, "remembrance, reminiscence, thinking of or upon, calling to mind, memory":
# memory as one of the Vyabhicāri-bhāvas [transient feelings];
# Memory (personified either as the daughter of [[Daksha]] and wife of [[Angiras (sage)|Aṅgiras]] or as the daughter of [[Dharma]] and Medhā);
# the whole body of sacred tradition or what is remembered by human teachers (in contradistinction to [[Śruti]] or what is directly heard or revealed to the [[Rishi]]s; in its widest acceptation this use of the term Smṛti includes the 6 [[Vedanga]]s, the Sūtras both [[Śrauta]] and [[Grhya Sutras|Grhya]], the [[Manusmṛti]], the [[Itihāsas]] (e.g., the [[Mahābhārata]] and [[Ramayana]]), the [[Puranas]] and the Nītiśāstras, "according to such and such a traditional precept or legal text";
# the whole body of codes of law as handed down memoriter or by tradition (esp. the codes of [[Manusmṛti]], [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]] and the 16 succeeding inspired lawgivers) … all these lawgivers being held to be inspired and to have based their precepts on the [[Vedas]];
# symbolical name for the number 18 (from the 18 lawgivers above);
# a kind of [[meter (poetry)|meter]];
# name of the letter ''g-'' ग्;
# desire, wish&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/index.html Monier-Williams Online Dictionary]. N.B.: these definitions are simplified and wikified.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese===
[[File:念-bigseal.svg|thumb|[[Zhou dynasty#Eastern Zhou|Eastern Zhou dynasty]] (771-221 BCE) [[Large Seal Script]] graph for ''nian'' 念]]
Buddhist scholars translated ''smṛti'' with the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''nian'' 念 "study; read aloud; think of; remember; remind". ''Nian'' is commonly used in [[Modern Standard Chinese]] words such as ''guannian'' 觀念 (观念) "concept; idea", ''huainian'' 懷念 (怀念) "cherish the memory of; think of", ''nianshu'' 念書 (念书) "read; study", and ''niantou'' 念頭 (念头) "thought; idea; intention". Two specialized Buddhist terms are ''[[nianfo]]'' 念佛 "chant the name of Buddha; pray to Buddha" and ''nianjing'' 念經 (念经) "chant/recite sutras".

This [[Chinese character]] ''nian'' 念 is composed of ''jin'' [[Wikt:今|今]] "now; this" and ''xin'' [[Wikt:心|心]] "heart; mind". [[Bernhard Karlgren]] graphically explains ''nian'' meaning "reflect, think; to study, learn by heart, remember; recite, read – to have 今 present to 心 the mind".&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Karlgren, 1923, ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'', Paul Geunther, p. 207. Dover reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese character ''nian'' or ''nien'' 念 is pronounced as [[Korean language|Korean]] ''yeom'' or ''yŏm'' 염, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ネン or ''nen'', and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] ''niệm''.

''A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms'' gives basic translations of ''nian'': "Recollection, memory; to think on, reflect; repeat, intone; a thought; a moment."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Edward Soothill]] and [[Lewis Hodous]], 1937, [http://www.acmuller.net/soothill/data/s5f/s5ff5.html ''A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms: with Sanskrit and English Equivalents and a Sanskrit-Pali Index'']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' gives more detailed translations of ''nian'' "mindfulness, memory":
*Recollection (Skt. ''smṛti''; Tib. ''dran pa''). To recall, remember. That which is remembered. The function of remembering. The operation of the mind of not forgetting an object. Awareness, concentration. Mindfulness of the Buddha, as in [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] practice. In Abhidharma-kośa theory, one of the ten omnipresent factors 大地法. In Yogâcāra, one of the five 'object-dependent' mental factors 五別境;
*Settled recollection; (Skt. ''sthāpana''; Tib. ''gnas pa''). To ascertain one's thoughts;
*To think within one's mind (without expressing in speech). To contemplate; meditative wisdom;
*Mind, consciousness;
*A thought; a thought-moment; an instant of thought. (Skt. ''kṣana'');
*Patience, forbearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhism-dict.net/cgi-bin/xpr-ddb.pl?5f.xml+id('b5ff5') ''Digital Dictionary of Buddhism'']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Originally, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, by paying attention to sensory experience, preventing the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions which cause the further chain of reacions leading to rebirth.{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadasa, ''Heartwood of the Bodhi-tree''&lt;/ref&gt; In the later tradition, especially Theravada, mindfulness is an antidote to delusion (Pali: [[Moha (Buddhism)|''Moha'']]), and is considered as such one of the 'powers' (Pali: ''[[Five Strengths|bala]]'') that contribute to the attainment of [[nirvana]], in particular when it is coupled with [[sampajañña|clear comprehension]] of whatever is taking place.  Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]] ([[Pali]]: ''moha'') have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.

===''Satipaṭṭhāna'' - guarding the senses===
{{Main|Satipaṭṭhāna}}

The [[Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]] (Sanskrit: ''Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra'') is an early text dealing with mindfulness. The Theravada Nikayas prescribe that one should establish mindfulness (''satipaṭṭhāna'') in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of the four ''upassanā'': one's body, feelings, mind, and [[dharma]]s.

According to Grzegorz Polak, the four ''upassanā'' have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:{{sfn|Polak|2011}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').

[[Rupert Gethin]] notes that the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] interprets the ''Satipatthana Sutta'' as "describing a pure form of insight ([[vipassanā]]) meditation" for which ''samatha'' (calm) and ''jhāna'' are not necessary. Yet, in [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]], the establishment of mindfulness was placed before the practice of the ''jhanas'', and associated with the abandonment of the [[five hindrances]] and the entry into the first ''jhana''.&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "The sutta is often read today as describing a pure form of insight ([[vipassanā]]) meditation that bypasses calm ([[samatha]]) meditation and the four absorptions ([[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]), as outlined in the description of the Buddhist path found, for example, in the [[Samaññaphala Sutta|Sāmaññaphala-sutta]] [...] The earlier tradition, however, seems not to have always read it this way, associating accomplishment in the exercise of establishing mindfulness with abandoning of the [[five hindrances]] and the first absorption."&lt;ref name="Gethin2008_p142"&gt;Gethin, Rupert, Sayings of the Buddha: New Translations from the Pali Nikayas (Oxford World's Classics), 2008, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths."{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|Frauwallner, E. (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy'', trans. V.M. Bedekar, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. Two volumes., pp.150 ff}} [[Buddhadasa]] also argued that mindfulness provides the means to prevent the arising of disturbing thought and emotions, which cause the further chain of reactions leading to rebirth of the ego and selfish thought and behavior.{{sfn|Buddhadasa|2014|p=78-80, 101-102, 117 (note 42)}}

According to Vetter, ''dhyana'' may have been the [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Contents and teachings of earliest Buddhism|original core practice of the Buddha]], which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

===''Samprajaña'', ''apramāda'' and ''atappa''===
{{See also|Dhamma vicaya}}

''Satii'' was famously translated as "bare attention" by [[Nyanaponika Thera]]. Yet, in Buddhist practice, "mindfulness" is more than just "bare attention"; it has the more comprehensive and active meaning of ''[[Sampajañña|samprajaña]]'', "clear comprehension," and ''[[Apramada|apramāda]],'' "vigilance".&lt;ref name="Subhuti"&gt;[http://madhyamavani.fwbo.org/8/mindfulness.html "Mindfulness and the Mind," by Subhuti. Madhyamavani Online]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[I]n Buddhist discourse, there are three terms that together map the field of mindfulness [...] [in their Sanskrit variants] ''smṛti'' (Pali: ''sati''), ''samprajaña'' (Pali: ''[[Sampajañña]]'')  and ''[[apramāda]]'' (Pali: ''appamada'').&lt;ref name="Subhuti" /&gt;}} All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as "mindfulness", but they all have specific shades of meaning.

In a publicly available correspondence between [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] and [[B. Alan Wallace]], Bodhi has described Ven. [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s views on "right mindfulness" and sampajañña as follows:
{{quote|I should add that Ven. Nyanaponika himself did not regard “bare attention” as capturing the complete significance of ''{{IAST|satipaṭṭhāna}}'', but as representing only one phase, the initial phase, in the meditative development of right mindfulness. He held that in the proper practice of right mindfulness, sati has to be integrated with sampajañña, clear comprehension, and it is only when these two work together that right mindfulness can fulfill its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shamatha.org/sites/default/files/Bhikkhu_Bodhi_Correspondence.pdf "The Nature of Mindfulness and Its Role in Buddhist Meditation" A Correspondence between B.A. wallace and the Venerable Bikkhu Bodhi, Winter 2006, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| According to this correspondence, Ven. Nyanaponika spend his last ten years living with and being cared for by Bodhi. Bodhi refers to Nyanaponika as "my closest kalyāṇamitta in my life as a monk."}}}}

In the [[Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta]], sati and sampajañña are combined with ''atappa'' (Pali; Sanskrit: ''ātapaḥ''), or "ardency,"{{refn|group=note|Dictionary.com:adjective
# having, expressive of, or characterized by intense feeling; passionate; fervent: an ardent vow; ardent love.
# intensely devoted, eager, or enthusiastic; zealous: an ardent theatergoer. an ardent student of French history.

# burning, fiery, or hot: the ardent core of a star.}} and the three together comprise ''yoniso manisikara'' (Pali; Sanskrit: ''yoniśas manaskāraḥ''), "appropriate attention" or "wise reflection."&lt;ref&gt;"Mindfulness Defined," by Thanissaro Bhikku. pg 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Anapanasati'' - mindfulness of breathing===
{{Main|Anapanasati}}

Ānāpānasati ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit]]: ''ānāpānasmṛti''; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 安那般那; [[Pinyin|Pīnyīn]]: ''ānnàbānnà''; [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ආනා පානා සති), meaning "mindfulness of breathing" ("sati" means mindfulness; "ānāpāna" refers to inhalation and exhalation), is a form of [[Buddhist meditation]] now common to the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]], [[Zen]], [[Tiantai]], and [[Theravada]] schools of Buddhism, as well as [[Mindfulness|western-based mindfulness programs]]. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body, as is practiced in the context of mindfulness. According to tradition, Anapanasati was originally taught by the Buddha in several sutras including the ''[[Anapanasati Sutta|Ānāpānasati Sutta]]''.{{refn|group=note|In the Pali canon, the instructions for anapanasati are presented as either one tetrad (four instructions) or four tetrads (16 instructions). The most famous exposition of four tetrads – after which [[Theravada]] countries have a national holiday (see [[Uposatha#Special uposatha days|uposatha]]) – is the ''Anapanasati Sutta'', found in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN), sutta number 118 (for instance, see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html Thanissaro, 2006]). Other discourses which describe the full four tetrads can be found in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]'s ''Anapana-samyutta'' (Ch. 54), such as SN 54.6 (Thanissaro, 2006a), SN 54.8 (Thanissaro, 2006b) and SN 54.13 (Thanissaro, 1995a). The one-tetrad exposition of anapanasati is found, for instance, in the ''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 119; Thanissaro, 1997), the ''Maha-satipatthana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22; Thanissaro, 2000) and the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' (MN 10; Thanissaro, 1995b).}} (MN 118)

The [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] of early Buddhism discuss ten forms of mindfulness.{{refn|group=note|The [[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara Āgama]] has:&lt;ref&gt;Nan Huaijin. ''Working Toward Enlightenment: The Cultivation of Practice.'' York Beach: Samuel Weiser. 1993. pp. 118-119, 138-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vipassanā'' - discriminating insight===
{{Main|Vipassanā}}

[[Satipatthana]], as four foundations of mindfulness, c.q. [[anapanasati]], "mindfulness of breathing," is being employed to attain Vipassanā ([[Pāli]]), [[Prajñā (Buddhism)|insight]] into the true nature of reality as impermanent and ''[[anatta]]'', c.q. ''[[sunyata]]'', lacking any permanent essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-Mahamudra-Looking-Directly-Mind/dp/0861713710/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348478405&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Essentials+of+Mahamudra%3A+Looking+Directly+at+the+Mind |title=Essentials of Mahamudra: Looking Directly at the Mind, by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henepola Gunaratana pg 21"&gt;Henepola Gunaratana, Mindfulness in plain English, Wisdom Publications, pg 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Theravadin]] context, this [[logical consequence|entails]] insight into the [[three marks of existence]], namely the [[impermanence]] of and the [[dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]] of every conditioned thing that exists, and [[anatta|non-self]]. In [[Mahayana]] contexts, it entails insight into what is variously described as [[sunyata]], [[dharmata]], the inseparability of appearance and emptiness ([[two truths doctrine]]), clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Defined by Reginald A.

According to Vetter, Bronkhorst and Gombrich, discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv–xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}} under pressure of developments in Indian religious thinking, which saw "liberating insight" as essential to liberation.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} This may also have been due to an over-literal interpretation by later scholastics of the terminology used by the Buddha,{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=96-134}} and to the problems involved with the practice of ''dhyana'', and the need to develop an easier method.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxv}} Accoridng to Wynne, the Buddha combined [[jhana|meditative stabilisation]] with mindful awareness and "an insight into the nature of this meditative experience."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne, ''The origin of Buddhist meditation.'' Routledge, 2007, page 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various traditions disagree which techniques belong to which pole.{{sfn|Schumann|1974}} According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|liberation]].

Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist [[vipassana movement]], modeled after [[Theravada|Theravāda]] [[Buddhism]] meditation practices,{{sfn|McMahan}} which employs vipassanā and [[anapana|ānāpāna]] (''anapanasati'', mindfulness of breathing) meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the [[Satipatthana|{{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna}}]] [[Sūtra|Sutta]].

===Mindfulness (psychology)===
{{Main|Mindfulness}}

Mindfulness practice, inherited from the Buddhist tradition, is being employed in [[psychology]] to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, including [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive disorder]], [[anxiety]], and in the prevention of relapse in [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/scan/nsm034 |title=Mindfulness training and neural integration: Differentiation of distinct streams of awareness and the cultivation of well-being |year=2007 |last1=Siegel |first1=D.

===="Bare attention"====
[[Georges Dreyfus]] has expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as "bare attention" or "nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness", stressing that mindfulness in Buddhist context means also "remembering", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information. Dreyfus concludes his examination by stating:
{{quote|[T]he identification of mindfulness with bare attention ignores or, at least, underestimates the cognitive implications of mindfulness, its ability to bring together various aspects of experience so as to lead to the clear comprehension of the nature of mental and bodily states. By over-emphasizing the nonjudgmental nature of mindfulness and arguing that our problems stem from conceptuality, contemporary authors are in danger of leading to a one-sided understanding of mindfulness as a form of therapeutically helpful spacious quietness. I think that it is important not to lose sight that mindfulness is not just a therapeutic technique but is a natural capacity that plays a central role in the cognitive process. It is this aspect that seems to be ignored when mindfulness is reduced to a form of nonjudgmental present-centered form of awareness of one’s experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness_Present-Centered_Nonjudgmental-Attention_Introspection-A-Discussion_Dreyfus.html "Is Mindfulness Present-Centered and Nonjudgmental? A Discussion of the Cognitive Dimensions of Mindfulness"] by Georges Dreyfus&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention":
{{quote|[[Mahasi Sayadaw|Mahasi]]s technique did not require familiarity with Buddhist doctrine (notably abhidhamma), did not require adherence to strict ethical norms (notably monasticism), and promised astonishingly quick results. This was made possible through interpreting sati as a state of "bare awareness" — the unmediated, non-judgmental perception of things "as they are," uninflected by prior psychological, social, or cultural conditioning. This notion of mindfulness is at variance with premodern Buddhist epistemologies in several respects. Traditional Buddhist practices are oriented more toward acquiring "correct view" and proper ethical discernment, rather than "no view" and a non-judgmental attitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/ Geoffrey Samuel, ''Mindfulness or Mindlessness: Traditional and Modern Buddhist Critiques of "Bare Awareness"'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jay L. Garfield]], quoting [[Shantideva]] and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, ''calling to mind'' and vigilantly ''retaining in mind''. He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of morality – at least in the context of [[Buddhism]] from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness-and-Morality-J-Garfield.html "Mindfulness and Ethics: Attention, Virtue and Perfection"] by Jay Garfield&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''strategic lawsuit against public participation''' ('''SLAPP''') is a [[lawsuit]] that is intended to [[censorship|censor]], [[intimidate]], and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a [[legal defense]] until they abandon their criticism or opposition.&lt;ref name="onthemedia_01"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2010/apr/02/slapp-back/transcript/
 |title=SLAPP Back: Transcript
 |date=April 2, 2010
 |website=[[On The Media]]
 |publisher=[[WNYC]] ([[National Public Radio]], [[PBS]])
 |first= Nazanin |last=Rafsanjani
 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such lawsuits have been made illegal in many jurisdictions on the grounds that they impede [[freedom of speech]].

In the typical SLAPP, the [[plaintiff]] does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the [[defendant]] succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting [[legal costs]], or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, repeated frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of [[directors and officers liability insurance]] for that party, interfering with an organization's ability to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/05/16/whacked-by-lawsuit-costs-old-city-civic-association-disbands/ |first=John |last=McDevitt |title=Whacked By Lawsuit Costs, Old City Civic Association Disbands |website=KYW-TV, CBS |location=Philadelphia |date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a [[legal threat]].

There is a difficulty in that plaintiffs do not present themselves to the court admitting that their intent is to censor, intimidate, or silence their critics. Hence, the difficulty in drafting SLAPP legislation, and in applying it, is to craft an approach which affords an early termination to invalid abusive suits, without denying a legitimate day in court to valid [[good faith]] claims. Thus, anti-SLAPP laws target tactics used by SLAPP plaintiffs. Common anti-SLAPP laws include measures such as penalties for plaintiffs who file lawsuits ruled frivolous and special procedures where a defendant may ask a judge to consider that a lawsuit is a SLAPP (and usually subsequently dismiss the suit).

Anti-SLAPP laws occasionally come under criticism from those who believe that there should not be barriers to the [[right to petition]] for those who sincerely believe they have been wronged, regardless of ulterior motives. Nonetheless, anti-SLAPP laws are generally considered to have a favorable effect, and many lawyers have fought to enact stronger laws protecting against SLAPPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2214&amp;context=llr |title=California's Anti-Slapp Legislation: A Summary of and Commentary on Its Operation and Scope |first=Kathryn W. |last=Tate |journal=[[Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review]] |volume=33 |pages=801–886 |date=April 1, 2000 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
SLAPPs take various forms. The most common used to be a civil suit for [[defamation]], which in the [[English common law]] tradition was a [[tort]]. The [[common law of libel]] dates to the early 17th century and, unlike most English law, is [[reverse onus]], meaning that once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden is on the defendant to prove that it is not. In England and Wales, the [[Defamation Act 2013]] removed most of the uses of defamation as a SLAPP by requiring the proof of special damage. Various abusive uses of this law including [[political libel]] (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places, but persist in some jurisdictions (notably [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]]) where political views can be held as defamatory.

A common feature of SLAPPs is [[forum shopping]], wherein plaintiffs find courts that are more favourable towards the claims to be brought than the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live.&lt;ref name=Sheldrick2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheldrick |first1=Byron |title=Blocking Public Participation: The Use of Strategic Litigation to Silence Political Expression |date=2014 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-1-55458-930-2 |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com?id=dbNlAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of [[perjury]], refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for [[discovery (law)|discovery]], attempts to identify [[anonymity|anonymous or pseudonymous]] critics, appeals on minor points of law, demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law, and attempts to run up defendants' costs even if this clearly costs more to the plaintiffs.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Several jurisdictions have passed anti-SLAPP laws, designed to quickly remove cases out of court. In many cases, the plaintiff is also required to pay a penalty for bringing the case, known as a SLAPP-back.

== History ==
The [[acronym]] was coined in the 1980s by [[University of Denver]] professors [[Penelope Canan]] and [[George W. Pring]].&lt;ref name="pring_canan_01"&gt;{{cite book |title=SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out |isbn=978-0-375-75258-2 |last=Pring |first=George W. |last2=Canan |first2=Penelope |publisher=Temple University Press |pages=8–9 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally defined as "a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance." The concept's originators later dropped the notion that government contact had to be about a public issue to be protected by the [[Right to petition in the United States|Right to Petition]] the Government, as provided in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. It has since been defined less broadly by some states, and more broadly in one state (California) where it includes suits about speech on any public issue.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_16_01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/statutes/c-c-p-section-425-16 |title=(California) Code of Civil Procedure – Section 425.16 |publisher=California Anti-SLAPP Project |year=2009 |origyear=Ratified 1992, last amended 2009 |quote=The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance, and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original conceptualization proffered by Canan and Pring emphasized the right to petition as protected in the United States under the US Constitution's specific protection in the First Amendment's fifth clause. It is still definitional: SLAPPs refer to civil lawsuits filed against those who have communicated to government officialdom (in its entire constitutional apparatus). The Right to Petition, granted by [[Edgar the Peaceful]], King of England in the 10th century, antedates the [[Magna Carta]] in terms of its significance in the development of democratic institutions. As currently conceived, the right claims that democracy cannot properly function in the presence of barriers between the governed and the governing.&lt;ref name="right_to_petition_01"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3486&amp;context=flr |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |date=January 1, 1998 |title=The Vestigial Constitution: The History and Significance of the Right to Petition |first=Gregory A. |last=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsengland.co.uk/queen-mary-ii-of-stuart-1689%E2%80%931694.html |title=Queen Mary II of Stuart (1689–1694) |website=Kings of England |year=2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrone'', 590 N.Y.S.2d 649, 656 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992). A number of jurisdictions have made such suits illegal, provided that the appropriate standards of [[journalistic responsibility]] have been met by the critic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Jurisdictional variations ==

=== Australia ===
In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 protects conduct intended to influence public opinion or promote or further action in relation to an issue of public interest. A party starting or maintaining a proceeding against a defendant for an improper purpose may be ordered to pay a financial penalty to the Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-48/20111212-50372/pdf/2008-48.pdf |title=Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 |website=Parliamentary Counsel's Office |location=Australian Capital Territory |date=12 December 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Some [[political libel]] and [[forum shopping]] incidents, both common in Canada, have been called SLAPPs, because such suits load defendants with costs of responding in unfamiliar jurisdictions or at times (typically elections) when they are extremely busy and short of funds. Both types of suits are unusual to Canada, so there is little academic concern nor examination of whether political subject matter or remote forums are a clear indicator of SLAPP.

==== British Columbia ====
One of the first cases in Canada to be explicitly ruled a SLAPP was ''Fraser v. Saanich'' (see [1999] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.)) (QL), where the British Columbia Supreme Court struck out the claim of a hospital director against the District of Saanich, holding that it was a meritless action designed to silence or intimidate the residents who were opposed to the plaintiff's plan to redevelop the hospital facilities.

Following the decision in ''Fraser v. Saanich'', the ''Protection of Public Participation Act'' went into effect in British Columbia in April 2001. The legislation was repealed in August 2001. There was extensive debate on its merits and the necessity of having hard criteria for judges and whether this tended to reduce or increase process abuse. The debate was largely formed by the first case to discuss and apply the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), ''Home Equity Development v. Crow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/sc/02/11/2002bcsc1138.htm |title=Home Equity Development v. Crow, et al (2002 BCSC 1138) |website=British Columbia Superior Courts |accessdate=May 23, 2015 |date=July 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants' application to dismiss the action against them was dismissed. The defendants failed to meet the burden of proof required by the PPPA, that the plaintiffs had no reasonable prospect of success. While it was not the subject of the case, some felt that the plaintiffs did not bring their action for an improper purpose, and the suit did not inhibit the defendants in their public criticism of the particular project, and that the Act was therefore ineffective in this case.

Since the repeal, BC activists especially the [[BCCLA]] have argued repeatedly for a broad understanding of SLAPP and a broad interpretation of judicial powers especially in intervener applications in BC and other common law jurisdictions and when arguing for new legislation to prevent SLAPPs. The activist literature contains extensive research on particular cases and criteria. The [[West Coast Environmental Law]] organization agrees and generally considers BC to lag other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="WCELJune2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcel.org/resources/environmental-law-alert/bc-trails-quebec-ontario-protecting-public-chilling-lawsuits |title=BC trails Quebec, Ontario in protecting public from chilling lawsuits |date=June 6, 2010 |website=West Coast Environmental Law Association |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nova Scotia ====
A [[private member's bill]] introduced in 2001 by [[Graham Steele]] (NDP, [[Halifax Fairview]]) proposed a "Protection of Public Participation Act" to dismiss proceedings or claims brought or maintained for an improper purpose, awarding punitive or exemplary damages (effectively, a SLAPP back) and protection from liability for communication or conduct which constitutes public participation. The bill did not progress beyond first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/58th_2nd/1st_read/b061.htm |title=Protection of Public Participation Act |website=Nova Scotia legislature |date=May 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ontario ====
In Ontario, the decision in ''Daishowa v. Friends of the Lubicon'' (see [1996] O.J. No. 3855 Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (QL) was also instructive on SLAPPs. A motion brought by the corporate plaintiff Daishowa to impose conditions on the defendant Friends of the Lubicon Indian Band that they would not represent Daishowa's action as a SLAPP was dismissed.

By 2010, the Ontario Attorney-General issued a major report which identified SLAPP as a major problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/anti_slapp/ |title=Anti-SLAPP Advisory Panel |website=Ministry of the Attorney General |date=June 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but initially little or nothing was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawiscool.com/2011/10/06/renewing-the-debate-on-anti-slapp-legislation-in-ontario/ |title=Renewing the Debate on Anti-SLAPP Legislation in Ontario |website=Law is Cool |date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the Attorney General introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the report; that bill was re-introduced after the [[Ontario general election, 2014|2014 election]]. {{asof|2014}}, Bill 83, the Protection of Public Participation Act (2014), has been referred to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and is not yet law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?BillID=2810 |title=Bills &amp; Lawmaking – Current Parliament – Bill 83, Protection of Public Participation Act, 2014 |website=Legislative Assembly of Ontario |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes a mechanism for an order to dismiss strategic lawsuits which attack free expression on matters of public interest, with full costs (but not punitive damages) and on a relatively short timeframe, if the underlying claims have no reasonable prospect of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rabble.ca/columnists/2014/08/protecting-public-debate-through-anti-slapp-legislation |title=Protecting public debate through anti-SLAPP legislation |first=Shelina |last=Ali |date=August 28, 2014 |website=[[rabble.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Ontario passed the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ontario.ca/mag/en/2015/10/protection-of-public-participation-act.html |title=Protection of Public Participation Act |date=October 28, 2015 |website=Ministry of the Attorney General |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill is supported by a wide range of groups including municipalities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billingstwp.ca/meeting-minutes/august-21-2014-meeting-minutes/ |title=August 21, 2014 Meeting Minutes |date=August 21, 2014 |website=Council of the Corporation of The Township of [[Billings, Ontario|Billings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Environmental Law Association]], EcoJustice, [[Environmental Defence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environmentaldefence.ca/blog/slapp-silly |title=SLAPP silly |date=March 3, 2014 |website=Environmental Defence Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110001136/http://environmentaldefence.ca/blog/slapp-silly |archivedate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontario Clean Air Alliance, [[Ontario Nature]], [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccla.org/2013/12/02/ccla-urges-ontario-attorney-general-to-pass-protection-of-public-participation-bill/ |title=CCLA Urges Ontario Attorney General to Pass Protection of Public Participation Bill |date=December 2, 2013 |website=Canadian Civil Liberties Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110003848/http://ccla.org/2013/12/02/ccla-urges-ontario-attorney-general-to-pass-protection-of-public-participation-bill |archivedate=November 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Journalists for Free Expression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cjfe.org/resources/protest_letters/organizations-continue-call-anti-slapp-legislation-ontario |title=Organizations continue call for anti-SLAPP legislation in Ontario |website=Canadian Journalists for Free Expression |date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens Environment Alliance of Southwestern Ontario, [[The Council of Canadians]], CPAWS Wildlands League, [[Sierra Club]] Ontario, [[Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rnao.ca/policy/submissions/letter-minister-john-gerretson-attorney-general-bill-83-protection-public-partici |title=Letter Minister John Gerretson, Attorney General: Bill 83, Protection of Public Participation Act, 2013 |date=November 29, 2013 |website=Registered Nurses Association of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greenpeace]] Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/commentary/2014/02/09/ontario_still_has_time_to_pass_environmental_bills.html |title=Ontario still has time to pass environmental bills |first=Yossi |last=Cadan |date=February 9, 2014 |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ontario Civil Liberties Association has called upon the Attorney General to go further, as Bill 83 does not correct fundamental flaws with Ontario's defamation law which impose a one-sided [[reverse onus|burden of proof]] to force defendants to disprove falsity, malice, and damage within a very limited framework where "truth", "privilege", "fair comment", and "responsible reporting" are their only recognised defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocla.ca/our-work/reports/report-bill-83/ |title=OCLA position paper on Bill 83 |website=Ontario Civil Liberties Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quebec ====
Québec's then Justice Minister, Jacques Dupuis, proposed an anti-SLAPP bill on June 13, 2008.&lt;ref name="ulcc_slapp_01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulcc.ca/en/poam2/SLAPP%20Report.pdf |title=Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPPs) (and other abusive lawsuits) |last=Pelletier |first=Vincent |website=Uniform Law Conference of Canada, Civil Section (English &amp; French) |date=August 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on June 3, 2009. As of September 2013, Quebec's amended Code of Civil Procedure is the only anti-SLAPP mechanism in force in Canada.

This bill was invoked in Ontario (and then [[Supreme Court of Canada]] docket 33819) in the case of Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., [[Alain Deneault]], [[Delphine Abadie]] and [[William Sacher]] vs. [[Banro]] Inc., in which the publisher Écosociété pleaded (supported by the [[BCCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/Ecosociete_BCCLA_argument.pdf |title=Les Editions Ecosociete Inc., Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie and William Sacher v.

That treaty only permits liability for arbitrary and unlawful speech. The ICCPR has also been cited, in the BC case Crookes v. Newton, as the standard for balancing free speech versus reputation rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in October 2011, ruling in that case, neither reiterated nor rescinded that standard.

It has been argued that the lack of uniform protection against SLAPPs has encouraged [[forum shopping]]; proponents of federal legislation have argued that the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the [[chilling effect]] of SLAPPs.&lt;ref name=PPP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-slapp.org/slappdash-faqs-about-slapps/ |title=FAQS about SLAPPS |website=Public Participation Project |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403051530/http://www.anti-slapp.org/slappdash-faqs-about-slapps |archivedate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== California ====
California has a unique variant of anti-SLAPP legislation. In 1992 California enacted Code of Civil Procedure §&amp;nbsp;425.16, a [[statute]] intended to frustrate SLAPPs by providing a quick and inexpensive defense.&lt;ref name ="ccp_425_16_01" /&gt; It provides for a special motion that a [[defendant]] can file at the outset of a lawsuit to strike a [[complaint]] when it arises from conduct that falls within the rights of [[petition]] or [[free speech]]. The statute expressly applies to any writing or speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, but there is no requirement that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body. It also applies to speech in a public forum about an issue of public interest and to any other petition or speech conduct about an issue of public interest.

To win on an anti-SLAPP (special motion to strike) motion, the defendant in the alleged SLAPP action must first show that the lawsuit is based on claims related to [[United States Constitution|constitutionally protected activities]], typically [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights such as [[free speech]], and typically seeks to show that the claim lacks any basis of genuine substance, legal underpinnings, evidence, or prospect of success. If this is demonstrated then the [[legal burden|burden]] shifts to the plaintiff to affirmatively present evidence demonstrating a reasonable probability of succeeding in their case by showing an actual wrong would exist as recognized by law, if the facts claimed were borne out.

The filing of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]. This feature acts to greatly reduce the cost of litigation to the anti-SLAPP defendant, and can make beating the motion extremely difficult for the plaintiff, because they effectively must prove their case has at least a basis of visible legal merit and is not merely [[vexatious]], prior to discovery.

If the special motion is denied, the order denying the motion is immediately appealable. Defendants prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion (including any subsequent appeal) are entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney's fees. After an anti-SLAPP motion has been filed, a plaintiff cannot escape this mandatory fee award by amending its complaint. More than 300 published court opinions have interpreted and applied California's anti-SLAPP law.&lt;ref name="casp_cases_california_01"&gt;{{cite web

California's '''Code of Civil Procedure §&amp;nbsp;425.17''' corrects what the Legislature found to be abuse of the anti-SLAPP statute.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_17_01"&gt;{{cite web

Signed into law on September 6, 2003, this statute prohibits anti-SLAPP motions in response to certain public interest lawsuits and class actions, and actions that arise from commercial statements or conduct. '''Section 425.18''', signed into law on October 6, 2005, was enacted to facilitate SLAPP victims in recovering their damages through a SLAPPback ([[malicious prosecution]] action) against the SLAPP filers and their attorneys after the underlying SLAPP has been dismissed.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_18_01"&gt;{{cite web

==== Washington State ====
In May 2015, the Washington Supreme Court struck down the state’s 2010 anti-SLAPP statute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e34a54bc-3ce7-4e0c-b714-9a4db8e59ae3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balancing the right of access to the courts ==
The SLAPP penalty stands as a barrier to access to the courts by providing an early penalty to claimants who seek judicial redress. In recent years, the courts in some states have recognized that enforcement of SLAPP legislation must recognize and balance the constitutional rights of both litigants. It has been said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since [[Magna Carta]], the world has recognized the importance of justice in a free society. "To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice." (Magna Carta, 1215.) This nation's founding fathers knew people would never consent to be governed and surrender their right to decide disputes by force, unless government offered a just forum for resolving those disputes.&lt;ref name="social_contract_from_hobbes_to_rawls_01"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The right to bring grievances to the courts, in good faith, is protected by state and federal constitutions in a variety of ways. In most states, the right to trial by jury in civil cases is recognized. The right to cross-examine witnesses is considered fundamental to the American judicial system. Moreover, the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. The "right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition."&lt;ref name="california_motor_transport_v_trucking_unlimited"&gt;{{cite web

Because "the right to petition is 'among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]],' ... the right of access to the courts shares this 'preferred place' in [the United States'] hierarchy of constitutional freedoms and values."&lt;ref name="harrison_v_springdale_water_and_sewer"&gt;{{cite web

In ''Palazzo v. Alves'', the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By the nature of their subject matter, anti-SLAPP statutes require meticulous drafting. On the one hand, it is desirable to seek to shield citizens from improper intimidation when exercising their constitutional right to be heard with respect to issues of public concern. On the other hand, it is important that such statutes be limited in scope lest the constitutional right of access to the courts (whether by private figures, public figures, or public officials) be improperly thwarted. There is a genuine double-edged challenge to those who legislate in this area.&lt;ref name="palazzo_v_ives_944_a2d_144"&gt;{{cite web

The most challenging balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims which do not sound (give rise to a claim) in [[tort]]. The [[common law]] and [[constitutional law]] have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for [[public speech]], especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of [[libel]]ous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence that there has been deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the [[bad faith]] SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.

A Minnesota Supreme Court case, ''Middle-Snake-Tamarac Rivers Watershed Dist. v. Stengrim'', 784 N.W.2d 834 (Minn. 2010) establishes a two-step process to determine whether SLAPP procedure should be applied. The decision arises in the context of an effort to enforce a settlement agreement between a local government and an opponent of a flood control project. The landowner had accepted a significant monetary settlement in settlement of his opposition to land acquisition. The landowner agreed as part of the settlement to address no further challenges to the project. When the local government sued the landowner for breach of settlement, the landowner contended that enforcement of the settlement was a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The Supreme Court rejected that claim and affirmed the District Court's denial of SLAPP relief, holding "The District Court properly denied a motion to dismiss where the underlying claim involved an alleged breach of a settlement agreement that potentially limited the moving party's rights to public participation." The Supreme Court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Preexisting legal relationships, such as those based on a settlement agreement where a party waives certain rights, may legitimately limit a party’s public participation. It would be illogical to read sections 554.01-.05 as providing presumptive immunity to actions that a moving party may have contractually agreed to forgo or limit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the Minnesota approach, as a preliminary matter, the moving party must meet the burden of showing that the circumstances which bring the case within the purview of SLAPP protection exists. Until that has been accomplished, no clear and convincing burden has been shifted to the responding party.

* In May 2010, [[Youthdale Treatment Centres]] of Toronto, Ontario filed a defamation suit against various former patients, parents of former patients, and other persons, claiming C$5,000,000.00 in damages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The lawsuit, filed on May 5, 2010 on behalf of Youthdale by Harvin Pitch and Jennifer Lake of Teplitsky, Colson LLP claimed that these persons were involved in a conspiracy to, among other things, have Youthdale's licence to operate revoked. Youthdale also claimed their reputation was damaged as a result of various actions by the named defendants, which Youthdale alleged included the creation of websites and blogs containing complaints against Youthdale, including alleged accusations of unlawful administration of psychotropic medications. A notable left-turn for Youthdale occurred in July 2010, when Youthdale became the subject of a [[Toronto Star]] investigation, in which it was found that Youthdale had been admitting children to its Secure Treatment Unit that did not have mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zlomislic |first=Diana |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Investigations/article/832911 |title=Youth lock-ups blasted |newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has since been dismissed.

This, the Liberals and most commentators and authorities agreed, would be a serious crime if proven. Harper alleged the tape had been altered but a court found no evidence of this. The suit was dropped by [[Michael Ignatieff]] after he replaced [[Stephane Dion]] as Leader of the Opposition, and so was not heard in court, but was transparently a (successful) effort to get the trucks off the streets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

* Morris vs Johnson et al. October 22, 2012 ONSC 5824 (CanLII): During the final weeks of the 2010 municipal election in Aurora, Ontario a group town councilors and the incumbent Mayor agreed to use town funds in order to launch what was later referenced as a private lawsuit fronted by the Mayor, seeking $6M, against both named and anonymous residents who were critical of the local government. After the mayor and a number of councilors lost the election the new town council cut public funding for the private lawsuit and they issued a formal apology to the defendants. Almost one year after the town cut funding and after Morris lost a Norwich motion, Morris discontinued her case. The discontinuance cost decision delivered by Master Hawkins reads, per para. 32 (Ontario Superior court of Justice court file no.10-CV-412021): "Because I regard this action as SLAPP litigation designed to stifle debate about Mayor Morris' fitness for office, commenced during her re-election campaign, I award Johnson and Hogg special enhanced costs as was done in Scory v. Krannitz 2011 BCSC 1344 per Bruce J. at para. 31 (B.C.S.C)." Morris subsequently sued the town for $250,000 in the spring of 2013 in order to recover her legal costs for the period after the town cut funding of her case. Almost one and a half years after the final ruling in the Morris defamation case (i.e. the second Master Hawkins cost ruling delivered in January 2013) and approximately one year after suing the town, Morris amended her statement of claim to note that her legal costs were actually $27,821.46 and not the $250,000 as noted in the initial statement of claim. Morris then attempted to move the case to small claims court after the town had already spent over $150,000 in preparing its defense. As of the summer of 2015 the case is ongoing.
* In 2012, [[Sino-Forest]] sued Muddy Waters Research for $4&amp;nbsp;billion for defamation in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].

=== Estonia ===
In 2016, the real-estate investment company Pro Kapital Ltd sued urbanist Teele Pehk who expressed her opinion about the company's development plans in Kalasadam area in [[Tallinn]], Estonia. The accusations were based on an interview given for the article "The battle for the Estonian coastline", published by the monthly newspaper ''[[The Baltic Times]]''. Initially, instead of clarifying the questionable quotes in the article with the ''Baltic Times''{{'}} editors, Pro Kapital sent a legal demand to Pehk demanding that she publish a pre-written explanation and pay €500 to cover their legal advice expenses. Pehk provided proof to the lawyer that she had not lied to the journalist of ''The Baltic Times'', and the newspaper published a clarification online that Pehk's words were misinterpreted. Few months later Pro Kapital sued Pehk for damaging their reputation by spreading lies about the detailed plan of the Kalasadam area. Teele Pehk had been involved with the detailed plan of Kalasadam since 2011, as a member of the neighbourhood association Telliskivi selts and caretaker of the Kalarand beach, situated on the edge of Kalasadam area.

Half a year into the court case, Pro Kapital began negotiations and settled with a compromise before the court hearing. Pro Kapital paid for Pehk's legal costs and both parties agreed not to disparage each other in the future. Teele Pehk is still active in Tallinn urban development and continues to spread the word about SLAPP.

This first SLAPP case in Estonia took place at the end of the 12-year process of planning the Kalasadam area, which over the years had witnessed exceptionally high public interest regarding the planned residential development and most importantly, the public use of the seaside and the beach. The planning system in Estonia allows anyone to express their opinion, present suggestions or objections to any detailed plan. Many Estonian civic organisations were raising concerned voices about the case and the Chancellor for Justice of Estonia condemned that practice many times in public appearances.

=== Norway ===

In 2018, [[Lovdata]], a foundation which publishes judicial information, sued two people amongst the volunteers in the [[rettspraksis.no]] project. Up until 2008, Lovdata was considered a government agency and had unlimited access to the supreme court servers. Based on this access, Lovdata has established a [[de facto]] monopoly on Norwegian supreme court rulings. When rettspraksis.no published supreme court decisions, Lovdata sued [[Håkon Wium Lie]] and [[Fredrik Ljone]], two of the volunteers. Although court decisions are not protected by copyright in Norway, Lovdata claimed that rettspraksis.no had used advanced crawlers to copy Lovdata's database. In less than 24 hours, Lovdata was able to close the rettspraksis.no site and the judge also ordered the volunteers to pay Lovdata's legal fees. Also, rettspraksis.no was not allowed to appear in court to explain that their source for the legal decision is a CD deposited in the National Library by Lovdata itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Winner's report, "Findings on Judicial Practices &amp; Court-appointed Personnel in the Family Courts in Dorchester, Charleston &amp; Berkeley Counties, South Carolina" and citizen demonstrations led to the first laws in South Carolina to establish minimum standards and licensing requirements for guardians ad litem – who represent the interests of children in court cases.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Cook, Final Reply Brief of Appellant/Respondent Ernie Weaver in the Charleston County case, 2001-CP-10-2967.&lt;/ref&gt; The retaliatory SLAPPs have been dragging on for nearly 10 years, with judgments totaling more than $11&amp;nbsp;million against the co-defendants collectively. Reflecting the retaliatory nature of these suits, at least one of the co-defendants is still waiting to find out from the judges which particular statements, if any, he made were false.&lt;ref&gt;Final Reply Brief of Appellant/Respondent Ernie Weaver in the Charleston County case, 2001-CP-10-2967.&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 1981 to 1986, [[Pacific Legal Foundation]] and [[San Luis Obispo County, California]], filed a suit attempting to obtain the mailing list of the [[Abalone Alliance]] to get the group to pay for the police costs of the largest [[anti-nuclear]] [[civil disobedience|civil-disobedience]] act in U.S. history at the [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant]]. Pacific Legal Foundation lost at every court level and withdrew the suit the day before it was due to be heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* In March 2009, [[MagicJack]] (a company that promotes a USB VOIP device) filed a defamation suit against [[Boing Boing]] for exposing their unfair and deceptive business tactics regarding their [[EULA]], visitor counter, and 30-day trial period. This was dismissed as a SLAPP by a California judge in late 2009. In the resulting ruling, MagicJack was made responsible for most of Boing Boing's legal cost.&lt;ref name="magic_jack_boing_boing"&gt;{{cite web

* In the 2009 case Comins vs. VanVoorhis, a Florida man named Christopher Comins filed a defamation suit against a University of Florida graduate student after the student blogged about a video of Comins repeatedly shooting someone's pet dogs. This was cited as an example of a SLAPP by the radio show ''[[On the Media]]''.&lt;ref name="onthemedia_01" /&gt;
* In November 2010, filmmaker Fredrik Gertten, as defendant, won an anti-SLAPP motion after he was sued for defamation by Dole Fruit Company.

* In an effort to prevent four women from filing any Public Records Requests without first getting permission from a judge, or from filing future lawsuits, the Congress Elementary School District filed the lawsuit [[Congress Elementary School District v. Warren, et. al.]] on January 28, 2010. [[The Goldwater Institute]], a think tank based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], represented the four defendants. The school district said that it has been harassed so often by Warren that it was not able to functionally educate its students. Toni Wayas, the school district's superintendent, claimed "that it had, time and time again, complied with the requests" The Goldwater Institute argued that the school district had been in violation of state laws mandating government transparency in the past. Investigations in 2002 and 2007 by the state Ombudsman and Attorney General uncovered violations of the state's open meeting law by the Attorney General's Office. According to Carrie Ann Sitren of the Goldwater Institute, this was "a clear attempt to silence people in the community who have been critical of the board's actions, and have made good-faith attempts to ensure the district is spending taxpayer money wisely." None of the records requested were private or confidential, and thus, should have been readily available to be released to the public, according to the assistant state Ombudsman.&lt;ref name="congress_school_district_v_warren"&gt;{{cite news

In 1838, Syed Ahmad entered the service of [[East India Company]] and went on to become a judge at a [[Small Causes Court]] in 1867, and retired from service in 1876. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], he remained, loyal to the [[British Empire]] and was noted for his actions in saving European lives.&lt;ref name="Glasse, Cyril, (2001)"&gt;Cyril Glasse (2001) ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira Press&lt;/ref&gt; After the rebellion, he penned the booklet [[Indian Mutiny|''The Causes of the Indian Mutiny'']]&amp;nbsp;– a daring critique, at the time, of [[British Raj|British]] policies that he blamed for causing the revolt. Believing that the future of Muslims was threatened by the rigidity of their [[Orthodox stance|orthodox outlook]], Sir Syed began promoting [[Education in the United Kingdom|Western–style]] [[scientific education]] by founding modern schools and journals and organising Muslim entrepreneurs.

In 1859, Syed established Gulshan School at [[Muradabad]], [[Victoria School]] at [[Ghazipur]] in 1863, and a [[Scientific Society of Aligarh|scientific society]] for Muslims in 1864. In 1875, founded the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]], the first Muslim university in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://storyofpakistan.com/sir-syed-ahmad-khan |title=Sir Syed Ahmad Khan {{!}} The greatest Muslim reformer and statesman of the 19th Century.|date=1 June 2003|language=en-US|access-date=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Syed repeatedly called upon Muslims to loyally serve the [[British Empire]] and promoted the adoption of Urdu as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of all [[Indian Muslim]]s. Syed heavily critiqued the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

Syed maintains a strong legacy in [[Pakistan]] and [[Indian Muslims]]. He strongly influenced other Muslim leaders including [[Allama Iqbal]] and [[Jinnah]].

==Early life==
Syed Ahmed Taqvi 'Khan Bahadur' was born on 17 October 1817 to a [[Syed|Syed family]] in [[Delhi]], which was the [[State capital|capital]] of the [[Mughal Empire]]. His family were descendant of [[Muhammad]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hali|Hali]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved to the Indian subcontinent&lt;ref name="LW"&gt;[[#Graham|Graham]], p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; in the ruling times of [[Mughal Emperor|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar|Akbar–I]]. Many generations of his family had since been highly connected with the administrative position in [[Mughal Empire]]. His maternal grandfather Khwaja Fariduddin served as ''[[Vizier|Wazir]]'' (lit. Minister) in the court of [[Mughal Emperor|Emperor]] [[Akbar Shah II|Akbar–II]].&lt;ref name="Story"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/person.asp?period |title=Sir Syed Ahmad Khan |work=Story of Pakistan |accessdate=14 October 2006}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather Syed Hadi Jawwad bin Imaduddin held a ''[[mansabdar|mansab]]'' (lit. [[General]])– a high-ranking administrative position and honorary name of "Mir Jawwad Ali Khan" in the court of [[Mughal Emperor|Emperor]] [[Alamgir II]]. Sir Syed's father, Syed Muttaqi Muhammad bin Hadi Khan, was personally close to [[Mughal Emperor|Emperor]] [[Akbar Shah II|Akbar–II]] and served as his personal adviser.&lt;ref name= "LW4"&gt;[[#Graham|Graham]], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Syed Ahmad was born at a time when his father was regional insurrections aided and led by the [[East India Company]], and the [[British Empire]] had diminished the extent and power of the Mughal state, reducing its monarch to [[figurehead]]. With his elder brother Syed Muhammad bin Muttaqi Khan, Sir Syed was raised in a large house in a wealthy area of the city. They were raised in strict accordance with Mughal noble traditions and exposed to politics. Their mother Aziz-un-Nisa played a formative role in Sir Syed's early life, raising him with rigid discipline with a strong emphasis on modern [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Syed Ziaur Rahman]] (Sept–Oct. 1999) "Sir Syed and His Family Background", ''The norad Magazine'', Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 1998–99, pp. 17–19; ''We and You'' (Special Issue), Aligarh, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Syed was taught to read and understand the [[Qur'an]] by a female tutor, which was unusual at the time. He received an education traditional to Muslim nobility in [[Delhi]]. Under the charge of Lord Wellesley

==Career==
[[File:Siryedazam.jpg|thumb|[[Maulvi Samiullah Khan|Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk]], Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Justice [[Syed Mahmood]], he was the first Muslim to serve as a High Court judge in the British Raj.]]

Having recognized the steady decline in Mughal political power, Sir Syed decided to enter the service of the East India Company. He could not enter the [[British Civil Service|English civil service]] because it was only in the 1860s that natives were admitted. He did not attend the [[East India Company College]] which did not grant degrees.&lt;ref name="David J. Matthews"/&gt; His first appointment was as a  ''Serestadar'' (lit. Clerk) at the courts of law in [[Agra]], responsible for record-keeping and managing court affairs.&lt;ref name="David J. Matthews"&gt;[[#Hali|Hali]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, he was promoted to the title of ''[[munshi]]''. In 1858, he was appointed to a high-ranking post at the court in [[Muradabad]], where he began working on his most famous literary work.

Acquainted with high-ranking British officials, Sir Syed obtained close knowledge about British colonial politics during his service at the courts. At the outbreak of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian rebellion]], on 10 May 1857, Sir Syed was serving as the chief assessment officer at the court in [[Bijnor]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Northern India became the scene of the most intense fighting.&lt;ref name= "SSU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Syed Ahmad Khan – Chronology |publisher=Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology|url=https://ssuet.edu.pk/about-us/inspiration/sir-syed-ahmed-khan/ |date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict had left large numbers of civilians dead. Erstwhile centres of Muslim power such as Delhi, Agra, [[Lucknow]] and [[Kanpur]] were severely affected. Sir Syed was personally affected by the violence and the ending of the Mughal dynasty amongst many other long-standing kingdoms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Sir Syed and many other Muslims took this as a defeat of Muslim society.&lt;ref name="Shan"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Aligarh Movement |publisher=Meenakshi Prakashan |location=[[Meerut]] |author=Shan Muhammad|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.119516/page/n1 |pages=IX |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost several close relatives who died in the violence. Although he succeeded in rescuing his mother from the turmoil, she died in [[Meerut]], owing to the privations she had experienced.&lt;ref name="SSU" /&gt;

Social reforms in the Muslim society were initiated by [[Nawab Abdul Latif|Abdul Latif]] who founded "The Mohammedan Literary Society" in Bengal. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College|MAO College]] which eventually became the [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. He opposed ignorance, superstitions and evil customs prevalent in Indian Muslim society. He firmly believed that Muslim society would not progress without the acquisition of western education and science. As time passed, Sir Syed began stressing on the idea of pragmatic modernism and started advocating for strong interfaith relations between [[Islam and Christianity]].

==Causes of the Indian Revolt==
Sir Syed supported the British during the [[1857 uprising]], a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as [[Jamaluddin Afghani]]. In 1859 Sir Syed published the booklet ''Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind'' (The Causes of the Indian Revolt) in which he studied the causes of the Indian revolt. In this, his most famous work, he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by Muslim élites, who resented the diminishing influence of Muslim monarchs. He blamed the British [[East India Company]] for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of British politicians regarding Indian culture. Sir Syed advised the British to appoint Muslims to assist in administration, to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ (a vulgar deed) such as the mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoodbhoy |first1=Pervez |title=Why Sir Syed loses and Allama Iqbal wins in Pakistan |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/504576/why-sir-syed-loses-and-allama-iqbal-wins-in-pakistan/ |accessdate=30 July 2015 |publisher=The Pakistan Tribune |date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maulana Altaf Hussain Hali wrote in the biography of Sir Syed that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"As soon as Sir Syed reached Muradabad, he began to write the pamphlet entitled 'The Causes of the Indian Revolt' (Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind), in which he did his best to clear the people of India, and especially the Muslims, of the charge of Mutiny. In spite of the obvious danger, he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the Government and refused the theory which the British had invented to explain the causes of the Mutiny."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hali|Hali]], pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the work was finished, without waiting for an English translation, Sir Syed sent the Urdu version to be printed at the Mufassilat Gazette Press in Agra. Within a few weeks, he received 500 copies back from the printers. His friend warned him not to send the pamphlet to Parliament or to the Government of India. Rae Shankar Das, a great friend of Sir Syed, begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger. Sir Syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the British for the good of his own people, of his country, and of the government itself. He said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of India alike, he would gladly suffer whatever befell him. When Rae Shankar Das saw that Sir Syed's mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it, he wept and remained silent. After performing a supplementary prayer and asking God's blessing, Sir Syed sent almost all the 500 copies of his pamphlet to England, one to the government, and kept the rest himself.

When the government of India had the book translated and presented before the Council, Lord Canning, the governor-general, and [[Sir Bartle Frere]] accepted it as a sincere and friendly report. The foreign secretary [[Cecil Beadon]], however, severely attacked it, calling it 'an extremely seditious pamphlet'. He wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author, unless he could give a satisfactory explanation, should be harshly dealt with. Since no other member of the Council agreed with his opinion, his attack did no harm.

Later, Sir Syed was invited to attend Lord Canning's [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] in Farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there. He told Sir Syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the government's interests at heart, he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country; he would have communicated it directly to the government. Sir Syed replied that he had only had 500 copies printed, the majority of which he had sent to England, one had been given to the government of India, and the remaining copies were still in his possession. Furthermore, he had the receipt to prove it. He was aware, he added, that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times, which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective. It was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly. He promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in India he would personally pay 1,000 rupees. At first, Beadon was not convinced and asked Sir Syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in India. Sir Syed reassured him on this matter, and Beadon never mentioned it again. Later he became one of Sir Syed's strongest supporters.

Many official translations were made of the Urdu text of ''The Causes of the Indian Revolt''. The one undertaken by the India Office formed the subject of many discussions and debates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Masood Ashraf Raja]] (2010) ''Constructing Pakistan: Foundational Texts and the Rise of Muslim National Identity'', 1857–1947. Oxford.  Chapter 2. {{ISBN|978-0-19-547811-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet was also translated by the government of India and several members of parliament, but no version was offered to the public. A translation which had been started by a government official was finished by Sir Syed's great friend, Colonel G.F.I. Graham, and finally published in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hali|Hali]], pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of Mirza Ghalib==
[[File:Court of Akbar from Akbarnama.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The court of Akbar, an illustration from a manuscript of the [[Ain-e-Akbari]]]]
In 1855, &lt;nowiki&gt;he finished&lt;/nowiki&gt; his scholarly, well researched and illustrated edition of Abul Fazl's ''[[Ain-e-Akbari|Ai'n-e Akbari]]'', itself an extraordinarily difficult book. Having finished the work to his satisfaction, and believing that [[Mirza Ghalib|Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib]] was a person who would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a ''taqriz'' (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he did produce was a short Persian poem castigating the Ai'n-e Akbari, and by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product. The least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things. Worse, he praised sky-high the "sahibs of England" who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world.&lt;ref&gt;The word a’in can mean all or any of the following: character, convention, temperament, habit, rule, path, law (ecclesiastical or secular), creed, praxis, quality, intention, organization, management, system, decoration, beauty. (Lughat Nama-e Dehkhoda). There are about eighty meanings in all. These meanings seem to have developed over the centuries. Most were available to Abul Fazl; all were available to Ghalib.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was unexpected, but it came at the time when Syed Ahmad Khan's thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change. Ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a European[English]-sponsored change in world polity, especially Indian polity. Syed Ahmad might well have been piqued at Ghalib's admonitions, but he would also have realized that Ghalib's reading of the situation, though not nuanced enough, was basically accurate. Syed Ahmad Khan may also have felt that he, being better informed about the English and the outside world, should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner.

Sir Syed Ahmad Khan never again wrote a word in praise of the ''Ai'n-e Akbari'' and in fact gave up taking an active interest in history and archaeology. He did edit another two historical texts over the next few years, but neither of them was anything like the ''Ai'n'': a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of Akbar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Faruqi |first1=Shamsur Rahman |title=From Antiquary to Social Revolutionary: Syed Ahmad Khan and the Colonial Experience |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00fwp/srf/srf_sirsayyid.pdf |website=Shamsur Rahman Faruqi, work in English |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=12 December 2015 |ref=srf_ss_gh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly works==
[[File:Muhammadansocialreformer.jpg|thumb|right|upright|First issue of the journal ''Muhammadan Social Reformer'' dated 24 December 1870, it was a pioneering publication initiated by Sir Syed to promote liberal ideas in Muslim society.]]

While continuing to work as a junior clerk, Sir Syed began focusing on writing, from the age of 23 (in 1840), on various subjects (from [[mechanics]] to educational issues), mainly in Urdu, where he wrote, at least, 6000 pages.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Wilder (2006), ''Selected essays by Sir Sayed Ahmad Khan'', p. 34. {{ISBN|9789693518054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; His career as an author began when he published a series of treatises in Urdu on religious subjects in 1842. He published the book ''Asaar-us-sanadeed'' (''Great Monuments'') documenting antiquities of Delhi dating from the medieval era. This work earned him the reputation of a cultured scholar. In 1842, he completed the ''Jila-ul-Qulub bi Zikr-il Mahbub'' and the ''Tuhfa-i-Hasan'', along with the ''Tahsil fi jar-i-Saqil'' in 1844. These works focused on religious and cultural subjects. In 1852, he published the two works ''Namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwur-i-Shaikh'' and ''Silsilat ul-Mulk''. He released the second edition of ''Ansar-as-sanadid'' in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssuet.edu.pk/stidemo/ssuet/Chronology.htm Sir Syed Ahmed Khan &gt;&gt; Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709150800/http://www.ssuet.edu.pk/stidemo/ssuet/Chronology.htm |date=9 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also started work on a commentary on the [[Bible]] – the first by a Muslim – in which he argued that Islam was the closest religion to [[Christianity]], with a common lineage from [[Abrahamic religion]]s.&lt;ref name="Story" /&gt; He began with [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], the first books of the Old and New Testament, but quit his project before even completing those first two. His other writings such as ''Loyal Muhammadans of India'', ''Tabyin-ul-Kalam'' and ''A Series of Essays on the Life of [[Muhammad]] and Subjects Subsidiary Therein'' helped to create cordial relations between the British authorities and the Muslim community.

Through the 1850s, Syed Ahmed Khan began developing a strong passion for education. While pursuing studies of different subjects including European jurisprudence, Sir Syed began to realise the advantages of Western-style education, which was being offered at newly established colleges across India. Despite being a devout Muslim, Sir Syed criticised the influence of traditional dogma and religious orthodoxy, which had made most Indian Muslims suspicious of British influences.&lt;ref name="EPMI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Educational Philosophy in Modern India |first=S |last=KUMAR |publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd. |pages=59 |year=2000 |isbn=978-81-261-0431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Syed began feeling increasingly concerned for the future of Muslim communities.&lt;ref name="EPMI" /&gt; A scion of Mughal nobility, Sir Syed had been reared in the finest traditions of Muslim élite culture and was aware of the steady decline of Muslim political power across India. The animosity between the British and Muslims before and after the rebellion (Independence War) of 1857 threatened to marginalise Muslim communities across India for many generations.&lt;ref name= "EPMI" /&gt; Sir Syed intensified his work to promote co-operation with British authorities, promoting loyalty to the [[British Empire|Empire]] amongst Indian Muslims. Committed to working for the upliftment of Muslims, Sir Syed founded a modern [[madrassa]] in Muradabad in 1859; this was one of the first religious schools to impart scientific education. Sir Syed also worked on social causes, helping to organise relief for the famine-struck people of North-West Province in 1860. He established another modern school in [[Ghazipur]] in 1863.

Upon his transfer to [[Aligarh]] in 1864, Sir Syed began working wholeheartedly as an educator. He founded the [[Scientific Society of Aligarh]], the first scientific association of its kind in India. Modelling it after the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Asiatic Society]],&lt;ref name= "Bio" /&gt; Sir Syed assembled Muslim scholars from different parts of the country. The Society held annual conferences, disbursed funds for educational causes and regularly published a journal on scientific subjects in [[English language|English]] and Urdu. Sir Syed felt that the socio-economic future of Muslims was threatened by their orthodox aversions to modern science and technology.&lt;ref name="EPMI" /&gt; He published many writings promoting liberal, rational interpretations of [[Islamic Holy Books|Islamic scriptures]]. 
One example was the reaction to  his argument – which appeared in his ''[[tafsir]]'' (exegesis) of the [[Quran]] – that ''[[riba]]'' referred to interest charges when lending money to the poor, but not to the rich, nor to borrowers "in trade or in industry", since this finance supported "trade, national welfare and prosperity". While many jurists declared all interest to be riba, (according to Sir Syed) this was based "on their own authority and deduction" rather than the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir al Quran'', v.1 p.3016, translated and quoted in [[#Baljon|Baljon]], pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other orthodox Sunni schools condemned him as out of the fold of Islam i.e. ''[[kafir]]''.&lt;ref name = "Islam"/&gt; Many of his own friends, like Nawab [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk|Muhsin ul Mulk]], expressed their significant reservations at his religious ideas (many of which were expounded in his commentary of Qur'an).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Panipati|Panipati]], pp. 249–263&lt;/ref&gt; According to J.M.S. Baljon his ideas created "a real hurricane of protests and outbursts of wrath" among by local clerics "in every town and village" in Muslim India, who issued [[fatwa|fatawa]] "declaring him to be a ''[[kafir]]''" (unbeliever).&lt;ref name="baljon-108"&gt;[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused of having converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="baljon-106"&gt;[[#Baljon|Baljon]], p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Maulana [[Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi|Qasim Nanautawi]], the founder of [[Darul Uloom Deoband|Darul 'Uloom Deoband]], expressed in a letter to an anacquaintance of his and Sir Syed's:

"No doubt, I greatly admire, as per what I've heard, Syed (Ahmad) Sahab's courage (''Ūlul Azmi'') and concern for the Muslims (''Dardmandi e Ahl e Islam''). For this if I shall express my affection for him, it will be rightful. However, similar to this (or rather more than this), upon hearing about his disturbed (Fāsid) beliefs, I have deep complains and sorrow for him"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Panipati|Panipati]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maulana Qasim Nanautawi wrote directly to Sir Syed as well, explaining him some of his "noteworthy" mistakes. This correspondence was published as "Tasfiyat ul Aqaaid" in 1887 C.E &lt;ref&gt;[[#Panipati|Panipati]], p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;
==Advocacy of Urdu==
{{See also|Hindi-Urdu controversy}}
[[File:Sirsyedinpunjab.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Syed Ahmed Khan in Punjab]]

The onset of the [[Hindi-Urdu controversy]] of 1867 saw the emergence of Sir Syed as a champion for cause of the Urdu language. He became a leading Muslim voice opposing the adoption of [[Hindi]] as a second official language of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]). Sir Syed perceived Urdu as the ''lingua franca'' of the United Provinces. Having been developed by during the Mughal period, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society translated Western works only into Urdu. The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus, was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India. Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that "Urdu was the language of [[gentry]] and Hindi that of the vulgar."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fmnpssOM_3kC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Urdu+was+the+language+of+gentry+and+Hindi+that+of+the+vulgar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qYJzARaHiI&amp;sig=sUvDhRokxc7PfrU6dm4TdZpX1bw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=varoUYTLNKbG0AX1uIGwDA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Urdu%20was%20the%20language%20of%20gentry%20and%20Hindi%20that%20of%20the%20vulgar&amp;f=false Hindi Nationalism], Alok Rai, Orient Blackswan, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders, who unified across the nation to demand the recognition of Hindi.

The success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of all Indian Muslims. His educational and political work grew increasingly centred around and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give Urdu extensive official use and patronage. His colleagues such as [[Mohsin-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] developed organisations such as the [[Urdu Defence Association]] and the [[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu]], committed to the perpetuation of Urdu.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} All these colleagues led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the [[Hyderabad State]] and as the medium of instruction in the [[Osmania University]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;ref name="Yusuf"&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslim Politics and Leadership in the South Asian Sub-continent |publisher=Institute of Islamic History, Culture and Civilization, Islamic University ([[Islamabad]]) |first=Yusuf |last=ABBASI |pages=90 |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu had become an integral part of political and cultural identity. However, the division over the use of Hindi or Urdu further provoked communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

On 1 April 1869 he went, along with his son [[Syed Mahmood]], to [[England]], where he was awarded the [[Order of the Star of India]] from the British government on 6 August. Travelling across England, he visited its colleges and was inspired by the culture of learning established after the [[Renaissance]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Sir Syed returned to India in the following year determined to build a "Muslim [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]." Upon his return, he organised the "Committee for the Better Diffusion and Advancement of Learning among [[Muslim|Muhammadans]]" (Muslims) on 26 December 1870. Sir Syed described his vision of the institution he proposed to establish in an article written sometime in 1872 and re-printed in the [[Aligarh Institute Gazette]] of 5 April 1911:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I may appear to be dreaming and talking like Shaikh Chilli, but we aim to turn this MAO College into a University similar to that of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or Cambridge. Like the churches of Oxford and Cambridge, there will be [[mosque]]s attached to each College... The College will have a dispensary with a Doctor and a compounder, besides a ''[[Unani]] [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]]''. It will be mandatory on boys in residence to join the congregational prayers ([[salat|namaz]]) at all the five times. Students of other religions will be exempted from this religious observance. Muslim students will have a uniform consisting of a black alpaca, half-sleeved ''chugha'' and a red ''[[Fez (clothing)|Fez]]'' cap... Bad and abusive words which boys generally pick up and get used to, will be strictly prohibited. Even such a word as a "liar" will be treated as an abuse to be prohibited. They will have food either on tables of [[table manners|European style]] or on chaukis in the manner of the [[Arab cuisine#Culture|Arabs]]... Smoking of cigarette or ''[[hookah|huqqa]]'' and the chewing of [[betel]]s shall be strictly prohibited. No [[corporal punishment]] or any such punishment as is likely to injure a student's self-respect will be permissible... It will be strictly enforced that [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] boys shall not discuss their religious differences in the College or in the boarding house. At present it is like a day dream. I pray to God that this dream may come true."{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Sirsyedsignatures.jpg|thumb|right|Signatures of Sir Syed]]

By 1873, the committee under Sir Syed issued proposals for the construction of a college in Aligarh. He began publishing the journal ''Tahzib-al-Akhlaq'' (''Social Reformer'') on 24 December 1870 to spread awareness and knowledge on modern subjects and promote reforms in Muslim society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aligarhmovement.com/Chronology_of_Aligarh_Movement A Brief Chronology of Aligarh Movement]. aligarhmovement.com &lt;/ref&gt; Sir Syed worked to promote reinterpretation of Muslim ideology in order to reconcile tradition with Western education. He argued in several books on Islam that the Qur'an rested on an appreciation of reason and natural law, making scientific inquiry important to being a good Muslim. Sir Syed established a modern school in Aligarh and, obtaining support from wealthy Muslims and the British, laid the foundation stone of the [[Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College]] on 24 May 1875. He retired from his career as a jurist the following year, concentrating entirely on developing the college and on religious reform.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt; Sir Syed's pioneering work received support from the British. Although intensely criticised by orthodox religious leaders hostile to modern influences, Sir Syed's new institution attracted a large student body, mainly drawn from the Muslim gentry and middle classes.&lt;ref name = "Islam"&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam in Global History |author=Nazeer Ahmed |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |pages=231 |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7388-5966-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=December 2017}} The curriculum at the college involved scientific and Western subjects, as well as Oriental subjects and religious education.&lt;ref name= "Bio" /&gt; The first [[chancellor]] was [[Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal|Sultan Shah Jahan Begum]], a prominent Muslim noblewoman, and Sir Syed invited an Englishman, [[Theodore Beck]], to serve as the first college principal.&lt;ref name="Islam" /&gt; The college was originally affiliated with [[Calcutta University]] but was transferred to the [[Allahabad University]] in 1885. Near the turn of the 20th century, it began publishing its own magazine and established a law school. In 1920, the college was transformed into a university.

==Political career==
In 1878, Sir Syed was nominated to the Viceroy's Legislative Council.&lt;ref name="LW 289"&gt;[[#Graham|Graham]], p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; He testified before the education commission to promote the establishment of more colleges and schools across India. In the same year, Sir Syed founded the Muhammadan Association to promote political co-operation amongst Indian Muslims from different parts of the country. In 1886, he organised the [[All India Muhammadan Educational Conference]] in Aligarh, which promoted his vision of modern education and political unity for Muslims. His works made him the most prominent Muslim politician in 19th century India, often influencing the attitude of Muslims on various national issues. He supported the efforts of Indian political leaders [[Surendranath Banerjee]] and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] to obtain representation for Indians in the government and civil services. In 1883, he founded the Muhammadan Civil Service Fund Association to encourage and support the entry of Muslim graduates into the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS).&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Struggle for Freedom |publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |pages=1967 |author=RC Majumdar|id=ASIN: B000HXEOUM |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fearful of the loss of Muslim political power owing to the community's backwardness, Sir Syed was also averse to the prospect of democratic self-government, which would give control of government to the Hindu-majority population:&lt;ref name="Baig"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Muslim Dilemma in India |isbn=9780706903119|publisher=Vikas Publishing House |location=[[Delhi]] |author=M.R.A. Baig|pages=51–2 |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPMI2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Educational Philosophy in Modern India |author=S. Kumar |publisher=Anmol Publications Pvt. Ltd. |page=60 |year=2000 |isbn=978-81-261-0431-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At this time our nation is in a bad state in regards education and wealth, but God has given us the light of religion and the Quran is present for our guidance, which has ordained them and us to be friends. Now God has made them rulers over us. Therefore we should cultivate friendship with them, and should adopt that method by which their rule may remain permanent and firm in India, and may not pass into the hands of the [[Bengali people|Bengalis]]... If we join the political movement of the Bengalis our nation will reap a loss, for we do not want to become subjects of the Hindus instead of the subjects of the "[[people of the Book]]..."&lt;ref name="EPMI2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in his life he said, "Suppose that the English community and the army were to leave India, taking with them all their cannons and their splendid weapons and all else, who then would be the rulers of India?.... Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations—the Mohammedans and the Hindus—could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable. But until one nation has conquered the other and made it obedient, peace cannot reign in the land."&lt;ref&gt;Sir Syed Ahmed Khan (1817–1898), Speech in March 1888, Quoted by Dilip Hiro, "The Longest August: The Unflinching Rivalry Between India and Pakistan"[https://yaleglobal.yale.edu/longest-august-unflinching-rivalry-between-india-and-pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-India Muslim League===
Sir Syed's educational model and progressive thinking inspired Muslim elites who supported the AIML. Ahmad Khan founded the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in 1886 in order to promote Western education, especially science and literature, among India's Muslims. The conference, in addition to generating funds for Ahmad Khan's Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, motivated Muslim elites to propose expansion of educational uplift elsewhere, known as the [[Aligarh Movement]]. In turn this new awareness of Muslim needs helped stimulate a political consciousness among Muslim elites that went on to form the AIML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abdul Rashid Khan|title=All India Muhammadan Educational Conference and the Foundation of the All India Muslim League|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society|year=2007|volume=55 |issue =1–2|pages=65–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Syed Ahmed is hailed as a Muslim social reformer who promoted communal harmony and peaceful coexistence of all communities in India. In an undivided India under the British rule, he was worried about Muslim backwardness and unwillingness to adopt modern education. He worked towards social and educational upliftment of Muslims so as to enable them to walk shoulder to shoulder with all other communities in India.

==Legacy and Knighthood==
Syed Ahmad is widely commemorated across South Asia as a great Muslim social reformer and visionary.&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RC" /&gt; At the same time, Syed Ahmad sought to politically ally Muslims with the British government. An avowed loyalist of the [[British Empire]], he was nominated as a member of the Civil Service Commission in 1887 by [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]]. In 1888, he established the [[United Patriotic Association]] at Aligarh to promote political co-operation with the British and Muslim participation in the British government.

Syed Ahmed was bestowed with the suffix of 'Khan Bahadur' and was subsequently [[knight]]ed by the British government in 1888 and was awarded [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India|Knight Commander of the order of Star of India]] (KCSI)&lt;ref name=brit&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ikram |first1=S.S. |title=Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan: Muslim Scholar |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Sayyid-Ahmad-Khan |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his loyalty to the British crown, through his membership of the Imperial Legislative Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Puja Mondal |title=Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and the Aligarh Movement |url=http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/history/sir-syed-ahmed-khan-and-the-aligarh-movement/23145/ |accessdate=30 July 2015|date=2014-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the following year he received an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] ''honoris causa'' from the [[Edinburgh University]].&lt;ref name="Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/a-musafir-to-london/278673 |title=A Musafir To London|author=C.M. Naim|date=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Bahadur lived the last two decades of his life in Aligarh, regarded widely as the mentor of 19th and 20th century Muslim entrepreneurs and illuminati. Battling illnesses and old age, Sir Syed died on 27 March 1898. He was buried besides [[Sir Syed Masjid]] inside the campus of the Aligarh university.

The university he founded remains one of India's most prominent institutions. Prominent alumni of Aligarh include Muslim political leaders Maulana [[Mohammad Ali Jouhar]], [[Abdur Rab Nishtar]], [[Maulana Shaukat Ali]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]], who is hailed in [[Pakistan]] as ''[[Baba-e-Urdu]]'' (''Father of Urdu''). The first two [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Ministers of Pakistan]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] and [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], as well as [[Indian President]] [[Zakir Hussain (politician)|Dr. Zakir Hussain]], are amongst Aligarh's most famous graduates. In India, Sir Syed is commemorated as a pioneer who worked for the socio-political upliftment of Indian Muslims.

The '''teletransportation paradox''' or '''teletransport paradox''' (also known in alternative forms as the '''duplicates paradox''') is a thought experiment on the [[Identity (philosophy)|philosophy of identity]] that challenges common intuitions on the nature of self and consciousness. It first appeared in full published form presumably in [[Derek Parfit]]'s 1984 book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'', but similar questions have been raised as early as 1775.

{{Quote|text=I would be glad to know your Lordship's opinion whether when my brain has lost its original structure, and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being, whether, I say that being will be me; or, if, two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain; whether they will all be me, and consequently one and the same intelligent being.|sign=[[Thomas Reid]] letter to [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]], 1775&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gm5CAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52|title=The Works of Thomas Reid, D.D.: Now Fully Collected, with Selections from His Umpublished Letters|author=Reid, T. and Hamilton, W. and Stewart, D.|year=1846|publisher=Maclachlan and Stewart|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Polish science-fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]] discovered the same problem independently in the middle of the twentieth century. He put it in writing in his philosophical text "''Dialogi''", 1957.

==Derek Parfit's version==

In ''Divided Minds and the Nature of Persons'' (1987), Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a "teletransporter", a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms, copying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light.  On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position.  Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel—is the person on Mars the ''same person'' as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when waking up on Mars, ''you'' would feel like being ''you'', ''you'' would remember entering the teletransporter in order to travel to Mars, ''you'' would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.

Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place.

Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact.  What matters, to Parfit, is simply "Relation R", psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.

Parfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual's "Future Self" from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not explicitly endorse such invasive control.

Parfit's conclusion is similar to [[David_Hume#The_self|David Hume's view]] and also to the view of the self in [[Buddhism]]{{dubious|date=March 2016}}, though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being ''reductive'', Parfit's view is also ''deflationary'': in the end, "what matters" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness.

'''''The Garden of Cyrus''''', or ''The Quincuncial [[Lozenge]], or Network Plantations of the Ancients, naturally, artificially, mystically considered'', is a [[discourse]] by [[Sir Thomas Browne]]. First published in 1658, along with its [[diptych]] companion, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Urn-Burial]]'', in modern times it has been recognised as Browne's major literary contribution to [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] wisdom.&lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/what-is-more-beautiful-than-quincunx.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html |title=Scintillae marginila: Sparkling margins - Alchemical and Hermetic thought in the literary works of Sir Thomas Browne |author=Faulkner, Kevin |date=2002 |accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:The Garden of Cyrus (1658) frontispiece.gif|thumb|right|Frontispiece to ''The Garden of Cyrus'' (1658)]]Written during a time when restrictions on publishing became more relaxed during [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]], ''The Garden of Cyrus'' (1658) is Browne's contribution to a 'boom period' decade of interest in esoterica in England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alchemywebsite.com/eng_bks.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Browne's discourse is a [[Neoplatonic]] and [[Neopythagorean]] vision of the interconnection of [[art]] and [[nature]] via the inter-related symbols of the number [[5|five]] and the [[quincunx]] pattern, along with the figure [[X]] and the [[Latticework|lattice]] design.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Huntley Sir Thomas Browne: a Biographical and Critical Study Ann Arbor, University of Michigan Press, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; Its fundamental quest was of primary concern to Hermetic philosophy: proof of the wisdom of [[God]], and demonstrable evidence of [[intelligent design]]. The Discourse includes early recorded usage of the words "[[prototype]]" and "[[archetype]]" in English.

'''Unified Lumumbist Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti Lumumbiste Unifié}} or ''PALU'') is a [[political party]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The party's name comes from [[Patrice Lumumba]], the first prime minister of Congo after its independence in 1960 from the [[Belgian colonial empire]].

It is led by [[Antoine Gizenga]] who placed third in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006|2006 general election]]. Gizenga backed the incumbent president [[Joseph Kabila]] in the runoff election, and was subsequently named prime minister in December 2006. PALU also won 34 out of 500 seats in the new parliament and became the third largest party. In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo Senate election, 2007|2007 senate election]], the party won only 2 out of 108 seats.

Gizenga resigned as Prime Minister on 25 September 2008 for reasons related to age and health, and on 10 October 2008 [[Adolphe Muzito]], another member of PALU who had served as Budget Minister under Gizenga, was appointed to succeed him. Muzito served as Prime Minister from 2008 until his resignation on 6 March 2012. &lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hIqIC0SJv-9FFXSMeyzUc-ET6f-w "DR Congo president names new prime minister: report"], AFP, 10 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2011|2011 general election]], PALU lost 15 seats in the lower house, sinking to 19 seats and becoming the sixth largest party in parliament. Additionally, PALU did not choose to field a presidential candidate in the election.

In 12–13 December 2014, the party was admitted into the [[Socialist International]] as an observer affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=2326|title=Socialist International - Progressive Politics For A Fairer World|website=www.socialistinternational.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 October 2018 PALU and its parliamentary allies exited the [[Alliance of the Presidential Majority|Presidential Majority]] coalition in anticipation of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2018|2018 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-42970_palu_majorite_le_divorce_est_consomme.html| title = PALU-Majorité : le divorce est consommé !| date = 3 October 2018| website = mediacongo.net| publisher = Media Congo Press| access-date = 3 October 2018| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Walter Wilson Greg''' (9 July 1875 &amp;ndash; 4 March 1959), known professionally as '''W. W. Greg''', was one of the leading bibliographers and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] scholars of the 20th century.

==Family and education==

Greg was born at [[Wimbledon and Putney Commons|Wimbledon Common]] in 1875. His father, [[William Rathbone Greg]], was an essayist; his mother was the daughter of [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]]. As a child, Greg was expected one day to assume editorship of ''[[The Economist]]'', which his grandfather had founded in 1843; Greg was educated at [[Wixenford School|Wixenford]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GRG894WW|name=Greg, Walter Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge he met [[Ronald Brunlees McKerrow|Ronald McKerrow]], whose friendship helped shape Greg's decision to pursue a career in literature. While still in school he compiled a list of Renaissance plays printed before 1700, and he joined the [[Bibliographical Society]] the same year. He was President of the Society from 1930 to 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/presidents Past Presidents of The Bibliographical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; and received its Gold Medal in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/gold-medalists Gold Medalists of The Bibliographical Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127022846/http://www.bibsoc.org.uk/about/gold-medalists |date=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

After school, Greg settled into a life of steady productivity, while living on the proceeds of his shares of ''The Economist''. Working in close association with [[A. H. Bullen]], he produced ''Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama'' (1906), the first edited version of the account books of [[Philip Henslowe]] (1906–8) and the papers of [[Edward Alleyn]]. The latter two works provided him with a knowledge of Renaissance theatrical conditions perhaps rivaled only by [[E. K. Chambers]], and this knowledge he applied to the publications of the [[Malone Society]], which he served as general editor between 1906 and 1939. He served as Librarian of Trinity College, 1907–13, resigning after his marriage to his cousin Elizabeth Gaskell. As an independent scholar,  Greg produced editions of ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1910),  [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]]'s ''Orlando Furioso'' and [[George Peele]]'s ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' (published together, 1923), and ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'' (1911). He returned to specific editing with work on ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' (1950). Greg also wrote on the material conditions of [[English Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theater]] and publishing; his work in this regard includes ''Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses'' (1931) and ''English Literary Autographs, 1550–1650'' (1932). ''The Variants in the First Quarto of King Lear'' (1940) offered a careful examination of this printing. He also wrote hundreds of reviews, including a notably caustic rejection of [[J. Churton Collins]]'s 1905 Oxford edition of Robert Greene.

At the beginning of [[World War II]], Greg moved to [[Sussex]], where he spent the war working on his edition of ''Faustus.'' In addition, he began to prepare his great works of the 1950s: ''The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare'' (1951), ''The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History'' (1955), ''Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing, 1550–1650'' (1954), and the essay "The rationale of copy-text" (1950), which had a significant influence on [[textual criticism]]. He was Lyell Reader in Bibliography at Oxford University, 1954–5. Greg was knighted in 1950.

Greg was strongly associated with [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in developing a modern understanding of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts. His greatest achievement{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} is ''A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration,'' published in four volumes between 1939 and 1959.

The '''World Community for Christian Meditation (WCCM)''' was founded in 1991 to foster the teachings of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk and priest, Fr. [[John Main]], [[Order of Saint Benedict|O.S.B.]] Fr. Main taught a way of [[Christian meditation]] which he based on parallels he saw between the spiritual practice taught by [[Desert Fathers|Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]] and the meditative practice he had been taught in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = John Main’s Monastic Adventure | work = Fr. Laurence Freeman, O.S.B. | url = http://www.wccm.org/images/JMMonasticAdvent3.htm | accessdate =  16 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director of the WCCM is Fr. [[Laurence Freeman]], [[Order of Saint Benedict|O.S.B.]], a student of John Main  and a Benedictine monk of the Olivetan Congregation. The World Community has its International Centre in London.

Annually, it runs the John Main Seminar and The Way of Peace.

[[File:Sima Chengchen.jpg|thumb|Image of Sima Chengchen.]]
The '''''Zuowanglun''''' or '''''Zuowang lun''''' is a [[Daoist meditation]] text that was written by the [[Shangqing School]] patriarch Sima Chengzhen (647–735). Daoism incorporated many Buddhist practices during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), and the ''Zuowanglun'' combined  meditation techniques from Daoism (e.g., ''[[zuowang]]'' "sitting forgetting" and ''guan'' 觀 "observation") and Buddhism (''[[samatha]]'' "calm abiding" and ''[[vipassanā]]'' "insight").

==Author==
Sima Chengzhen (or Si-ma Ch'eng-chen) 司馬承禎 (647–735), also known as Daoyin 道隐 "Recluse of the Dao" and Baiyunzi 白雲子 "Master of the White Cloud", was a native of [[Henan]]. He was a descendent of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420) imperial house, and his family included many high-ranking [[scholar-official]]s. Although Sima received a traditional education in the [[Chinese classics|
Confucian classics]], he chose a career in Daoism, and was ordained by the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] "Highest Clarity" School in 669. Sima was promoted to Shangqing Grand Master in 684, and became a favorite of the imperial court and aristocracy. Russell Kirkland (2008:911) describes Sima Chengzhen as "perhaps the most important [D]aoist of Tang times."

==Textual versions==
There are two received ''Zuowanglun'' editions and a stone inscription on [[Mount Wangwu]].

===Received editions===
The  ''Zuowanglun'' text exists in two main editions. One is in [[Zhang Junfang (writer)|Zhang Junfang]]'s (1019) ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' 雲笈七籤 "
Seven Cloudy Satchel" and [[Xu Song (Qing dynasty)|Xu Song]]'s (1819) ''Quan Tangwen'' 全唐文 "Complete Tang Literature". Another is in the (1444) ''[[Daozang]]'' "Daoist Canon" and (1796-1820) ''Daozang jiyao'' 道藏輯要 "Essentials of the Daoist Canon".

There are two prefaces with the text, one by the author Sima Chengzhen and another by the otherwise unknown recluse Zhenjing 真靜.

===Stele inscription===
A shorter ''Zuowanglun'' inscription on a [[stele]], dated to the year 829, was placed in front of a temple dedicated to Sima Chengzhen erected in [[Jiyuan]] on [[Mount Wangwu]], his last residence. It summarizes the key features of the text. Kohn (2010:9) says it "is probably an early forerunner", and translates (2010:159-162) this "Inscription on Oblivion".

The ''Zuowanglun'' elucidates seven steps, involving various practices, "including Buddhist-inspired concentration, observation, and absorption" (Kohn 2010:8), that gradually lead one from ordinary consciousness to ''dedao'' 得道 "attaining the [[Tao|Dao]]; becoming enlightened".
#''Jingxin'' 敬信 "Respect and Faith"
#''Duanyuan'' 斷緣 "Interception of karma"
#''Shouxin'' 收心 "Restraining the Mind"
#''Jianshi'' 簡事 "Detachment from Affairs"
#''Zhenguan'' 真觀 "True Observation"
#''Taiding'' 泰定 "Intense Concentration"
#''Dedao'' 得道 "Realizing the Dao" (tr. Kohn 2008:1310)

The Zhenjing preface explains.
&lt;blockquote&gt;As the author's understanding and viewpoint are extraordinary indeed, he clarifies Dao very well. First he leads the reader to feel "respect and faith" so that his mind may be no longer in mad confusion. Then he makes him "break off his karmic conditions" and factors, "tame his mind," and "detach himself from affairs" so that he can be serene in his physical structure and illuminated within. By the next step of "perfect observation" of center and periphery, being and nonbeing, he can then step into the "stability of cosmic peace," where the qi is peaceful and the spirit stable. Thus it is called "attaining Dao." (Kohn 2010:61)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Translations==
There are English translations of the ''Zuowanglun'' by Livia Kohn (1987, 1993:235-241, 2010) and [[Thomas Cleary]] (2000).

The title is translated as:
*''Discourse on (Taoist) Meditation'' ([[Joseph Needham|Needham]] 1976)
*''Seven Steps to the Tao'' (Kohn 1987)
*''Essay on Sitting in Oblivion'' ([[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] 1987)
*''Treatise on Abiding in Forgetfulness'' (Cleary 2000)
*''Discourse on Sitting-in-Forgetfulness'' (Komjathy 2004)
*''On Sitting in Oblivion'' (Kohn 2010)

Kohn explains choosing "oblivion" instead of "forgetfulness".
&lt;blockquote&gt;I translate ''wang'' as "oblivion" and "oblivious" rather than "forgetting" or "forgetful" because the connotation of "forget" in English is that one ''should'' remember but doesn't do so, or – if used intentionally – that one actively and intentionally does something in the mind. None of these holds true for what ancient and medieval Daoists were about. This is borne out both by the language and the writings: the word ''wang'' in Chinese consists of the character ''xin'' for "mind-heart," usually associated with conscious and emotional reactions to reality and the word ''wang'' for "obliterate" or "perish." The implication is – as indeed described in the sources – that one lets go of all kinds of intentional and reactive patterns and comes to rest in oneness with spirit and is ready to merge completely with Dao. (Kohn 2010:1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Related texts==
The ''Zuowanglun'' is associated with six contemporaneous texts by Daoist mediation masters from the ''Chongxuan'' 重玄 "Twofold Mystery" and [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] "Highest Clarity" Schools. Sima Chengzhen led an influential school of Buddho-Daoist mediation centered on [[Tiantai Mountain|Mount Tiantai]], which was also the headquarters of the [[Tiantai]] school of Buddhism.

The (early 8th century) ''Dingguanjing'' 定觀經 "Scripture on Concentration and Observation", or ''Dongxuan lingbao dingguanjing'' 洞玄靈寶定觀經 "Scripture on Concentration and Observation of the Numinous Treasure from the Cavern Mystery", appears three times in the Daoist Canon: as an appendix to the ''Zuowanglun'' edition, as a separate text (DZ 400, tr. Kohn 2010:163-173), and in the ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' anthology. This 49-stanza text outlines the psychological transition from an ordinary perspective with emotions and desires to a mental state of stability and quietude (Kohn 2010:65). The popular ''Dingguanjing'' was summarized under the title ''Guanmiaojing'' 觀妙經 "Scripture on Concentration on the Mystery" (DZ 326).

The ''Cunshen lianqiming'' 存神鍊氣銘 "Inscription on Visualizing Spirit and Refining Qi" (DZ 834, tr. Kohn 2010:174-178) is attributed to the Daoist physician and alchemist [[Sun Simiao]] (d. 682). This text first records five phases in taming the mind and seven stages in transforming the body into immortality, which the ''Zuowanglun'' appendix and ''Dingguanjing'' repeat.

The ''Tianyinzi'' 天隱子 "[Book of the] Master of Heavenly Seclusion" was allegedly transmitted by Wu Yun 吳筠 (d. 778) and edited by Sima Chengzhen, who wrote the "Oral Instructions" postface. This text is contained in the Daoist Canon (DZ 1026, tr, Kohn 2010:188-197), and has been republished many times in non-Daoist collections. The ''Tianyinzi'' emphasizes gradual progress toward the Dao through simplicity, fasting, seclusion, visualization, sitting in forgetfulness, and spirit liberation. Present day ''[[qigong]]'' practitioners consider the ''Tianyinzi'' to be a core text  (Kohn 2010:68).

The ''Xinmulun''  心目論 "Treatise on Mind and Eyes", also by Wu Yun, is an imaginary dialogue between the heart-mind and eyes (DZ 1038, tr. Kohn 2010:207-212). The mind accuses the eyes (representing the senses) of causing confusion and agitation, but the eyes argue that the mind is ultimately responsible. The mind resolves to eliminate thoughts with ''zuowang'' in order to achieve liberation. Wu Yun uses various water metaphors (frequently written with the [[Radical 85|water radical]] 水 or 氵) to describe mental activities (Kohn 2010:83). He emphasizes the distraught and unhappy state of mind with words like ''luan''亂 "chaotic; confused" and ''Iun'' 淪 "engulfed; muddled"; and uses images like ''cheng hundun'' 乘混沌 "ride on pure chaos" and become one with the ''hanman'' 汗漫 "vast expanse of water" to express the mind's longing for clarity and freedom. Abstract purity and defilement are also expressed in water-terms of ''qing'' 清 "clarity; standing water that is lucid to the bottom" and ''zi'' 滓 "dregs; sediments; defilements".

The (late 6th century) ''Neiguanjing'' 內觀經 "Scripture of Inner Observation" (DZ 641, tr Kohn 2010:179-187) is written in the words of [[Laozi]] (deified as Lord Lao 老君). This treatise describes inner meditations on the human body, Buddho-Daoist psychological terms, and internal purification.

The ''[[Chu (Daoism)#Wuchu five-kitchens meditation|Wuchujing]]'' 五廚經 "Scripture of the Five Kitchens" (DZ 763, tr. Kohn 2010:198-206) was edited and annotated by Yin Yin 尹愔 and presented to the Tang court in 736. This mystical poem is devoted to the Five ''[[Zang-fu|Zang]]'' "Organs", with "Kitchens" figuratively meaning ''qi'' processing in ''[[neidan]]'' "internal alchemy". The text is also transmitted in a Buddhist version. Modern Daoists consider the ''Wuchujing'' as talismanic and chant it for protection.
