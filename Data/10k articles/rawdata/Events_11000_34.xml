'''Albert Freiherr&lt;ref&gt;{{German title Freiherr}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Schrenck-Notzing''' (18 May 1862 – 12 February 1929) was a [[Germany|German]] physician, psychiatrist and notable [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]], who devoted his time to the study of [[paranormal]] events connected with [[mediumship]], [[hypnotism]] and [[telepathy]]. He investigated [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] mediums such as [[Willi Schneider]], [[Rudi Schneider]], and [[Valentine Dencausse]]. He is credited as the first [[forensic psychologist]] by [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-forensic-psychologist First forensic psychologist]:&lt;br&gt;''the first referenced use of a psychologist called upon to testify in a court of law was Dr Albert Von Schrenk-Notzing who, in 1896, drew upon his studies of suggestibility and memory recall to testify in a murder trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mediumship==
===Eva C===
Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium [[Eva Carrière]] and believed the [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] she produced was genuine. However, Schrenck-Notzing did not believe her ectoplasm "[[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]]" were anything to do with spirits, he claimed they were the result of "ideoplasty" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind.&lt;ref name="Brady2010"&gt;M. Brady Brower. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 120. {{ISBN|978-0252077517}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrenck-Notzing published the book ''Phenomena of Materialisation'' in English translation (1920), which included photographs of the ectoplasm. Critics pointed out that the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"&gt;[[Carlos María de Heredia]]. (1922). ''Spiritism and Common Sense''. P. J. Kenedy &amp; Sons. pp. 186-198; Albert von Schrenck-Notzing. ''Materialisationsphaenomene: Ein Beitrag Zur Erforschung Der Mediumistischen Teleplastie. München: Ernst Reinhardt, 1914; [https://books.google.com/books?id=lo3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=albert%20von%20schrenck%20notzig&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Albert von Schrenck-Notzing.

Dutton &amp; Co., 1920.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ektoplasma.gif|thumb|170px|Eva C. (1912)]]
The psychiatrist [[Mathilde Ludendorff]] wrote that the experiments of Schrenck-Notzing were unscientific and that he had been duped by tricks of Carrière.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3381523 | pmid=23002296 | doi=10.1017/mdh.2011.36 | volume=56 | title=Policing epistemic deviance: Albert Von Schrenck-Notzing and Albert Moll(1) | journal=Med Hist | pages=255–76 | last1 = Sommer | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Schrenck-Notzing experiments with Carrière the scientific controls were scarce and there was evidence that she had freed her hands in the [[séance]] room.&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Aykroyd, Angela Narth. (2009). ''A History of Ghosts: The True Story of Séances, Mediums, Ghosts, and Ghostbusters''. Rodale Books. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-1605298757}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry Price]] wrote the photographs of her ectoplasm taken with Schrenck-Notzing look artificial and two-dimensional made from cardboard and newspaper portraits and that there were no scientific controls as both her hands were free.&lt;ref name="Price1939"&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1939). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. {{ISBN|978-0766142428}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 Carrière was investigated by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in London. An analysis of her ectoplasm revealed it to be made of chewed paper. She was also investigated in 1922 and the results of the tests were negative.&lt;ref name="Price1939"/&gt;

Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carrière deceptively smuggled pins into the séance room.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"/&gt; The magician [[Carlos María de Heredia]] replicated the ectoplasm of Carrière using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"/&gt;

[[Donald J. West|Donald West]] wrote that the ectoplasm of Carrière was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters "Le Miro". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald J. West|Donald West]]. (1954). ''Psychical Research Today''. Chapter Séance-Room Phenomena. Duckworth. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière's ectoplasm faces.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgess McHargue]]. (1972). ''Facts, Frauds, and Phantasms: A Survey of the Spiritualist Movement''. Doubleday. p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Miss Barkley in an article in the newspaper ''Neue Wiener Tagblatt'' had exposed the fraud of Carrière:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss Eva prepared the heads before every séance, and endeavoured to make them unrecognizable. A clean-shaven face was decorated with a beard. Grey hairs became black curls, a broad forehead was made into a narrow one. But, in spite of all her endeavours, she could not obliterate certain characteristic lines.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cut out faces that she used included [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|King Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], French president [[Raymond Poincaré]] and the actress Mona Delza.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-1573920216}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carrière had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm.&lt;ref name="Brady2010"/&gt; Because of this Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous.&lt;ref name="Heredia1992"/&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] noted that "In Germany and Austria, Baron von Schrenck-Notzing is the laughing-stock of his medical colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Harris. (1993). ''Debates on the Meaning of Life, Evolution, and Spiritualism.'' Prometheus Books. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0879758288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ladislas Lasslo===

The Hungarian medium Ladislas Lasslo (also known as Laszlo Laszlo) confessed that all of his spirit [[Materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] were fraudulent in 1924. A séance sitter was also found to be working as a confederate for Lasslo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pflyceum.org/83.html "Fraudulent Mediums"]. Lyceum Library.&lt;/ref&gt; Lasslo who was originally endorsed as genuine by Schrenck-Notzing  was a [[Pickpocketing|pickpocket]] and army deserter. During his séances he confessed to hiding "spirit heads" made from pieces of gauze in Schrenck-Notzing's pocket or in the seat of his armchair.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tabori]]. (1961). ''The Art of Folly''. Prentice-Hall International, Inc. pp. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;

===Karl Kraus===

Karl Kraus (pseudo Karl Weber) was a medium that was exposed as a fraud by Professor [[Hans Thirring]] in Vienna in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price]]. (1933). ''Leaves from a Psychist's Case-Book''. V. Gollancz. p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kraus had been endorsed by Schrenck-Notzing as genuine. Kraus would later write a [[manuscript]] about his mediumship. He admitted that he had set out to deceive Schrenck-Notzing to reveal the inefficiency of psychical research. In 1928 [[Harry Price]] obtained the Kraus manuscript. Some of the manuscript was later reprinted by the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] and Schrenck-Notzing was charged of being a credulous investigator.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Tabori]]. (1974). ''Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter''. Sphere Books. p. 163. {{ISBN|0-7221-8326-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud==

In 1954, the SPR member Rudolf Lambert published a report revealing details about a case of fraud that was covered up by many early members of the Institute Metapsychique International (IMI).&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"&gt;Sofie Lachapelle. (2011). ''Investigating the Supernatural: From Spiritism and Occultism to Psychical Research and Metapsychics in France, 1853-1931''. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 144-145. {{ISBN|978-1421400136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert who had studied [[Gustav Geley]]'s files on Eva Carrière discovered photographs depicting fraudulent [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] taken by her companion Juliette Bisson.&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"/&gt; Various "materializations" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. The discovery was never published by Geley. [[Eugéne Osty]] (the director of the institute) and members Jean Meyer, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and [[Charles Richet]] all knew about the fraudulent photographs but were firm believers in mediumship phenomena so demanded the scandal be kept secret.&lt;ref name="Lachapelle2011"/&gt;

== Plot ==

She decides to return to her present in an effort to maintain the union of her family, save her happiness and find her true love.

Zanetti also participated as the film's [[production designer]].

Camilla Belle took some time before filming for learning to speak [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]], a variant of the [[Spanish language]] and Argentina's official language (as well as the most popularly talked in the country), and to do so with a "[[Porteño]]" (people from [[Buenos Aires City]]) accent.

== Reception ==

An '''American-led intervention in Iraq''' started on 15 June 2014, when [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] ordered [[United States Armed Forces|United States forces]] to be dispatched to the region, in response to offensives in [[Iraq]] conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL). At the invitation of the [[Al Maliki II Government|Iraqi government]], American troops went to assess Iraqi forces and the threat posed by ISIL.&lt;ref name=def31-10-14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=123542|title=DoD Authorizes War on Terror Award for Inherent Resolve Ops|date=31 October 2014| website=Defense.gov|publisher=Department of Defense|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Third-party inline|date=February 2018}}

In early August 2014, ISIL [[Northern Iraq offensive (August 2014)|attacked Kurdish-held territory in northern Iraq]], and captured three towns in northern Iraq, close to the [[Autonomous administrative division|autonomous region]] of [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/world/middleeast/iraq.html|title=Sunni Extremists in Iraq Seize 3 Towns From Kurds and Threaten Major Dam|work=The New York Times|last1=Arango|first1=Tim|date=3 August 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on 5 August, the United States started supplying the Iraqi Kurdish [[peshmerga]] forces with weapons. On 7 August, the United States also started humanitarian aid air droppings of food, water, and medicine for civilians fleeing ISIL in the [[Sinjar Mountains]].&lt;ref name=abc7Aug14/&gt; On the next day, 8 August, the United States began airstrikes against ISIL positions in Iraq. Since then, in coalition with the United States, nine countries have also executed airstrikes on ISIL in Iraq. These airstrikes have been operating more or less in concert with ground warfare by Kurdish and Iraqi government forces against ISIL. There have also been sporadic clashes between ISIL fighters, and US and Canadian troops, several thousand of whom are acting in advisory and combat roles alongside Kurdish and Iraqi forces.&lt;ref name="firstclash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canadianclash"/&gt; By April 2015, ISIL had lost significant amounts of territory to Iraqi and American-led Coalition forces. Compared to their peak in December 2014, ISIL had lost 25–30% of their territory, leaving them in possession of around 15,000 square miles of Iraq.&lt;ref name=US.13-4-2015/&gt; By December 2017, ISIL had no remaining territory in Iraq, following the [[2017 Western Iraq campaign]].&lt;ref name="victory parade"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-parade/iraq-holds-victory-parade-after-defeating-islamic-state-idUSKBN1E407Z|title=Iraq holds victory parade after defeating Islamic State|author=Ahmed Aboulenein|publisher=Reuters|date=10 December 2017|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== Previous U.S. involvement ===
In 2003, the United States led a controversial [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], which was based on flawed intelligence that [[Iraq]] had [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|links to al-Qaeda]] while under [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist]] rule.&lt;ref name="beginning1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030322.html|title=President Discusses Beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom| accessdate=29 October 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, the number of [[United States Army|U.S. forces]] in Iraq peaked at 170,000 soldiers. In 2011, the U.S. had [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|withdrawn most of its troops from Iraq]], and later kept 20,000 employees in its embassy and consulates, including dozens of [[Marine Security Guard|U.S. Marine Embassy Guards]] and approximately 4,500 [[Private military company|private military contractors]].

In 2013, the U.S. resumed flying surveillance aircraft in order to collect intelligence about [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–13)|insurgent Islamist fighters]] targeting the Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-secretly-flying-unmanned-drones-over-iraq-1402605640 |title=U.S. Secretly Flying Drones Over Iraq|date=12 June 2014|work=WSJ|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = cnn27-6-14&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/27/world/meast/iraq-crisis/ |title=U.S. has armed drones over Baghdad, official says| publisher =CNN|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coalitions ==
{{main| Military intervention against ISIL#International coalitions against ISIL}}
On 5 September, 15 September and 3 December 2014, different sets of countries came together to discuss concerted action against ISIL. Present at all three meetings were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey, and Denmark.

The coalition of 5 September (10 countries) decided to support anti-ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref name=TIME5Sep&gt;[http://time.com/3273185/isis-us-nato/ ‘U.S. Forms Anti-ISIS Coalition at NATO Summit’]. ''Time'', 5 September 2014. Retrieved 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of the Iraqi Government, on 15 June 2014 President Obama ordered dozens of [[United States]] troops to Iraq in response to offensives by ISIL (see previous section '[[#Background|Background]]'), to assess Iraqi forces and the ISIL threat.&lt;ref name=def31-10-14 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140829/DEFREG02/308290035/US-Ops-Iraq-Cost-550-Million-Since-June | title = US Ops in Iraq Have Cost €550 Million Since June | newspaper = Defense News | date = 29 August 2014 | accessdate = 22 November 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably between 15 and 26 June, the U.S. also began to fly missions with manned aircraft over Iraq in secret.&lt;ref name=reut27-6-14&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/27/us-iraq-security-usa-flights-idUSKBN0F22DR20140627 | title = Armed U.S. aircraft now flying over Iraq: defense officials|publisher=Reuters|date= 27 June 2014 | accessdate = 20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2014, the U.S. started to survey over Baghdad also with armed drones "primarily" for protection of 180 U.S. military advisers in the area.&lt;ref name=cnn27-6-14 /&gt;

On 29–30 June 2014, the U.S. increased the number of its troops in Iraq from 180 to 480, to prevent ISIL from taking control of [[Baghdad International Airport]], which the US said would be critical to any evacuation of Americans from Baghdad, and to protect U.S. citizens and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youssef|first=Nancy A.|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/06/30/231985/480-us-troops-now-in-baghdad-as.html | place = Washington, DC | title = 480 U.S. troops now in Baghdad as officials move to secure access to airport |publisher = McClatchy DC| date =30 June 2014|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, Obama announced that due to the continuing violence in Iraq and the growing influence of non-state actors such as the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], the United States would elevate its security commitment in the region.{{Citation needed|date= November 2014}}  Approximately 800 U.S. troops secured American installations like the [[Embassy of the United States, Baghdad|Embassy in Baghdad]] and the Consulate in [[Erbil]] as well as seizing control of strategic locations like the Baghdad International Airport.{{Citation needed | date =November 2014}}

During the first 15 days of August 2014, ISIL expanded its territories in northern [[Iraq]]. On 3 August, they conquered [[Sinjar]] and surrounding area, including Wana and Zumar,&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; killing possibly 2,000 [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] men in the [[Sinjar massacre]], and taking Yazidi women into slavery, causing 50,000 [[Yazidis]] to flee into the adjacent [[Sinjar Mountains]]. During their whole August offensive, ISIL massacred 5,000 Yazidis.&lt;ref name="5,000 Kurdish Yazidis executed by ISIL"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;On 7 August, ISIL conquered [[Bakhdida|Qaraqosh]], the largest Christian town in Iraq, and neighbouring towns, causing 100,000 [[Christian]] civilians to flee from ISIL troops.&lt;ref name=bbc7aug14&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28686998|title=Iraq Christians flee as Islamic State takes Qaraqosh|work=BBC News|date=7 August 2014|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obama's decision for airstrikes ===
[[File:President Obama Makes a Statement on Iraq - 080714.ogv|thumb|President Obama makes a statement on Iraq and dealing with ISIL, 7 August 2014.]]
On the evening of 7 August 2014, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] gave a live address to the nation. He described [[Northern Iraq offensive (August 2014)|the recent ISIL advances across Iraq]] and said that [[Persecution of Yazidis by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL's persecution and threatening the extinction of Yazidis]], a religious minority in northern Iraq, including especially the [[Yazidis]] who had fled into the [[Sinjar Mountains]],&lt;ref name=CNN9-8-14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Obama7Aug14/&gt;
in particular had convinced him that U.S. military action was necessary. The President said that he had ordered airstrikes:
* to protect American diplomats, civilians and military in Erbil at the American consulate or advising Iraqi forces;
* to prevent a potential massacre (genocide) by ISIL on thousands of [[Yazidis]] on [[Mount Sinjar]]; and
* to stop ISIL's advance on [[Erbil]], the capital of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish Autonomous Region]]&lt;ref name=Obama7Aug14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/07/statement-president|title=Statement by the President|publisher=The White House|date=7 August 2014|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the U.S. had a consulate and a joint operations center with the Iraqi military.&lt;ref name=TWP8-8-14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/islamic-state-militants-seize-christian-town-in-northern-iraq-thousands-flee/2014/08/07/942a553a-1e2b-11e4-ab7b-696c295ddfd1_story.html?hpid=z1 | agency=''The Washington Post''|title=U.S. airstrikes target Islamic State militants in northern Iraq|date=8 August 2014|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Obama further defended his decision by saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the world is confronted by many challenges. And while America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place. And our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon. We do so by adhering to a set of core principles. We do whatever is necessary to protect our people. We support our allies when they're in danger. We lead coalitions of countries to uphold international norms. And we strive to stay true to the fundamental values -- the desire to live with basic freedom and dignity -- that is common to human beings wherever they are. That's why people all over the world look to the United States of America to lead. And that's why we do it.&lt;ref&gt;Kliff, Sarah (7 August 2014).

===== February 2016 =====
US officials reported that [[Delta Force]] operatives have carried out operations to target, capture or kill top ISIS operatives in Iraq, reportedly beginning in late February 2016, after several weeks of covert preparation such as setting up safe houses, establishing informant networks and coordinating operations with Iraqi and Peshmerga units. The Delta force operators are part of an Expeditionary Targeting Force that is also made up of operators from the US military's so-called "Tier One" Special Operations units, numbering around 200 personnel. Their main objectives are to gather enough intelligence from raids on terrorist-occupied compounds and hideouts, then from intelligence gathered at those sites they will give the ETF more intelligence about ISIS networks and quickly attack additional and related targets, in what's known as "targeted" missions. This strategy was tested during the [[May 2015 U.S. special forces raid in Syria|May 2015 raid on Deir Ezzor]] in Syria. The ETF has so far collected enough intelligence about ISIS operations in Iraq in up to half a dozen locations that raids and field operations are ready to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/29/politics/pentagon-army-target-isis-iraq/ |title=Army's Delta Force begins to target ISIS in Iraq |publisher=CNN |date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late-February, U.S. special forces captured Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, an ISIS senior chemical weapons engineer, in a raid in Badoosh, north-west of Mosul, there were no US casualties.

Their motivations to join this war: ISIL's advance in Iraq and Syria, while displaying "unprecedented violence" and "perpetrating terrible crimes against population groups", formed "a direct threat for that region"; ISIL's advance in Iraq and Syria "causes instability at the borders of Europe" which threatens "our own [Dutch] safety".

According to [[Iraq Body Count]], 118 civilians were killed by coalition airstrikes in 2014&lt;ref name="IBC2014" &gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq 2014: Civilian deaths almost doubling year on year|url=https://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/2014/|work=IBC|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 845 in 2015.&lt;ref name="IBC2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq 2015: A Catastrophic Normal|url=https://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/2015/|work=IBC|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to "Airwars", a team of independent journalists, between 1,687 and 2,534 civilians were killed by coalition airstrikes in 288 incidents in Iraq and Syria between 8 August 2014 and 18 October 2016; other incidents with thousands more civilian fatalities were also recorded by Airwars, but the US-led coalition's responsibility couldn't be confirmed with equal confidence in those cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary findings on Coalition airstrikes: August 8th 2014 to October 18th 2016|url=https://airwars.org/civilian-casualty-claims/|website=airwars.org|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peshmerga troops ===
"At least 999 Peshmerga troops lost their lives and 4,596 have been injured between June 10, 2014 and February 3, 2015," said Jabbar Yawar, secretary-general of the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs to reporters at a press conference in Arbil on 4 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/international-military-news/2015-02/05/content_6340597.htm|title=China Military Online English Edition|author=Yao Jianing|publisher=|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/iraq/154344/nearly-1000-peshmerga-killed-since-june-2014|title=Nearly 1,000 peshmerga killed since June 2014 - Iraq -  Worldbulletin News|work=World Bulletin|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US soldiers ===
The [[United States]] suffered its first casualty of the conflict on 2 October 2014, when a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[MV-22 Osprey]] crashed in the [[Persian Gulf]] after takeoff from {{USS|Makin Island|LHD-8|6}}, leaving one of its crewmen missing and presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/10/02/us-marine-presumed-lost-in-persian-gulf/?intcmp=latestnews|title=US Marine 'presumed lost' in the Persian Gulf|work=Fox News|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extending US presence on Iraqi ground ==
While some U.S. troops were already active in Iraq for several purposes since June 2014 (see section [[2014 American-led intervention in Iraq#Background|Background]]), on 13 August, the U.S. deployed another 130 military advisers to Northern Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/world/middleeast/us-to-send-130-more-military-advisers-to-iraq.html?_r=0|title=US To Send 130 More Military Advisors To Iraq|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up to 20 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and special forces servicemen landed on [[Mount Sinjar]] from [[V-22]] aircraft to coordinate the evacuation of Yazidi refugees. A team of British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] was already in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/13/us-ground-troops-direct-role-evacuate-yazidis-iraq|title=US troops land on Iraq's Mt Sinjar to plan for Yazidi evacuation|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September, an increase of 350 servicemen was announced to be sent to Baghdad, increasing U.S. forces in Baghdad to 820, and increasing U.S. forces in Iraq to 1,213.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|agency=Associated Press|title=Obama to send approximately 350 additional military personnel to Iraq|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/03/obama-to-send-approximately-350-additional-military-personnel-to-iraq/|newspaper=Fox News|date=3 September 2014|accessdate=7 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September, President Obama gave a speech in which he reiterated that American troops will not fight in combat.  He also said that about 500 more troops will be sent to Iraq to help train Iraqi forces.&lt;ref name=aje11sept&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/09/obama-strike-wherever-it-exists-2014910223935601193.html|title=Obama outlines plan to target IS fighters|date=11 September 2014|accessdate=11 September 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of September, Obama planned to send 1,600 troops to Iraq as "advisers" to the Iraqi army and Kurdish forces. 800 of them would provide security for soldiers and Marines and for property; hundreds would train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces on how to fight ISIL.&lt;ref name=TheHill27-9-14/&gt;

In early November 2014, President Obama announced that he would be doubling the number of US troops present on the ground in Iraq to around 3,000 men.&lt;ref name="stripes.com"/&gt; By early December 2014, the number of US ground troops in Iraq had increased to 3,100, while other nations in the US-led Coalition decided to send 1,500 more ground troops to Iraq, increasing the total number of troops to 4,600.&lt;ref name="Coalition ground troops in Iraq increase"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30388718|title=Islamic State: Coalition 'pledges more troops' for Iraq|work=BBC News|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the 1,000 Paratroopers of the "Panther Brigade" of the US Army's [[82nd Airborne Division]] were deployed to Iraq. They came with an additional 300 soldiers, Airmen, and Marines, bringing US troop levels deployed in the country to 4,400.&lt;ref name="1,300 more US soldiers deployed to Iraq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us/1-000-soldiers-from-the-82nd-airborne-headed-to-iraq-1.320194|title=1,000 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne headed to Iraq|work=Stars and Stripes|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the New York Times, by 4 February 2015, the US had 4,500 troops in Iraq. Over the next two years, this number seemed to plateau at a number around 4,500. As of Sept 28, 2016, according to the DOD, the [[United States]] authorized additional troops for [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], for a total of 5,262.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/News-Article-View/Article/958881/carter-600-troops-to-deploy-to-enable-iraqis-to-retake-mosul-from-isil/ "Carter: 600 Troops to Deploy to Enable Iraqis to Retake Mosul From ISI"].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of the new Trump administration in January 2017, a change in policy was instituted regarding the disclosure of current troop levels as well as the timing of any additional deployments to the area, thus making good on his campaign promises to utilize the "element of surprise." As of April 2017, according to the LA Times,&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Hennigan, W. J.. [http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-deployment-20170330-story.html "Trump administration stops disclosing troop deployments in Iraq and Syria"]. ''latimes.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; unbeknownst to both Congress and the general public, there had been two non-disclosed troop deployments in the month of March: a deployment of 400 US Marines to northern Syria and 300 US Army Paratroopers to the area around Mosul. As of 2 April 2017, the current US troop level, or "force management level" — the number of full-time troops deployed, is currently around 5,200 in Iraq and 500 in Syria, with about 1,000 more troops there on a temporary basis.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

As of July 2, 2018, the US still maintains a limited military presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Iraq with the task of helping train and assist Iraqi forces.&lt;ref name="wesa.fm"/&gt;

== U.S. naming controversy ==

== Technicalities ==

=== Types of aircraft used ===
In the first U.S. airstrikes on 8 August, armed drones as well as fixed wing aircraft:
[[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] fighters, were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/world/middleeast/iraq.html|title=Middle east : Iraq|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The F/A-18s were that day launched from the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|George H.W. Bush|CVN-77|6}}. A Navy official said that the two planes involved in the airstrikes were [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Super Hornet]]s from [[Carrier Air Wing 8]], of [[Naval Air Station Oceana]], [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/08/08/uss-george-h-w-bush-and-its-super-hornet-fighters-strike-in-iraq/|title=USS George H.W.

A number of [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|Fairchild Republic A-10C Thunderbolt II]]'s from the USAF's [[163d Fighter Squadron|163d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron]] were deployed on 17 November 2014.&lt;ref name="AFMFEB15"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[AirForces Monthly]]|date=February 2015|publisher=[[Key Publishing|Key Publishing Ltd]]|location=[[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]]|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategics ==
Kurdish and Iraqi forces battling Islamic State fighters have been closely cooperating with U.S. air force [[Joint terminal attack controller|controllers]] based in [[Baghdad]] and in [[Erbil]], suggesting ISIL targets to those U.S. air force controllers. The US controllers then checked those suggestions with live stream video information [[intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance|(ISR)]], to avoid hitting Iraqi or Kurdish forces with their airstrikes.&lt;ref name=Mil.29-9-14&gt;[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/09/29/airstrike-agreement-keeps-us-air-controllers-away-from-combat.html 'Airstrike Agreement Keeps US Air Controllers Away From Combat'].

== Reaction ==
The initial decision to intervene in Iraq was met with bipartisan support&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; in the [[United States Congress]], albeit subject to a range of interpretations as to what constitutes legitimate intervention. [[Barbara Lee]] supported a strictly humanitarian intervention and opposed any [[mission creep]]&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Julie|title=Bipartisan Support, With Caveats, for Obama on Iraq Airstrikes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/us/politics/bipartisan-support-with-caveats-for-obama-on-iraq-airstrikes.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/defense/214752-left-frets-over-mission-creep-in-iraq|title=Left frets over Iraq mission creep|work=The Hill|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico&gt;{{cite web|last=Vargas|first=Cesar|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/obama-iraq-airstrikes-liberals-109860.html|title=Obama's liberal problem&amp;nbsp;— Seung Min Kim and Jeremy Herb|work=Politico|date=10 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Richard Blumenthal]] who argued for humanitarian relief, but opposed a prolonged direct military involvement.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; [[Bob Corker]] expected greater clarity with regards to the intervention's objectives, time frame and source of authorization.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; while [[Dick Durbin]] opined that he, "still had concerns" despite assurances from Obama that no U.S. ground troops would be deployed in Iraq.&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; Congressional Democrats and Republicans who were more hawkish for their support for the intervention included the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] Chairman [[Carl Levin]],&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Harry Reid]],&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; chairwoman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]] [[Dianne Feinstein]]&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt; and then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] [[John Boehner]].&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Politico/&gt;

Despite the bipartisan support, the President's decision to re-engage the United States into a conflict in Iraq has attracted criticism from both the political left and right. [[Andrew Bacevich]] argued against military action, but not humanitarian assistance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|place=UK|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/08/dont-listen-to-the-hawks-the-west-should-leave-iraq-alone/|title=Don't listen to the hawks&amp;nbsp;— the West should leave Iraq alone|work=Coffee house|publisher=The Spectator|type=blog|date=13 August 2014|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Seumas Milne]] who argued against military, but not humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/13/war-in-iraq-yazidis-aid-military-intervention|title=Another war in Iraq won't fix the disaster of the last|work=The Guardian|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, [[Cal Thomas]] accused Obama's decision to withhold American military assistance barring efforts by the Iraqi government to bridge the country's sectarian differences as tantamount to abandonment while an article in [[the Globe and Mail]] cautioned that an American intervention "would kill both ISIS and MCIR fighters as well as many Sunni civilians and fail to fix the underlying issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/the-us-debate-over-iraq-is-missing-the-most-serious-questions/article19235723/|title=The US debate over Iraq is missing the most serious questions|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|quote= Bombing the insurgents would kill both ISIS and MCIR fighters as well as many Sunni civilians.

Mirroring the bipartisan congressional support for the interventions, polls, notwithstanding varying qualifications, show majorities of Americans supporting air strike in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Mark|title=Poll: Americans back airstrikes, but oppose use of U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/29/politics/poll-americans-back-airstrikes/|publisher=CNN|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balz and Craighill|first1=Dan &amp; Peyton|title=Poll: Public supports strikes in Iraq, Syria; Obama’s ratings hover near his all-time lows |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-public-supports-strikes-in-iraq-syria-obamas-ratings-hover-near-his-all-time-lows/2014/09/08/69c164d8-3789-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ekins|first1=Emily|title=Poll: 66% Favor Airstrikes Against ISIS, but 52% Oppose US Sending Ground Troops|url=http://reason.com/poll/2014/10/10/poll-66-favor-airstrikes-against-isis-bu|publisher=Reason|date=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Support for U.S. Campaign against ISIS; Doubts about Its Effectiveness, Objectives|url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/10/22/support-for-u-s-campaign-against-isis-doubts-about-its-effectiveness-objectives/|publisher=Pew|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[editorial board]]s of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' penned editorials that were supportive of the intervention. Two editorials by [[The Washington Post]] argued that Iraqi's disintegration would threaten national, regional and global security&lt;ref name=June12WaPo&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq's disintegration could haunt the U.S. for years to come|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/iraqs-disintegration-could-haunt-the-us-for-years-to-come/2014/06/12/9aab1af4-f264-11e3-914c-1fbd0614e2d4_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described efforts by the Obama administration to create a more inclusive Iraq government as presenting the best hope for the country in its fight against ISIS.&lt;ref name=June12WaPo/&gt;&lt;ref name=June16WaPo&gt;{{cite news|title=A more inclusive Iraq presents the best hope for the country |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-more-inclusive-iraq-presents-the-best-hope-for-the-country/2014/06/16/5e65eb94-f590-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html|publisher=The Washington Post|date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two editorials written in August by [[the New York Times]] also supported the intervention, praising Obama's sagacity in delivering the [[2014 American-led intervention in Iraq#Contributions to August intervention#Humanitarian efforts|necessary humanitarian assistance to the Christians, Yazidis and other minorities on Mount Sinjar]] while eschewing the redeployment of American ground troops,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preventing a Slaughter in Iraq|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/opinion/preventing-a-slaughter-in-iraq.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describing the subsequent deployment of American military airstrikes and other forms of assistance as, although insufficient, a necessary component of a more comprehensive strategy to defeating ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Necessary Response to ISIS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/opinion/a-necessary-response-to-isis.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial by [[the Guardian]] written in June opined that ISIS's [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|June 2014 Iraqi offensive]] invited foreign intervention that included the United States and that Obama's conditionalization of aid on Iraqis working together was in the best interest of all of Iraq's regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guardian view on the crisis in Iraq|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/13/crisis-in-iraq-kurds-baghdad|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an editorial in [[the Wall Street Journal]] written in August wrote of the strategic interest the United States had in defeating ISIS and positively assessed the efficacy of American airstrikes in, "...reducing the jihadists' room for maneuver and giving new confidence to the Kurdish forces."&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|title=A Small Victory in Iraq|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-small-victory-in-iraq-1408406198|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While condemning ISIS's [[2014 ISIL beheading incidents|savagery]] and acknowledging the threat to American national interests in the Middle East that the group posed, an editorial by the editorial board of [[the Los Angeles Times]] argued that congressional authorization should override Obama's legal authority as the ultimate legal basis for the usage of military force in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attack Islamic State? Congress should decide|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-islamic-state-20140917-story.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, support for the intervention in the media was not unanimous. A ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial criticized the American strategy of creating a unity government in order to fight ISIS was a mirage due to the country's political-religious cleavages and ISIS's numerical and technological superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diehl|first=Jackson|title=Obama's 'unity government' plan in Iraq is just a mirage|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jackson-diehl-obamas-unity-government-plan-in-iraq-is-just-a-mirage/2014/07/06/62c5aeae-02c9-11e4-8fd0-3a663dfa68ac_story.html|accessdate=13 August 2014|work=The [[Washington Post]]|date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William D. Hartung|William Hartung]], writing in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' argued that the intervention would result in [[mission creep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartung|first=William|author-link=William D. Hartung|title=US 'mission creep' won't help in Iraq|archivedate=13 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813115847/http://www.stripes.com/us-mission-creep-won-t-help-in-iraq-1.293693|url=http://www.stripes.com/us-mission-creep-won-t-help-in-iraq-1.293693|accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the BBC, [[Marc Weller (professor)|Marc Weller]], professor of international law at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], argued that the US airstrikes are consistent with international law. Specifically, he argued that: the government in Baghdad invited international forces to join in the fight against IS; the [[Haider al-Abadi|newly reconstituted and religiously representative Iraqi government]] has a positive obligation to deliver on its constitutional promises and defend its population from subjugation by ISIS; and foreign intervention exercising the right of collective self-defense on behalf of Iraq can involve forcible action in IS-controlled territories in Syria that is proportional to the necessity of securing Iraq's borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weller|first1=Marc|title=Islamic State crisis: What force does international law allow?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29283286|publisher=BBC|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Michael Ignatieff]], professor of politics at [[Harvard University]] discussed the international dimensions of American intervention in Iraq in an interview with [[Der Spiegel]] in which he described the Islamic State as an "attack on all values of civilization" and that it was essential that America, "continued with their air strikes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Follath|first1=Erich|title=Michael Ignatieff Interview: 'Those Fighting Islamic State Are the Lesser Evil'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-michael-ignatieff-on-islamic-state-and-mideast-turmoil-a-990667-2.html|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramzi Mardini in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote an op-ed opposing armed intervention as it exacerbated the blowback risk of terrorism against US although he did not object to [[2014 American-led intervention in Iraq#Contributions to August intervention#Humanitarian efforts|humanitarian assistance aimed at helping the persecuted religious minorities living in ISIS controlled territories]] and instead called for greater diplomatic intervention in which the United States played a key role as an arbiter between Iraq's warring sectarian factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mardini|first=Ramzi|title=US Intervention in Iraq Will Only Worsen the Situation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/08/07/a-return-to-the-fight-in-iraq/us-intervention-will-only-worsen-the-situation|accessdate=13 August 2014|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aaron Zelin of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]] argues that ISIS are "likely planning attacks whether the U.S. conducts targeted air strikes or not" and that, in his opinion, the United States, "should destroy them as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowley|first=Michael|title=Experts Warn of Terrorism Blowback From Iraq Air Strikes|url=http://time.com/3096348/isis-iraq-barack-obama-blowback/|accessdate=13 August 2014|agency=Time|date=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and members of the Republican party including [[John McCain]], [[Lindsey Graham]], [[Ted Cruz]], and [[John Boehner]] have likewise called for greater military strikes in the region to contain the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=rep&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Susan|title=Lawmakers support airstrikes; some want more action|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/08/congress-iraq-obama-airstrikes/13765801/|work=USA Today|accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[the Atlantic]], Hillary Clinton suggested that the current crisis in Iraq was a result of his [President Obama] refusal to arm Syrian rebels, which Obama, in a meeting with lawmakers before Clinton's interview, criticized as "horseshit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Josh|last=Rogin|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/14/obama-stifled-hillary-s-syria-plans-and-ignored-her-iraq-warnings-for-years.html|title=Obama Stifled Hillary's Syria Plans and Ignored Her Iraq Warnings for Years|work=The Daily Beast|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[Vox Media|Vox]]'' defined the intervention as being limited to Kurdistan, effectively allowing the Islamic State to control a large part of Iraq absent any other occupying power. The editorial argued that the stability of Kurdistan would make it a better ally for the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Max|work=Vox|title=Obama's message to ISIS: Stay out of Kurdistan, but the rest of northern Iraq is all yours|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/8/8/5982275/obamas-implicit-bargain-with-isis-for-iraq|accessdate=13 August 2014|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretary of Iran's [[Supreme National Security Council]] [[Ali Shamkhani]] condemned the US-led coalition [[2017 Mosul airstrike|airstrikes in Mosul]] in March 2017 which killed more than 200 civilians and accused the United States of committing [[war crime]]s, saying: "This war crime is similar to the behavior of Daesh [Islamic State] and other Takfiri groups in targeting civilians and innocent people and should be urgently addressed in courts of justice."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/03/26/515669/Iran-Shamkhani-Mosul-airstrikes-US-crimes-- Iran urges 'war crime' hearing into US killings in Mosul]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">The '''Backseat Film Festival''' is an [[independent film]] [[film festival|festival]] organized by [[Doug Sakmann]], [[Nick Esposito]], and [[Zafer Ulkucu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A home at last for local directors and their films |publisher=''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' |date=2008-07-15 |work=Daily Magazine |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20080715_A_home_at_last_for_local_directors_and_their_films.html |accessdate=2008-07-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717200228/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20080715_A_home_at_last_for_local_directors_and_their_films.html |archivedate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in [[Park City, UT]] during the winter of 2003 as one of many alternatives to the [[Sundance Film Festival]] it quickly transformed into a touring festival that continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Backseat Gets Messy Every Month in New York |publisher=Film Threat |date=2003-06-11 |work=Headlines |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=headlines&amp;Id=1497 |accessdate=2008-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822120946/http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=headlines |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2003 the festival joined forces with the [[Vans Warped Tour]] and its screening bus, the Dirty Erin, traveled through 44 cities across [[North America]] playing films for tens of thousands of young people.  [[Doug Sakmann]], former Festival Director for the [[Troma Films]]' [[Tromadance]] [[Film Festival]], filmed a [[slasher film]] series [[Punk Rock Holocaust]] during this tour which garnered international press attention for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=[[Todd Martens|Martens, Todd]] | title=Warped Tour Bands Team For Film | magazine=Billboard | date=14 July 2003 | page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=[[Employment|Staff Writer]] | title=Murder Most Horrid | magazine=Kerrang UK | date=27 September 2003 | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Backseat is currently based in [[Philadelphia, PA]].  The touring festival travels across the U.S. each year screening films for those interested in edgy, alternative [[indy films]].  It has also showcased its film lineup at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

The '''Battle of Pelusium''' was the first major battle between the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]]. This decisive battle transferred the throne of the [[Pharaoh]]s to [[Cambyses II]] of [[Persia]]. It was fought near [[Pelusium]], an important city in the eastern extremes of [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile Delta]], 30&amp;nbsp;km to the southeast of the modern [[Port Said]], in 525 BC. The battle was preceded and followed by sieges at [[Gaza City|Gaza]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].

==Background==
===Herodotus on motives and background===
The best recounting of the events leading to the battle of Pelusium is from [[Greek historians]], particularly [[Herodotus]]. According to Herodotus the conflict between the Pharaoh [[Amasis II]] of Egypt and Cambyses II of Persia was a gradual process involving multiple personalities, mostly Egyptians. According to Herodotus, an Egyptian physician was requested by Cambyses from Amasis on good terms, to which Amasis complied. The physician (most likely an ancient [[ophthalmologist]]) resented the forced labor that Amasis had imposed on him, and in retaliation, persuaded Cambyses to ask of Amasis a daughter in marriage, knowing how Amasis would dislike losing his daughter to a Persian. Cambyses complied, requesting the hand of the daughter of Amasis in marriage. 

Amasis, unable to let go of his offspring, and unwilling to start a conflict with the Persians, instead sent an Egyptian girl named [[Nitetis]], who was a daughter of an Egyptian named [[Apries]]. According to Herodotus, Apries was the previous pharaoh whom Amasis had defeated and killed, and whose daughter was now to be sent in place of Amasis's own offspring. Once greeted by Cambyses as "the daughter of Amasis", Nitetis explained the trickery employed by Amasis to avoid giving away his own daughter to the king. This infuriated Cambyses, who vowed to avenge the insult.&lt;ref name="Hero"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1uQaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Herodotus+Amasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a0o0Tb-HMdDegQfu64niCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Amasis&amp;f=false|title=The History of Herodotus Volume I, Book II|author=Herodotus|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=246–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Herodotus, another motivation that solidified Cambyses's expedition into Egypt was [[Phanes of Halicarnassus]].&lt;ref name="sir" /&gt; Originally a council man and advisor to Amasis, an unknown course of events led to bitterness developing between them to the point that Amasis sent an Egyptian [[eunuch]] after Phanes, pursuing him to [[Lydia]]. Phanes was captured in [[Lycia]] but outwitted his guards by getting them drunk and escaped to Persia, and assisted the Persian king in all manners of strategy, and was instrumental in shaping his resolve for conquest of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt;

Despite having full control over the [[Neo-Babylonian empire]] and its sub-regions including northern Arabia, Cambyses sent a message to the King of Arabia requesting safe passage through the desert road from Gaza to Pelusium.&lt;ref name="sir" /&gt; The Arabian king, himself an enemy of Amasis, and glad to facilitate his destruction, granted safe passage to Cambyses and even supplied him with troops.&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt; According to [[Polybius]], even with all the precautions taken on entering the border of Egypt, only the city of Gaza resisted the Persians, which fell after a long siege. When the news of the impending battle reached Egypt, [[Psamtik III]] (Psammenitus), son and heir of Amasis II, gathered the Egyptian army, stationing it along the fork of the [[Red Sea]] and the river [[Nile]]. Amasis himself died six months before Cambyses reached Egypt.&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sir"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manners and customs of the ancient Egyptians: including their private life, government, laws, art, manufactures, religions, and early history; derived from a comparison of the paintings, sculptures, and monuments still existing, with the accounts of ancient authors.

Psamtik had hoped that Egypt would be able to withstand the threat of the Persian attack by an alliance with the [[Greek city states|Greeks]], but this hope failed, as the Cypriot towns and the tyrant [[Polycrates of Samos]], who possessed a large fleet, now preferred to join the Persians. That one of Egypt's most prominent tactical advisers, Phanes of Halicarnassus, had already gone over to the Persian side meant that Psamtik was entirely dependent on his own limited military experience. Polycrates sent 40 [[triremes]] to the Persians. Psamtik, in a violent act of revenge prior to the confrontation with the Persian army, arrested all the sons of Phanes and stood them between two bowls. He then cut them one by one, draining their blood and mixing it with wine. Psamtik then drank of it and made every other councilman drink their blood before the battles.&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt;

==The battle==
[[File:MarchofCamybsesII.png|thumb|right|The possible path of Cambyses, Phanes of Halicarnassus, and Amasis's forces sent after Phanes; Note: The itinerary paths depicted are supposed and by no means certain. Persian forces - black line, Phanes of Halicarnassus - blue line, and Egyptians - red line.]]
The decisive military conflict happened at Pelusium. As Herodotus describes a sea of skulls at the Nile basin, upon the remnants of which he remarks on the differences between the Persian and the Egyptian heads. According to [[Ctesias]], fifty thousand Egyptians fell, whereas the entire loss on the Persian side was only seven thousand. After this short struggle, the troops of Psamtik fled, and soon the retreat became a complete rout. Disoriented, and fleeing, the Egyptians took shelter in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt; The Egyptians were now besieged in their stronghold of Memphis.

==Aftermath==
According to Herodotus, Cambyses, in a last attempt to bring an end to the struggle, sent a Persian herald in a ship to exhort the Egyptians to give up before further bloodshed. Upon sighting the Persian vessel at the port of Memphis, the Egyptians ran out, attacking the ship and killing every man in it, carrying their torn limbs with them back to the city.&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt; As Cambyses advanced to Memphis, it is said that for every [[Mytilene|Mytilenian]] killed during the siege of Memphis, ten Egyptians died, which makes the number of dead Egyptians two thousand, who may have been executed at the time or after the siege, because two hundred Mytileneans were killed. Pelusium probably surrendered itself immediately after the battle. The pharaoh was captured after the fall of Memphis and allowed to live under Persian watch. He later commited suicide after attempting a revolt against the Persians.&lt;ref name="Hero" /&gt;

==Herodotus on the battle==
[[File:Le roi Cambyse au siège de Péluse par Paul-Marie Lenoir.jpg|thumb|300px|According to [[Polyaenus]], the Persian soldiers allegedly used cats - among other sacred Egyptian animals - against the Pharaoh's army. Paul-Marie Lenoir's paintwork, 1872.]]
The fields around were strewn with the bones of the combatants when [[Herodotus]] visited. He noted that the skulls of the Egyptians were distinguishable from those of the Persians by their superior hardness, a fact confirmed he said by the mummies, and which he ascribed to the Egyptians' shaving their heads from infancy, and to the Persians covering them up with folds of cloth or linen.

[[Polyaenus]], "a retired Macedonian general more interested in novelty than historical accuracy",&lt;ref&gt;Katharine M. Rogers, ''The Cat and the Human Imagination: Feline Images from Bast to Garfield'', University of Michigan Press, 2001, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt; claims that, according to legend, Cambyses captured Pelusium by using a clever strategy. The Egyptians regarded certain animals, especially cats, as being sacred (they had a cat goddess named [[Bastet]]), and would not injure them on any account. Polyaenus claims that Cambyses had his men carry the "sacred" animals in front of them to the attack. The Egyptians did not dare to shoot their arrows for fear of wounding the animals, and so Pelusium was stormed successfully. This would be an early form of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=New York (State). Dept. of Mental Hygiene|journal=Psychiatric Quarterly: Supplement, Volumes 24-25|date=1950|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b_M6AAAAIAAJ|publisher=State Hospitals Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus, however, makes no mention of any such strategy, and "gives hardly any information" about the fighting in general. According to Herodotus, Cambyses initially behaved with a certain moderation, sparing the son of Psamtik due to feeling "a touch of pity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briant|first1=Pierre|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|date=2002|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=9781575061207|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&amp;lpg=PA54|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later, dissatisfied with his victory and unable to punish the already deceased Amasis for his trickery, decided to commit what Herodotus calls an un-Persian act: he desecrated the tomb of the mummified Amasis and ordered the mummy burned.

However, [[Pierre Briant]] concludes that Herodotus' recorded information regarding Cambyses' actions in Egypt after the victory is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briant|first1=Pierre|authorlink=Pierre Briant|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|date=2002|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=9781575061207|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&amp;lpg=PA57|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambyses then made peace with Libyans, accepting their offer for truce. Egypt became a possession of Persia, and Cambyses its Pharaoh. Because they defeated the pharaohs of the twenty-sixth dynasty, Persian monarchs were acknowledged as pharaohs and came to be known as Egypt's [[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-seventh Dynasty]] (or the first Persian period).

The '''Battle of Yarmouk Camp (December 2012)''' was a period of fierce clashes in Yarmouk Camp during the [[Syrian Civil War]]. [[Yarmouk Camp|Yarmouk]] is a district of [[Damascus]] that is home to the biggest community of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] refugees in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="googlenews1"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jevFaBhWboO5_Mqrgpk7ycShh4RQ?docId=CNG.493b5bfef777e0c4e6e2103828c1614e.1b1]&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting was between the [[Syrian Army]] and [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command|PFLP-GC]] on one side, and [[Syrian opposition|Syrian rebels]] on the other. The rebels included the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) and a group made up of Palestinians, called Liwa al-Asifa or Storm Brigade. On 17 December, it was reported that the FSA and anti-Assad Palestinians had taken control of the camp. The FSA and Syrian Army agreed to leave Yarmouk as a neutral, demilitarized zone, but sporadic clashes continued.

==Background==
At the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command]] (PFLP-GC) was based in Yarmouk and supported Syria's [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]] government led by the [[Al-Assad family]]. At the beginning of the war, tensions arose in Yarmouk between the PFLP-GC and anti-Assad Palestinian residents. On 5 June 2011, a number of Yarmouk residents were [[2011 Israeli border demonstrations|shot dead while protesting at the Israeli border]]. Allegedly angered by the PFLP-GC's refusal to take part in the protests, thousands of mourners burnt-down its headquarters in Yarmouk. PFLP-GC members opened-fire on the crowd, killing 14 Palestinians and wounding 43.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=394412 "Report: 14 Palestinians killed in Syria camp"].

[[The Electronic Intifada]], 6 June 2011. Retrieved 26 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2012, [[Al Arabiya]] reported that over 21 civilians were killed when the Syrian Army shelled Yarmouk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/03/230127.html "At least 21 killed in shelling on Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp in Syria: NGO"]. [[Al Arabiya]], 3 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Palestinian president [[Mahmoud Abbas]] condemned the Syrian Army for shelling the camp and chided the PFLP-GC for dragging Palestinians into the conflict.&lt;ref name="googlenews1"/&gt;

On 31 October, the FSA announced that they had helped form a brigade made up of anti-Assad Palestinians, called Liwa al-Asifa (Storm Brigade), who have been armed to take control of Yarmouk. The PFLP-GC leader [[Ahmed Jibril]] and his men were accused of harassing Yarmouk's residents and attacking FSA fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/topic/syria/rebels-form-brigade-damascus-fight-armed-palestinians-aligned-president-assad|title=Rebels form a brigade in Damascus to fight armed Palestinians aligned with President Assad.|work=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Palestinian men from the camp also joined other FSA units and fought with them in the Damascus districts of Tadamon and Al-Hajar Al-Aswad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2012/Jul-18/181033-palestinians-join-syria-revolt-activists-fsa.ashx#axzz2Aniktc00|title=Palestinians join Syria revolt: activists, FSA|work=The Daily Star Newspaper - Lebanon|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==December clashes==
Fierce fighting in Yarmouk began on 5 December 2012&lt;ref name=aa1612/&gt; and lasted until 17 December. The fighting mainly involved the FSA (along with the Liwa al-Asifa brigade) fighting against the PLFP-GC.

On 16 December, Syrian Army jets bombed Yarmouk, for the first time since the civil war began. Activists reported that a school and mosque sheltering refugees were hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/16/syria-crisis-camp-idUSL5E8NG4DX20121216 | work=Reuters | title=Syrian fighter jets bomb Palestinian camp in Damascus-activists | date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that at least 23 were killed, all civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/12/16/syrian-planes-hit-yarmouk-mosque-killing-dozens/|title=Syrian planes hit Yarmouk mosque killing dozens|work=euronews|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 1,000 Palestinians reached Lebanon less than 48 hours after the bombing.

On 17 December, it was claimed that many PFLP-GC fighters defected to the rebels. One PFLP-GC commander said "I felt that we became soldiers for the Assad regime, not guards for the camps, so I decided to defect". He claimed that government forces stood by and watched as the PFLP-GC fought the rebels, without helping the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/world/middleeast/syrian-airstrike-kills-palestinian-refugees.html|title=A Syrian Airstrike Kills Palestinian Refugees and Costs Assad Support|date=17 December 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed Jibril reportedly fled Damascus for the Mediterranean city of [[Tartous]].&lt;ref name=aa1612&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/16/255444.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/15/us-syria-crisis-palestinians-idUSBRE8BE09O20121215|title=Palestinian faction leader Jibril leaves Damascus: rebels|work=Reuters|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/12/16/278330/palestinian-chief-leaves-syrian-capital/|title=PressTV|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225014929/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2012/12/16/278330/palestinian-chief-leaves-syrian-capital/|archivedate=25 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFLP-GC political bureau member [[Hossam Arafat (Palestinian politician)|Hussam Arafat]], however, announced that Jibril was still in Damascus and that only a small number of fighters had defected.

On 20 December, the FSA said it had pushed all pro-government fighters out of Yarmouk and handed it back to the Palestinians. The day before, fresh fighting on the outskirts of Yarmouk killed a civilian and four PFLP-GC members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/20/256099.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, government and rebel representatives agreed that all armed groups should withdraw from Yarmouk and leave it as a neutral zone. The agreement also said that the PFLP-GC should be dismantled and its weapons surrendered. However, a spokesman for the pro-rebel Palestine Refugee Camp Network said, "the implementation of the truce has been problematic" because of "intermittent" government shelling of Yarmouk and clashes on its outskirts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/20/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html "Syrian fight now 'overtly sectarian,' U.N. says"]. [[CNN]], 20 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An AFP reporter at Batikha, the main entrance to the camp, reported sporadic shooting on 21 December but no gunmen were seen on the streets of Yarmouk.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.lorientlejour.com/category/%C3%80+La+Une/article/793291/%22Nous_rentrons_car_nous_en_avons_assez_detre_humilies%22.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.lorientlejour.com/category/Derni%C3%A8res+Infos/article/793297/Nouveaux_combats_entre_pro_et_anti-regime_dans_le_camp_palestinien_de_Yarmouk_a_Damas.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Fellow Palestinian left-wing groups—including the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), the biggest Palestinian leftist group—berated Jibril and the PFLP-GC.&lt;ref name=pflp-on-defense&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2012/al-monitor/pflp-on-defense-in-gaza.html "PFLP on Defense in Gaza Over Ties to Assad"]. [[Al-Monitor]], 27 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One PFLP official said "Everyone knows the true size of PFLP-GC. They are not representative of the Palestinians". Another said that Jibril "does not even belong to the Palestinian Left.

==Synopsis==
''From the Beautiful: The Carole King Musical cast recording booklet''
===Act I===
At Carnegie Hall in 1971, Carole King sings "[[So Far Away (Carole King song)|So Far Away]]". Then, in Brooklyn 1958, 16-year-old Carole tells her mother, Genie, she is going into Manhattan to try to sell a song to music publisher [[Don Kirshner|Donnie Kirshner]]. In the long tradition of mothers, Genie is opposed to her daughter's wish and in the equally long tradition of teenagers not caring about their mother's opinion, Carole goes anyway. At [[Brill Building|1650 Broadway]], she hears the "1650 Broadway Medley". She then sings her new song "[[It Might As Well Rain Until September]]". Donnie says he will take it and hopes she has others. At [[Queens_College,_City_University_of_New_York|Queens College]], Carole meets a handsome young lyricist named Gerry Goffin. They agree to collaborate, musically and romantically, which in both cases turns out to be a fertile arrangement. When they go to Donnie's to play their new song, Carole confesses to Gerry that she is pregnant. Gerry asks her to marry him. It gives her an extra depth of feeling when she sings their new song for Donnie, "[[Some Kind of Wonderful (The Drifters song)|Some Kind of Wonderful]]", which [[The Drifters]] then record.

They get an office at 1650. While there, Carole meets a new lyricist Cynthia Weil ("[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]"), who is looking for a composer to work with. Gerry and Carole sing their new song "Take Good Care of My Baby", during which Barry Mann, the composer with the office next door, enters. Barry meets Cynthia and they decide to collaborate. As they begin to work, sparks fly. Donnie tells them he needs a song for the Shirelles. The couples compete for the job. In Donnie's office the next morning, Carole and Gerry present "Will You Love Me Tomorrow". Cynthia and Barry perform "He's Sure the Boy I Love". Donnie picks Carole and Gerry's song for [[The Shirelles]] and it goes to no. 1. And so, on either side of the same wall, a competition is born. The two teams turn out an amazing parade of songs: "[[Up on the Roof (song)|Up on the Roof]]", "[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]", "[[The Loco-Motion]]" and "[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]".

Gerry and Carole are at the taping of a TV special where their new song, "[[One Fine Day (song)|One Fine Day]]", is being performed by the dazzling Janelle Woods. During a break, Gerry confesses to Carole that he is restless in their marriage. He wants to sleep with Janelle, and he doesn't want to lie about it. Carole is stunned. As the song begins again, she takes it over and sings it herself.

===Act II===
Carole is in a recording studio doing a demo of "Chains". Gerry is off with Janelle but tells her he will meet her later. Nick, a guitarist, asks Carole to come sing at the Bitter End sometime but she declines — she's a songwriter, not a singer. The thing with Gerry is getting her down so she goes and talks to Cynthia who is also having trouble with Barry — they split up. Carole decides to tell Gerry he has to end the affair with Janelle. As she leaves, Barry comes in. He and Cynthia make up and play their new song, "Walking in the Rain". Gerry shows up, but he is not making sense. He eventually has a breakdown. At the hospital, he tells Carole he will end the affair with Janelle and that he wants to come home. She suggests they make a new start and move to the suburbs ("Pleasant Valley Sunday"). 

Barry, Cynthia and Donnie come to see the new house. Barry plays their new song, "[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]". Depressed that he and Carole can't do as well, Gerry leaves in a funk for the city. While he is gone, it comes out that Barry and Cynthia have seen him with another woman, a singer named Marilyn Wald. Carole goes to Marilyn's apartment and Gerry is there. It's the final straw, and she ends their marriage. At the Bitter End, where Barry and Cynthia hear their song "Uptown", Carole explains she went to Los Angeles for a vacation and has started writing on her own. Nick, the guitarist from the studio who asked her to sing with his group, is playing there and urges her to sing. She sings her new song, "It's Too Late". She decides to move to Los Angeles. At 1650, she says goodbye to Donnie, Barry and Cynthia and plays them a parting present "[[You've Got a Friend]]".

In Los Angeles, she records her album, ''Tapestry''. The session goes well until the last song, which she is afraid to sing. It's a song she wrote with Gerry and she is afraid of the feelings it may stir up. Her producer, Lou Adler, persuades her. She sings "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman". The album is a smash. Carole is at Carnegie Hall for her concert, and is met by Gerry, who apologizes for the way he mistreated her in the past and gives her a final prediction - "you're going all the way". Carole takes to the piano, and performs for her audience.

==Critical reception==
[[Ben Brantley]], reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called the musical a "friendly, formulaic bio-musical". He wrote that the musical shows the change in King from a modest songwriter to the popular and confident performer of those songs, showing the "real, conflicted person within the reluctant star."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/theater/beautiful-the-carole-king-musical-at-sondheim-theater.html?_r=0# "Theater Review. 'Beautiful: The Carole King Musical' at Sondheim Theater"], ''The New York Times'', January 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Green, in his review for the ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'', praised the performers but criticized the book, writing that the musical does not have the "dramatic coherence of book biomusicals".&lt;ref&gt;Green, Jesse.

She wrote that while the musical "doesn't hang its songs on the greatest or most suspenseful story ever told, it has enough bounce and Broadway show glitz to keep you in your seat".&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Elyse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9728">'''Brendan Kyle Hatcher''' is a United States [[diplomat]] who was called "the most closely surveilled American in Russia" by ABC News Investigative Reporter Brian Ross in a September 2009 investigative report.  Hatcher gained notoriety in August 2009 after the Russian tabloid ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', a newspaper which Russian intelligence expert [[Andrei Soldatov]] ties to the [[Federal Security Services]] (FSB) of the [[Russian Federation]], showed a video &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/andrei-soldatov-irina-borogan/project-id-who%E2%80%99s-bugging-russian-opposition |title=Project_ID: Who’s bugging the Russian opposition? |website=Opendemocracy.net |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of him while accusing him of being an undercover [[CIA]] agent in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jill Dougherty |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/09/24/russia.us.sextape/index.html |title=U.S. calls purported sex tape 'doctored' and 'smear campaign' |website=Edition.cnn.com |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The media reports were quickly condemned by investigating authorities in the U.S. as fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/09/23/complains-russia-sex-tape-smear.html U.S. Complains to Russia About Sex Tape 'Smear'] foxnews.com 2009/09/23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
According to Eli Lake of ''[[The Washington Times]]'', Hatcher became one of several American diplomats and journalists to be attacked and falsely accused between 2007 and 2011 after the [[Obama Administration]]'s "reset" with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/4/russia-uses-dirty-tricks-despite-us-reset/ |title=Russia uses dirty tricks despite U.S. 'reset' |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hatcher served as Political Officer who worked to promote [[human rights]] and [[freedom of religion]] in Russia from 2008 to 2010. He was awarded in June 2010 by the [[State Department]] for his "courage and character, commitment to excellence, and support of human rights and religious freedom in spite of exceedingly difficult circumstances and personal hardship."  As part of his job, Hatcher would meet with opposition figures, government officials, NGOs, journalists, and religious leaders to promote human rights and religious equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.st-catherine.ru/index.php?lang%3Deng%26sitepartid%3D9%26id%3D1161%26level%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326121900/http://old.st-catherine.ru/index.php?lang=eng&amp;sitepartid=9&amp;id=1161&amp;level=0 |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatcher was fully exonerated by the media and State Department, and he was lauded by his colleagues for heroism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beam |first=Christopher |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2277407/ |title=Honey traps: Do spies use sex to extract secrets? |website=Slate.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2009, Russian media sources with links to the FSB (the successor organization to the [[KGB]] of the [[Soviet Union]]) released real video images and pictures of Hatcher that had been spliced with images of another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/09/24/idINIndia-42678820090924 |title=U.S. complains to Russia over sex tape 'smear' |website=In.reuters.com |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctored images emerged just one month after the first presidential summit between U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev which prominently featured discussions on human rights and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/06/AR2009070603623.html |title=Obama Endorses Medvedev's Agenda but Pushes for More Democratic Reforms |website=Washingtonpost.com |date=2009-07-07 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ambassador of the [[Embassy of the United States in Moscow]], [[John Beyrle]], issued a formal protest to the [[Russian government]], stating that the Russian media reports about Hatcher were completely untrue and had no place in the development of better relations between the two superpowers.  Despite Beyrle's protest, neither Hatcher nor the U.S government received an apology from Russian officials for the "smear campaign."&lt;ref name="abcnews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/russian-sex-tape-smear-american-diplomat/story?id=8651311 |title=Russian Sex Tape Used to Smear American Diplomat - ABC News |website=Abcnews.go.com |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2009, [[ABC News]] ran an investigative piece on ''[[Nightline]]'' concerning the "smear campaign" against Hatcher, including the interview with Ambassador Beyrle. During the interview, Beyrle stated that Hatcher was 100% innocent of any wrongdoing. Beyrle had previously awarded Hatcher in May 2009 for his success in promoting freedom of religion and human rights in Russia, and commented that an element in Russia had attacked Hatcher to discredit him and his work as well as prevent the two countries from developing closer ties. Soldatov further noted that only Russian intelligence agents would be interested in smearing Hatcher to force his dismissal from Russia.

In the course of the segment, retired FBI Counterintelligence Officer and Russian intelligence services expert David Majors pointed out that the video segments had been doctored to smear Hatcher and to reduce his effectiveness at his job. Major pointed out obvious flaws in the video sequence and assessed that the false media reports were a "dirty trick," constituting a failed attempt to frame Hatcher and ruin his reputation as a change agent in the human rights activist community.&lt;ref name="abcnews1"/&gt;

On September 24, 2009, State Department spokesperson Ian Kelly called Hatcher "one of our best" diplomats, and confirmed that Hatcher had been smeared with false media reports to discredit his work promoting human rights and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.state.gov/md129583.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706073213/http://m.state.gov/md129583.htm |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Kelly noted that the State Department deplored this type of activity by the Russians at a time when diplomats like Hatcher were working to improve bilateral relations.

In the February 19, 2017, episode of HBO series [[Last Week Tonight]], host John Oliver called the FSB fake tape "ridiculous" as part of his larger commentary on the lengths to which the Kremlin will go to discredit its opponents.

Prior to his service in the diplomatic corps, Hatcher served as an intelligence analyst with the [http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Intelligence-Analysis.aspx Department of the Treasury, Office of Intelligence and Analysis], where he focused on fighting the sources of [[terrorism financing]]. In the summer of 2004, Hatcher conducted research for the Center for East Asian Studies in Vladivostok, Russia, where he focused on Russian attitudes towards Chinese migrants.  He later presented and published a paper detailing his findings, which included a scathing commentary about Russian racism and xenophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.froginawell.net/china/category/china-russia/ |title=China-Russia – Frog in a Well China |website=Froginawell.net |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his research in Russia, Hatcher worked in the private sector as a business manager, and he served in the Peace Corps as a volunteer in Kazakhstan (part of the former Soviet Union) where he taught economics at the Taraz Polytechnical College in [[Taraz|Taraz, Kazakhstan]].  Former Soviet officials have long been skeptical of the Peace Corps as a cover for US spies, evidenced by Russia’s decision to kick out the Peace Corps in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-12-28/world/peace.corps_1_peace-corps-situation-in-russian-regions-social-tasks?_s%3DPM%3AWORLD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021064828/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-12-28/world/peace.corps_1_peace-corps-situation-in-russian-regions-social-tasks?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=2010-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal background and honors==
Hatcher hails from Nashville, Tennessee and attended [[Montgomery Bell Academy]], famous as the source for the blockbuster film [[Dead Poets Society]]. In 1997, Hatcher graduated from the [[University of Georgia]], which honored him as one of its top 40 under 40 graduates in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.uga.edu/alumni/index.php/site/blog/25387 |title=Blog - UGA Alumni Association |website=Alumni.uga.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Hatcher received his masters from the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey]] (MIIS), where he delivered the student commencement address alongside Russian scientist Roald Sagdeev and philanthropist Susan Eisenhower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/alumni/photos_graduation_2005.htm |title=CNS Alumni Photos: 2005 &amp;#124; James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies |website=Cns.miis.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government honored him as a Presidential Management Fellow in 2005.

According to former High Court judge Michael Kirby, the rudeness of judges trickles down to senior lawyers who then vent their frustrations on more junior staff, thus creating a cycle of bullying and [[Occupational stress|stress]] that is rife within the [[legal profession]].&lt;ref name=judge&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/bullying-judges-breed-stressful-system-kirby-20130221-2eudp.html Bullying judges breed stressful system: Kirby]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chatham House Rule''' is a system for holding debates and discussion panels on controversial issues, named after the headquarters of the UK [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]], based in Chatham House, London, where the rule originated in June 1927.

At a meeting held under the Chatham House Rule, anyone who comes to the meeting is free to use information from the discussion, but is not allowed to reveal who made any comment. It is designed to increase openness of discussion.

==The rule==
The rule was created in 1927 and refined in 1992.  Since its most recent refinement in 2002, the rule states:&lt;ref name=rule&gt;{{cite web| work = About | url = http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule/ |title=Chatham House Rule |publisher=Chatham House | location = [[United Kingdom|UK]] |accessdate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the [[information]] received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.}} Sometimes the reference is made to ''Chatham House rules''.&lt;ref name=MW01/&gt; However, Chatham House states that the singular should be used as there is only one rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule|website=Chatham House Rule|title=Chatham House|publisher=Chatham House|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The rule is designed to increase openness of discussion of [[public policy]] and current affairs, as it allows people to express and discuss controversial opinions and arguments without suffering the risk of stalling their career or even dismissal from their job, and with a clear separation from the opinion and the view of their employer. 

The rule allows people to speak as individuals and to express views that may not be those of their organisations, and therefore encourages free discussion. Speakers are free to voice their own opinions, and to contest the opinions of other participants, without concern for their personal reputation or their official duties and affiliations. The Chatham House Rule resolves a boundary problem faced by many [[community of practice|communities of practice]], in that it permits acknowledgement of the community or conversation, while protecting the freedom of interaction that is necessary for the community to carry out its conversations. It is designed to reduce the risk of what has come to be described as [[groupthink]], where unpopular views are excluded from discussion, reducing the range of opinions an organisation can discuss.

The aim of the rule is to guarantee anonymity to those speaking within its walls so that better [[international relations]] may be achieved.  The rule is now used internationally as an aid to free discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | location = [[Finland]] | author-link = Jukka Rislakki | first = Jukka | last = Rislakki | title = Informaatiouhat mietityttävät sekä virolaisia että suomalaisia | publisher = [[Suomen Kuvalehti]] | date = February 24, 2011 | language = Finnish | url = http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/blogit/eri-mielta/verkossa-sk82011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110227111229/http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/blogit/eri-mielta/verkossa-sk82011 | archivedate = February 27, 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original rule of 1927 was refined in October 1992 and again in 2002.&lt;ref name=rule /&gt; Chatham House has translated the rule into [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Chatham House | url = http://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule/chatham-house-rule-translations | work = About us | title = Chatham House Rule Translations}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule is a contrast (or a compromise) between private meetings, where revealing what was said in the meeting is forbidden, and  ''[[Journalism sourcing#"On the record"|on the record]]'' events where the discussion is completely public and attributed.

Generally, the Chatham House Rule is imposed as a condition of being allowed to attend a meeting or event: all participants are understood to have agreed that it would be conducive to free discussion that they should be subject to the rule for the relevant part of the meeting. The success of the rule may depend upon it being considered morally binding, particularly in circumstances where a failure to comply with the rule may not result in sanction.

==Concern over ECB use==
In May 2015, the release of a rule-bound speech by [[European Central Bank]] board member [[Benoît Cœuré]] triggered broader attention to the bank's use of the system. The [[Benoît Cœuré#European Central Bank|Cœuré speech]] influenced currency, stock and bond markets.&lt;ref name="FT_2015-05-20"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Benoît Cœuré speech highlights central bank links to financiers - FT.com | last = Jones | first = Claire  | last2 = Fleming | first2 = Sam | website = [[Financial Times]] | date = 20 May 2015 | accessdate = 2016-02-11 | url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f48123e2-ff02-11e4-8dd4-00144feabdc0.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150707225427/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f48123e2-ff02-11e4-8dd4-00144feabdc0.html | archive-date = 2015-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg_2015-05-19"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Hedge Fund Diners Get ECB’s Market-Moving News Hours Early | last = Black | first = Jeff | last2 = Worrachate | first2 = Anchalee | website = [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] | date = 19 May 2015 | accessdate = 2016-02-11 | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-19/ecb-serves-hedge-fund-diners-qe-treat-most-investors-didn-t-know | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150816075211/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-19/ecb-serves-hedge-fund-diners-qe-treat-most-investors-didn-t-know | archive-date = 2015-08-16 | dead-url = no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph_2015-05-28"&gt;{{Cite news | title = ECB told off by ombudsman for fumbling market moving speech | last = Spence | first =  Peter | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 28 May 2015 | accessdate = 2016-02-11 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11636422/ECB-told-off-by-ombudsman-for-fumbling-market-moving-speech.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151201130922/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11636422/ECB-told-off-by-ombudsman-for-fumbling-market-moving-speech.html | archive-date = 2015-12-01 | dead-url = no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, other recent ECB invocations of the rule regarding a question-and-answer session and opening remarks for Cœuré, respectively, by ECB Vice President [[Vitor Constancio]] and another member of the board, [[Peter Praet]], also gained attention. An [[Governing Council of the European Central Bank|ECB governing council]] member Boštjan Jazbec of [[Slovenia]] also had, the same month, held a question-and-answer session under the rule.&lt;ref name=MW01&gt;Fletcher, Laurence, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecb-error-spurs-questions-about-policy-disclosures-2015-05-25-17485932 "ECB error spurs questions about policy disclosures"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', May 25, 2015.

The '''collapse of the Hotel New World''' ({{Lang-zh|s=新世界酒店倒塌事件}}; {{Lang-ms|Runtuhnya Hotel New World}}; {{Lang-ta|நியூ வர்ல்டு சம்பவம்}}) occurred on 15 March 1986, and was Singapore's deadliest civil disaster since the [[Spyros disaster]] on 12 October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|author1=Allen Yu-Hung LAI|author2=Seck L.

== Background ==
Frequently referred to as '''Hotel New World''', the building in question was actually the '''Lian Yak Building''' ({{lang-zh|'''联益大厦'''}}), which was completed in 1971 and consisted of six stories and a basement garage.&lt;ref name="Inquiry" /&gt; The Hotel New World, previously known as the New Serangoon Hotel until 1984, was the main tenant occupying the top three floors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite techreport|title=Seventh report of the committee: for the two years ending July 1987|page=13|institution=Standing Committee on Structural Safety|date=September 1987|url=http://www.structural-safety.org/media/41885/162_7th_SCOSS_report_1987.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;!--original-url=http://www.scoss.org.uk/publications/rtf/07Report.pdf--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a branch of the Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank (which merged with [[United Overseas Bank]] in 1987) took up the ground level. A nightclub, Universal Neptune Nite-Club and Restaurant, was situated on the second level of the building at the time of the collapse.&lt;ref name=channel8&gt;{{citation|title=《劫后“新”生》第4集- 新世界酒店倒塌|publisher=[[新傳媒私人有限公司]]|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building had previously experienced a poisonous gas leak (caused by [[carbon monoxide]]) in some of the hotel rooms, first hitting the headlines on 30 August 1975, the day after the poisonous gas leak was reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19860316.2.4.8 | title=Gas Ieak made news 10 years ago (Title adjusted due to improper transcription by OCR) | date=16 March 1986 | accessdate=27 September 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005180339/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19860316.2.4.8 | archive-date=5 October 2017 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collapse ==
On 15 March 1986, the building rapidly disintegrated in less than a minute at about {{nowrap|11:25 am}}, leaving little time for anyone within it to make their escape. Witnesses reported hearing an explosion prior to the collapse, but the police ruled out the possibility of a bomb attack. A gas explosion was thought to be a possible cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=100 still trapped|author=Philip Lee|publisher=[[The Sunday Times]]|url=http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/dream/life/headline/lifh12.html|date=16 March 1986|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816022001/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/dream/life/headline/lifh12.html|archivedate=16 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse was met with shock by many, including the then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] who was quoted as saying that "the collapse of such a building is unprecedented."&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/17/world/after-36-hours-2-are-rescued-from-the-ruins-in-singapore.html?sec=travel&amp;n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | work=The New York Times | title=After 36 Hours, 2 Are Rescued From The Ruins in Singapore | first=Barbara | last=Crossette | date=17 March 1986 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612164941/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/17/world/after-36-hours-2-are-rescued-from-the-ruins-in-singapore.html?sec=travel&amp;n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | archive-date=12 June 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the collapse, as many as 300 were feared trapped underneath the debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/world/300-trapped-as-hotel-in-singapore-topples.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | work=The New York Times | title=300 Trapped as Hotel in Singapore Topples | date=15 March 1986 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729051754/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/world/300-trapped-as-hotel-in-singapore-topples.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | archive-date=29 July 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates dropped to 100 trapped or missing a day later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40710F63B5F0C758DDDAA0894DE484D81&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Singapore | work=The New York Times | title=6-Story Hotel Collapses in Singapore; 100 Trapped | date=16 March 1986 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to 60, including 26 hotel staff and 16 bank staff unaccounted for.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; The figure was finally put at 33 when the official death toll was announced on 22 March 1986 after the end of the rescue effort.&lt;ref name="final toll"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/world/singapore-toll-put-at-33.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | work=The New York Times | title=Singapore Toll Put at 33 | date=22 March 1986 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729081334/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/world/singapore-toll-put-at-33.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | archive-date=29 July 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst those killed, 23 were Singaporeans, and the other ten foreigners.

=== Rescue ===
After the collapse, many passers-by began to try pulling out survivors. They were soon joined by the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force|Singapore Fire Service]] (SFS), the [[Police Tactical Unit (Singapore)|Police Task Force]] of the [[Singapore Police Force]] (SPF) and the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF). A nearby business, Eagle Piano Company, became a centre for the rescue operation.

As there were survivors buried in the rubble, the rescue was a delicate operation. Debris was carefully removed as power saws and drills cut through the rubble.

Sound detectors were used to locate survivors beneath the slabs by picking up faint moans and cries. In the first 12 hours, nine people were rescued. At one time, Lieutenant-Colonel Lim Meng Kin (SAF Chief Medical Officer), along with several other SAF medical officers and two doctors from the [[Ministry of Health (Singapore)|Health Ministry]], took turns to crawl through narrow spaces inside the rubble in an effort to provide assistance to trapped survivors, giving [[Intravenous therapy|glucose and saline drips]] to them.

Tunnelling experts from Britain, Ireland and Japan who were involved in nearby construction for the (Singapore) Mass Rapid Transit, including Thomas "Tommy" Gallagher, Thomas Mulleary, Patrick "PJ" Gallagher, Michael Prendergast, Michael "Mickey" Scott, and Tan Jin Thong, offered to assist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/world/singapore-honors-rescuers.html | work=The New York Times | title=Singapore Honors Rescuers | date=27 April 1986 | access-date=6 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828114523/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/world/singapore-honors-rescuers.html | archive-date=28 August 2016 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They became concerned that the use of heavy machinery would collapse the rubble onto those trapped. Their voluntary efforts, digging 4 tunnels under the rubble, resulted in the rescue of another eight survivors. The tunnelling experts were later honoured by the Singapore government for their efforts. Thomas Mulleary was also nominated for an O.B.E for his rescue work but refused the prestigious honour when the rest of the rescue squad was not included.

The last survivor, 30-year-old Chua Kim Choo, was rescued on 18 March 1986, having survived after hiding beneath a table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/world/around-the-world-singapore-woman-saved-after-3-days-in-rubble.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | work=The New York Times | title=AROUND THE WORLD; Singapore Woman Saved After 3 Days in Rubble | date=19 March 1986 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612165747/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/world/around-the-world-singapore-woman-saved-after-3-days-in-rubble.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FWorld%2FCountries+and+Territories%2FSingapore | archive-date=12 June 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the six-day rescue operation in 21 March, 17 people were rescued, but 33 people lost their lives.

== Outcome ==
=== Inquiry ===
Many potential causes of the accident were investigated. Surviving sections of concrete were tested to ensure they were built to proper construction standards and it was found that they were. The construction work of the underground railway – built by tunnellers who had assisted in the rescue – was investigated, even though the excavations were more than 100 yards from the collapsed building. It was found they had no effect on the building's stability.

Also investigated were the various additions made to the building after its initial construction. [[Air conditioning]] systems had been constructed on the roof of the building, the bank had added a large safe, and ceramic tiles had been fixed to the building's exterior, all adding considerably to the building's weight. It was found that the weight of these additions was inconsequential.

However, this line of investigation into weight led to the discovery that the original structural engineer had made a serious error in calculating the building's [[structural load]]. The structural engineer had calculated the building's [[Structural load#Live loads|live load]] (the weight of the building's potential inhabitants, furniture, fixtures, and fittings) but the building's [[Structural load#Dead load|dead load]] (the weight of the building itself) was completely omitted from the calculation. This meant that the building as constructed could not support its own weight. Collapsing was only a matter of time. After three different supporting columns failed in the days before the disaster, the other columns—which took on the added weight no longer supported by the failed columns—could not support the building.&lt;ref name="Seconds from Disaster"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hotel Collapse Singapore|series=[[Seconds from disaster]]|season=2|number=9|network=[[National Geographic Channel]]|date=27 September 2005|url=http://natgeotv.com/uk/seconds-from-disaster/about|lang=en|access-date=24 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308031118/http://natgeotv.com/uk/seconds-from-disaster/about|archivedate=8 March 2014|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Channel News Asia, Lian Yak Building was designed by an unqualified draftsman instead of a professional structural engineer. An investigator found that he had over-estimated the dead weight which the columns and walls could support. The draftsman claimed that the building owner Ng Khong Lim, who eventually died in the collapse incident, had appointed him to design Lian Yak Building but Ng directed that building work. The investigator also found that Ng requested to use inferior materials to build Lian Yak Building in order to reduce the cost.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hotel New World Collapse|series=Days of Disaster|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/days-of-disaster/hotel-new-world-collapse/1673428.html|access-date=27 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227173535/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/days-of-disaster/hotel-new-world-collapse/1673428.html|archivedate=27 February 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/lhzb19860919-1.2.15.6.aspx|accessdate=2015-10-17|title=为节省成本 黄康霖修改混凝土成分比例|language=Chinese|date=1986-09-19|first1=Lianhe|last1=Zaobao|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111051506/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/lhzb19860919-1.2.15.6.aspx|archive-date=11 January 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aftermath ===
On 27 April 1986, the [[Government of Singapore]] honoured five individuals for their assistance in rescue efforts, including three from Ireland, one from Britain, and a local.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/world/singapore-honors-rescuers.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FSubjects%2FR%2FRescues | work=The New York Times | title=Singapore Honors Rescuers | date=27 April 1986 | accessdate=4 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162548/https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/world/singapore-honors-rescuers.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FSubjects%2FR%2FRescues | archive-date=12 June 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A dinner was also hosted by the Singapore government on 29 April 1986 for [[SMRT Corporation]] staff involved in the rescue effort, with the then [[Ministry of Communications and Information|Minister of Communications and Information]], [[Yeo Ning Hong]], as the Guest-of-Honour.

Following this disaster, buildings built in the 1970s were checked for structural faults, and some of them were declared structurally unsound and had to be evacuated, including the main block of [[Hwa Chong Junior College]] and [[Catholic High School, Singapore|Catholic High School]] campus at Queen Street. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://video.toggle.sg/en/series/tuesday-report-when-the-bell-rings/ep6/524942|title=星期二特写 - 《钟声响起时》第6 集 - 双轨火车|last=|first=|date=21 August 2017|website=video.toggle.sg|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825202840/https://video.toggle.sg/en/series/tuesday-report-when-the-bell-rings/ep6/524942|archive-date=25 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government also introduced tighter regulations on building construction; since 1989, all structural designs are required to be counter-checked by Accredited Checkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bca.gov.sg/Newsroom/others/pr260699.pdf|format=PDF|title=Update on the Collapse of Roof of School Hall Under Construction at Compassvale Street|publisher=[[Building and Construction Authority]]|date=26 June 1999|access-date=21 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613051605/http://www.bca.gov.sg/Newsroom/others/pr260699.pdf|archive-date=13 June 2007|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (SCDF) underwent a significant upgrade, in terms of training and equipment, to improve its readiness in performing complex rescue operations.

Five years after the collapse, construction work commenced on the site for a new seven-storey hotel on 28 March 1991. The Fortuna Hotel opened with 85 rooms in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tacboc.ca/LibraryDocs/0,1887,2402.pdf|format=PDF|title=A new world now after hotel collapse|author=Goh Chin Lian|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]|date=15 March 2004}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In media ===
In July 1986, singer-songwriter [[Kelvin Tan (musician)|Kelvin Tan]] contributed to ''BigO'' magazine's ''Nothing on the Radio'' cassette the song "Seen the End", after spending two nights at the former Hotel New World site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sounds like Nothing on the Radio|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19860704-1.2.68.11.4.aspx|accessdate=30 September 2014|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=4 July 1986|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006091830/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19860704-1.2.68.11.4.aspx|archive-date=6 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the disaster was re-enacted in the Chinese-language television series ''[[Finishing Line]]'' (出人头地), which was aired on SBC 8 (now [[MediaCorp Channel 8]]).

On 25 September 2003, the disaster was featured in the first episode of the second season of the television series ''True Courage'', which was broadcast on MediaCorp TV Channel 5 (now [[MediaCorp Channel 5]]). A Chinese-language version of the series, titled ''True Courage'' (逆境勇者), was also on aired on MediaCorp TV Channel 8 (now MediaCorp Channel 8).

On 27 September 2005, ''Seconds From Disaster'' portrayed the disaster in the episode "Hotel Collapse Singapore". Instead of the actual site, the program used an image of the area around 88 Syed Alwi Road (at the corner of Kampon Kapor Road) as the basis for a computer-generated reconstruction of the building and its collapse. The episode was retelecast in Singapore on 16 September 2007 via [[StarHub TV]].

In February 2015, ''Days of Disasters'' also portrayed the disaster in the episode "Hotel New World Collapse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotel New World Collapse Video (Channel NewsAsia)|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/days-of-disaster/hotel-new-world-collapse/1673428.html|accessdate=27 February 2015|agency=Channel NewsAsia|publisher=MediaCorp Pte Ltd.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226103911/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/tv/tvshows/days-of-disaster/hotel-new-world-collapse/1673428.html|archive-date=26 February 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in the drama ''[[The Journey: Our Homeland]]''.

'''Convergence''' (sometimes referenced as C*) is the annual [[net.goth]] party run by and for members of the [[alt.gothic]] and alt.gothic.fashion [[newsgroups|newsgroup]], and other related Usenet newsgroups. Started in 1995, it is a chance for [[net.goth]]s and others who normally only meet on the [[Internet]] to meet. Events at Convergence typically included live bands and [[nightclub|club]] nights, bazaars, fashion, art shows, panels, and tours of goth-themed locales in the host city.

== Location ==

Convergence is a "floating" event. The location for each year voted on by the [[net.goth]] community in response to proposals by volunteer committees. So far all have taken place in [[North America]].

Past Convergences have been held in:

== Attendance ==
Convergence was initially proposed and planned by two long-time members of the [[alt.gothic]] [[newsgroup]] hierarchy, at the time residents of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], as an international gathering of members of the newsgroups and related [[net.goth]] groups. It was conceived as an opportunity for those who had previously known each other primarily or exclusively through [[Internet]] forums, to meet and get to know each other in person.

There has been considerable debate regarding the extent to which the event should reach out to other on-line gothic communities, as well as members of local non-[[Internet]]-based [[Goth subculture|gothic]] scenes. Some planning committees have made efforts to expand the scope of the event; while others have made similar efforts to restrict advertising to predominantly the founding [[net.goth]] communities.

Attendance ranged over the years usually between 300-800, but attendance spiked at Convergence 13 to approximately 1,500.

== Organization ==

There is no formal Convergence organization per se. Since shortly after its inception, the bidding and voting process has been managed by a more-or-less consistent group of volunteers, known informally as the C*b*l, composed of several of the longest-term participants in the [[alt.gothic]] newsgroups. The C*b*l is widely recognized as having made some of the most substantial contributions to maintaining Convergence, and are among its most frequent attendees. The group also maintains the official Convergence website, and provides organizational and informational assistance to host committees.

Each Convergence is organized and run by an [[ad hoc]] volunteer committee. Committees typically consist of residents of the host city, a large percentage of whom are expected to be active participants on alt.gothic or related [[net.goth]] groups.

'''Chervonohorod''' or '''Chervone''' (until 1970 {{lang-uk|Червоне}}, formerly {{lang-uk|Червоногород}}, {{lang-pl|Czerwonogród}}), meaning "Red Town" (from the color of the earth), is a former [[town]] in [[Zalischyky Raion]], [[Ternopil Oblast]] of [[Ukraine]], that was part of the municipal district of [[Nyrkiv]] (Ни́рків). 

It was chartered in 1434 and was the seat of a [[powiat]] in the [[Podole Voivodeship]]. During the 19th century Chervonohorod declined in importance, and its population was reduced to 500 by the time of the [[September Campaign]] (1939).

The local [[Chervonohorod castle|castle]] was built in the early 17th century as a seat of the Daniłowicz magnate family. Prince [[Poniński]] acquired the ruined castle from the [[Habsburgs]] in 1778 and had it demolished. A new princely residence was erected to replace it. The prince and his family were interred in the family vault, which boasted a relief commissioned from [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. The Soviets dismantled the Poniński-[[Lubomirski]] palace (apart from the two towers), removing Czerwonogród from the map of the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Elizabethan era''' is the epoch in the [[Tudor period]] of the [[history of England]] during the reign of [[Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]] (1558–1603). Historians often depict it as the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history. The symbol of [[Britannia]] (a female personification of Great Britain) was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over the Spanish – at the time, a rival kingdom much hated by the people of the land. In terms of the entire century, the historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] (1988) argues that "England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the [[Tudors]]" than at any time in a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32 {{ISBN|0192852132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "golden age"&lt;ref&gt;From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C. S. Lewis]]; Lewis, ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century'' (Oxford, 1954) p. 1, {{OCLC|256072}}&lt;/ref&gt; represented the apogee of the [[English Renaissance]] and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]], as [[William Shakespeare]] and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the [[Protestant Reformation]] became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the [[Spanish Armada]] was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.

The Elizabethan Age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns.  It was a brief period of internal peace between the [[English Reformation]] and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics and then the political battles between [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.

England was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The [[Italian Renaissance]] had come to an end under the weight of Spanish domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in its own religious battles that were (temporarily) settled in 1598 by a policy of tolerating Protestantism with the [[Edict of Nantes]]. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent by Spain's [[tercios]], the centuries-long conflict between France and England was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign.

The one great rival was Spain, with whom England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1585–1604. An attempt by [[Philip II of Spain]] to invade England with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 was famously defeated, but the tide of war turned against England with an unsuccessful expedition to Portugal and the Azores, the [[English Armada|Drake-Norris Expedition of 1589]]. Thereafter, Spain provided some support for Irish Catholics in a debilitating rebellion against English rule, and Spanish naval and land forces inflicted a series of reversals against English offensives. This drained both the English Exchequer and economy that had been so carefully restored under Elizabeth's prudent guidance. English commercial and territorial expansion would be limited until the signing of the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London]] the year following Elizabeth's death.

England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], as well as Elizabeth's harsh punishments for any dissenters. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] trade and persistent theft of Spanish treasure.

==Romance and reality==
[[File:Elizabeth succession allegory.jpg|left|thumb|250px|'''Elizabeth ushers in Peace and Plenty'''. Detail from ''The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'', c. 1572, attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]].]]
The [[Victorian era]] and the early 20th century idealised the Elizabethan era. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' maintains that "[T]he long reign of Elizabeth I, 1558–1603, was England's Golden Age... '[[Merry England]]', in love with life, expressed itself in music and literature, in architecture and in adventurous seafaring".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061112031836/http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-200261 Elizabeth I and England's Golden Age]. Britannica Student Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; This idealising tendency was shared by Britain and an Anglophilic America. In popular culture, the image of those adventurous Elizabethan seafarers was embodied in the films of [[Errol Flynn]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;

In response and reaction to this hyperbole, modern historians and biographers have tended to take a more dispassionate view of the Tudor period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Patrick Collinson|title=Elizabeth I and the verdicts of history|journal=Historical Research|year=2003|volume=76 |issue =194|pages=469–91|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.00186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Elizabethan England was not particularly successful in a military sense during the period, but it avoided major defeats and built up a powerful navy. On balance, it can be said that Elizabeth provided the country with a long period of general if not total peace and generally increased prosperity due in large part to stealing from Spanish treasure ships, raiding settlements with low defenses, and selling African slaves. Having inherited a virtually bankrupt state from previous reigns, her frugal policies restored fiscal responsibility. Her fiscal restraint cleared the regime of debt by 1574, and ten years later the Crown enjoyed a surplus of £300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa D. Aaron, ''Global Economics'' (2005), p. 25. In the later decades of the reign, the costs of warfare — defeating the [[English Armada]] of 1589 and funding the campaigns in the Netherlands — obliterated the surplus; England had a debt of £350,000 at Elizabeth's death in 1603.&lt;/ref&gt; Economically, [[Sir Thomas Gresham]]'s founding of the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] (1565), the first stock exchange in England and one of the earliest in Europe, proved to be a development of the first importance, for the economic development of England and soon for the world as a whole. With taxes lower than other European countries of the period, the economy expanded; though the wealth was distributed with wild unevenness, there was clearly more wealth to go around at the end of Elizabeth's reign than at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576–1642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 49–96 {{ISBN|0691064547}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This general peace and prosperity allowed the attractive developments that "Golden Age" advocates have stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hibbert (1991) ''The Virgin Queen: Elizabeth I, Genius of the Golden Age,'' Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0201608170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plots, intrigues and conspiracies===
The Elizabethan Age was also an age of plots and conspiracies, frequently political in nature, and often involving the highest levels of Elizabethan society. High officials in Madrid, Paris and Rome sought to kill Elizabeth, a Protestant, and replace her with [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], a Catholic. That would be a prelude to the religious recovery of England for Catholicism. In 1570, the [[Ridolfi plot]] was thwarted. In 1584, the [[Francis Throckmorton|Throckmorton Plot]] was discovered, after Francis Throckmorton confessed his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Queen and restore the Catholic Church in England. Another major [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] was the [[Babington Plot]] — the event which most directly led to Mary's execution, the discovery of which involved a [[double agent]], [[Gilbert Gifford]], acting under the direction of [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's highly effective spy master.

The [[Essex Rebellion]] of 1601 has a dramatic element, as just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]), paid for a performance of [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] at the [[Globe Theatre]], apparently with the goal of stirring public ill will towards the monarchy.&lt;ref name="bate256"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Bate|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age|publisher=Penguin|location=London|year=2008|pages=256–286|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at the trial of Essex by [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Chamberlain's Men]] actor [[Augustine Phillips]], that the conspirators paid the company forty [[shilling]]s "above the ordinary" (i. e., above their usual rate) to stage the play, which the players felt was too old and "out of use" to attract a large audience.&lt;ref name="bate256" /&gt;

In the [[Bye Plot]] of 1603, two Catholic priests planned to kidnap King James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Most dramatic was the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]] to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. It was discovered in time with eight conspirators executed, including [[Guy Fawkes]], who became the iconic evil traitor in English lore.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Sharpe (2005) ''Remember, Remember: A Cultural History of Guy Fawkes Day'', Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0674019350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy and defeat of the Armada===
[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Spanish Armada fighting the English navy at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]] in 1588.]]
While Henry VIII had launched the [[Royal Navy]], Edward and Mary had ignored it and it was little more than a system of coastal defense. Elizabeth made naval strength a high priority.&lt;ref&gt;Julian S. Corbett (1898) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qs0gAAAAMAAJ ''Drake and the Tudor Navy, With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power''] 2 vol.&lt;/ref&gt; She risked war with Spain by supporting the "[[Sea Dogs]]", such as [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on the Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The Navy yards were leaders in technical innovation, and the captains devised new tactics. Parker (1996) argues that the full-rigged ship was one of the greatest technological advances of the century and permanently transformed naval warfare. In 1573 English shipwrights introduced designs, first demonstrated in the "Dreadnaught", that allowed the ships to sail faster and maneuver better and permitted heavier guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=The 'Dreadnought' Revolution of Tudor England|journal=Mariner's Mirror|year=1996|volume=82 |issue =3|pages=269–300|doi=10.1080/00253359.1996.10656603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so that soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they stood off and fired broadsides that would sink the enemy vessel. When Spain finally decided to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco. Superior English ships and seamanship foiled the invasion and led to the destruction of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, marking the high point of Elizabeth's reign. Technically, the Armada failed because Spain's over-complex strategy required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. Moreover, the poor design of the Spanish cannons meant they were much slower in reloading in a close-range battle. Spain and France still had stronger fleets, but England was catching up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=Why the Armada Failed|journal=History Today|year=1888|volume=38 |issue =5|pages=26–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker has speculated on the dire consequences if the Spanish had landed their invasion army in 1588. He argues that the Spanish army was larger, more experienced, better-equipped, more confident, and had better financing. The English defenses, on the other hand, were thin and outdated; England had too few soldiers and they were at best only partially trained. Spain had chosen England's weakest link and probably could have captured London in a week. Parker adds that a Catholic uprising in the north and in Ireland could have brought total defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=If the Armada Had Landed|doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1976.tb01347.x|journal=History|year=1976|volume=61|issue =203|pages=358–368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonising the New World===
{{main|English colonial empire}}
The discoveries of Christopher Columbus electrified all of western Europe, especially maritime powers like England. King Henry VII commissioned [[John Cabot]] to lead a voyage to find a northern route to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of Asia; this began the search for the [[North West Passage]]. Cabot sailed in 1497 and reached [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Andrews (1984) ''Trade, Plunder and Settlement: Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480–1630'' (Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-27698-5}}) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He led another voyage to the Americas the following year, but nothing was heard of him or his ships again.&lt;ref&gt;[[Niall Ferguson]] (2004) ''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire'', Penguin Books, p. 4 {{ISBN|0143034790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1562 Elizabeth sent [[privateer]]s [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake|Drake]] to seize booty from Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas (1997) ''The Slave Trade: the History of the Atlantic Slave Trade'', Simon &amp; Schuster, pp. 155–158 {{ISBN|0684810638}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish Wars]] intensified after 1585, Elizabeth approved further raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and against shipping returning to Europe with treasure.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson (2004) ''Colossus: The Price of America's Empire'', Penguin Books, p. 7 {{ISBN|0143034790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the influential writers [[Richard Hakluyt]] and [[John Dee]] were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own overseas empire. Spain was well established in the Americas, while Portugal, in union with Spain from 1580, had an ambitious global empire in Africa, Asia and South America. France was exploring North America.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Owen Lloyd (1994) ''The British Empire 1558–1995'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-873134-5}}, pp. 4–8.&lt;/ref&gt; England was stimulated to create its own colonies, with an emphasis on the [[West Indies]] rather than in North America.

[[Martin Frobisher]] landed at [[Frobisher Bay]] on [[Baffin Island]] in August 1576; He returned in 1577, claiming it in Queen Elizabeth's name, and in a third voyage tried but failed to found a settlement in Frobisher Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |first=Alan |last=Cooke |title=Frobisher, Sir Martin |volume=1|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/frobisher_martin_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James McDermott (2001) ''Martin Frobisher: Elizabethan privateer'' (Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-08380-7}}) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YeMcPYIKNYUC&amp;pg=PA190 p. 190]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1590 or later Marcus Gheeraerts, Sir Francis Drake Buckland Abbey, Devon.jpg|thumb|200px|Sir Francis Drake]]
From 1577 to 1580, [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] circumnavigated the globe. Combined with his daring raids against the Spanish and his great victory over them at [[Battle of Cádiz (1587)|Cadiz in 1587]], he became a famous hero&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=John Cummins|title='That golden knight': Drake and his reputation|journal=History Today|year=1996|volume=46|issue =1 |pages=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Wathen (2009) ''Sir Francis Drake: The Construction of a Hero'', D.S.Brewer {{ISBN|184384186X}}&lt;/ref&gt;—his exploits are still celebrated—but England did not follow up on his claims.&lt;ref&gt;John Sugden (1990) ''Sir Francis Drake'', Random House, p. 118 {{ISBN|1448129508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1583, [[Humphrey Gilbert]] sailed to Newfoundland, taking possession of the harbour of [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St John's]] together with all land within two hundred [[League (unit)|leagues]] to the north and south of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Gilbert, Sir Humphrey |first=David B. |last=Quinn |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/gilbert_humphrey_1E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1584, the queen granted [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] a charter for the colonisation of [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]]; it was named in her honour. Raleigh and Elizabeth sought both immediate riches and a base for privateers to raid the Spanish treasure fleets. Raleigh sent others to found the [[Roanoke Colony]]; it remains a mystery why the settlers all disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Quinn (1985) ''Set fair for Roanoke: voyages and colonies, 1584–1606'', UNC Press Books, {{ISBN|0807841234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1600, the queen chartered the [[East India Company]]. It established trading posts, which in later centuries evolved into [[British India]], on the coasts of what is now India and [[Bangladesh]]. Larger scale colonisation began shortly after Elizabeth's death.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth R. Andrews (1985) ''Trade, Plunder, and Settlement: Maritime Enterprise and the Genesis of the British Empire, 1480–1630'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521276985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==
England in this era had some positive aspects that set it apart from contemporaneous continental European societies. Torture was rare, since the English legal system reserved torture only for capital crimes like treason&lt;ref&gt;George Macaulay Trevelyan (1949) ''England Under the Stuarts,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;—though forms of corporal punishment, some of them extreme, were practised. The persecution of witches began in 1563, and hundreds were executed, although there was nothing like the frenzy on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;With over 5% of Europe's population in 1600, England executed only 1% of the 40,000 witches killed in the period 1400–1800. {{cite journal|author= William Monter|title=Re-contextualizing British Witchcraft|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=35 |issue=1 |year=2004|pages=105–111 (106)|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_interdisciplinary_history/v035/35.1monter.html|doi= 10.1162/002219504323091252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary had tried her hand at an aggressive anti-Protestant Inquisition and was hated for it; it was not to be repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= John Edwards|title=A Spanish Inquisition? The Repression of Protestantism under Mary Tudor|journal=Reformation and Renaissance Review|year=2000|volume=4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Main|Tudor period#English Reformation}}
Elizabeth managed to moderate and quell the intense religious passions of the time. This was in significant contrast to previous and succeeding eras of marked religious violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Collinson|authorlink=Patrick Collinson|title=Elizabethans|publisher=Hambledon|location=London|year=2003|page=43|chapter=The Monarchical Republic of Queen Elizabeth I|isbn=978-1-85285-400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth said "I have no desire to make windows into mens' souls". Her desire to moderate the religious persecutions of previous Tudor reigns — the persecution of Catholics under Edward VI, and of Protestants under Mary I — appears to have had a moderating effect on English society. Elizabeth, Protestant, but undogmatic one, Christopher Haigh, English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993 p. 237 {{ISBN|978-0-19-822162-3}}, reinstated the 1552 Book of Common Prayer with modifications which made clear that the Church of England believed in the (spiritual) Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Communion but without a definition how in favor of leaving this a mystery, and she had the Black Rubric removed from the Articles of Faith: this had allowed kneeling to receive communion without implying that by doing so it meant the real and essential presence of Christ in the bread and wine: she believed it so. She was not able to get an unmarried clergy or the Protestant Holy Communion celebrated to look like a Mass,  Haigh, op. cit. p. 241. The Apostolic Succession was maintained, the institution of the church continued without a break (with 98% of the clergy remaining at their posts) and the attempt to ban music in church was defeated. The Injunctions of 1571 forbade any doctrines that did not conform to the teaching of the Church Fathers and the Catholic Bishops. The Queen's hostility to strict Calvinistic doctrines blocked the Radicals. Almost no original theological thought came out of the English Reformation: instead the Church relied on the Catholic Consensus of the first Four Ecumenical Councils.   The preservation of many Catholic doctrines and practices was the cuckoos nest that eventually resulted in the formation of the Via Media during the 17th century, Diarmaid MacCullough, The Later Reformation in England, 1547-1603, 2001, pp. 24-29 {{ISBN|0-333-69331-0}}, 'The cuckoo in the nest,' p. 64, 78-86; English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993, pp. 240-242, 29-295.  She spent the rest of her reign ferociously fending of radical reformers and Roman Catholics who wanted to modify the Settlement of Church affairs: The Church of England was Protestant, "with its peculiar arrested development in Protestant terms, and the ghost which it harboured of an older world of Catholic traditions and devotional practice," MacCullough, p. 85.           

For a number of years refrained from persecuting Catholics because she was against Catholicism, not her Catholic subjects if they made no trouble. In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] declared Elizabeth a heretic who was not the legitimate queen and that her subjects no longer owed her obedience. The pope sent Jesuits and seminarians to secretly evangelize and support Catholics. After several plots to overthrow her, Catholic clergy were mostly considered to be traitors, and were pursued aggressively in England. Often priests were tortured or executed after capture unless they cooperated with the English authorities. People who publicly supported Catholicism were excluded from the professions; sometimes fined or imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;J. B. Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth: 1558–1603'' (2nd ed. 1959) pp. 166–88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science, technology and exploration==
[[File:British - Francis Bacon - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francis Bacon]], pioneer of modern scientific thought.]]
Lacking a dominant genius or a formal structure for research (the following century had both Sir [[Isaac Newton]] and the [[Royal Society]]), the Elizabethan era nonetheless saw significant scientific progress. The astronomers [[Thomas Digges]] and [[Thomas Harriot]] made important contributions; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published his seminal study of magnetism, ''De Magnete,'' in 1600. Substantial advancements were made in the fields of cartography and surveying. The eccentric but influential [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] also merits mention.

Much of this scientific and technological progress related to the practical skill of navigation. English achievements in exploration were noteworthy in the Elizabethan era. Sir [[Francis Drake]] circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1581, and [[Martin Frobisher]] explored the [[Arctic]]. The first attempt at English settlement of the eastern seaboard of North America occurred in this era—the abortive colony at [[Roanoke Island]] in 1587.

While Elizabethan England is not thought of as an age of technological innovation, some progress did occur. In 1564 Guilliam Boonen came from the [[Netherlands]] to be Queen Elizabeth's first [[coach-builder]] —thus introducing the new European invention of the spring-suspension coach to England, as a replacement for the litters and carts of an earlier transportation mode. Coaches quickly became as fashionable as sports cars in a later century; social critics, especially [[Puritan]] commentators, noted the "diverse great ladies" who rode "up and down the countryside" in their new coaches.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576–1642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 81–82 {{ISBN|0691064547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians since the 1960s have explored many facets of the social history, covering every class of the population.&lt;ref&gt;On the social and demographic history see D. M. Palliser (1992) ''The Age of Elizabeth: England Under the Later Tudors, 1547–1603'' (2nd ed.), pp 35-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Although home to only a small part of the population the Tudor [[municipalities]] were overcrowded and unhygienic. Most towns were unpaved with poor public sanitation.  There were no [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] or drains,  and rubbish was simply abandoned in the street. Animals such as [[rat]]s thrived in these conditions. In larger towns and cities, such as London, common diseases arising from lack of sanitation included [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[malaria]], [[typhus]], [[diphtheria]], [[Scarlet fever]], and [[chickenpox]].&lt;ref name="Life In Tudor Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/tudor.html |title=Life In Tudor Times |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outbreaks of the [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] occurred in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589 and 1603. The reason for the speedy spread of the disease was the increase of rats infected by fleas carrying the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_salisbury.shtml |title=Spread of the Plague |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child mortality was low in comparison with earlier and later periods, at about 150 or fewer deaths per 1000 babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce M. S.

===Homes and dwelling===
The great majority were tenant farmers who lived in small villages. Their homes were, as in earlier centuries, [[thatched]] huts with one or two rooms, although later on during this period, roofs were also tiled. Furniture was basic, with stools being commonplace rather than chairs.&lt;ref name="Life In Tudor Times"/&gt; The walls of Tudor houses were often made from timber and [[wattle and daub]], or brick; stone and [[tiles]] were more common in the wealthier homes. The daub was usually then painted with [[limewash]], making it white, and the wood was painted with black [[tar]] to prevent rotting, but not in Tudor times; the Victorians did this afterwards. The bricks were handmade and thinner than modern bricks. The wooden beams were cut by hand, which makes telling the difference between Tudor houses and Tudor-style houses easy, as the original beams are not straight. The upper floors of Tudor houses were often larger than the ground floors, which would create an overhang (or [[jettying|jetty]]). This would create more floor-surface above while also keeping maximum street width. During the Tudor period, the use of glass when building houses was first used, and became widespread. It was very expensive and difficult to make, so the panes were made small and held together with a lead lattice, in [[casement windows]]. People who could not afford glass often used polished horn, cloth or paper. Tudor chimneys were tall, thin, and often decorated with symmetrical patterns of molded or cut brick. Early Tudor houses, and the homes of poorer people, did not have chimneys. The smoke in these cases would be let out through a simple hole in the roof.

[[Mansions]] had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm. These fires were also the only way of cooking food. Wealthy Tudor homes needed many rooms, where a large number of guests and [[servants]] could be accommodated, fed and entertained. Wealth was demonstrated by the extensive use of glass. Windows became the main feature of Tudor mansions, and were often a fashion statement. Mansions were often designed to a symmetrical plan; "E" and "H" shapes were popular.&lt;ref name="Tudor Houses"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |title=Tudor Houses |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510202040/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |archivedate=10 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===
{{Main article|Poor Law}}
[[File:Vagrant being punished in the streets (Tudor England).jpg|thumb|240px|A woodcut from circa 1536 depicting a vagrant being punished in the streets in Tudor England.]]

About one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give [[alms]] to assist the [[impotent poor]].&lt;ref&gt;John F. Pound, ''Poverty and vagrancy in Tudor England'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Tudor law was harsh on the [[able-bodied poor]], i.e., those unable to find work. Those who left their [[parishes]] in order to locate work were termed [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]]s and could be subjected to punishments, including whipping and putting at the stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUDpoverty.htm |title=Poverty in Tudor Times |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122075943/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUDpoverty.htm |archivedate=22 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Slack, ''Poverty and policy in Tudor and Stuart England'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the [[workhouse]] for the able-bodied poor was first suggested in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] (1999), ''Britain since 1789: A Concise History''. La Nuova Italia Scientifica, Roma.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

There was an unprecedented expansion of education in the Tudor period. Until then, few children went to school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Simon|title=Education and Society in Tudor England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yymAz-8W77gC&amp;pg=PAvii|year=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that did go were mainly the sons of wealthy or ambitious fathers who could afford to pay the attendance fee. Boys were allowed to go to school and began at the age of 4, they then moved to [[grammar school]] when they were 7 years old. Girls were either kept at home by their parents to help with housework or sent out to work to bring money in for the family. They were not sent to school. Boys were educated for work and the girls for marriage and running a household so when they married they could look after the house and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alison Sim|title=The Tudor Housewife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3qYAiZVJHoC&amp;pg=PA29|year= 2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|pages=29–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wealthy families hired a tutor to teach the boys at home. Many Tudor towns and villages had a parish school where the local vicar taught boys to read and write. Brothers could teach their sisters these skills. At school, pupils were taught English, Latin, Greek, catechism and arithmetic. The pupils practised writing in ink by copying the alphabet and the [[Lord's Prayer]]. There were few books, so pupils read from [[hornbooks]] instead. These wooden boards had the alphabet, prayers or other writings pinned to them and were covered with a thin layer of transparent cow's horn. There were two types of school in Tudor times: petty school was where young boys were taught to read and write; grammar school was where abler boys were taught English and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;William Nelson, "The Teaching of English in Tudor Grammar Schools," ''Studies in Philology'' (1952) 49#2 pp. 119-143 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4173010 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; It was usual for students to attend six days a week. The school day started at 7:00 am in winter and 6:00 am in summer and finished about 5:00 pm. Petty schools had shorter hours, mostly to allow poorer boys the opportunity to work as well. Schools were harsh and teachers were very strict, often beating pupils who misbehaved.&lt;ref&gt;David Cressy, "Educational Opportunity in Tudor and Stuart England." ''History of Education Quarterly'' (1976): 301-320. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/368112 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Education would begin at home, where children were taught the basic etiquette of proper manners and respecting others.&lt;ref name =Pearson&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee E. Pearson|title=Elizabethans at home|year=1957|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-0494-5|pages=140–41|chapter=Education of children}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was necessary for boys to attend [[Grammar school (United Kingdom)|grammar school]], but girls were rarely allowed in any place of education other than petty schools, and then only with a restricted curriculum.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt; Petty schools were for all children aged from 5 to 7 years of age. Only the most wealthy people allowed their daughters to be taught, and only at home. During this time, endowed schooling became available. This meant that even boys of very poor families were able to attend school if they were not needed to work at home, but only in a few localities were funds available to provide support as well as the necessary education scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Simon|title=Education and Society in Tudor England|year=1966|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-521-22854-1|page=373}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boys from wealthy families were taught at home by a private tutor. When Henry VIII shut the monasteries he closed their schools. He refounded many former monastic schools—they are known as "King's schools" and are found all over England. During the reign of Edward VI many free grammar schools were set up to take in non-fee paying students. There were two universities in Tudor England: [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Some boys went to university at the age of about 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/tudors/schools.htm |title=Tudor Schools |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618131251/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/homework/tudors/schools.htm |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
England's food supply was plentiful throughout most of the reign; there were no famines. Bad harvests caused distress, but they were usually localized. The most widespread came in 1555–57 and 1596–98.&lt;ref&gt;John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, pp. 30–31 {{ISBN|0192852132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the towns the price of staples was fixed by law; in hard times the size of the loaf of bread sold by the baker was smaller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. H. Britnell |title=Price-setting in English borough markets, 1349–1500 |journal=Canadian Journal of History |year=1996 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi= |url=https://www.usask.ca/history/cjh/e/iss/text/96/brit_496.shtml |issn=0008-4107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor consumed a diet largely of bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just arriving at the end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. G. Emmison|Emmison, F. G.]] (1976) ''Elizabethan Life: Home, Work and Land'', Essex Record Office, v. 3, pp. 29–31 {{ISBN|090036047X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a somewhat higher social level families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens, and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some grew their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbors to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Singman (1995) ''Daily Life in Elizabethan England'', Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 133–36 {{ISBN|031329335X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England was exposed to new foods (such as the [[potato]] imported from South America), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Thirsk (2006) ''Food in Early Modern England: Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500–1760'', Continuum, {{ISBN|0826442331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. The upper classes often celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of the king or queen. Feasts were commonly used to commemorate the "procession" of the crowned heads of state in the summer months, when the king or queen would travel through a circuit of other nobles' lands both to avoid the plague season of London, and alleviate the royal coffers, often drained through the winter to provide for the needs of the royal family and court. This would include a few days or even a week of feasting in each noble's home, who depending on his or her production and display of fashion, generosity and entertainment, could have his way made in court and elevate his or her status for months or even years.

Special courses after a feast or dinner which often involved a special room or outdoor gazebo (sometimes known as a folly) with a central table set with dainties of "medicinal" value to help with digestion. These would include wafers, comfits of sugar-spun anise or other spices, jellies and marmalades (a firmer variety than we are used to, these would be more similar to our gelatin jigglers), candied fruits, spiced nuts and other such niceties. These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. One must remember that sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though it could be as everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body. It also, of course, allowed those standing to show off their gorgeous new clothes and the holders of the dinner and banquet to show off the wealth of their estate, what with having a special room just for banqueting.


===Gender===
[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait..jpg|thumb|250px|''The Procession Picture'', c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]
While the Tudor era presents an abundance of material on the women of the nobility—especially royal wives and queens—historians have recovered scant documentation about the average lives of women. There has, however, been extensive statistical analysis of demographic and population data which includes women, especially in their childbearing roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Minna F. Weinstein|title=Reconstructing Our Past: Reflections on Tudor Women|journal=International Journal of Women's Studies|year= 1978|volume=1 |issue =2|pages=133–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The role of women in society was, for the historical era, relatively unconstrained; Spanish and Italian visitors to England commented regularly, and sometimes caustically, on the freedom that women enjoyed in England, in contrast to their home cultures. England had more well-educated upper class women than was common anywhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susan C. Shapiro |title=Feminists in Elizabethan England |journal=History Today |year=1977 |volume=27 |issue=11 |pages=703–711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce A. Youings (1984) ''Sixteenth-century England'', Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140222316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen's [[Elizabeth I of England#Marriage question|marital status]] was a major political and diplomatic topic. It also entered into the popular culture. Elizabeth's unmarried status inspired a cult of virginity. In poetry and portraiture, she was depicted as a virgin or a goddess or both, not as a normal woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=John N. King |title=Queen Elizabeth I: Representations of the Virgin Queen |journal=[[Renaissance Quarterly]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1990 |pages=30–74 |jstor=2861792 |doi=10.2307/2861792 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth made a virtue of her virginity: in 1559, she told the Commons, "And, in the end, this shall be for me sufficient, that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Haigh (2000) ''Elizabeth I'' (2nd ed.), Longman, p. 23 {{ISBN|0582472784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen's marriage negotiations with the Duc d'Alençon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susan Doran|title=Juno Versus Diana: The Treatment of Elizabeth I's Marriage in Plays and Entertainments, 1561–1581|journal=Historical Journal|volume=38 |year=1995|pages=257–274|jstor=2639984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to her father's emphasis on masculinity and physical prowess, Elizabeth emphasized the maternalism theme, saying often that she was married to her kingdom and subjects. She explained "I keep the good will of all my husbands — my good people — for if they did not rest assured of some special love towards them, they would not readily yield me such good obedience,"&lt;ref&gt;Agnes Strickland, ''The life of Queen Elizabeth'' (1910) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cF0NAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA424 p. 424]&lt;/ref&gt; and promised in 1563 they would never have a more natural mother than she.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Levin and Patricia Ann Sullivan (1995) ''Political rhetoric, power, and Renaissance women'', State Univ of New York p. 90 {{ISBN|0791425452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coch (1996) argues that her figurative motherhood played a central role in her complex self-representation, shaping and legitimating the personal rule of a divinely appointed female prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christine Coch|title='Mother of my Contreye': Elizabeth I and Tudor construction of Motherhood|journal=English Literary Renaissance|year=1996|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6757.1996.tb01506.x|volume=26 |issue =3|pages=423–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
Over ninety percent of English women (and adults, in general) entered [[marriage]] at the end of the 1500s and beginning of the 1600s, at an average age of about [[Western European marriage pattern|25–26 years for the bride]] and 27–28 years for the groom, with the most common ages being 25-26 for grooms and 23 for brides.&lt;ref&gt;David Cressy.

==High culture==

===Theatre===
[[File:London, UK (August 2014) - 156.JPG|thumb|A reconstruction of the [[Globe Theatre]] in London, originally built in 1599 and used by Shakespeare]]
{{main|English Renaissance theatre}}
With [[William Shakespeare]] at his peak, as well as [[Christopher Marlowe]] and many other playwrights, actors and theatres constantly busy, the high culture of the Elizabethan Renaissance was best expressed in its theatre. Historical topics were especially popular, not to mention the usual comedies and tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Bradbrook (1979) ''The Living Monument: Shakespeare and the Theatre of his Time'', Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521295300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Music in the Elizabethan era}}
Travelling musicians were in great demand at Court, in churches, at country houses, and at local festivals. Important composers included [[William Byrd]] (1543–1623), [[John Dowland]] (1563–1626) [[Thomas Campion]] (1567–1620), and [[Robert Johnson (English composer)|Robert Johnson]] (c. 1583–c. 1634). The composers were commissioned by church and Court, and deployed two main styles, [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]] and [[Air (music)|ayre]].&lt;ref&gt;Comegys Boyd (1973) ''Elizabethan music and musical criticism'', Greenwood Press {{ISBN|0837168058}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular culture showed a strong interest in folk songs and ballads (folk songs that tell a story). It became the fashion in the late 19th century to collect and sing the old songs.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Child Sargent and George Lyman Kittredge, eds. (1904) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YRNFAAAAYAAJ ''English and Scottish popular ballads: edited from the collection of Francis James Child'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine arts===
{{Main|Portraiture of Elizabeth I|Artists of the Tudor court}}

It has often been said that the Renaissance came late to England, in contrast to Italy and the other states of continental Europe; the fine arts in England during the Tudor and Stuart eras were dominated by foreign and imported talent—from [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] under Henry VIII to [[Anthony van Dyck]] under Charles I. Yet within this general trend, a native school of painting was developing. In Elizabeth's reign, [[Nicholas Hilliard]], the Queen's "limner and goldsmith," is the most widely recognized figure in this native development; but [[George Gower]] has begun to attract greater notice and appreciation as knowledge of him and his art and career has improved.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Waterhouse (1978) ''Painting in Britain: 1530–1790,'' 4th ed., New York, Viking Penguin, pp. 34–39 {{ISBN|0300058322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
===Pastimes===
{{Main|Elizabethan leisure}}
The Annual Summer [[Fair]] and other seasonal fairs such as May Day were often bawdy affairs. 

Watching plays became very popular during the Tudor period.  Most towns sponsored plays enacted in town squares followed by the actors using the courtyards of taverns or inns (referred to as Inn-yards) followed by the first theatres (great open air amphitheatres and then the introduction of indoor theatres called Playhouses.)   This popularity was helped by the rise of great playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] using London theatres such as the [[Globe Theatre]]. By 1595, 15,000 people a week were watching plays in London. It was during Elizabeth's reign that the first real theatres were built in England. Before theatres were built, actors travelled from town to town and performed in the streets or outside inns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/tudors/entertainment.html |title=Tudor Entertainment |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618130140/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/homework/tudors/entertainment.html |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Miracle plays were local re-enactments of stories from the Bible. They derived from the old custom of [[Mystery Play]]s, in which stories and fables were enacted to teach lessons or educate about life in general.  They influenced Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theresa Coletti |title=The Chester Cycle in Sixteenth-Century Religious Culture |journal=Journal of Medieval &amp; Early Modern Studies |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=531–547 |doi=10.1215/10829636-2007-012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festivals were popular seasonal entertainments&lt;ref&gt;François Laroque (1993) ''Shakespeare's festive world: Elizabethan seasonal entertainment and the professional stage'', Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0521457866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports ===
There were many different types of Elizabethan sports and entertainment. Animal sports included [[bear baiting|bear]] and [[bull baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cock fighting]].

The rich enjoyed [[tennis]], [[fencing]], and [[jousting]]. Hunting was strictly limuited to the upper class. They favoured their packs of dogs and hounds trained to chase foxes, hares and boars. The rich also enjoyed hunting small game and birds with hawks, known as [[falconry]].  

====Jousting====
Jousting was an upscale, very expensive sport where warriors on horseback raced toward each other in full armor trying to use their lance to knock the other off his horse. It was a violent sport--[[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] of France was killed in a tournament in 1559, as were many lesser men. King Henry VIII was a champion; he finally retired from the lists after a hard fall left him unconscious for hours.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Barber and Juliet Barker,  ''Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages'' (Boydell Press, 1998) {{ISBN|0851157815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sports included archery, bowling, hammer-throwing, quarter-staff contests, [[troco]], [[quoits]], [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], wrestling and [[mob football]].

====Gambling and card games====
Dice was a popular activity in all social classes.  Cards appeared in Spain and Italy about 1370, but they probably came from Egypt. They began to spread throughout Europe and came into England around 1460. By the time of Elizabeth’s reign, gambling was a common sport. Cards were not played only by the upper class. Many of the lower classes had access to playing cards. The card suits tended to change over time. The first Italian and Spanish decks had the same suits: Swords, Batons/ Clubs, Cups, and Coins. The suits often changed from country to country. England probably followed the Latin version, initially using cards imported from Spain but later relying on more convenient supplies from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daines Barrington|authorlink=Daines Barrington|title=Archaeologia, or, Miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity|volume=8|year=1787|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|location=London|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the decks that have survived use the French Suit: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Yet even before Elizabeth had begun to reign, the number of cards had been standardized to 52 cards per deck. The lowest court subject in England was called the “knave.” The lowest court card was therefore called the knave until later when the term “Jack” became more common. Popular card games included Maw, One and Thirty, Bone-ace. (These are all games for small group players.) Ruff and Honors was a team game.


===Festivals, holidays and celebrations===
[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - Festival at Bermondsey.png|right|thumb|300px|A wedding feast, c. 1569.]]

During the Elizabethan era, people looked forward to holidays because opportunities for leisure were limited, with time away from hard work being restricted to periods after church on Sundays. For the most part, leisure and festivities took place on a public church holy day. Every month had its own holiday, some of which are listed below:
*The first Monday after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] of January (any time between 7 January and 14 January) was [[Plough Monday]]. It celebrated returning to work after the Christmas celebrations and the New Year.
*2 February: [[Candlemas]]. Although often still very cold, Candlemas was celebrated as the first day of spring. All Christmas decorations were burned on this day, in candlelight and torchlight processions.
*14 February: [[Valentine's day|Valentine's Day]].
*Between 3 March and 9 March: [[Shrove Tuesday]] (known as [[Mardi Gras]] or Carnival on the Continent). On this day, apprentices were allowed to run amok in the city in mobs, wreaking havoc, because it supposedly cleansed the city of vices before [[Lent]]. &lt;br /&gt;The day after Shrove Tuesday was [[Ash Wednesday]], the first day of Lent when all were to abstain from eating and drinking certain things.&lt;br /&gt;24 March: [[Lady Day]] or the feast of the Annunciation, the first of the [[quarter days|Quarter Days]] on which rents and salaries were due and payable. It was a legal New Year when courts of law convened after a winter break, and it marked the supposed moment when the Angel [[Gabriel]] came to announce to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she would bear a child.
*1 May: [[May day|May Day]], celebrated as the first day of summer. This was one of the few Celtic festivals with no connection to Christianity and patterned on [[Beltane]]. It featured crowning a [[May Queen]], a [[green man|Green Man]] and dancing around a [[maypole]].
*21 June: [[Midsummer]], (Christianized as the feast of [[John the Baptist]]) and another Quarter Day.
*1 August: [[Lammas]]tide, or Lammas Day. Traditionally, the first day of August, in which it was customary to bring a loaf of bread to the church.
*29 September: [[Michaelmas]]. Another Quarter Day. Michaelmas celebrated the beginning of autumn, and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]].
*25 October: [[St. Crispin's Day]]. Bonfires, revels, and an elected 'King Crispin' were all featured in this celebration. Dramatized by Shakespeare in [[Henry V (play)|Henry V]].&lt;br/&gt;28 October: [[Lord Mayor's Show|The Lord Mayor's Show]], which still takes place today in London.&lt;br/&gt;31 October: [[All Hallows Eve]] or [[Halloween]]. The beginning celebration of the days of the dead.
*1 November: [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows]] or [[All Saints' Day]], followed by [[All Souls' Day]].
*17 November: [[Accession Day]] or Queen's Day, the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession to the throne, celebrated with lavish [[Accession Day tilt|court festivities featuring jousting]] during her lifetime and as a national holiday for dozens of years after her death.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton 1994, p. 146–151&lt;/ref&gt;
*24 December: The [[Twelve days of Christmas]] started at sundown and lasted until [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] on 6 January. Christmas was the last of the Quarter Days for the year.

'''Eugene Henry DeBruin''' (April 1, 1933 &amp;ndash; c. 1968) was a [[US Air Force]] [[Staff Sergeant#United States|staff sergeant]], and a member of [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] serving in [[Laos]] during the [[Vietnam War|Second Indochina War]].  "Gene" DeBruin was working as a "kicker" for Air America in 1963 when his [[C-46]] was shot down. He was a [[POW]] at a [[Pathet Lao]] prison camp in Laos until he and other prisoners attempted to escape. After this, there is [[POW/MIA|little known]] about DeBruin's whereabouts.

==Biography==

===Early life and military career===
Eugene DeBruin was the second eldest of ten children that grew up in a [[Wisconsin]] farm. While growing up, DeBruin became interested in outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing and skiing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

After graduating from high school, DeBruin joined the [[US Air Force]] in 1952. He served four years, mostly in Japan, as an aircraft mechanic reaching the rank of [[Staff Sergeant#United States|staff sergeant]]. During that time, he also obtained a private pilot license. He practiced [[judo]] during his time in Japan.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

After being discharged from the Air Force, DeBruin enrolled at the [[University of Montana]] at [[Missoula, Montana]] obtaining a degree in forestry. He then worked as a "[[Smokejumper]]" for three years in [[Alaska]]. DeBruin then moved to Mexico to learn Spanish with the intent of becoming a writer.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AirAmericaCIALogo.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Air America Logo]] --&gt;

After declining to join the [[Peace Corps]],{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} DeBruin volunteered as a "kicker" with Air America. His job was to kick the pallets of rice and other food out of an airplane to aid Lao refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his brother, he had plans of joining the [[Peace Corps]] after he finished his stint with [[Air America (airline)|Air America]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!--All of this indicates he was not a member of the military when working with Air America.--&gt;

===Capture and first escape attempt===
On September 5, 1963, during one of his flights over Laos, DeBruin's [[C-46]] cargo airliner was shot down by ground fire.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; He took off on a mission with fellow [[United States|Americans]], [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=69444105&amp;PIpi=85988325|Joseph C. Cheney] and [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7622220|Charles Charles Herrick], Thai [[Pisidhi Indradat]], Prasit Promsuwan and Prasit Thanee, and Chinese Y.C. To. He crashed about 2 kilometers from [[Tchepone]] in [[Savannakhet Province]]. DeBruin, Y.C. To, and the three Thai nationals parachuted to safety, but were immediately captured by the [[Pathet Lao]]. Cheney and Herrick were killed in the crash.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

After his capture, DeBruin was moved to four different prisons, together with the other four prisoners. In May 1964, they managed to escape for three days, but were caught at a watering hole.

====Second escape attempt====
After that failed attempt, DeBruin attempted a second escape. The other six prisoners who worked together for this second attempt were:
*[[Pisidhi Indradat]] (Thai)
*[[Prasit Promsuwan]] (Thai)
*[[Prasit Thanee]] (Thai)
*[[Y.C. To]] (Chinese)
*[[Duane W. Martin]] (American)
*[[Dieter Dengler]] (American)

Dengler was the last to arrive at the POW camp, and was initially distrusted by the other prisoners as they thought he might be an informant.&lt;ref name=Dietervid&gt;[http://www.rescuedawnthetruth.com/ Dieter on Gene Debruin video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000000/http://www.rescuedawnthetruth.com/ |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the prisoners advised Dengler of their past escape attempts.&lt;ref name=Dietervid /&gt;

On June 29, 1966, while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand and foot restraints and grabbed the guards' unattended [[submachine guns]]. The Pathet Lao guards spotted some of the other prisoners trying to escape. A shootout between the two sides ensued and Dengler and [[Pisidhi Indradat|Indradat]] ended up killing five guards so the others could escape.  Two others ran off, presumably to get help.  The seven prisoners split into three groups: Indradat, and the other Thai prisoners; DeBruin stayed with To, who had been too ill to continue with the escape; and Dengler and Martin headed for the [[Mekong River]] to escape to Thailand. Martin was killed by a Laotian villager, while Dengler was rescued after 23 days in the jungle. Indradat was also rescued later.

===Later life===
Of the seven prisoners that attempted to escape, only two reached safety (Dengler and Indradat). One report stated that DeBruin was killed in the escape attempt, but Indradat originally reported that he last saw DeBruin attempting to "reach high ground in a classified location".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In March 1971, the Central Intelligence Agency had [[reconnaissance]] Team Papaya/305 operating in the area of DeBruin's capture. Tasked with gathering [[military intelligence]] concerning DeBruin, it returned a report that the CIA's case handler thought truthful:&lt;ref name=briggs210&gt;Briggs, pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eugene Henry DeBruin arrived at [[Muong Phine]] ([[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|XD 0927]]) in late 1966. On or about 3 January 1967 DeBruin was taken from Muong Phine and arrived at [[Muong Nong]] ([[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|XD 6010]]) on or about 5 January 1967. The Muong Nong prison contained only eight other Americans at this time. While in Muong Nong, DeBruin was strictly guarded by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] and he suffered very much. The North Vietnamese Army did not torture him but kept him imprisoned and gave him propaganda lectures. Pathet Lao General Khamkong and North Vietnamese Army General Tao, who speaks English, were the only high ranking officers to interview him. The North Vietnamese Army often displayed anger toward the prisoners because of the U.S. bombing in their area. DeBruin was allowed to eat his meals with, and talk to the other Americans but the villages had no knowledge whether he ever received letters or packages. DeBruin never escaped from Muong Phine or Muong Nong, because he was strictly guarded. In early January 1968 Ong Lui and six North Vietnamese Army soldiers took DeBruin and eight other Americans away. The villagers did not know Ong Lui's rank and said he was not from that area, but probably came from [[North Vietnam|NVN]] to get the prisoners. The villagers were told only that DeBruin and the others were being taken away for training. End of report.&lt;ref name=briggs210/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case agent's superiors in the CIA disbelieved the report, as did the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name=briggs210/&gt;

DeBruin's brother, Jerome DeBruin, traveled to [[Laos]] in 1972 in search of information. Although the Pathet Lao admitted holding American prisoners of war, they insisted that the [[United States]] negotiate directly with them to ensure their release, but this never happened.

==Eugene DeBruin in film==
Eugene DeBruin was portrayed by [[Jeremy Davies (actor)|Jeremy Davies]] in [[Werner Herzog]]'s 2007 film ''[[Rescue Dawn]]''. The film focuses mostly on [[Dieter Dengler]]'s life as told to Herzog by Dengler himself, but has been severely criticized by members of the family of DeBruin and [[Pisidhi Indradat|Indradat]], the other survivor of the group, for portraying DeBruin as a selfish and unstable prisoner who threatened to betray his fellow prisoners at any time, and who, at the time of their escape, did not know what to do.&lt;ref name="rescuedawnthetruth"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rescuedawnthetruth.com | title = Rescue Dawn: The Truth | publisher = Family, Friends of Gene DeBruin Critical of Herzog Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog acknowledged that DeBruin acted heroically during his imprisonment, refusing to leave while some sick prisoners remained, but Herzog was unaware of this until after the film had been completed. Herzog states that this narrative aspect probably would have been included had he learned it earlier.&lt;ref name="dvd feature"&gt;Herzog, Werner, ''The Making of a True Story'', documentary feature on the American [[DVD]] release of ''Rescue Dawn''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Exhibition Road South Kensington.jpg|thumb|Exhibition Road following opening of [[shared space]] scheme during 2012.]]
'''Exhibition Road''' is a street in [[South Kensington]], [[London]] which is home to several major museums and academic establishments, including the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]].

== Overview ==
The road gets its name from [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851 which was held just inside [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] at the northern end of the road. It forms the central feature in an area known as [[Albertopolis]].

It provides access to many nationally significant institutions, including the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]], [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] (which incorporates the former [[Geological Museum]]), the [[Royal Geographical Society]], [[Imperial College London]] (directly and via [[Imperial College Road]]), [[Pepperdine University]] Abroad and [[Jagiellonian University]] Abroad. The London [[Goethe Institute]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] meeting house are also located on Exhibition Road.

== Shared space ==
A design competition for plans of how to improve the street's design to reflect its cultural importance was held in 2003 by the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]]. The competition was won by the architectural firm Dixon and Jones for a [[shared space]] scheme for the road and surrounding streets which would give pedestrians greater priority whilst still allow some vehicular traffic at a reduced speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Albertopolis: 2012 Map of Dixon Jones scheme |url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/ExploringSouthKensington/SouthKensingtonFromAbove/2012Map.aspx |website=RIBA |accessdate=2010-12-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407022238/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Albertopolis/ExploringSouthKensington/SouthKensingtonFromAbove/2012Map.aspx |archivedate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''final''' of a [[Competition#Sports|competition]] is the match or round in which the winner of the entire event is decided.

In [[sport]]s competitions following a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] system, where only two individuals or teams compete in each match, the final is usually played between the winners of two [[semi-final]]s. However, if more than two entrants are required for each match, then qualification for the final may be through some other process such as winning ''heats''.

The final is usually, but not always, the last match in a tournament to be played, and the winner of this match is declared the winner of the whole tournament. In many contests, the winner(s) and runner(s)-up receive [[Gold medal|gold]] and [[Silver medal|silver]] medals respectively. Another game, or competition, between the two players who lost in the semi-finals is done to determine who receives the [[bronze medal]]. Unusually, many teams (32 in recent years) qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals. These teams then play each other in various formats until the ultimate two 'finalists' play off for the gold and silver medals.

If the final round is contested in a "best-of" format (like "best-of-7"), the term is sometimes called "finals," ([[playoffs]]) to denote that there is more than one game (like "the [[NBA Finals]]")  The [[Stanley Cup]] Final has been referred to in the singular since the 2005-06 season.  However, it refers to its semi-final round as the Conference Finals, because there are two separate ones being contested.

The '''Finnish Rally Championship''' is the national [[Rallying|rally]] championship in [[Finland]]. The series currently has four classes; '''Super4''' (including R5, S2000 and old WRC cars), '''Production4''' (including Group N cars), '''R2''' (including R2 and R1 cars) and '''Super2''' (including other 2WD cars apart from R2 and R1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Finnish Rally Championship | work=Ralli SM | url=http://www.rallism.fi/content/en/1/10090/FRC.html | accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The series began in 1959 and featured four events; [[Hankiralli]], 500-ralli, Syysralli and the [[1000 Lakes Rally]]. Esko Keinänen and his co-driver Kai Nuortila took the title with a [[Peugeot 403]]. In 1970, Group 2 was introduced with [[Timo Mäkinen]] taking the first title. [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] championship was contested from 1976 to 1978. In the 1980s, [[Group A]] cars were allowed in Group 1, eventually replacing the older homologation entirely. Group 2 was replaced by [[Group N]] in 1987 and a new championship was created for [[Group B]] cars from 1983 to 1988. Group 4 entrants were allowed to participate in the Group B championship in 1983 and 1984. In the late 1980s, groups A and N were divided into over and under 2000 cc classes, creating the new groups "a" and "n". In addition to the usual classes, the Finnish Rally Championship for Ladies has been contested from 1971 to 1978 and from 1986 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Finnish Rally Championship for Drivers – Champions | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=championlist&amp;subchamptype=find | accessdate=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Money Week (GMW)''' is a global money awareness celebration that takes place in March every year.&lt;ref name="newsandevents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=Global Money Week|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is coordinated by the [[Child and Youth Finance International]] (CYFI) Secretariat to raise awareness on [[Economic Citizenship]] and directly engage children and youth worldwide on the issue. The celebration of Global Money Week consists of a series of activities held at the regional, national and local level by the partners and stakeholders of the Child and Youth Finance Movement, and are geared toward engaging children, youth and their communities in learning about financial education and financial inclusion.&lt;ref name="newsandevents" /&gt;

According to the Global Money Week website, “GMW is an annual global celebration, initiated by Child &amp; Youth Finance International (CYFI), with local and regional events and activities aimed at inspiring children and youth to learn about money, saving, creating livelihoods, gaining employment and becoming an entrepreneur.” &lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GMW in previous years==
In 2013, GMW involved approximately 1 million children in 80 countries ranging across Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Over 1000 activities were organized by 403 organizations, such as NGOs, central banks, Ministries of Finance, corporations and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/global_money_week_report_2013/1?e=7128000/2518812|title=Global Money Week Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMW 2014 saw the participation of 3 million children, 118 countries, over 2000 activities and 490 organizations involved in the theme of enterprise: among those, central banks, governmental bodies, educational institutions.&lt;ref name="globalmoneyweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalmoneyweek.org/civil-society |title=Civil Society |publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 event saw a number of multi-sectoral organizations working together for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/2014_gmw_report_2014_8589ec3f401824|title=Global Money Week Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ISSUU.com|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During GMW 2015 the theme was, “Save Today, Safe Tomorrow.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2015/1?e=7128000/14165258|title=Global Money Week Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|format=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 5.6 million children &amp; youth took part in the celebrations in 124 countries.

In 2016, GMW expanded even further, reaching over 7 million children and young people across 132 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2016/1?e=7128000/38177764|title=Global Money Week Report 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ever increasing number of countries and organizations were involved in supporting the millions of young people taking part in money awareness, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship activities during the 2016 Global Money Week celebrations, which focused on the theme 'Take Part, Save Smart'.

The 2017 edition of GMW will take place from 27 March - 2 April, with the theme 'Learn Save Earn':
* Learn: Educating children and young people about their social and economic rights and responsibilities is key to creating a generation of capable adults who can make wise decisions for their future
* Save: It is important for children and youth to build clever savings habits from an early age in order to cultivate key money-managing skills for later in life
* Earn: Developing livelihoods skills or receiving entrepreneurial training supports children and young people with getting a job or building their own business and developing their careers.

'''''I Love Hip Hop in Morocco''''' is a 2007 film by Josh Asen who decided to film hip hop in Morocco with his friend Jennifer Needle. While interviewing Moroccan hip hop artists, they told him that they needed concerts to promote their music. Asen managed to get the U.S. Embassy and Coca-Cola to sponsor a music festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/15635/Hip_to_HipHop__in_Morocco/ |title=Hip to Hip-Hop ... in Morocco |date=March 20, 2008 |work=Jewish Exponent |accessdate=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups of musicians started the country's first hip hop tour in three Moroccan cities - [[Meknes]], [[Marrakesh]], and [[Casablanca]]. The three concerts brought in thousands of audience members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ucriverside.academia.edu/OykuPotuogluCook/Papers/1197979/_I_Love_Hip_Hop_in_Morocco._Film_Video_._Josh_Ansen_and_Jennifer_Needleman._Anthropology_Review_Database_January_28th_2011_ |title="I Love Hip Hop in Morocco."

The film ended up as a  2007 documentary about the musicians' struggles and what it is like to rap in a Muslim country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rock the Casbah: Rage and Rebellion Across the Islamic World |last=Wright |first=Robin |year=2011 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4391-0316-6 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=numqfH3FgY8C&amp;pg=PA121 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary mainly focuses on DJ Key, H-Kayne, Bigg, Fati Show, and the hip hop group Fnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-234308692/love-hip-hop-morocco.html |title=I Love Hip Hop in Morocco.(Masizakhe: Building Each Other)(Brief article)(Video recording review) |author=Bill Baars |date=August 1, 2010 |work=Library Journal |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informa's oldest business started in 1734 when ''[[Lloyd's List]]'', now one of the world's oldest continuously running journals, began covering London shipping news.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/home/about.htm |title=Lloyd's List |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223191107/http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/home/about.htm |archivedate=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informa itself was created in 1998 by the merger of IBC Group plc and LLP Group plc. Since then Informa has expanded considerably, including a 2004 merger with the publishing company Taylor &amp; Francis and a 2005 acquisition of IIR Holdings, a human capital development company, for £768&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=ForbesRoundup&gt;{{cite news |title=ROUNDUP Informa names new chairman, CEO after FY profits soar |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/03/14/afx3514841.html |work=Forbes |date=14 March 2007 |accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2007"&gt;{{cite news |title=T&amp;F Informa buys conferences group Institute for International Research for 768 mln stg |url=https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2005/06/01/afx2068249.html |work=Forbes |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=31 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121012535/http://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2005/06/01/afx2068249.html|archivedate=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, the company was approached by [[Springer Science and Business Media]] in a takeover bid,&lt;ref name="Kundnani2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hans |last=Kundnani |title=Springer Science &amp; Business Media launches bid for Informa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/oct/19/privateequity.pressandpublishing |work=The Guardian |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in early November the Informa board rejected the 630p per share offer as too low.&lt;ref name="Ref_2006"&gt;{{cite news |title=Informa rejects Springer bid |url=https://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2006/11/03/afx3144026.html |work=AFX News Limited |date=3 November 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, chairman Richard Hooper announced his retirement in May and, after consulting with major shareholders, the company moved chief executive Peter Rigby to chairman, and managing director David Gilbertson to Rigby's former post. Informa explained Rigby's move by the need to maintain management stability, although it generated some controversy because it did not follow the advice of the UK's Combined Code on [[Corporate Governance]].&lt;ref name=ForbesRoundup/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2006a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Informa unveils new CEO, chairman as 2006 results top forecasts |url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/03/14/afx3514395.html |work=Forbes |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2008, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' revealed that [[United Business Media]] (UBM) had proposed a merger with Informa to create a media group worth over £3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="Harrington2008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Harrington |author2=Kleinman, Mark |title=Media giants United Business Media and Informa open talks on £3bn merger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2008/06/08/cnubm108.xml |work=The Sunday Telegraph |date=8 June 2008 |accessdate=8 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The talks were confirmed by Informa in a press release that same day, but described as "preliminary".&lt;ref name="Ref_2008"&gt;{{cite news |title=Statement Regarding Press Speculation |url=http://www.informa.com/about/Press_Releases/2008/statement_regarding_press_speculation/statement_regarding_press_speculation2 |publisher=Informa |date=8 June 2008 |accessdate=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2008a"&gt;{{cite news |title=UBM and Informa confirm merger talks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/09/mediabusiness.unitedbusinessmedia?INTCMP=SRCH |work=The Guardian |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=18 July 2013 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously on 13 May ''[[The Times]]'' had reported that the [[Carlyle Group]] and [[Apax Partners]] were considering bidding for the company.&lt;ref name="Andrews2008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amanda |last=Andrews |author2=Kennedy, Siobhan |title=Informa garners attention of private equity |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3919555.ece |work=The Times |date=13 May 2008 |accessdate=8 June 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 June talks with UBM ended because of the rapid rise in Informa's stock price after the public disclosure of the potential merger.&lt;ref name="Arnott2008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Arnott |title=Cash approach for Informa as merger talks end with UBM |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/cash-approach-for-informa-as-merger-talks-end-with-ubm-849295.html |work=The Independent |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June a private equity consortium consisting of [[Providence Equity Partners]], the [[Carlyle Group]] and [[Hellman &amp; Friedman]] proposed a takeover bid offering 506 pence per share.&lt;ref name="Thiel2008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Thiel |author2=Sabine Pirone |title=Informa Rises on $4.29 Billion Private-Equity Offer |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=aSRNcFwXy3qw&amp;refer=uk |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Informa acquired the assets of Elsevier Business Intelligence (EBI) from [[Reed Elsevier]]. The EBI business unit includes such publications as The Pink Sheet, The Gray Sheet, IN VIVO, Start-Up, and the Strategic Transactions database along with a series of notable conferences. The EBI assets combined with Scrip, Datamonitor and several other publications formed the newly created Pharma Intelligence division of Informa Business Information.&lt;ref name="InformaEBI2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/Informa-Acquires-Elsevier-Business-Intelligence-93697.asp |title=Informa Acquires Elsevier Business Intelligence |date=9 December 2013 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10108">'''Intimidation''' (also called '''cowing''') is  intentional behavior that "would cause a person of ordinary sensibilities" to fear [[injury]] or [[harm]]. It is not necessary to prove that the behavior was so violent as to cause mean [[wikt:terror|terror]] or that the victim was actually frightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/def/i064.htm|title=Legal Definition of Intimidate|website=www.lectlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Threat''', '''criminal threatening''' (or '''threatening behavior''') is the crime of intentionally or knowingly putting another person in fear of bodily injury. "[[Threat]] of harm generally involves a perception of injury...physical or mental damage...act or instance of injury, or a material and detriment or loss to a person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/t/threat-of-harm/|title=Threat of Harm Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A terroristic threat is a crime generally involving a threat to commit violence communicated with the intent to terrorize other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/t/terroristic-threat/|title=Terroristic Threat Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Intimidation" is the name of a criminal offense in several [[U.S. state]]s.

==Description==
Threatening behaviors may be conceptualized as a maladaptive outgrowth of normal competitive urge for interrelational [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] generally seen in animals. Alternatively, intimidation may result from the type of society in which individuals are socialized, as human beings are generally reluctant to engage in confrontation or threaten violence.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Violence: A Micro-sociological Theory (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all behavioral traits, it exists in greater or lesser manifestation in each individual person over time, but may be a more significant "compensatory behavior" for some as opposed to others. Behavioral theorists often see threatening behaviours as a consequence of being threatened by others, including parents, [[teacher|authority figures]], playmates and siblings. "Use of force is justified when a person reasonably believes that it is necessary for the defense of oneself or another against the immediate use of unlawful force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/def/d030.htm|title=Legal Definition of Self-Defense Defense|website=www.lectlaw.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimidation may be employed consciously or unconsciously, and a percentage of people who employ it consciously may do so as the result of selfishly rationalized notions of its appropriation, utility or self-[[empowerment]]. Intimidation related to [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] may include conduct "which annoys, threatens, intimidates, alarms, or puts a person in fear of their safety...because of a belief or perception regarding such person's race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct."&lt;ref name = harassment&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/h/harassment/|title=Harassment Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimidation may be manifested in such manner as physical contacts, glowering countenance, [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]], [[verbal abuse]], making someone feel lower than you, purposeful [[embarrassment]] and/or actual physical assault. "Behavior may include, but is not limited to, epithets, derogatory comments or slurs and lewd propositions, assault, impeding or blocking movement, offensive touching or any physical interference with normal work or movement, and visual insults, such as derogatory posters or cartoons."&lt;ref name = harassment/&gt;

==As a criminal offense==

===United States===
"Intimidation" is the name of a criminal offense in several [[U.S. state]]s. The definitions of the crime of Intimidation differ by state.

In [[Montana]], Intimidation is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/45/5/45-5-203.htm|title=45-5-203. Intimidation.|first=Dale Matheson, Montana Legislative|last=Services|website=leg.mt.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

45-5-203. Intimidation. 
:(1) A person commits the offense of intimidation when, with the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, the person communicates to another, under circumstances that reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:
::(a) inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person;
::(b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or
::(c) commit any felony.
:(2) A person commits the offense of intimidation if the person knowingly communicates a threat or false report of a pending fire, explosion, or disaster that would endanger life or property.
:(3) A person convicted of the offense of intimidation shall be imprisoned in the state prison for any term not to exceed 10 years or be fined an amount not to exceed $50,000, or both.

Several states have a crime called "'''Ethnic intimidation'''". For instance, the law of the state of [[Michigan]] reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(koccjbzwql50hibj0nlh3355))/mileg.aspx?page=GetMCLDocument&amp;objectname=mcl-750-147b|title=Michigan Legislature - Section 750.147b|website=www.legislature.mi.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

750.147b Ethnic intimidation.

Sec. 147b.
:(1) A person is guilty of ethnic intimidation if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, does any of the following:
::(a) Causes physical contact with another person.
::(b) Damages, destroys, or defaces any real or personal property of another person.
::(c) Threatens, by word or act, to do an act described in subdivision (a) or (b), if there is reasonable cause to believe that an act described in subdivision (a) or (b) will occur.
:(2) Ethnic intimidation is a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or by a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.
:(3) Regardless of the existence or outcome of any criminal prosecution, a person who suffers injury to his or her person or damage to his or her property as a result of ethnic intimidation may bring a civil cause of action against the person who commits the offense to secure an injunction, actual damages, including damages for emotional distress, or other appropriate relief. A plaintiff who prevails in a civil action brought pursuant to this section may recover both of the following:
:(a) Damages in the amount of 3 times the actual damages described in this subsection or $2,000.00, whichever is greater.
:(b) Reasonable attorney fees and costs.

Crimes closely related to intimidation are [[menacing]], [[coercion]], terrorizing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17-a/title17-Asec210.html|title=Title 17-A, §210: Terrorizing|website=www.mainelegislature.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[assault]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The traditional [[common law]] definition of assault of putting the victim in fear/apprehension of harm is maintained in many states; in other states, assault is now defined as the contact itself, having replaced the traditional common law crime of [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. Further, in other states, assault may encompass both the threat and the contact. For more details, see the [[Assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] articles.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]], making criminal threats is a [[hybrid offence|wobbler]] and may be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony under California Penal Code 422.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=422-422.4|title=California Penal Code 422|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A felony criminal threat is a strike under California's [[Three-strikes law|three strikes law]].

==As a civil offense==

===United States===
Intimidation can also be a civil offense, in addition to a criminal offense, in some [[U.S. state]]s. For example, in Oregon a violation of the state criminal statute for intimidation results in a civil violation.&lt;ref name="Weblaws"&gt;Weblaws.org. "Civil action for intimidation." Oregonlaws.org. http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/30.198 (accessed October 13, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiff in the civil suit for intimidation may then secure remedies including an injunction or special and general damages.&lt;ref name="Weblaws"/&gt;

==Story==
{{main|List of Kamen Rider Blade characters}}
Ten thousand years ago, a massive battle known as the Battle Royal was fought by fifty-two Undead, each representing a species fighting for dominance over all others. The winner was the Human Undead, known as Category Two of Hearts, giving dominion of the Earth to humanity. In the present day, archaeologists discover the sealed Undead, and accidentally set them free. Thus, a new Battle Royal begins.

Having developed the Rider System, based on the Joker's ability to copy sealed Undead, the organization BOARD (Board Of Archaeological Research Department) equips two young men, who become Kamen Riders: Kazuma Kenzaki and Sakuya Tachibana fight together as [[list of Kamen Rider Blade characters#Kazuma Kenzaki|Kamen Rider Blade]] and [[list of Kamen Rider Blade characters#Sakuya Tachibana|Kamen Rider Garren]] to protect humans from Undead and seal them. Also fighting Undead is the mysterious [[list of Kamen Rider Blade characters#Hajime Aikawa|Chalice]], a Kamen Rider whose purpose is unknown. In addition, a young man struggles to free himself from the control of the sealed Undead powering his own Undead-made Rider System, fighting as [[list of Kamen Rider Blade characters#Mutsuki Kamijo|Kamen Rider Leangle]].

==Specials==
{{nihongo4|''Kamen Rider Blade: Blade vs. Blade''|仮面ライダー剣（ブレイド） ブレイドVSブレイド|Kamen Raidā Bureido: Bureido Buiesu Bureido}} is a Hyper Battle Video, wherein a Trial-series cyborg pretends to be Kenzaki and copies the Blay Rouzer, starting a fight with the real Kenzaki. During their battle, Tachibana and Mutsuki are unable to tell the two apart, which results in their humorously attacking the real Kenzaki (shooting him in the rear end and bashing him over the head), before Hajime steps in and reveals the impostor. As with all Hyper Battle Videos, this serves as a device to exposit the Rider's various powers and abilities.

''Kamen Rider Blade: New Generation'' is a television special made of a collection of [[vignette (literature)|vignette]]s which aired following certain episodes of ''Kamen Rider Blade'', following the history of Kamen Riders Glaive, L'arc, and Lance. This is a direct tie-in to the movie ''Missing Ace''.

'''[[Maria Zankovetska]] Theatre''' ({{lang-uk|Національний академічний український драматичний театр імені Марії Заньковецької}}, ''Natsionalnyi akademichnyi ukrayinskyi dramatychnyi teatr imeni Mariyi Zankovetskoyi''; {{lang-pl|Teatr Skarbkowski}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt;) is a drama theatre in the centre of [[Lviv]], Ukraine, at the intersection of  Lesya Ukrayinka Street and Prospekt Svobody. The building was erected in the mid 19th century and until [[World War I]] was used as a theatre stage and a session hall of the regional council.

==History==
[[File:Stanislav Skarbek Theatre in Lviv.jpg|thumb|left|Skarbek Theater, Lwów, water-colour by T. Rybrovsky, 1900]]
The theatre was founded by Count [[:pl:Stanisław Skarbek|Stanisław Marcin Skarbek (pl)]] (1780–1848) [[Abdank coat of arms]], who as early as 1819 had applied for permission from the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Imperial]] authorities to build it following the final [[Third Partition of Poland|Partition of Poland]].&lt;ref name="teatry1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teatry.art.pl/!inne/teatralia3/teatrsk.htm |title=Teatralia3 - Teatr Skarbkowski |publisher=Teatry.art.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the theatre’s [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] building began in 1837, the project was designed by architects Jan Salzmann and Ludwig Pichl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.com.pl/semper/teatr.html |title=SEMPER FIDELIS - Okoliczności powstania i otwarcia Teatru Wielkiego we Lwowie |publisher=Lwow.com.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex was built in the location of bastions, which surrounded the [[:uk:Низький замок|Lower Castle]] and its foundation was made of 16,000 oak logs. In 1842 it was the third biggest building of Central Europe.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090321024424/http://www.poznan.pl/mim/public/euro2012/pages.html?id=8127&amp;ch=10854&amp;p=10859&amp;instance=1017&amp;lang=pl&amp;lhs=publications&amp;rhs=publications&amp;lhs=euro2012  Ukraina. UEFA Euro 2012: Lwów.] Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the theatre itself, the complex also included apartments, for such famous personalities as [[Artur Grottger]] and [[Juliusz Kossak]]. On the opening day, March 28, 1842, a [[Franz Grillparzer]] play in the German language was presented, and on the next day, [[Aleksander Fredro]]'s play ''Śluby panieńskie'' was presented, this time in Polish.&lt;ref name="teatry1"/&gt;

In initial years, plays both in Polish and German were presented, and this lasted until 1871, when all German plays were withdrawn and the theatre became a Polish-language only. In 1872, operas were also presented, which made Skarbek Theatre the sole opera scene in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. 

In late years of the 19th century, the complex became insufficient, and in 1900, it was augmented by a brand new building of the [[The Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Grand Theatre]]. Skarbek Theatre was turned into a philharmonic, then into a cinema. Currently, it is home of the Ukrainian Dramatic Theatre of [[Maria Zankovetska]]. On May 18, 2008, celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Polish People's Theatre of Lviv took place in the complex, with performance of a play by [[Marian Hemar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.com.pl/teatr/skarbek/jubileusz.html |title=Jublileusz Polskiego Teatru we Lwowie |publisher=Lwow.com.pl |date=2008-08-31 |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MineCon''' is a [[Fan convention|convention]] for the video game ''[[Minecraft]]'', hosted by [[Mojang]].&lt;ref name="pcg-2012"/&gt; The first gathering in 2010 was known as '''MinecraftCon'''. The MINECON 2011 convention was held in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and celebrated the launch of the game with ''Minecraft''-related discussion panels and gaming areas. The most recent convention, held in [[Anaheim]], had 12,000 attendees. The latest event, known as MineCon Earth, took place on 18 November and marked the first free online MineCon event.

==Events by year==

===2010===
MinecraftCon 2010 was a gathering of more than 30 people at [[Bellevue, Washington]] on 31 August. [[Markus Persson]] made an appearance at the meet-up when several requests were made for a community meet-up, so he called on the community to pick no specific venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1008498266/how-about-a-somewhat-spontaneous-minecraftcon-2010-in|title=How about a somewhat spontaneous MinecraftCon 2010 in Bellevue in one week?|first=Markus|last=Persson|work=[[Tumblr]]|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not technically a convention, but some count it as the first ''Minecraft'' convention.

===2011===
5,000 people attended the first official MINECON convention held in [[Las Vegas]] on 18 November 2011.&lt;ref name="mcvuk-paris"/&gt; The convention focused on celebrating the game's release and hosted ''Minecraft''-related discussion panels, and invited people to play the game with others while at the convention.&lt;ref name="mcvuk-paris"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/MINECON-2012-will-be-at-disneyland-paris/0100583|title=MINECON 2012 will be at Disneyland Paris|first=Lauren|last=Wainwright|date=2 August 2012|publisher=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were keynote speeches from members of the community, building contests, costume contests and exhibits. One of the many events at MINECON was the "Nether Party", an event for those aged 21 and over, featuring [[deadmau5]]. This event also marked the release of Minecraft 1.0 to the public, officially taking the game out of beta.

'''Monetary reform of 1991''' (known also as '''Pavlov Reform''') was the last of such in the [[Soviet Union]]. The reform had a confiscatory character. It began on January 22, 1991. Its architect was Minister of Finance [[Valentin Pavlov]], who was to become the last prime minister of the Soviet Union.

==Overview==
22 January 1991 [[President of the USSR]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] signed a [[decree]] on withdrawal from circulation and retirement of the 50- and 100-ruble banknotes of then-current 1961 issue.

The signing of the Decree was reported on [[Television in the Soviet Union|television]] at 21:00 pm [[Moscow time]] same day. By that time, virtually all financial institutions and shops were closed for the day. In the next few hours, the most "resourceful" people managed to exchange their 50 - and 100-ruble banknotes at institutions that were open late, like subway and railway stations and in taxis as many cashiers and taxi drivers were not aware of the news.

Some were able to send large remittances at late-open post offices, at railway stations, working 24 hours to relatives or to themselves. Some managed to purchase advance rail and air tickets and pay with 50 - and 100-ruble banknotes with an intention to return then for refund in other banknotes.

The reform included provision for the 50- and 100-ruble banknotes of 1961 standard to be redeemable for exchange in ''limited'' quantities per person or family through workplace-organized exchange locations to smaller-denomination banknotes or to new-issue (1991) bills of 50 and 100 rubles denomination.

The exchange was a subject to significant limitations:

*Deadlines for exchange – for three days from 23 to 25 January (Wednesday to Friday).
*No more than 1,000 rubles per person − additional exchange was to be requested as an exception for consideration by a special commissions till the end of March 1991.

However, actual exchange was also limited by the amount of cash available to exchange locations. Withdrawal at the "Savings Bank of the USSR" - the only consumer bank in USSR was also limited to no more than 500 rubles per month per depositor.

In reality, deposits in several savings banks, including those in different cities, were allowed and common. As there was no technical way to link different accounts, an ad-hoc decision was made to make notes of withdrawals on the last pages of passport, where bank's officers made a mark of the amounts withdrawn from the deposit.

==Results==
Government plans succeeded only in part, and had tremendous negative effect: confiscatory procedure allowed to withdraw from circulation 14 billion rubles in cash, but the surprise attack (or reform?) which intended to help in the fight against "speculation", "unearned" income, counterfeiting, "smuggling" and corruption, resulted in a loss of public confidence in the government's actions.

Unpopular "shock therapy" reforms in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Pavlov continued.

On April 2, just as suddenly, consumer prices (then controlled by government) increased about 3-fold, cash dried up and so many daily wage workers lost their jobs, Soviet Union crashed miserably and got separated into different nations.

Poupart, a mother of two, was last seen on May 20, 1990 with two men after leaving a party in [[Lac du Flambeau, Wisconsin]] at 4:00 AM. According to one witness, she was apparently being forced into a vehicle. Six months after she went missing, on November 22, 1990, hunters discovered her remains in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]].&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;

After testifying in court, both men who she was last seen with denied abducting her, claiming that they were going to transport the woman home but instead dropped her off near a school.&lt;ref name=exclusive&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephenson|first=Lauren|title=Newswatch 12 Exclusive: Inside the Susan Poupart cold case investigation|url=http://wjfw.com/stories.html?sku=20140521173520|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=News Watch 12|date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 1990, her purse and identification were discovered underneath harvested trees. Her partial remains were subsequently found; she had apparently been [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]]. Duct tape and plastic were also found, indicating that her killer or killers had attempted to hide the corpse.&lt;ref name=exclusive/&gt;

==Later developments==

In 2007, a man was given several hearings in court after being accused of involvement in Susan Poupart's death, but the charges were later dismissed after witnesses declined to appear, although several others reportedly testified. The two men seen with Poupart after the party are considered persons of interest along with the other man.&lt;ref name=cards&gt;{{cite news|last=Schaefer|first=Heather|title=Playing cards may solve Vilas cold case|url=http://www.rivernewsonline.com/main.asp?SectionID=6&amp;SubSectionID=47&amp;ArticleID=48627|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=The Northwoods River News|date=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Sarah|title=Unsolved Mystery: Susan Poupart|url=http://www.wjfw.com/stories.html?sku=20101125111256|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=News Watch 12|date=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews about the case continued to be conducted between the three, but the men have given little to assist authorities.&lt;ref name="rivernews" /&gt;&lt;ref name=exclusive/&gt;

In 2014, evidence was tested for DNA after advances with technology but did not unearth any new clues. Suspicion has continued to circulate through the local area about those who may be responsible for the murder, yet it is believed that most individuals have withheld their knowledge "out of fear."&lt;ref name="rivernews" /&gt;

A billboard along Highway 47 detailing the case was created in hopes of receiving tips on the case with some success. Investigators reported that they received information about the case as late as 2016, which helped the case somewhat.&lt;ref name=rivernews&gt;Sabato, Nick.

The '''Norfolk headless body''' case relates to a woman, believed to have been murdered, who died around the first or second week of August 1974. Her [[decapitated]] body was found near [[Swaffham]], [[Norfolk]], England, on 27 August 1974. Her head has never been found. The woman has never been identified; one theory that police are working on is that she was a prostitute known as "The Duchess" who worked the [[Great Yarmouth]] docks under this [[pseudonym]], and who had disappeared in mid-1974.

==Death==
The badly decomposed body of this woman was discovered on 27 August 1974 by a 19-year-old tractor driver named Andrew Head who had been out walking when he found this body on land belonging to Sir Peter Roberts. Head later recalled: "I lifted one corner of the cover over the body and that was enough – I could see what it was. I went home and phoned the police."&lt;ref name=lynn&gt;[http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/news/local/latest-local-news/cockley-cley-police-exhume-headless-body-1-520094 Cockley Cley: Police exhume headless body.] ''Lynn News'', 29 May 2008. Retrieved 1 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The body was discovered near a track leading to Brake Hill Farm, Brandon Road, within [[Cockley Cley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-35350440 ''bbc.co.uk'']&lt;/ref&gt; Combine harvesters were used to clear fields to allow them to be searched.&lt;ref&gt;"Woman's headless body is found near farm track", ''[[The Times]]'', 28 August 1974, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Police believe the woman died in either the first or second week of August 1974. She was estimated to be aged between 23 and 35&lt;ref name=norfpol/&gt; and 5&amp;nbsp;ft to 5&amp;nbsp;ft 2 in tall.&lt;ref name=edp&gt;[http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/crime/cold_case_headless_body_found_in_norfolk_1_1006953 Cold case: Headless body found in Norfolk.] Peter Walsh, ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'', 27 August 2011.

Retrieved 25 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A collector in the United States identified the cover as being from a payroll machine and the exact model but the enquiry also established that thousands of the machines would have been made with many exported.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

With her body was a length of rope that was unusual in being made of four strands, rather than the more usual three or five strands. An expert told police that the composition of the rope "suggests it was made for use with agricultural machinery". Police traced the place of manufacture of the rope to [[Dundee]] in Scotland but the firms that made that type of rope have since ceased trading.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

The first murder enquiry into the death ran from 1974 to 1975 during which time police spoke to 15,000 people and took 700 statements. They completed 6,750 house to house questionnaires.&lt;ref name=norfpol/&gt;

In 2008, Norfolk Police [[Exhumation|exhumed]] the woman's body under Operation Monton and took a DNA sample but were unable to identify the woman. They established that she was right-handed, had probably given birth,&lt;ref name=merc/&gt; had consumed water found in Scotland and that fish and crabs formed an important part of her diet.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; They have issued several appeals for information. In 2008, the case was featured on the BBC's ''[[Crimewatch]]'' programme.&lt;ref name=merc/&gt; In 2011, police made another appeal and identified 540 missing women as a result of fresh enquiries.&lt;ref name=norfpol/&gt; In 2016, the case featured on television again and twice in the online version of BBC News.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;

In 2009, police began to examine serial killer [[Peter Tobin]]'s links to Norfolk, to determine whether he could have been involved in the case, or in any other unsolved murders in the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greatyarmouthmercury.co.uk/news/killer-tobin-s-norfolk-links-probed-1-502110 | title=Killer Tobin's Norfolk links probed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
After the woman's remains were exhumed in 2008, samples of her toenails, hair and thigh bone were subjected to DNA and [[Isotope analysis|isotopic analysis]]. A full [[DNA profiling|DNA profile]] of the victim was obtained but there was no match with any database, but the independent isotopic analyses carried out by professor [[Wolfram Meier-Augenstein]] and another scientist, which looks at the traces left in the body from the water consumed during a person's lifetime, both indicated that she was probably from the central Europe area including Denmark, Germany, Austria and northern Italy.&lt;ref name=norfpol/&gt;&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

==Family==
From a second post-mortem examination of the woman, Norfolk police learned that her [[pelvic girdle]] had widened which happens during pregnancy to allow a woman to give birth, indicating that she had likely borne at least one child in her lifetime.&lt;ref name=norfpol/&gt;

=="The Duchess"==
Following a call from a former police officer, after the case featured on ''Crimewatch'' in 2008,&lt;ref name=indep&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/headless-corpse-discovered-in-norfolk-40-years-ago-could-be-sex-worker-known-as-the-duchess-a6835176.html Headless corpse discovered in Norfolk 40 years ago 'could be sex worker known as "the Duchess"'.] Paul Peachey, ''[[The Independent]]'', 26 January 2016. Retrieved 21 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Norfolk police are examining a theory that the woman is "The Duchess"; a prostitute who lived in [[Great Yarmouth]] docks and who disappeared in mid-1974 leaving all her possessions behind. "The Duchess" is believed to have arrived in the port town on the Esbjerg Ferry from Denmark. Her clients were often lorry drivers who travelled between [[Esbjerg]] and Yarmouth using the ferry and she also sometimes accompanied drivers on deliveries across England. This woman is understood to have worked as an [[Call girl|escort]] around Great Yarmouth in the mid 1970s, with her clients often being truck drivers. She was aged in her late 20s or early 30s, hailed from Denmark, and regularly travelled between [[East Anglia]] and Denmark in 1973&amp;ndash;74. She had lived for four or five months in the dockers' hut at the Ocean terminal,&lt;ref name=merc/&gt; and is believed to have also spent time in custody, although contemporary records from this era have been destroyed, and thus the police still do not know this woman's real name. Furthermore, they cannot be sure that the dead woman was indeed "The Duchess".&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-35350440 Norfolk headless body inquiry finds missing women.] BBC News, 24 January 2016.

'''''Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage''''' (subtitled "An Original Aboriginal Erratic Operatic Semi-civilized and Demi-savage Extravaganza") is a two-[[Act (theater)|act]] [[musical theatre|musical]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] by [[John Brougham]] (words) and James Gaspard Maeder (music). It debuted in 1855 and became an instant hit. ''Po-ca-hon-tas'' remained a staple of theatre troupes and [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrel]] companies for the next 30 years, typically as an [[afterpiece]].

The play [[parody|parodies]] the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] narratives that were popular at the time in the [[United States]], particularly those featuring Indian heroines in the [[Noble Savage]] mould. The burlesque is usually credited with bringing the fad for Indian narratives to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Tilton 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barker-Benfield 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot very loosely follows events in the life of the historical [[Pocahontas]]. It begins with the arrival of white men led by [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]], who says they are there to "ravage the land and steal gold".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hall 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and company raid the "Tuscarora Finishing School of Emancipated Maidens" and there meet Pocahontas. The remainder of the play revolves around the [[love triangle]] formed by Pocahontas, Smith, and [[John Rolfe]], concluding with a card game between Smith and Rolfe for the hand of the Indian princess.

However, Brougham's narrative merely adds some action to what is otherwise a collection of [[joke|gags]] and [[pun]]s rapidly delivered in the form of rhymed [[couplet]]s. For example:

&lt;center&gt;''Pocahontas rushing in heroineically distressed and dishevelled, followed by sailors.

&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;POCAHONTAS&lt;/span&gt;

Husband! for thee I ''scream!''

&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;SMITH&lt;/span&gt;

''Lemon or Vanilla?''

&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;POCAHONTAS&lt;/span&gt;

Oh! ''Fly'' with me, and quit those vile dominions!

&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;SMITH&lt;/span&gt;

How ''can'' I fly, beloved, with these pinions?&lt;ref name="Tilton 75"&gt;Quoted in Tilton 75. Emphasis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Many of these jokes hinge upon the play's cavalier approach to [[historical accuracy]]. For example, in a scene where Smith attempts to win the affections of the Native American princess, she denies him with an appeal to historian [[George Bancroft]]:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;POCAHONTAS&lt;/span&gt;

Stop! One doubt within my heart arises!
A great historian before us stands,
''Bancroft'' himself, you know, forbids the ''[[banns]]!''

&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;SMITH&lt;/span&gt;

''Bancroft'' be ''banished'' from your memory's shelf,
for spite of ''fact'', I'll marry you myself.&lt;ref name="Tilton 75"/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Even the [[stage directions]] are written for [[farce]]. Upon one entrance of Pocahontas, "her overburdened soul bursts forth in melody."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kirk 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Other directions parody [[Italian opera]]: "&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;text-transform:lowercase"&gt;GRAND SCENA COMPLICATO&lt;/span&gt;, In the Anglo-Italiano Style".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Kirk 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical numbers to the tunes of popular songs punctuate the jokes. Some of these reiterate the play's [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the white man despoiling virgin America:

::Grab away
::While you may
:In this game, luck is all
::And the prize
::Tempting lies
:In the rich City Hall.
::Grab away
::While you may,
:Every day there's a job.
::It's a fact,
::By contract
:All intact you may rob.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rourke Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre companies and orchestra leaders took great liberties with the music, often substituting popular songs with little or no connection to the plot. For an 1860 staging in [[New Orleans]], for example, [[Mrs. John Wood]] performed "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" for a concluding scene featuring a [[Zouave]] march.

== Historical Context ==

=== Indian Removal ===
This prevalent success of Brougham upon the genre of American burlesque sits mainly on his choice to take a spin-off of such a specific American topic. Po-Ca-Hon-Tas appeared to surpass the usual guidelines of burlesque, lampooning up-to-the-minute dramatic formulas and characters. Po-Ca-Hon-Tas was also “specifically linked to the social and cultural transformations that were taking place in America” during this nineteenth century period.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Detsi-Diamanti 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the heat of century, there was a revolution of sorts happening between the Native Americans and the United States settlers due to the unrest concerning territory and authority. There were some groundbreaking Americans who believed that Indians could embody “what once had been, or yet could be, if only America’s overpowering drive to conquer and contaminate could be reined in”, but regardless of this view, the culture of the Native Americans took on a considerable amount of damage over the course of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Smith 215.&lt;/ref&gt; After winning independence from England in 1776, the new United States’ government began taking possession of Indian territories that lay west of the Appalachian Mountains, even though the United States did not yet manifest past that frontier. From this seizure on, there was a rapid fire of treaties and court cases between the American government and the Indian nations. Treaties were considered “legal … agreements between two legitimate governments” – in this case, the United States and an Indian Nation. Whenever an Indian Nation would sign a treaty, it consented to “give the federal government some or all of its land, as well as some or all of its sovereign powers” in exchange for the government’s “protection, benefits, and rights” to the Native people. Almost none of these agreements ended well for the Natives, as “Indians saw their lands greatly diminished between 1763 and 1889” and eventually all Natives were forced to relocate to relatively minuscule Indian reservations.&lt;ref name="Narrative Historical Overview"&gt;Narrative Historical Overview&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did the United States government greatly impose on the Indian’s geographical boundaries, but their cultural boundaries as well. The newly created and crammed reservations became a hub for government officials to “civilize Indians” and “prepare them for inclusion into the U.S. polity” – a concept that Pocahontas’ story specifically highlights.&lt;ref name="Narrative Historical Overview"/&gt; In the American perspective, Pocahontas’ conversion to English culture presented the possibility of the “European’s fulfilling their hopes for commercial, religious, and political gains” among the Natives – the idea that drove the condescension and controversy of the time.&lt;ref name="Quoted in Detsi-Diamanti 113"&gt;Quoted in Detsi-Diamanti 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jacksonian Democracy ===
In the early 19th century, there was a huge infatuation with Indians, especially Pocahontas, as her story was a prime example of Jacksonian democracy: ‘expansion (nationalism), antimonopoly (egalitarianism) and white supremacy’ . The Jacksonian democracy, an era that defined American beliefs in the early 1800s supported the “Manifest Destiny” (1840), which extended the belief that the United States should extend from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast. Jackson battled Congress in order to pass his Indian Removal Act (1830), which would authorize removal of Native Americans west of the Mississippi River in order to increase United States territory. This only added to American’s practice of white supremacy and superiority over inferior races. There was pride in this idea of the eventual submission of the Indians to the whites’ colonizing/ ‘civilizing’ power. People idealized this story as proof that they could change the Indians and win them over to the white side, the “right side.”  Pocahontas was this legendary figure, the famous Indian Princess who willingly renounced her own people and culture, converted to Christianity, and married the English colonizer &lt;ref name="Quoted in Detsi-Diamanti 113"/&gt; Celebrating these ideas is to inadvertently suppress Indian culture and present it in an inferior to the new “White American” culture.  John Brougham’s burlesque deeply goes against the ideals of “Jacksonian democracy” by portraying Pocahontas as a satire.

==John Brougham==
	However, before all of this was John Brougham himself. Born in Dublin, Ireland in 1810, Brougham was educated at Trinity College to be a surgeon, but he expended much of his college career partaking in substandard theatre endeavors. He made his true theatrical debut in London in 1830 playing six characters in the play Tom and Jerry. Being the well-rounded theatre man he was, Brougham also became the manager of the Lyceum Theatre in 1840, where he wrote several of his lighter burlesques. Finally in 1842, he made the fateful move to the United States, where he quickly joined in on the theatre scene – managing first the Niblo’s Garden, and then opening his own namesake lyceum in 1850, Brougham’s Lyceum. It was here that Po-Ca-Hon-Tas was produced and performed originally. Despite his seemingly successful managing career, theatrical business was not Brougham’s forte, and he lost his beloved Lyceum to comrade James Wallack, who proceeded to rename the theatre to Wallack's Lyceum. In spite of this, Brougham stayed in the same location and was reported to have been paid $250 a week by Wallack, which according to Moody, in Dramas from the American Theatre, was “the largest salary then paid any artist in a regular New York company.” Brougham was noted to have said that working at Wallack’s Theatre was the “brightest part of his life.”&lt;ref&gt;Moody 398&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Brougham did manage to write “no fewer than 126 plays, including burlesques, adaptations, Gothic melodramas, tear-jerkers, Irish plays, and social satire."&lt;ref name="Bordman 96"&gt;Bordman 96&lt;/ref&gt; Brougham was one of the first to bring a bit of the action of his plays into the auditorium.&lt;ref name="Bordman 96"/&gt; “Brougham was not a behind-the-proscenium, peephole-stage, realistic actor.”&lt;ref name="Moody 399"&gt;Moody 399&lt;/ref&gt; According to Moody, “He was genial, jovial, hearty, handsome, immensely popular, dashing, clever, and always stylishly dressed.”&lt;ref name="Moody 399"/&gt; Many people attended the theatre just to hear his impromptu “before-the-curtain” speeches. He ignored the critic’s protests of “impropriety” and gave the audience what they wanted. “Few actors have received the personal acclaim accorded Brougham.” &lt;ref name="Moody 399"/&gt; Fulfilling his American dream as both an actor and a dramatist, Brougham earned the “enthusiastic applause of American audiences, the praise of American critics, and the enviable title of America’s Aristophanes.”&lt;ref&gt;Bordman&lt;/ref&gt;

The object is to have the best [[Hand (poker)|poker hand]] at the end of the run.  Having the best hand and winning is purely a matter of chance. The event has a time limit, however the individual participants are not timed.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the record for the largest event was set in 2009 with 2,136 motorcyclists benefiting the Fallen Firefighter Survivors Foundation (FFSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Largest-motorcycle-Poker-run/BLOG/266718/7691.html |title=Largest motorcycle Poker run - Guinness World Records Blog post - Home of the Longest, Shortest, Fastest, Tallest facts and feats |publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com |date=2009-04-18 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record for the largest single venue event was set in 2012, with 586 motorcyclists raising money for Prostate Cancer research in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/4000/largest-motorcycle-poker-run-%28single-venue%29 | title=Largest motorcycle poker run (single venue)|date=2012-11-06 | accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
Poker runs usually require a fee to enter and some for each additional hand; in some events a small part of the fee may go to funding the event, including the prizes, while the rest goes to the event's charity recipient or club treasury. In charity events usually most, if not all of the funds goes to the selected charity. Prizes, such as money, plaques, or merchandise donated by commercial sponsors of the event, are awarded for the best hand. Some runs will award smaller awards for lower hands or even the [[shooting the moon|lowest hand]].

Each checkpoint might offer food or entertainment, either covered by the entry fee or at additional cost. Each participant is responsible to maintain the integrity of their hand during the run.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} Hands are usually written down or marked with punched holes on a ticket, rather than assembled from actual cards given to the riders. The only requirement is that riders arrive at the final checkpoint by the time prizes are awarded, usually near the end of the day, typically at a party with food and refreshments. It might be required that participants collect all of the requisite number of cards, five or seven, or they might be allowed to miss checkpoints and use a hand with fewer cards, though the odds of a winning hand are much lower.

[[File:Rau Quagga on Devils Peak.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Zebras of the project in the animal camp on the slopes of Devil’s Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town]]
The '''Quagga Project''' is an attempt by a group in South Africa to use [[selective breeding]] to achieve a breeding lineage of [[plains zebra]] (''Equus quagga'') which optically resemble the extinct [[quagga]] (''Equus quagga quagga'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/25/africa/quagga-project-zebra-conservation-extinct-south-africa/ Zebra cousin became extinct 100 years ago. Now, it's back]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rebuilding a Species.ogv|thumb|right|[[VOA]] report about the project]]
[[File:Quagga photo.jpg|left|thumb|A photograph of a quagga mare from 1870]]
In 1955, [[Lutz Heck]] suggested in his book ''{{lang|de|Großwild im Etoshaland}}'' that careful selective breeding with the plains zebra could produce an animal resembling the extinct quagga: a zebra with reduced striping and a brownish basic colour. In 1971, [[Reinhold Rau]] visited various museums in Europe to examine the quagga specimens in their collections and decided to attempt to re-breed the quagga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaggaproject.org/downloads/2012/rough%20road%20to%20re%20breeding%20quagga-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Rau later contacted several zoologists and park authorities, but they were on the whole negative because the quagga has left no living descendants, and thus the genetic composition of this animal is not present in living zebras. Rau did not abandon his [[Breeding back|re-breeding]] proposal, as he considered the quagga to be a subspecies of the plains zebra.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/01/magazine/01taxidermy.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print | title=Can You Revive an Extinct Animal? |work=New York Times Magazine |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=25 August 2010 | first=D.T. | last=Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, molecular studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] of a quagga indicated that it was indeed a subspecies of the plains zebra.

After the DNA examination results appeared in publications from 1984 onward, gradually a more positive attitude was taken towards the quagga re-breeding proposal. In March 1986, the project committee was formed after influential persons became involved. During March 1987, nine zebras were selected and captured at the [[Etosha National Park]] in [[Namibia]]. On 24 April 1987, these zebras were brought to the specially constructed breeding camp complex at the Nature Conservation farm "Vrolijkheid" near [[Robertson, South Africa]]. This marked the start of the quagga re-breeding project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaggaproject.org/downloads/2012/rough%20road%20to%20re%20breeding%20quagga-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional zebras were selected for the lightness of their stripes and incorporated into the project to increase the rate at which the zebras lost their stripes. Some of the zebras of the project that failed to develop the more quagga-like physical traits were released into the Addo Elephant National Park.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

After the number of zebras increased, the Quagga Project had to abandon the "Vrolijkheid" farm. In October 1992, six zebras were moved to land that had sufficient natural grazing. This would reduce the cost of feeding. In 1993, the remaining zebras were moved to two additional sites. On 29 June 2000, the Quagga Project Association, represented by its chairman Dr. Mike Cluver and South African National Parks by its CEO Mavuso Msimang, signed a co-operation agreement. This agreement changed the Quagga Project from a private initiative to an officially recognised and logistically supported project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaggaproject.org/downloads/2012/rough%20road%20to%20re%20breeding%20quagga-1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project milestones==

The Project's first foal was born on 9 December 1988. On 20 January 2005, Henry (a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping) was born. The first 5th generation foal was born in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaggaproject.org/the-quagga-project.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Those individuals with the most reduced stripe patterns are called "Rau quagga" by the people of the project. 

In March 2016 The Quagga Project listed 116 animals in 10 locations, some of which are close to [[Cape Town]]. Of the 116 animals, currently six individuals show a strongly reduced stripe pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaggaproject.org/the-quagga-project.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal is to have a population of about 50 such zebras and move them to a protected area within their former natural habitat. The current individuals with a stripe pattern resembling the quagga are named Henry, Freddy, DJ14, Nina J, FD15, and Khumba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaggaproject.org/downloads/2013/The%20Quagga%20and%20Science%20-%20Prof%20Peter%20Heyward.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Based on the success of ''[[Chandrayaan]]'' and the [[Mars Orbiter Mission]], ISRO has been studying the feasibility of future interplanetary missions to Mars and Venus, the closest planetary neighbours to Earth. The mission concept to Venus was first presented at a Tirupati space meet in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/India-planning-Venus-mission/articleshow/11920410.cms India planning Venus mission.] Srinivas Laxman, ''The Times of India''. 17 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of India]], in its budget for 2017–18 gave the [[Department of Space]] a 23% increase. Under the space sciences section, the budget mentions provisions "for Mars Orbiter Mission II and Mission to Venus",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/with-an-eye-on-venus-and-mars-isro-attempts-mega-world-record-117021200083_1.html|title=Budget 2017: ISRO gets funds for 2nd Mars mission, maiden Venus venture|first=Press Trust of|last=India|date=12 February 2017|publisher=|access-date=30 March 2017| via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following the 2017–18 request for grants, it was authorized to complete preliminary studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiabudget.gov.in/ub2017-18/eb/sbe91.pdf DEPARMENT OF SPACE

The three broad research areas of interest for this mission include surface/subsurface features and re-surfacing processes; second: study the atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and compositional variations, and third: study the atmospheric interaction with solar radiation and [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name="A of O"/&gt;

==Status==

On 19 April 2017, ISRO made an 'Announcement of Opportunity' (AO) seeking science payload proposals from Indian academia based on broad mission specifications.&lt;ref name="A of O" /&gt; As of 2017, the Venus mission is in the study phase and ISRO has not sought the Indian government's full approval.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sputniknews.com/science/201704261053012398-india-venus-mission/ Indian Space Research Organisation Starts Work on India's First Venus Mission]. ''Sputnik International''. 2 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2018, ISRO made another 'Announcement of Opportunity' inviting payload proposals from the international scientific community. The available science payload capacity was revised to 100 kg from 175 kg mentioned in first AO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/ao_venus.pdf|title=Announcement of Opportunity (AO) to international science community for Space-Based Experiments to Study Venus|last=|first=|date=6 November 2018|website=ISRO.gov.in|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106102728/https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/ao_venus.pdf|archive-date=6 November 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/isro-invites-foreign-riders-to-venus/article25465971.ece ISRO invites foreign ‘riders’ to Venus]. Madhumathi D.S., ''The Hindu''. 11 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential collaboration with France==
The space agencies of India (ISRO) and France ([[French National Space Agency|CNES]]) are holding discussions to collaborate on this mission and jointly develop autonomous navigation and [[aerobraking]] technologies.&lt;ref name='I Times 2018'&gt; [https://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/technology/isro-to-work-with-its-french-counterpart-for-inter-planetary-missions-to-mars-venus/63778007 ISRO to work with its French counterpart for inter-planetary missions to Mars, Venus]. ''India Times'' 16 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, French astrophysicist [[Jacques Blamont]] with his experience from the [[Vega program]], expressed his interest to [[U R Rao]] to use inflated balloons to help study the Venusian atmosphere. Just like during the Vega missions, these instrumented balloons could be deployed from an orbiter and take prolonged observations while floating in the relatively mild upper atmosphere of the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Srinivas Laxman |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-17/hyderabad/31070866_1_venus-mission-chandrayaan-1-isro |title=India planning Venus mission |publisher=Times of India |date=17 February 2012 |access-date=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150520/technology-latest/article/after-mars-isro-plans-venus-odyssey|title=After Mars, ISRO plans Venus odyssey|date=2015-05-20|work=deccanchronicle.com/|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ISRO accepted the proposal and would be using a balloon probe carrying {{Convert|10|kg|lbs}} payload to study the Venusian atmosphere at {{Convert|55|km|mi}} altitude.&lt;ref name='Bagla 2018'&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/india-seeks-collaborators-mission-venus-neglected-planet|title=India seeks collaborators for a mission to Venus, the neglected planet|last= Bagla|first= Pallava|date=2018-11-21|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en|quote=Astrophysicist Jacques Blamont, a former head of France’s National Center for Space Studies in Paris, several years ago proposed producing metallic balloons that could dip in and out of Venus’s hot atmosphere to study its chemistry. ISRO has adopted that idea, says Sivan, but will develop the balloon in-house. It will carry 10 kilograms of instruments and float down to 55 kilometers above the surface.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/29597/IndiaFrance+Joint+Vision+for+Space+Cooperation+New+Delhi+10+March+2018|title=India-France Joint Vision for Space Cooperation (New Delhi, 10 March 2018)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mea.gov.in|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-21|quote=3.6 Exploring the solar system and beyond: ISRO and CNES would work together on (i) autonomous navigation of rovers in Moon, Mars and other planets; (ii) aero braking technologies for planetary exploration; (iii) modeling of Mars and Venus atmosphere; and (iv) inflatable systems for Venus exploration. Both sides can embark on complex high technology space science and planetary exploration missions in future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2269">'''Stouthrief''' (alternatively '''stouthreif'''&lt;ref&gt;According to William Roughead - "Trial of Dr. Pritchard - Notable Scottish Trials" the spelling should be STOUTHREIF. See p.343, reference to the execution in front of New Prison of Dd.Little on 27th. January 1831 for stouthreif.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Scottish criminal offence]] of use or threat of violence against a householder who defends themselves during a housebreaking; it is additional to any associated robbery offence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924024627675/cu31924024627675_djvu.txt A practical treatise on the criminal law of Scotland - John H A MacDONALD 1867]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is to be distinguished from the offence of '''Hamesucken''' which is breaking into the home of an individual and assaulting him where that is the initial purpose.&lt;ref name=proutdejure&gt;{{cite web | last = Sloan | title = Hamesucken is alive and well in Scots Law | website = Prout de Jure | date = 2011-08-25 | url = http://proutdejure.info/2011/08/25/hamesucken-is-alive-and-well-in-modern-scots-law/ | accessdate = 2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are offences in [[Common Law]], typically to be found in the description of the offences libelled in court relative to a single incident rather than in the usually less-detailed newspaper reports of such a trial.

Section 285 ("Certain crimes not to be tried in inferior courts") of the [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/21/section/285 Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975.]&lt;/ref&gt; prevented prosecution for stouthrief in a court of summary jurisdiction other than a Sheriff Court.

Although rarely used, prosecutions for Hamesucken were brought in 2011&lt;ref name=proutdejure /&gt; and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bynorth | first = John | title = Man in court accused under ancient law | newspaper = [[The Herald (Glasgow)]] | date = 2015-07-08 | url = http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/crime-courts/man-in-court-accused-under-ancient-law.131323955 | accessdate = 2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propulsion==

Wesley Faler, who leads Fluid and Reason, LLC., is the inventor of the [[ion thruster]] to be used, which he calls ConstantQ Model H.&lt;ref name="Model H"&gt;[https://fluidandreason.com/constantq/ ConstantQ Spacecraft Propulsion]. ''Fluid and Reason LLC''. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpaceD 2017"/&gt; It is a form of [[electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] for spacecraft.

Lloyd Sowers, ''Fox News''. 11 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

The Model H system includes 4 thruster heads which are canted, allowing for both primary propulsion and [[attitude control]] (orientation) without the use of moving parts.&lt;ref name="Model H"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://miles-space.com/thruster/ ConstantQ™ Thruster].

'''Terry's Theatre''' was a [[West End theatre]] in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], in the [[City of Westminster]], London.  Built in 1887, it became a cinema in 1910 before being demolished in 1923.

==History==
The theatre was built in 1887, near Fountain's Court, on the site of a former [[public house]], the [[Coal Hole, Strand|Old Coal Hole]], and was designed by [[Walter Emden]] for the publican, Charles Wilmot and a Dr Web. The theatre was built to accommodate 800, seated in pit and stalls, balcony and a dress circle.  Fountain's Court was named for 'Fountain's Tavern', where the Fountain Club met &amp;ndash; formed by [[Robert Walpole]]'s political opponents. In 1826, [[Edmund Kean]], the actor, founded a late supper club here, known as the 'Wolf Club' for carousing. It ran until the 1850s, introducing entertainments similar to [[Evans Music-and-Supper Rooms]], in nearby [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;The clubs are marked by historic plaques on the modern Coal Hole public house.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]], as owner-manager, opened the theatre on 17 October 1887, with the farce ''The Churchwarden'', followed by ''The Woman Hater''. Terry had been the leading comedian of the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and then starred in  [[John Hollingshead]]'s company at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] before entering theatre management.  He achieved considerable success with his own production of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s ''[[Sweet Lavender]]'', which opened at Terry's Theatre on 21 March 1888 and ran for 683 performances, producing a £20,000 profit. The play was quickly revived.&lt;ref&gt;''The British and American Drama of Today''. Barrett H. Clark. New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1915. pp. 10-13 [http://www.theatredatabase.com/19th_century/arthur_wing_pinero_002.html quoted], accessed 16 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Its cast included: Terry, [[Brandon Thomas]], Maude Millett and Carlotta Addison.

[[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''The Three Wayfarers'' premièred at the theatre on 3 June 1893 with four other one act plays on the bill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~kgwilson/profprod.htm ''Major Professional Productions Staged in Hardy's Lifetime''], accessed 16 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This was typical of theatres of the time, offering 3&amp;ndash;4 one-act plays commencing at 7:45pm, and running until 11pm. Many of the principal parts would be taken by Terry, himself, with other members of a permanent company sharing the other roles.  Pinero also wrote "In Chancery" (1890) and "The Times" (1892) for the theatre.  Law's farce ''The New Boy'' played in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Henry Barton. ''History of the London Stage and Its Famous Players (1576-1903)'', London, G. Routledge (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, [[Edward Laurillard]] became manager of the theatre, producing ''King Kodak'', opening on 30 April 1894, with music by Alfred Plumpton and lyrics by Arthur Branscombe&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/musicals.html ''The Musicals''] (British Musical Theatre) accessed 16 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and a score by [[Walter Slaughter]].  ''[[Little Christopher Columbus]]'' transferred to the theatre in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William.

Madeline Ryley's ''Jedbury Junior'' playec in 1896.  W. H. Griffiths became manager, and there was a further success for Slaughter, with the opening of ''[[The French Maid]]'', on 24 April 1897, transferring the following year to the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] and running for a total of 480 performances, with [[Louie Pounds]] in the title role, before transferring to New York.  During the Christmas season, 1897–98, a series of matinees consisting of short musicals for children by [[Basil Hood]] and Walter Slaughter played with much success at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EED81630E132A25756C0A9649D94669ED7CF "'The Happy Life,' by Louis N.

With Frederick Mouillot installed as manager, ''[[My Lady Molly]]'', a comic opera, ran for 342 performances between 14 March 1903&amp;ndash;16 January 1904.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/myladymolly.htm ''My Lady Molly''] (The Guide to Musical Theatre), accessed 16 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Ib and Little Christina]]'' was revived at the theatre for short runs in both 1903 and 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, J.P.  ''The London Stage 1900-1909'' (2 vols), Scarecrow (1981)  {{ISBN|0-8108-1403-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The theatre was remodelled by [[Frank Matcham]] in 1905, and in 1906 H. A. Jones' comedy ''The Heroic Stubs'' premièred. After further changes to the building, it was reopened on 24 October 1910 as the ''Grand Casino'' cinema, a part of the "Bey Circuit".  It was finally demolished in 1923 to facilitate a road widening scheme.&lt;ref&gt;"Widening The Strand", ''The Times'', 27 August 1923, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; An office block, named "Norman House" stands on the site, with shops below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://londonfilm.bbk.ac.uk/view/venue/?id=995 ''Grand Casino (Terry's)''] (The London Project), accessed 16 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The modern Coal Hole public house stands near, but not on, the former site of the theatre.

'''Injury of the [[thoracic aorta]]''' refers to any injury which affects the portion of the [[aorta]] which lies within the [[chest cavity]]. Injuries of the thoracic aorta are usually the result of [[physical trauma]]; however, they can also be the result of a pathological process. The main causes of this injury are [[acceleration|deceleration]] (such as a car accident) and [[Crush injury|crush injuries]].

==Causes==
Injuries to the aorta are usually the result of trauma, such as [[deceleration]] and crush injuries. Deceleration injuries almost always occur during high speed impacts, such as those in [[motor vehicle accident|motor vehicle crash]]es and falls from a substantial height. Several mechanical processes can occur and are reflected in the injury itself. A more recently proposed mechanism is that the aorta can be compressed between bony structures (such as the [[manubrium]], [[clavicle]], and first [[rib]]) and the [[Vertebral column|spine]]. In the [[ascending aorta]] (the portion of the aorta which is almost vertical), one mechanism of injury is torsion (a two-way twisting).&lt;ref name="Overview"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
There are inconsistencies in the terminology of aortic injury. There are several terms which are interchangeably used to describe injury to the aorta such as ''tear'', ''laceration'', ''transection'', and ''rupture''. ''Laceration'' is used as a term for the consequence of a tear, whereas a ''transection'' is a section across an [[Axis of rotation|axis]] or [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. For all intents and purposes, the latter is used when a tear occurs across all or nearly all of the [[circumference]] of the aorta. ''Rupture'' is defined as a forcible disruption of tissue. Some disagree with the usage of ''rupture'' as they believe it implies that a tear is incompatible with life; however, the term accurately gauges the severity of tears in the aorta. A rupture can be either complete or partial, and can be classified further by the position of the tear.&lt;ref name="Overview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Creasy JD, Chiles C, Routh WD, Dyer RB | title = Overview of traumatic injury of the thoracic aorta | journal = Radiographics | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–45 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9017797 | doi = | url = http://radiographics.rsnajnls.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9017797 | issn = | accessdate = 2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Titanic''''' is a [[Musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Maury Yeston]] and a book by [[Peter Stone]] that opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1997. It swept the 1997 musical [[Tony Award]]s winning all five it was nominated for including the award for [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]] and Best Score (Yeston's second for both). ''Titanic'' is set on the ocean liner [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] which [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sank on its maiden voyage]] on April 15, 1912.

==Background==
The discovery of the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of the RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1985 attracted Yeston's interest in writing a musical about the famous disaster.  "What drew me to the project was the positive aspects of what the ship represented – 1) humankind's striving after great artistic works and similar technological feats, despite the possibility of tragic failure, and 2) the dreams of the passengers on board: 3rd Class, to immigrate to America for a better life; 2nd Class, to live a leisured lifestyle in imitation of the upper classes; 1st Class, to maintain their privileged positions forever. The collision with the iceberg dashed all of these dreams simultaneously, and the subsequent transformation of character of the passengers and crew had, it seemed to me, the potential for great emotional and musical expression onstage."&lt;ref name=contemporary&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/yeston-maury-biography Kalfatovic, Mary.  "Maury Yeston", ''Contemporary Musicians'' (ed. Luann Brennan). Vol. 22, Gale Group, Inc., 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone and Yeston knew that the idea was an unusual subject for a musical. "I think if you don't have that kind of daring damn-the-torpedoes, you shouldn't be in this business. It's the safe sounding shows that often don't do well. You have to dare greatly, and I really want to stretch the bounds of the kind of expression in musical theater," Yeston explained.&lt;ref name=BMI&gt;''BMI Music World'', Fall 1997, pp. 24-29&lt;/ref&gt;  Yeston saw the story as unique to turn-of-the-century British culture, with its rigid social class system and its romanticization of progress through technology. "In order to depict that on the stage, because this is really a very English show, I knew I would have to have a color similar to the one found in the music of the great composers at that time, like [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]] or [[Vaughan Williams]]; this was for me an opportunity to bring in the musical theater an element of the symphonic tradition that I think we really haven't had before. That was very exciting."&lt;ref name=BMI/&gt;

The high cost of ''Titanic''′s set made it impossible for the show to have traditional out of town tryouts.  ''Titanic''′s previews began at Broadway's [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] in 1997 with various technical troubles which were overcome by opening night, initially receiving mixed to positive reviews.  ''[[The New Yorker]]''′s was the first of numerous later unqualified raves: "It seemed a foregone conclusion that the show would be a failure; a musical about history's most tragic maiden voyage, in which fifteen hundred people lost their lives, was obviously preposterous....  Astonishingly, ''Titanic'' manages to be grave and entertaining, somber and joyful; little by little you realize that you are in the presence of a genuine addition to American musical theatre."&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Nancy. ''New Yorker'', May 12, 1997, pp. 102-03&lt;/ref&gt;

It ran 804 performances initially closing at a loss,&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven, Show Tunes: The Songs, Shows, and Careers of Broadway's Major Composers, p.372. {{ISBN|978-0195314076}}&lt;/ref&gt; though winning five Tony Awards (including Best Musical), and the advocacy of [[Rosie O'Donnell]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Tobie S. and Bathurst, Jessica.[https://books.google.com/books?id=TaGGqTZwN3EC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=%22Rosie+O'Donnell%22+Titanic&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rosie%20O'Donnell%22%20Titanic&amp;f=false "Arranging Interviews"] ''Performing Arts Management'', Allworth Communications, Inc., 2008, {{ISBN|1-58115-650-2}}, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; With a [[Grammy Award]] nominated cast album, over the next twenty years the show received hundreds of professional and amateur productions worldwide and has become a national and international staple of musical theater.

==Productions==

===1997 original Broadway production===
''Titanic'' opened on April 23, 1997 at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]]&lt;ref name=times&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&amp;tols_title=TITANIC%20(PLAY)&amp;pdate=19970424&amp;byline=By%20BEN%20BRANTLEY&amp;id=1077011431768 " 'Titanic,' the Musical, Is Finally Launched, and the News Is It's Still Afloat"] ''New York Times'', April 24, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and ran for 804 performances and 27 previews, closing on March 21, 1999. Directed by [[Richard Jones (director)|Richard Jones]] with choreography by [[Lynne Taylor-Corbett]], the cast included [[John Cunningham (actor)|John Cunningham]], [[David Garrison]], [[Larry Keith]], [[Alma Cuervo]],  [[Michael Cerveris]], [[Victoria Clark]], [[Don Stephenson]], and [[Brian d'Arcy James]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt;  [[Danny Burstein]] was a cast replacement. The set encompassed three levels to help form the impression of the size of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John.[http://www.musicals101.com/titanic.htm Review: 'Titanic', Lunt Fontanne Theatre, NYC - 1997"] Musicals101.com, accessed May 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The lobby of the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre was redecorated for the production: the complete passenger list of the ''Titanic'' was painted on the walls, noting those who ultimately survived the disaster.

Orchestrator [[Jonathan Tunick]] won the first [[Tony Award for Best Orchestrations]] for his work on the score.  The show received five Tony nominations, winning in all five categories, though the director, Richard Jones, was not nominated, nor were any of the performers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1997 "1997 Tony Award Winners"] broadwayworld.com, accessed May 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stewart Laing]] was responsible for both the costume design and the scenic design, for which he won a Tony Award for Best Scenic Design. The wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. [[Paul Gallo]] was responsible for the lighting design. Steve Canyon Kennedy was responsible for the sound design.

===First US National tour===
The production toured the United States after closing on Broadway, beginning in January 1999 at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, with a cast that featured Brian d'Arcy James (Los Angeles only),  Marcus Chait, and William Parry.&lt;ref&gt;Ehren, Christine.

===Ensemble Version===
In 2012 original Broadway cast member [[Don Stephenson]], who created the part of Charles Clarke, developed a new chamber version of ''Titanic'' in collaboration with choreographer Liza Gennaro.  This scaled down production used 20 actors playing all of the roles, an abstract set design, projections of the actual ship and passengers, and new orchestrations designed to make the score sound as if it was being played by the ships band. Material that had been previously cut from the original Broadway production was put  back into the show, and existing material was reordered and reassigned.  This new intimate version of ''Titanic'' opened in July 2012 at The Hangar Theatre. The production was nominated for 11 BroadwayWorld Awards which included Best Musical, Best Director, Best Choreographer, and Best Ensemble performance.  Stephenson subsequently remounted this production in hopes of an eventual Broadway revival at Westchester Broadway Theatre in [[Elmsford, New York]] in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Santis|first1=Solange|title=“Titanic” sails into Westchester Broadway Theatre.|url=https://www.broadwaytheatre.com/index.php?src=news&amp;srctype=detail&amp;category=shows&amp;refno=121|website=BroadwayTheatre.com|publisher=Westchester Broadway Theatre|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This concert was produced by Manhattan Concert Productions and featured a chorus of 200 singers from across the country.  It was conducted by original musical director, music supervisor, and conductor Kevin Stites, choreographed by Liza Gennaro, and directed by [[Don Stephenson]].&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven.

Staged with full orchestra and 40-member cast, the run was extended twice due to popular demand.

The Australian production starring [[Nick Tate]] as [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain Smith]] debuted in October 2006. The same production made its UK premiere at York Theatre Royal, and its London premiere at the Gordon Craig Theatre in Stevenage.

A Japanese engagement played from January to February 2007.

==Synopsis==
'''Act 1'''

''Titanic'''s designer, [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]] marvels at the wondrous things mankind has accomplished ("In Every Age"); with the R.M.S. ''Titanic'' becoming the newest feat once thought impossible.  [[Stoker (occupation)|Stoker]] Fred Barrett arrives at the dock in [[Southampton, England|Southampton]], amazed by the feat of engineering ("How Did They Build ''Titanic''?").  He is joined by [[Lookout]] [[Frederick Fleet]] and [[wireless telegraph]] operator [[Harold Bride]], and they gaze in awe at the "Ship of Dreams" ("There She Is") as the crew arrives.  [[J. Bruce Ismay]], Andrews, and [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain E. J. Smith]] congratulate each other on being the owner, designer, and captain of "The Largest Moving Object" in the world.  The ship's passengers arrive; the Third and Second Class passengers feel privileged to be aboard the maiden voyage of the grandest ship ever to sail ("I Must Get on that Ship").  The First Class passengers arrive; their names and achievements are narrated by Second Class passenger Alice Beane ("First Class Roster").  The ''Titanic'' sets sail, and the assembled company wishes her a safe crossing ("Godspeed Titanic").

Now at sea, Ismay arrives on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] to inform Smith that he plans for the ''Titanic'' to arrive in [[New York City|New York]] on Tuesday afternoon rather than Wednesday morning, while Andrews insists that the maiden voyage be a safe one.  As they've cleared land, Smith allows her speed to be increased slightly.  Barrett, in the boiler room, disagrees with the order on such a new ship, but nonetheless complies ("Barrett's Song").

As the voyage continues, Ismay demands increasingly more speed, so the ship can build an impressive reputation. Smith complies despite Andrews' objections and warnings of icebergs in their course.  Smith hails [[William McMaster Murdoch|1st Officer Murdoch]]'s qualities, deeming him ready to assume a command of his own, but Murdoch feels he is not yet ready to handle the responsibilities of the job ("To Be a Captain").

In Second Class, Alice Beane longs for the grandeur that is First Class, while her husband Edgar, a successful hardware store owner, is content with their station.  Charles Clarke, who is traveling to America to become a journalist, is accompanied by his fiancee Caroline Neville. Caroline's father doesn't approve of the engagement, so they are eloping to America.  In First Class, the titans of industry recount the accomplishments that man has recently achieved, with the ''Titanic'' becoming the pinnacle. ("What a Remarkable Age this Is!").  In [[steerage]], three Irish lasses—each named Kate—dream with the rest of Third Class of the opportunities that await them in America ("Lady's Maid").  Kate McGowan is smitten with a young man traveling with them, Jim Farrell.

In the wireless room, Bride is overwhelmed by the passenger's personal messages to be sent, though he finds time to handle Barrett's proposal to his girlfriend ("The Proposal/The Night Was Alive").

On Sunday morning, the First Class attends religious services ("God Lift Me Up"), then dances on deck to "The Latest Rag".  Alice Beane has managed to infiltrate their ranks, though she is turned away several times by an alert steward.  Edgar finds her and the two argue over their lifestyle choices ("I Have Danced").  As evening draws near, the temperature drops, and lookout Fleet finds the weather conditions difficult for spotting icebergs ("No Moon").  On deck, Kate McGowan tells Farrell that she needs to marry as she is carrying the child of a married man, and he accepts.  Elderly passengers [[Isidor Straus|Isidor]] and [[Ida Straus]] discuss their plans for the years to come while Charlotte Drake Cardoza scandalizes the First Class men by joining them for cards in the First Class Smoke Room ("Autumn").

Suddenly, Fleet spots an iceberg and alerts the bridge.  Murdoch, who's the senior officer on the bridge, takes evasive action, but the ''Titanic'' strikes the iceberg.

'''Act 2'''

The stewards begin waking the confused passengers, while they themselves do not have much information ("Wake Up, Wake Up").  Capt. Smith arrives on the bridge and is briefed on the situation.  He orders all passengers to put on life vests, for Bride to begin sending distress messages, and for Andrews to inspect the damage.  Andrews informs Smith and Ismay that the damage inflicted is more than the ship is designed to endure and that the ship will sink, reminding them that there are only enough lifeboats for less than half of the people aboard.

In the First Class Dining Salon, passengers refuse to believe that anything is wrong with the ship and are annoyed at being awakened in the middle of the night ("Dressed in Your Pyjamas in the Grand Salon").  Crew members are assuring them that there is no reason to panic. No one is aware of the ship's growing peril until a food cart rolls on its own, showing the ship's growing tilt. All the passengers and crew members quickly hurry to the lifeboats.

In Third Class, the three Kates and Farrell attempt to find a way up to boat deck, but are unable to until they are assisted by Barrett ("The Staircase"). Smith arrives in the radio room where Bride informs him that only the [[RMS Carpathia|''Carpathia'']] is near enough to help, but is unable to arrive until after the ''Titanic'' has sunk.  Smith, Andrews, and Ismay argue over responsibility for the disaster ("The Blame").

Women and children are ordered into the lifeboats, while the men are forced to stay behind ("To the Lifeboats").  Murdoch orders Fleet and Barrett into the last lifeboat to help man the oars, but Barrett doesn't know how to row a boat and lets Farrell, who can row, into the boat instead.  Barrett bids farewell to his absent girlfriend while the rest of the passengers do the same to their loved ones ("We'll Meet Tomorrow").

The bellboy tells the captain that all the life boats have been launched, and that those remaining aboard accept their fate. Murdoch tells the Captain that he takes full responsibility for the accident, but Smith forgives him and then laments on how he had gone his entire career without experiencing any accident. Henry Etches, the first class steward, says a prayer for the ship's and passenger's safetyl ("To Be A Captain" (Reprise)). Isidor and Ida Straus (Ida had refused to leave her husband behind) affirm their long-lasting love for one another ("Still").  As the Captain declares the ship officially lost, Andrews—life vest unworn—remains in the first-class smoking room, obsessing over the ship's plans. He visualizes redesigning her as well as the final moments of the souls left aboard as the ship sinks beneath the waves ("Mr. Andrews' Vision").

In the early hours of the morning, the survivors are rescued by the ''Carpathia''.  Many of them recount the tragedy of the ''Titanic'', mourning the loss of people and ship.  Bride and Ismay, along with several of the survivors, discuss the possibilities that could have prevented the disaster ("The Foundering").  The survivors express hope that they will one day be reunited with their lost loved ones and abandoned dreams ("In Every Age/Finale").

[[File:Neerdalen van Celedon over het plein La Virgen Blanca.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The popular Celedon’s Descent.]]
The '''''Fiestas de la Virgen Blanca''''' (in [[Basque language|Basque]]: '''''Andre Maria Zuriaren Jaiak''''') have been celebrated every year, since 1884. It is held on 5 August, but the celebrations begin the day before, on the 4th, and end on 9 August it honours the patron saint of the city, and features a programme of special events, activities and free open-air concerts.

The actual festivity starts at six o'clock in the afternoon with the ''[[txupinazo]]'' and Celedon's (a rag doll with an umbrella) descent. Once Celedón reaches a balcony in the square, it is replaced by a human Celedón who then crosses the square on foot with some difficulty amongst the crowds. On arriving to the balcony of the Church of San Miguel, Celedón greets the crowds below and wishes everyone a happy celebration. On the morning of 5 August, the [[Blusas]] and the '''Neskak''' offer flowers to the ''Virgen Blanca''. 
On 7 August the Children's Day is celebrated. The little Celedón or '''Celedón txiki''' descends in the same square as the first day, and later, '''Celedón txiki''' and '''neska txiki''' wish a happy celebration to all the children in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], from the Town Hall. 
On 10 August at one o'clock in the morning Celedon ascends and this marks the end of the Virgen Blanca Festivities

==History of the Fiestas==

This festitvity has been celebrated since 1884. In 1957, a group of friends created a Celedon’s descent, as an analogy to the inhabitants of nearby villages, who went to [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] to celebrate the festivities.
The initial idea was a parachutist, but due to technical difficulties they created a rag doll that descends from the Church-tower to a balcony in the square.

==The Virgen Blanca Fiesta day by day==

===4 August===
[[File:Vitoria 9.JPG|thumb|right|190px|[[Celedón]]]]
At '''six o'clock''' in the afternoon, Celedon's descent is performed from the top of the Church of San Miguel to a balcony in the square below, where Celedón (a rag doll with an umbrella) gradually goes down suspended by a wire. Mean while the citizens below, shower themselves in champagne and sing Celedón's song. Once he reaches the balcony the staff hide the rag doll and a human Celedón appears. Next, he has to cross the square, helped by a group of friends, to reach the Church of San Miguel and greet the crowds below and wish everyone a happy celebration. This performance marks the starting of the celebration in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]].
At '''ten o'clock''' at night, the ''Virgen Blanca'' brotherhood is in charge of organizing a lantern procession.

===5 August===
The Virgen Blanca Day is celebrated on this day. At '''seven o'clock''' in the morning the dawn procession and the rosary take place. Afterwards, at '''nine o'clock''' in the morning a group of friends called the [[blusas]] (boys) and the '''''neskak''''' (girls) offer bunches of flowers to the Virgen Blanca Saint and places them at the entrance of [[San Miguel church (Vitoria-Gasteiz)|San Miguel church]]

===7 August===
''Celedón txiki''. This day is especially focused on children. At '''twelve o'clock''' in the morning a recreation of Celedón's descent is made and celedón txiki and neska txiki come down the same way as Celedón did three days before. Children have special activities for them all around the city so they can enjoy the day.

===8 August===
The ''veteran blusa and neska'''s day. This day is focused on the veterans of the city. The streets are bursting with older people dressed in blouses belonging to the [[blusas]] from the 60's

===9 August===
[[File:Vitoria - San Miguel Arcángel - Virgen Blanca -BT- 01.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Virgen Blanca at the San Miguel Church]]
Traditionally the 'dirty' day is celebrated on 9 August. In the parades taking place this day, the ''blusas'' and the ''neskak'' used to throw flour at each other and danced covered in flour and got very dirty, but nowadays, this tradition is only carried out by a group of ''blusas'' called [[batasuna]].

===10 August===
At '''one o'clock''' in the morning, Celedón goes up to San Miguel Church the same way he came down on 4 August. This marks the end of the celebration in the city.

==Sports==
Every year several traditional basque sports tournaments take place to entertain spectators and increase tourism. The most popular and traditional basque sport is ''eskupilota'' and every year the ''Virgen Blanca Eskupilota Txapelketa'' Championship is organized and other traditional Basque sports can be followed every morning in the 'Fueros' Square.

==Concerts==
Concerts are one of the most important highlights these days. Famous local and national celebrities come to Vitoria and perform on stages all around the city centre. The concerts organized by the Town Hall, are normally performed in the squares of 'Plaza del Machete', 'Plaza del Arca', 'Plaza de los Fueros' and 'Plaza Nueva'. But the concerts organized by the ''Txosnas'' are performed in the campus of the [[University of the Basque Country]] in Vitoria.

==''Blusas'' and ''Neskak''==
[[File:Gasteizko blusen asto-lasterketa.jpg|thumb|right|260px|A donkey race is organized on 25 July in anticipation of the Virgen Blanca festivity]]
These are groups of boys [[blusas]] and girls ('''neskak''') from the city, who take an active part throughout the Virgen Blanca festivities. Most groups are made up of both [[Blusas]] and '''Neskak'''. These groups of friends, get together and take part in a parade from the 'Plaza Nueva' to the bullring every day. They also organize different activities around the city centre. All groups have their own identity and are given one of the following names:
* [[Alegrios]]

[[File:GeorgIvonGroßbritannienGeorgFriedrichHaendelHamman.jpg|thumb|300px|Handel ''(left)'' and King George I on the River Thames, 17 July 1717; painting by [[Edouard Hamman]]]]
[[File:Canaletto, Westminster Bridge from the North on Lord Mayor's Day, 1746-47, detail.jpg|thumb|300px|''Westminster Bridge on [[Lord Mayor's Day]]'' by [[Canaletto]], 1746 (detail)]]
The '''''Water Music''''' is a collection of orchestral movements, often published as three [[Suite (music)|suite]]s, composed by [[George Frideric Handel]]. It premiered on 17 July 1717, in response to [[George I of Great Britain| King George I]]'s request for a concert on the [[River Thames]].

The ''Water Music'' is scored for a relatively large orchestra, making it suitable for outdoor performance.

==Structure==
The ''Water Music'' opens with a [[French overture]] and includes [[minuet]]s, [[bourrée]]s and [[hornpipe]]s. It is divided into three [[Suite (music)|suites]]:

===Suite in F major (HWV 348)===

There is evidence for the different arrangement found in [[Friedrich Chrysander|Chrysander]]'s [[Händel-Gesellschaft#Volumes| Gesellschaft edition]] of Handel's works (in volume 47, published in 1886), where the movements from the "suites" in D and G were mingled and published as one work with HWV 348. This sequence derives from Samuel Arnold's first edition of the complete score in 1788 and the manuscript copies dating from Handel's lifetime. Chrysander's edition also contains an earlier version of the first two movements of HWV 349 in the key of F major composed in 1715 (originally scored for two natural horns, two oboes, bassoon, strings and continuo), where in addition to the horn fanfares and orchestral responses, the original version contained an elaborate concerto-like first violin part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|language=de|title=Wassermusik|type=score|place=Germany|trans-title=Water Music|publisher=Bib BVB}} (the piece is given its German title in this edition by [[Friedrich Chrysander]], Leipzig 1886).&lt;/ref&gt;

The music in each of the suites has no set order today.

==First performance==
The first performance of the ''Water Music'' suites is recorded in ''[[The Daily Courant]]'', the first British daily newspaper. At about 8 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 July 1717, King George I and several aristocrats boarded a [[pleasure barge|royal barge]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], for an excursion up the Thames toward [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. The rising [[Tideway|tide]] propelled the barge upstream without rowing. Another barge, provided by the [[City of London]], contained about 50 musicians who performed Handel's music. Many other Londoners also took to the river to hear the concert. According to ''The Courant'', "the whole River in a manner was covered" with boats and barges. On arriving at Chelsea, the king left his barge, then returned to it at about 11 p.m. for the return trip. The king was so pleased with the ''Water Music'' that he ordered it to be repeated at least three times, both on the trip upstream to Chelsea and on the return, until he landed again at Whitehall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Daily Courant | date = 17 Jul 1717 | pages = 76–77}}, cited by {{Citation | first = Donald | last = Burrows | title = Handel | edition = 2 | place = Oxford | year = 2012 | page = 101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

King George's companions in the royal barge included Anne Vaughan, the [[Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton|Duchess of Bolton]], the [[Harriet Pelham-Holles, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Duchess of Newcastle]], the [[Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull|Duke of Kingston]], [[Sophia von Kielmansegg, Countess of Darlington|Madam Kielmansegg]], the [[Henrietta Godolphin, 2nd Duchess of Marlborough|Countess of Godolphin]], and the [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Earl of Orkney]]. Handel's orchestra is believed to have performed from about 8 p.m. until well after midnight, with only one break while the king went ashore at Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rumoured that the ''Water Music'' was composed to help [[George I of Great Britain|King George]] steal some of the London spotlight back from the [[George II of Great Britain|prince]] who, at the time, worried that his time to rule would be shortened by his father's long life, was throwing lavish parties and dinners to compensate for it. The ''Water Music's'' first performance on the Thames was the King's way of reminding London that he was still there and showing he could carry out gestures even grander than his son's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Handel's Water Music&amp;nbsp;– Recreating a Royal Spectacular | year = 2005 | type = documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
Legend has it that Handel composed ''Water Music'' to regain the favour of King George I. Handel had been employed by the future king George while he was still [[Elector of Hanover]], before he succeeded to the British throne. The composer supposedly fell out of favour for moving to London during [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s reign. This story was first related by Handel's early biographer [[John Mainwaring]]; although it may have some foundation in fact, the tale as told by Mainwaring has been doubted by some Handel scholars.

Another legend has it that the Elector of Hanover approved of Handel's permanent move to London, knowing the separation between them would be temporary. Both were aware the Elector of Hanover would eventually succeed to the British throne after Queen Anne's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Andrew|last=Wilkinson|at=liner notes|publisher=Union Square|title=Simply Handel}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture and the media==

Many portions of ''Water Music'' have become familiar in popular culture.

From 1958 to 1988 this was featured as the theme music from the British network [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]] a brand by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

From 1977 to 1996, [[Walt Disney World]] featured movements from both installments of ''Water Music'' as the background music for the [[Electrical Water Pageant]], a parade of sea creatures lit up with electric lights off the coast of the Magic Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/florida/orlando-disney-world/review-115449.html | title = Orlando: Disney World | publisher = Fodors | contribution = Electrical Water Pageant Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A performance of ''Water Music'' plays a major role in the movie ''[[The Madness of King George]]'', in which [[King George III]] exhibits very erratic and inappropriate behavior at a concert, yelling at the orchestra to play louder (and eventually taking the place of the harpsichordist, playing very badly), culminating in a physical altercation with the Prince of Wales, leading to the Prince of Wales asking to be named Regent.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

==Recordings==
There are many recordings. The ''[[Music for the Royal Fireworks]]'' (1749), composed 32 years later for another outdoor performance (this time, for [[George II of Great Britain]] for the fireworks in London's [[Green Park]], on 27 April 1749), has often been paired with the ''Water Music'' on recordings.
