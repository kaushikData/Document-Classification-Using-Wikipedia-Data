==Events==
After the successful first [[1922 Women's World Games]] in Paris and the three Women's Olympiads ([[1921 Women's Olympiad]], [[1922 Women's Olympiad]] and [[1923 Women's Olympiad]]) in Monaco the interest for [[women's sports]] also grew internationally. In 1922&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; the "[[Women's Amateur Athletic Association]]" (WAAA) was founded in the UK: the WAAA organised the first official British women championships&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; in track and field ([[1923 WAAA Championships|WAAA Championships]]) on 18 August [[1923 in sports|1923]] at the Oxo Sports Ground in [[Downham, London|Downham]] outside London. In the US the "[[Amateur Athletic Union]]" (AAU) organised the [[1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|first official American women championships in track and field]] on 29 September 1923 at [[Weequahic Park]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]].

The 1924 Women's Olympiad was organised in cooperation with the newspapers&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; [[News of the World]], [[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]] and [[Daily Mirror]] in cooperation with the WAAA and the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]]&lt;ref name="O" /&gt; (FSFI) under chairwoman [[Alice Milliat]].

The games were attended by participants from 8&lt;ref name="H" /&gt; nations: Belgium, Canada (exhibition events only), Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA (exhibition events only). The tournament was a huge promotion for women's sports.

The '''2010 Austrian Figure Skating Championships''' ({{lang-de| Österreichischen Staatsmeisterschaften im Eiskunstlauf 2010}}) were the [[Austrian Figure Skating Championships]] of the 2009-2010 [[figure skating season]]. Skaters competed in the disciplines of [[single skating|men's singles, ladies singles]], and [[ice dancing]] on the senior level for the title of [[list of national championships in figure skating|national champion]] of [[Austria]]. The results of the national championships were used to choose the Austrian teams to the [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships]] and the [[2010 European Figure Skating Championships]].

The 2010 Championships took place between 10 December and 12 December 2009 in the [[Tiroler Wasserkraftarena]] in [[Innsbruck]]. The Junior-level Championships were held immediately prior to the Senior-level championships in the same location and arena, between 8 December and 10 December. The senior [[compulsory dance]] was the Tango Romantica and the junior was the Westminster Waltz.

==Construction and renovations==
Originally called Buckhurst Park, the stadium was constructed in 1951 on sixteen hectares of land given by William H. B. Buckhurst in 1948.&lt;ref name=rotary&gt;{{cite web |title=Rotary Club of Suva, Fiji, First Club of the South Pacific Islands |work=Rotary Global History Fellowship |url=https://www.rghfhome.org/first100/global/countries/fiji/

The stadium was first renovated in 1978–1979 for the [[1979 South Pacific Games|Sixth South Pacific Games]].&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-2689-0-0-0&amp;sID=121642&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=8634422 |accessdate = 3 June 2014 | title = South Pacific Games 1979 - Fiji |work=Solomon Islands Games Record |publisher=Fox Sports Pulse |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194222/http://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-2689-0-0-0&amp;sID=121642&amp;&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=8634422 |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work commenced in April 1978 with the demolition of the grandstand, which had lost its roof during [[Cyclone Bebe|Hurricane Bebe]].&lt;ref name=fijitimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=237617 |title=Sporting history begins |newspaper=[[Fiji Times]] |first=Frederica |last=Elbourne |date=22 June 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2015 |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414115314/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=237617 |archivedate=2015-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was renamed National Stadium upon reopening in 1979.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

A second renovation took place in 2012, sponsored by [[ANZ Fiji]], Fiji's largest bank, at a cost of FJD $17.5 million.&lt;ref name=upgrade&gt;{{cite news |title=$17.5m For Stadium Upgrade |date=9 August 2012 |first=Anasilini |last=Ratuva |newspaper=[[Fiji Sun]] |url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2012/08/09/17-5m-for-stadium-upgrade/ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426033904/http://fijisun.com.fj/2012/08/09/17-5m-for-stadium-upgrade/ |archivedate=2016-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium reopened in March 2013, with a rugby union game between the [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji national team]] and [[Classic All Blacks]].&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt;

'''Al Lang Stadium'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowdiessoccer.com/index.php?id=556|title=Al Lang Stadium|last=|first=|date=|website=rowdiessoccer.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Rowdies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014071951/http://www.rowdiessoccer.com/index.php?id=556|archive-date=October 14, 2012|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 7,500-seat sports [[stadium]] in downtown [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] that is the current home pitch of the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the [[United Soccer League]] (USL). It was used almost exclusively as a [[baseball park]] for over 60 years. However, since the Rowdies moved to the facility in 2011, it has been reconfigured to better host soccer.

Al Lang Stadium was built in 1947 at the site of an older facility known as St. Petersburg Athletic Park. It is named in honor of [[Al Lang]], a former mayor of St. Petersburg who was instrumental in bringing minor league and spring training baseball to the city in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="mrbaseball"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/remembering-al-lang-st-petersburgs-mr-baseball/428340|title=Remembering Al Lang, St. Petersburg's Mr. Baseball|first=Melanie|date=March 22, 2008|work=Tampa Bay Times|first2=Curtis|location=St. Petersburg, Florida|via=|accessdate=2017-01-04|author1=Ave|author2=Krueger|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818043647/http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/remembering-al-lang-st-petersburgs-mr-baseball/428340|archive-date=2016-08-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ballpark was reconstructed in 1976 and was extensively renovated before the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] began using it as their first [[spring training]] venue in 1998. The Devil Rays / Rays were the last of a long series of [[Major League Baseball]] clubs to conduct spring training and host an affiliated [[Minor League Baseball|minor league team]] at Al Lang Stadium and St. Petersburg's previous ballparks. Before the Rays, tenants included the [[New York Yankees]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[New York Mets]], and the [[Baltimore Orioles]], amongst others. The stadium hosted its last spring training game in March 2008 and was the site of occasional amateur and exhibition baseball for the next several years.

The Tampa Bay Rowdies became the primary tenant in 2011, and Al Lang Stadium was incrementally modified into a better soccer venue over each of the following off-seasons. Since October 2014, an agreement between the club and the city of St. Petersburg has made the stadium a soccer-only facility, and the Rowdies' ownership conducted an extensive renovation in early 2015.

==History==

===Background===
{{see also|Baseball in the Tampa Bay Area}}
Professional baseball grew throughout the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, and clubs sought additional facilities to accommodate their [[spring training]]. [[Al Lang]], a businessman in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], saw a huge potential to attract northeastern teams to his city to take advantage of the warm weather during the early months of the year. Lang and city officials created an incentives package that covered teams' travel expenses and other amenities, which drew in the city's first spring training tenant, the [[St. Louis Browns]], in 1914. The club trained at [[Coffee Pot Park]], a small ballpark located beside Coffee Pot bayou about a mile north of the current site of Al Lang Stadium. Subsequently, other [[Major League Baseball]] clubs such as the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] and the [[New York Yankees]] came to St. Petersburg for spring training, and Lang continued promoting the city when he was elected Mayor of St. Petersburg in 1916. After his term, Lang devoted his life to building a successful connection between Florida and baseball, and was instrumental in marketing St. Petersburg as a desirable sports site.&lt;ref name="mrbaseball"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fountain"&gt;Fountain, Charles (2009) ''Under the March Sun: The Story of Spring Training.'' New York:  Oxford University Press, pages 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Al Lang's support, the city replaced Coffee Pot Park with St. Petersburg Athletic Park (also known as Waterfront Park) on the present site of Al Lang Stadium in [[1923 in baseball|1923]]. It served as the spring training home for Major League Baseball teams the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] and the [[New York Yankees]] until after World War II, hosting baseball greats such as [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Stan Musial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2008/02/10/Rays/All_Time_Spring_Team.shtml|title=Rays: All-Time Spring Team|last=Topkin|first=Marc|date=February 10, 2008|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current stadium===
In 1947, the city of St. Petersburg demolished Waterfront Park and constructed a modern baseball park on the same site. It was named Al Lang Stadium in honor of his many years of service to the city and his continual promotion of baseball in the area. The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[New York Yankees]] shared the new ballpark in its first spring training season.

The stadium underwent a major reconstruction in 1976, expanding its capacity to 7,227.&lt;ref&gt;Moncada, Carlos (August 28, 2006.

====Description====
Al Lang Stadium's grandstand faces the southeast, giving almost every seat a view of the St. Petersburg harbor and [[Tampa Bay]] beyond the left field wall. The stadium is constructed primarily of [[reinforced concrete]], and the public portions of the facility include very few enclosed and air conditioned areas. A unique concrete [[cantilever]]ed overhang shades many of the grandstand seats from the afternoon sun, and the stadium's waterfront location is often cooled by a [[sea breeze]]. During the 2015 renovation, the Rowdies replaced all of the seats in the grandstand, refreshed fan areas under the grandstand, and extensively updated many of the club and gameday operation areas.&lt;ref name="2015update"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/slideshow/2015/02/13/exclusive-take-a-tour-of-the-al-lang-stadium.html|title=Take a tour of the Al Lang Stadium renovations with Tampa Bay Rowdies owner|first=Alexis|date=February 13, 2013|website=Tampa Bay Business Journal|publisher=|accessdate=2017-01-04|author=Muellner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a portion of the outfield wall was removed and two banks of uncovered bleachers installed in its place, adding several hundred seats on the sideline of the soccer pitch opposite the grandstand.

==Tenants and events==

===Baseball===
Al Lang stadium has hosted may thousand [[spring training|major league spring training]], [[minor league baseball|minor league]], college, high school, international. and exhibition baseball games over the decades.

====Professional baseball====
Al Lang Stadium was originally built as a spring training and minor league venue and served that purpose from 1947 until 2008. Spring training tenants included the [[New York Yankees]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], [[New York Mets]], and [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Minor league tenants included the [[St. Petersburg Saints]] of the [[Florida International League]] and the [[St. Petersburg Cardinals]] of the [[Florida State League]]. Al Lang Stadium's final minor league tenant was the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[St. Petersburg Devil Rays]], who last played at the stadium in [[2000 in baseball|2000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/071800/TampaBay/Deal_to_sell__Baby_Ra.shtml|title=Tampabay: Deal to sell 'Baby Rays' wrapped up|last=Gilmer|first=Byran|date=July 18, 2000|website=St. Petersburg Times|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the expansion [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] began using the stadium for spring training. Their regular season home at [[Tropicana Field]] is approximately one mile west, making the Devil Rays the first major league team to train and play regular season games in the same city in almost 90 years. In 2006, the Rays, seeking to expand their fan base across the [[Tampa Bay area]], decided to move their spring training operations to [[Charlotte Sports Park]] in [[Port Charlotte, Florida]], about 80 miles south of St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/news_pf/Southpinellas/If_Rays_go__Al_Lang_c.shtml|title=If Rays go, Al Lang could be reduced to memories|last=Sharockman|first=Aaron|date=August 16, 2006|website=St. Petersburg Times|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They played their last spring training ballgame at Al Lang Stadium on March 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/st-petersburg-to-see-its-final-spring-training-game-friday-after-94-years/428725|title=St. Petersburg to see its final spring training game Friday after 94 years|last=Sharockman|first=Aaron|date=March 23, 2008|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819143943/http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/st-petersburg-to-see-its-final-spring-training-game-friday-after-94-years/428725|archive-date=2016-08-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amateur baseball====
[[Baseball in the Tampa Bay area]] has a long history, and amateur baseball has long been played in Al Lang Stadium and its predecessors in downtown St. Petersburg. Many different tournament, exhibition, practice, and regular season games have been held there, with the [[University of South Florida St. Petersburg]] club baseball program the last amateur team to call Al Lang Stadium home during their inaugural season of 2014.

The [[1997 Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament|1997]] and [[2002 Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament|2002]] [[Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournament]]s were played at the venue,&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-basebl/2012-acc-baseball-guide.html |title=2012 ACC Baseball Guide |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |work=TheACC.com |accessdate=2012-05-29 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/682OROOXc?url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-basebl/2012-acc-baseball-guide.html |archivedate=May 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[2000 Conference USA Baseball Tournament|2000]] [[Conference USA Baseball Tournament]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/c-usa/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/c-usa-m-basebl-guide-2012.pdf |title=2012 Conference USA Baseball Media Guide |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |page=75 |accessdate=2012-06-21 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68aqThrrz?url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/c-usa/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/c-usa-m-basebl-guide-2012.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010 to 2014, Al Lang Stadium hosted the St. Petersburg International Baseball Series, which involved international teams, national teams, and local college and high school teams along with minor league squads from various major league organizations that were already in the area for spring training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpeteinternationalbaseball.com/index.php|title=2016 Schedule|last=|first=|date=|website=StPeteInternationalBaseball.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2017}} The event moved to other local venues in 2015.

After the Tampa Bay Rowdies moved to Al Lang Stadium in 2011, the playing surface and seating arrangement had to be constantly alternated between baseball and soccer configurations, especially in the spring. The resulting poor condition of the turf led to complaints by Rowdies management and, in October 2014, an agreement that baseball would not be played at the facility.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/edwards-to-city-fix-al-lang-field-or-the-rowdies-may-have-to-move/2179047 |title=Edwards to city: Fix Al Lang field or the Rowdies may have to move |last=Snow Smith |first=Katherine |date=May 9, 2014 |website=Tampa Bay Times |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512014031/http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/edwards-to-city-fix-al-lang-field-or-the-rowdies-may-have-to-move/2179047 |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=2017-01-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soccer===
In 2011, the soccer team [[FC Tampa Bay]] of the [[North American Soccer League]] announced it would move to Al Lang Stadium from [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]] in Tampa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author =&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= March 9, 2011 |title= Mainsail Suites, Lotto among FC Tampa Bay 2011 season sponsors  |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2011/03/09/mainsail-suites-lotto-among-fc-tampa.html |newspaper= Tampa Bay Business Journal|location= |publisher= |accessdate= November 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended three years in which the stadium had no long-term tenant.

On October 27, 2012, the Tampa Bay Rowdies became the [[2012 North American Soccer League season|2012 NASL Champions]] by winning the two-leg [[Soccer Bowl]] against the [[Minnesota Stars]] at Al Lang Stadium. It was the first time that a major championship was held at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasl.com/index.php?id=3&amp;newsid=3473|title=Tampa Bay Wins NASL Championship Series After Penalty Shootout|last=|first=|date=October 27, 2013|website=nasl.com|publisher=North American Soccer League|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013102719/http://www.nasl.com/index.php?id=3&amp;newsid=3473|archive-date=October 13, 2013|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Rowdies signed a lease extension keeping the team at Al Lang Stadium through the 2016 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rowdiessoccer.com/index.php?id=52&amp;newsid=3231|title=Rowdies Agree To Stadium Deal At Al Lang Stadium|last=|first=|date=September 12, 2012|website=rowdiessoccer.com|publisher=Rowdies Soccer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224044649/http://rowdiessoccer.com/index.php?id=52&amp;newsid=3231|archive-date=February 24, 2013|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Rowdies majority owner Bill Edwards publicly complained that the city of St. Petersburg and the St. Petersburg Baseball Commission, which managed Al Lang Stadium, had not kept up with maintenance on the grandstand, the locker rooms, or the playing field. This was partially due to the fact that although the Rowdies have been the only regular tenant of Al Lang Stadium since 2011, it was regularly used for exhibition and amateur baseball during the spring, necessitating that the playing surface be converted for soccer use by removing the pitcher's mound and replacing the infield dirt with grass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/soccer/fc-tampa-bay-to-call-al-lang-home-for-two-seasons/1146358|title=FC Tampa Bay to call Al Lang home for two seasons – St. Petersburg Times|last=A.

====Transfer of stadium management====
The issues were finally resolved in October 2014 when Edwards and the city of St. Petersburg brokered a deal that gave Edwards' Big 3 Entertainment company management control of Al Lang Stadium for the next four years. As part of the arrangement, the facility would no longer be used for baseball events, and Edwards agreed to complete $1.5 million in renovations as he sought to make Al Lang Stadium more soccer friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/its-official-bill-edwards-will-control-al-lang-stadium-in-a-deal-approved/2200447|title=St. Petersburg City Council gives developer Bill Edwards control of Al Lang Stadium|last=Stanley|first=Kameel|date=October 2, 2014|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111304/http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/its-official-bill-edwards-will-control-al-lang-stadium-in-a-deal-approved/2200447|archive-date=March 4, 2016|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed Rays ballpark===
In [[2006 in baseball|2006]], the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] announced plans to move their spring training home to [[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]], about 80 minutes south of St. Petersburg, for the 2009 season. In November 2007, Rays President Matt Silverman introduced a plan to build a $450 million new [[Rays Ballpark]] at the Al Lang Stadium site that was to be ready for the 2012 baseball season. The plan failed to garner enough political support to move forward, and it was shelved in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/rays-president-optimistic-about-baseball-in-bay-area/649945|title=Rays president optimistic about baseball in bay area|last=Sharockman|first=Aaron|date=June 28, 2008|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803174625/http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/rays-president-optimistic-about-baseball-in-bay-area/649945|archive-date=2016-08-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the Rays began looking at other potential locations, and in May 2009, they announced that they would not seek to build a new facility in downtown St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="abandoned"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090522&amp;content_id=4890804&amp;vkey=news_tb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=tb|title=St. Pete waterfront ballpark a no-go|last=Gonzalez|first=Alden|date=May 22, 2009|website=RaysBaseball.com|publisher=|accessdate=2017-01-04}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soccer specific replacement===
In 2013, the city of St. Petersburg began the process of creating a master plan for the waterfront area that includes Al Lang Stadium. Some of the proposals suggest replacing the entire stadium and surrounding parking areas with a soccer park complex with a new [[soccer-specific stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/st-petersburg-creates-master-plan-for-downtown-waterfront/2139566|title=St. Petersburg creates master plan for downtown waterfront|last=Woodrow Cox|first=John|date=September 2, 2013|work=|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|via=|accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowdies owner Bill Edwards has stated that "in a perfect world", Al Lang Stadium would be replaced by an 18,000-seat publicly financed soccer stadium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In March 2016, St. Petersburg mayor [[Rick Kriseman]] announced plans to hold a public [[referendum]] on extending the Rowdies' lease at Al Lang Stadium and to use tax dollars to help the club transform the facility into a "city showpiece". However, these plans were shelved in May 2016, possibly because it became known that [[Orlando City SC]], the closest [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) franchise, has territorial rights for the Tampa/St. Petersburg market, clouding the prospects for potentially bringing the Rowdies to MLS and delaying the need for a larger venue.&lt;ref name="201shelved"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/growth/st-petersburg-mayor-rick-kriseman-shelves-plans-to-ask-voters-for/2275984|title=St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman shelves plans to ask voters for permission to expand Al Lang|first=Charlie|date=May 4, 2016|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|accessdate=2017-01-04|author=Frago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the Tampa Bay Rowdies launched another proposal entitled "#MLS2StPete" to join Major League Soccer as an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer#Tampa Bay.2FSt. Petersburg|expansion team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/news/tampa-bay-rowdies-launch-mls-expansion-campaign/1wj2gzuw7jbbv1hroaptm1pm7j|title=Tampa Bay Rowdies launch MLS expansion campaign|last=Floyd|first=Thomas|date=December 6, 2016|work=|newspaper=Sporting News|access-date=2017-01-05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wtsp.com/sports/soccer/rowdies-announce-bid-for-joining-major-league-soccer/364393093|title=Rowdies announce bid for joining Major League Soccer|last=Hollenbeck|first=Sarah|date=December 7, 2016|work=|newspaper=WTSP|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the announcement, plans were released for an expansion and renovation of Al Lang Stadium to accommodate an 18,000-seat capacity financed by private funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://patch.com/florida/stpete/rowdies-bucking-support-mls-considers-expansion-teams|title=Rowdies Bucking For Support As MLS Considers Expansion Teams|last=Lonon|first=Sherri|date=December 15, 2016|work=|newspaper=The Patch|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2016/12/07/tampa-bay-rowdies-mls-expansion-bid-stadium-renovation|title=Tampa Bay Rowdies launch aggressive bid to join MLS|last=Staff|first=|date=December 7, 2016|work=|newspaper=Sports Illustrated|access-date=2017-01-05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A May 2017 referendum authorized the city of St. Petersburg to negotiate a 25-year lease with the club if MLS picks the Rowdies as an expansion team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/tampa-bay-rowdies-major-league-soccer-hopes-rest-with-st-petersburg-voters/2322337|title=St. Petersburg voters overwhelmingly bless Tampa Bay Rowdies' bid to join Major League Soccer|last=Frago|first=Charlie|date=May 2, 2017|website=Tampa Bay Times|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article148466969.html|title=St. Pete voters okay Tampa Bay Rowdies' bid to join MLS|last=|first=|date=May 3, 2017|work=Miami Herald|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com/major-league-soccer/story/3118181/st-petersburg-approves-stadium-plan-amid-mls-expansion-bid|title=St. Petersburg approves stadium plan amid MLS expansion bid|last=Charlise|first=Jeff|date=May 3, 2017|work=ESPNFC|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baton twirling''' is a art involving the manipulation of a metal rod and the performer's body to a coordinated routine.&lt;ref name= WBTF-Sport&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wbtf.org/about/sport| website= WBTF.org| publisher= World Baton Twirling Federation| title= The Sport| year= 2014| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[rhythmic gymnastics]] or [[color guard (flag spinning)]].

==Description==
Twirling combines dance, agility, coordination, flexibility and often [[gymnastics]] while manipulating a single baton or multiple batons. A performance is typically accompanied by music. When judged, fundamental characteristics include the handling of the baton to create visual images, pictures, and patterns executed with dexterity both close in and around the body and the proper release of the baton into the air. The discipline requires the simultaneous blending of these fundamental characteristics, utilizing time and space to display both technical merit and artistic expression. There are multiple types of baton twirlers. Majorettes, twirl in a group for a high school or college with its [[marching band]]. A twirler may perform as part of a group which marches in a [[parade]] or in front of an audience. Competitive twirlers may compete solo or as part of a group. Twirlers start learning the skills as early as age 2, but usually in grade school age, although some begin as late as high school age.

Baton twirling requires specific knowledge of how to manipulate the baton and where to hold the baton.  The baton can be described as a rod, usually a lightweight metal such as [[aluminum]], with weighted, resilient ends, typically [[rubber]].  The baton's rubber ends attach to the rod and can be replaced.  On one end, there is a large tip that is called the ball. On the other end, there is a small tip simply called the tip.  The baton is balanced slightly off center to allow for proper rolling.  The rod can be one of several thicknesses. Thicker, heavier rods are better for rolling, while thinner ones are better for [[finger roll]]s.  The rubber ends can have different designs or weights depending on the manufacturer. Additionally, [https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-grplist.asp?pid=2 Star Line] is the most common manufacturer of batons. Common types are the star, tulip and simple round tips.  The length is the baton from tip to tip should be one inch longer than the distance from the user's [[armpit]] to the tip of the user's middle finger. The baton is manipulated from three positions, depending on the trick: from the ball, one hand from the tip, and mostly from the center of the baton.  The rod of the baton wrapped with tape, either for decoration or for added grip, using tape specially employed for that purpose. The tape can be anything from [[electrical tape]] to [[tennis tape]].

In addition to twirling baton(s), twirlers are known for manipulating multiple pieces of equipment including fire baton(s), machetes, fire machetes, hoop baton, streamer, flag baton, swing baton, rifle, lighted baton, double flag baton, and sabers. All equipment that is used by twirlers of the NBTA, USTA, and WBTF are show quality pieces of equipment that are engineered to be easily manipulated in a twirling routine. Therefore, the rifle, sabre, and machetes are not real weapons, as they are props created specifically for twirling. However, fire batons are, in fact, real flaming batons. The twirler will soak the ends of the fire batons overnight in a flammable substance, commonly kerosene, tiki oil, or gasoline. After the ends have finished soaking, it is important that the twirler shakes off any excess liquid. Finally, the ends of the baton can be set on fire using a lighter. After the twirler has finished performing, the flames can be put out through tossing the baton very fast and hard or by placing it in a fire blanket. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-grplist.asp?pid=4&lt;/ref&gt;

Baton twirling requires skillful coordination and extraordinary control of the human body. Additionally, it requires a great amount of flexibility in order to properly execute baton, dance, and gymnastics elements. [[Choreography]] for baton twirling is designed to promote expression of the body through dance and movement to create a demonstration of strength, flexibility, physical fitness, beauty, aesthetics, and harmony in coordination with the manipulation of the baton.&lt;ref&gt; name= WBTF-Sport&lt;/ref&gt;rt /&gt;

The foundation of baton twirling is the thumb toss.  This trick is accomplished from the middle of the baton.  The baton is held in one hand at the waist.  The baton is rolled over the thumb and a slight hand movement lifts it into the air.  The thumb toss can be increased in difficultly with 1 or more spins done under the toss, cartwheels, front walkovers, illusions or many more tricks.  The baton can be tosses from either hand, but proficiency in both hands is preferable.  The baton can be caught blind behind the head, at the side, under a kick, under one or both legs or in an illusion. Other tosses include the open hand toss and flat spin toss.

The sport of baton twirling has many tricks common to all twirlers.  The elbow roll is a common trick. Continuous elbow rolls go over one elbow, dip, go over the second elbow, dip at the back, and over the first elbow again.  This process can keep going as long as the baton stays in motion.  Other common tricks include fishtails, open throats, open neck rolls, mouth rolls and more.

The routines have a predictable pattern of organization, despite a unique organization of tricks based on ability.  Typically, the twirler has an initial routine constructed in each type of routine as they are ready.  That routine is changed over and over during the course of their career. In Basic March, the twirler places one hand on their left hip and cradles the baton in the other.  The twirler lifts the leg up into a chair height bend leg and lowers the foot back to the ground to the beat of "Stars and Stripes".  Strut is an expansion off of Basic March.  It also counts the hitting of the foot off the ground based on the beat of "Stars and Stripes", but other dance moves w/ the coordinated baton are incorporated into its X pattern. Solo routines don't have a specific music or beat to follow.  The twirler attempts to constantly improve the routine with greater consistent speed, difficult tricks and improved bodywork.  The routine has specific sections from the vertical, horizontal, finger and roll sections.  It can include a walk up and walk back with poses, but the walk can be a Tour Jete, leaps, skip, Step ball changes or a simple march. Modeling is completed in a T pattern with slow, graceful spins/turns. The routine can be done in a short/party/long dress or costume depending on contest rules.  Modeling can also include an interview depending on the contest.  Other routines can include 2 baton, 3 baton, flag baton, show routine or hoop.  Pageants are a large part of competitive baton twirling.  Basic Skills pageants are the introductory level where the contestant performs Basic March, Modeling and Solo.  Beginner and Intermediate pageants include Modeling/Interview, Strut and Solo.  Advanced pageants include Modeling/Interview, Show twirl, and solo.

Currently, Baton Twirlers perform at football games, basketball games, competitions, parades, and virtually anywhere where entertainment is needed. It is commonly known that after a twirling season has come to an end, each twirling company/studio will host a recital to showcase the talents obtained over the season. 

Competitive solo twirlers in the United States compete through several organizations.  These organization include United States Twirling Association, Twirling Unlimited, Twirltacular, National Baton Twirling Association and more.  Each of these organizations have their own rules. The United States Twirling Association, USTA, offers competitive routines that are unique to this association only. Moreover, these routines include L military marching, 32 count presentation, rhythm twirl, freestyle, and show twirl. Twirling Unlimited, TU, has restrictions on number of turns and continuous elbow rolls in developmental levels, but they allow gymnastics moves.  TU separates the age groups as 0-6, 7-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15+. The 0-6 and 7-8 age groups are combined for certain events. National Baton Twirling Association, NBTA, does not have developmental restrictions, but it does not permit gymnastics.  NBTA age groups are 0-4, 0-6, 7-9, 10-12. 13-15, 16+.  NBTA nations are called America's Youth on Parade, which has been held for 50 years.  AYOP has been held at Notre Dame's [[Joyce Center]] for 46 years. The event allows the soloists and groups to qualify for world competition.  AYOP is a week long event with a mixture of open events and pageants, which the twirler has to qualify for at Miss Majorette state/regional events.  The solo events of both organizations are also divided into Novice, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Elite levels.  Advancement is based on a set number of wins.

===History===

[[File:Baton-practice-Manzanar-Adams.jpeg|thumb|alt=Japanese teenage girl in 1940s sweater, skirt, and blouse twirling two batons and smiling, backlit by the sun against a nearly-cloudless sky.|Baton practice, [[Manzanar War Relocation Center]], 1943. Photographed by [[Ansel Adams]].]]

Baton twirling started in Western Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where performers used knives, rifles, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The sport progressed into the armies of some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler to the front of the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a "mace". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace bearer or "drum major" twirled the baton whilst leading the army or band. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females ("drum majorettes") and the progression of twirling that prompted the lightening and balancing of the baton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btsai.ie/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421054348/http://www.btsai.ie/history.html |archivedate=2009-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport came to North America when Major [[Reuben Webster Millsaps]] created baton twirling when he established [[Millsaps College]] in [[Mississippi]] after the [[US Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/colosseum/loge/6944/bt_history.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+17:47:55&lt;/ref&gt;

While many member countries have their own national organizations, at the world level, three governing bodies are recognized: 
the [http://www.wbtf.org/ World Baton Twirling Federation (WBTF)], the [http://www.worldtwirling.cc/ World Twirling Association (WTA)/], and [http://www.nbta-europe.eu/index.php?page=Doc183 The Global Alliance of National Baton Twirling &amp; Majorette Associations (NBTA)/]. The WBTF and NBTA host World Championships and International Cup (WBTF), while the WTA continues to honor the origins of the sport with additional events that WBTF does not include.&lt;ref name=WTA-organization&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldtwirling.cc/organization.html |title= World Twirling Association |website= WorldTwirling.cc |accessdate= 2009-05-04 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090423031247/http://worldtwirling.cc/organization.html |archivedate= 2009-04-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTA was founded in 1960, by champion baton twirler Victor Faber.&lt;ref name= WTA-organization /&gt;

Established in 1977, the World Baton Twirling Federation was formed to develop, encourage, and standardize the sport. In October 1979, the Federation representatives met in [[Paris]], [[France]] to finalize all plans for the first World Championships, bringing together teams of twirlers from ten countries to compete in a spirit of healthy, athletic competition. The United States Twirling Association, Inc. hosted the first World Championships in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in 1980. Each successive year, one member country has hosts the championships in August.&lt;ref name= WBTF-history&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wbtf.org/about/history/| website= WBTF.org| publisher= World Baton Twirling Federation| title= History| year= 2014| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current member countries of the WBTF include: [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]), [[Croatia]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Scotland]], [[Seychelles]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name= WBTF-about&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.wbtf.org/about/| website= WBTF.org| publisher= World Baton Twirling Federation| title= About Us | year= 2014| access-date= January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current member countries of the NBTA include: [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Scotland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]], and the [[United States of America]]. Under consideration are: [[Australia]], [[Estonia]], [[Japan]], [[Slovenia]], and [[South Africa]].

==Competitive baton twirling==
Competitive baton twirling is classified by two factors, skill and age. The [http://www.batontwirling.com/NBTA/Solo2.htm NBTA], USTA, and WBTF separate twirlers by their skill levels, which range from novice, beginner, intermediate, to advanced; advancement to the next skill level is determined through the number of first place wins that the twirler has accomplished against other twirlers.
Wins obtained with no competitors in said division typically do not count towards advancement.  Next, the twirlers are classified by their age through a standard scale that is as follows:  0-6 7-9 10-12 13-15 16+.  This classification scale ensures that the competition between twirlers in each division is fair. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.batontwirling.com/NBTA/Solo2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

When competing, a twirlers attire will typically be a leotard or a skater dress that is embellished with sequins, rhinestones, fringe, and other ornate designs. Major brands of twirling costumes include [http://www.showoffinc.com/ Show-Off Inc]., [http://kenerlykreationsinc.com/ Kenerly Kreations], [http://www.sewstoppersonline.com/ Sewstoppers], and [https://www.algyperforms.com/ Algy]. Twirlers are judged on their attire during competition, especially in events such as best in costume, so it is important that they wear a costume that fits properly and looks good during competition. Footwear ranges from [https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-proddetailsv1.asp?pid=66 instep cougars], [https://www.capezio.com/women/shoes/jazz-shoes/eos jazz shoes], to [https://www.starlinebaton.com/slb-proddetailsv1.asp?pid=361 majorette boots]. Typically, instep cougars are seen on both the competition floor and during practice. Jazz shoes are primarily used during competition, as the soft bottoms can easily be torn during practice. It is common to see the heels of jazz shoes covered in rhinestones. Majorette boots can be seen during competition; however, high school and college majorettes typically wear these on the football field and during other performances.

One of the most competitive titles in the twirling field, Miss Majorette, is a title that is given to the top baton twirlers of each state. As mentioned earlier, twirlers will be classified based on their skill and age, which allows for a Miss Majorette title in each rank. When competing for this title, twirlers will begin by competing in T or Circle T Modelling, Interview, Solo, and X- Strut. After a twirler has been named Miss Majorette of their state, they will advance to compete for the title of Miss Majorette of America in their division. 

Every year, the [[ESPN Wide World of Sports]] hosts [http://www.twirlmania.com Twirlmania] international championship competition at [[Walt Disney World]]. Competition is available for soloists, teams, high schools, colleges, and recreational groups of any age or gender. Some countries that have participated in the past include U.S, Japan, Russia, Australia, and England. Competing ranges from baton twirling to pompom and dance. Competitors also get to march in a Disney parade as well as participate in a fun, family oriented weekend. Awards range from trophies to plush stuffed animals to cash (up to $4,000) and gifts by sponsors. Some categories include Dance Line Team, Collegiate Team, Pom Pom Team, Drill Team, Basic &amp; Military, and Miss Twirl Mania Pageant, to name a few.

The main events at the first World Baton Twirling Championships were Freestyle and Compulsory Moves. Two new events were introduced: Teams (1981) and Pairs (1993). In 2005, a Short Program replaced the Compulsory Moves for the Senior Men and Women's divisions.&lt;ref name=WBTF-history /&gt; 

The World Championships have the following events:
*Freestyle Senior Women &amp; Men
*Junior Women and Men 
*Event accompanied by a compulsory/short programme event
**strut
**solo
**dancetwirl
**pairs
**trios
**show choir
*Single baton, 2 batons, 3 batons

Teams, pairs, trios, and show choir can be co-ed.

For several years, the powerhouse countries (France, Italy, Japan, and the United States) have dominated the world championships. In order to promote more events and other smaller countries' ability to have international champions, the International Cup was introduced. Athletes are categorized into B level athletes, A level athletes, and elite. The power house countries don't take B level athletes so as to the give the smaller countries an opportunity to have international champions. Because every country doesn't have dancetwirl as an event, and because of the variety within the freestyle event, the artistic twirl was introduced to replace freestyle and dancetwirl at the International Cup.

Since 2005, the two competitions have been run concurrently over a week. In 2009, the competitions began running separately, with the International Cup falling on uneven years and the World Championships on even years. New events such as Freestyle and Pairs across different age levels and divisions were added to the International Cup.

'''Chatteris Cricket Ground''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Chatteris]], [[Cambridgeshire]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1832, when [[Cambridge Town Club]] played the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in the ground's only [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/391_f.html First-Class Matches played on Chatteris Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground was first used for [[Minor Counties Championship]] cricket when [[Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club|Cambridgeshire]] played [[Lincolnshire County Cricket Club|Lincolnshire]] in 1967.  From 1967 to 1971, the ground hosted 4 Minor Counties Championship matches, the last of which saw Cambridgeshire play [[Bedfordshire County Cricket Club|Bedfordshire]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/391_minc.html Minor Counties Championship Matches played on Chatteris Cricket Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  Chatteris CC was formed in 1879 and it is uncertain if the field used in 1832 is the same one currently used by the town club in Wenny Road.&lt;ref&gt;Chatteris CC Play-cricket.com&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Choruru'''|ちょるる|}} is a [[mascot]] character who was created for the 66th annual [[National Sports Festival of Japan]] and 11th annual National Sports Festival for People with Disabilities which were held in [[Yamaguchi prefecture]] in 2011. After the tournaments, he became head of the Oidemase Yamaguchi Tourism Advertising Department, before becoming the Yamaguchi Prefecture PR General Manager in October 2012.

== Outline ==
Choruru was first introduced on 14 October 2007 at the 'Oidemase! Yamaguchi Kokutai Jump Up Festa 2007'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/gyosei/kokutai/pdf/public006.pdf |title=広報紙「おいでませ！山口国体2011vol.6」 }} - 第66回国民体育大会山口県準備委員会事務局2007年12月10日 (PR Paper Oidemase! Yamaguchi Kokutai 2011 vol.6){{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His design features green antennae which have the shape of the first kanji character for Yamaguchi (山), which catch the abundant energy of the people and nature. His white face is the shape of the second kanji character for Yamaguchi (口), representing the prefecture's name on his head.

The character design was chosen from the 80 entries from a prefecture-wide design contest, with a proposal by [[Shūnan, Yamaguchi|Shunan city]] based design company Sansou Ltd being used. Although the design for Choruru was actually by Mitsuo Fukunaga,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/area/yamaguchi/news/20110624ddlk35070419000c.html|script-title=ja:ひと交差点：ちょるるの生みの親、福永みつおさん　／山口|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]](Seibuhan Yamaguchimen)|publisher=Mainichi Shimbun Seibuhan]]|date=2011-06-24|accessdate=2011-07-12|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Shunan city based PH Graphics&lt;ref&gt;[http://ph-g.jp phグラフィックス] - PH Graphics Official Website{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who submitted the design through Sansou Ltd, when the character was officially announced it was accreddited to Sansou Ltd president Hirofumi Shigeoka. A civil trial was brought about by Fukunaga to clarify his position as the creator of Choruru, and in 2011 both parties reached a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] in which Fukunaga was once again declared as Chorurus "art director-cum-designer".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/seibu/sports/news/20110622ddp041050027000c.html|script-title=ja:山口国体：キャラ著作者、お披露目|work=[[Mainichi Shimbun]](Seibuhan Yamaguchimen)|publisher=Mainichi Shimbun Seibuhan]]|date=2011-06-22|accessdate=2011-07-12|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a further point, due to the submission rules for the design contest, the [[copyright]] for Choruru belongs to the Oidemase Yamaguchi National Sports Festival Executive Committee.

His name was based on a modified word form from the [[Chūgoku dialect|Yamaguchi dialect]] ～ちょる（～している doing ~), and was selected from the 9,227 entries that were submitted during the open entry session from 14 October to 30 November, while his design was on show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/gyosei/kokutai/kokutai/news/20080318003.html マスコットの愛称が決定] - おいでませ！山口国体公式サイト内ニュース&amp;トピックス2008年3月18日 (Oidemase Yamaguchi Koktai Official Website News &amp; Topics 18 March 2008){{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name was officially decided and announced as "Choruru" in issue 8 of the "Oidemase! Yamaguchi Kokutai" PR Brochure, published in July 2008.

== History ==

=== Oidemase Yamaguchi National Sports Festival ===
From 2008 onward, Choruru participated in a range of events across Yamaguchi prefecture in order to promote the National Sports Festival. Various types of promotional material, pamphlets and commemorative merchandise were made using Choruru's image, and even a song (Fight, Choruru!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minato-yamaguchi.co.jp/yama/news/digest/2009/0426/5p.html マスコットソング「ファイト！ちょるる」発表] - 山口新聞2009年4月26日 (Mascot Song "Fight!

The total sales of related goods, including Choruru National Sports Festival pin badges, topped a ground breaking two hundred and eight million yen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sankeibiz.jp/compliance/news/121017/cpd1210171648019-n1.htm 山口ゆるキャラ「ちょるる」、ネット人気投票２位快走　「ぜひグランプリを」知事も期待] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130502031743/http://www.sankeibiz.jp/compliance/news/121017/cpd1210171648019-n1.htm |date=2013-05-02 }} - サンケイビズ2012年10月17日 (Yamaguchi's Yuru Character Choruru Hits Second in Net Popularity Contest, Governor Hopes for Grand Prix Victory - Sankei Biz 17 October 2012){{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oidemase Yamaguchi Year Tourism Exchange Campaign ===
When the Oidemase Yamaguchi National Sports Festival drew to a close, Choruru's role as the festival mascot also ended. However, from 1 November 2011 he was appointed as "Head of the Oidemase Yamaguchi Tourism Advertising Department",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/gyosei/kokutai/kokutai/torikumi/news_1065.html 【ちょるる日記】「おいでませ山口観光宣伝部長」に就任するよ] - おいでませ!山口国体公式サイト (Choruru is Inaugurated as Head of the Oidemase Yamaguchi Tourism Advertising Department - Oidemase!

Though his role was only supposed to last the duration of the campaign, the then [[Governor (Japan)|governor]] of Yamaguchi, [[Sekinari Nii]], announced that there might be other opportunities for Choruru besides just tourism, suggesting that there was potential for Choruru to have a PR role in other campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mainichi.jp/area/yamaguchi/news/20111102ddlk35040360000c.html ちょるる：国体マスコットから観光へ“異動”　宣伝部長に任命／山口] - 毎日新聞山口版 (Choruru: Transer From Kokutai Character to Tourism, Appointed Head of Advertising - Mainichi Shimbun Yamaguchihan 2 November 2011){{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yamaguchi Prefecture PR General Manager ===
On 13 September 2012 at the Yamaguchi Tourism Commission, Choruru's promotion to Yamaguchi Prefecture PR General Manager,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/News/Tn201209140051.html 「ちょるる」県PR役継続] - (Choruru, Prefectural PR Role Continues) [[Chugoku Shimbun]] 14 September 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a role not limited to the field of tourism but also to widen the appeal of Yamaguchi Prefecture, was recognised. The official appointment certificate was handed over on 11 October by then [[Governor (Japan)|governor]] [[Shigetarō Yamamoto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/News/Tn201210120007.html ちょるる、「昇進」本部長に] - (Choruru Promoted to General Manager) Chugoku Shimbun 12 October 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also at this time that the commercial use for Choruru's character design became available without charge. At least 50 applications for commercial goods such as soft toys and sweets were made within the first month of availability, with applications coming with outside the prefecture from [[Hiroshima Prefecture|Hiroshima]] and [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] prefectures.&lt;ref&gt;ホットボイス 準V人気一過性にしない - (Hot Voice, Jun V Ninki Ikkasei ni Shinai) [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] 23 December 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yuru-chara Grand Prix ===
Voting for the 2012 [[Yuru-chara]] Grand Prix opened on 15 September 2012, with Choruru making his first entry into the competition on 20 September, successfully climbing to second place by early October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yamaguchi.keizai.biz/headline/1559/ 山口の「ちょるる」、ゆるキャラGPに初参戦－ランキング急上昇で2位] - (Yamaguchi's Choruru, Shoots to Second Place in First Yuru Chara GP) Yamaguchi Ube Keizai Shimbun 4 October 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he called for support by visiting the entrance of the Yamaguchi Prefectural Office, the [[Tokuyama Zoo]] in Shunan and so on, the gap between him and the top ranked yuru-chara, [[Barysan]] from [[Imabari, Ehime|Imabari]] city in [[Ehime Prefecture|Ehime]], in terms of votes received was very large. As such, at an emergency press conference held on 19 October at the Yamaguchi Prefectural Office, as well as a declaration of determination for victory, it was announced that Choruru would visit each area of the prefecture on a promotional tour to call for support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/News/Tn201210200009.html ちょるる、ＧＰへ決意の会見] - (Choruru Determination for GP at Interview) Chugoku Shimbun 20 October 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/e-japan/yamaguchi/news/20121020-OYT8T00150.htm|title= ちょるる県内遊説へ (Choruru's Prefectural Campaign)|work=Yomiuri Shimbun|publisher=Yomiuri Online|date=2012-10-20|accessdate=2012-10-20|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the final results were announced on 25 November 2012, although he could not close the gap on Barysan, he managed to maintain second place having received 462,970 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minato-yamaguchi.co.jp/yama/news/digest/2012/1126/3p.html ちょるる堂堂準グランプリ　ゆるキャラGP] - (Choruru's Impressive Semi-Grand Prix, Yuru Chara GP) Yamaguchi Shimbun 26 November 2012 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1211/25/news009.html 「ゆるキャラグランプリ2012」　優勝はバリィさん　2位はちょるるに] - (Yuru Chara Grand Prix 2012, Winner is Barysan, 2nd is Choruru) IT Media 25 November 2012{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Health and Welfare Festival ===
On 27 November 2012, it was announced that Choruru was selected to be the event mascot for the 28th [[National Health and Welfare Festival]]. It will be held in Yamaguchi prefecture in 2015 under the name {{nihongo|Nenrinpikku Oidemase!

=== Hello Kitty Friendship Pact ===
On 25 February 2013 at the Yamaguchi Prefectural Office, Choruru and [[Hello Kitty]] were joined in a "Friendship Pact".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/press/201302/024073.html 「ちょるる」＆「ハローキティ」おともだち協定調印式及び知事表敬訪問について] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724114149/http://www.pref.yamaguchi.lg.jp/press/201302/024073.html |date=2014-07-24 }} - (About Choruru and Hello Kitty's Friendship Pact Signing Ceremony and the Governor's Courtesy Call) Yamaguchi Prefectural Information Publication 20 February 2013 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yamaguchi.keizai.biz/headline/1661/ 山口PR本部長・ちょるる、キティと「お友達協定」－コラボグッズ展開など] - (Yamaguchi PR General Manager Choruru and Kitty's Friendship Pact, Developing Collaboration Goods etc) Yamaguchi Ube Keizai Shimbun 16 February 2013 {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the two characters meeting at the 2012 Sanrio Thanks Party, an event held at [[Sanrio Puroland]] in December 2012, Yamaguchi began working toward associating with [[Sanrio]]. This was the first such pact Hello Kitty had made with another character. Afterwich both characters worked toward sending joy to people by way of participating in each other's events and collaborating on promotional goods and materials.

The population of [[Xinjiang Province]], [[China]] is divided between two ethnic groups: the indigenous Muslim [[Uyghurs]] and the ruling [[Han Chinese]], who gained control of the region in 1755 from the Dzungar kingdom. Uyghur and Han speak different languages, practice different religions, live and work in different neighborhoods, and even set their watches two hours apart―Han operate on [[Time in China|Beijing time]], [[Uyghurs]] on unofficial [[Time zone|local time]].

There is one place, however, where the [[Racial segregation|segregation]] line is broken: on the baseball field. Although Uyghur and Han Chinese students at Xinjiang University take separate classes and live in separate dormitories, there are not enough players of one or the other ethnicity to field a whole team. They need each other to play baseball.

''Diamond in the Dunes'' follows this team and their charismatic captain, Parhat Ablat, in their struggle to overcome ethnic differences and prepare for their only game of the season: an all-in match up against a team of [[Tibetans]] from [[Qinghai Province]].

The film is directed by Christopher Rufo.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3309155/&lt;/ref&gt; This is his third documentary film.

== Summary and background ==
''Diamond in the Dunes'' opens with pastoral shots of Parhat Ablat, a young [[Muslim]] [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]], [[farming]] and herding [[sheep]] on his homestead outside [[Kashgar]]. Parhat says goodbye to his family and gets on the train for [[Urumqi]], the capital of [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang Province]], where he attends university.

The population of this hardscrabble region is divided between two ethnic groups: the indigenous [[Muslim]] [[Uyghurs]] and the ruling [[Han Chinese]], who gained control of the region in 1755 from the Dzungar kingdom. [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] speak different languages, practice different religions, live and work in different neighborhoods, and even set their watches two hours apart―Chinese operate on [[Beijing]] time, [[Uyghurs]] on unofficial local time.

Parhat, pitcher and captain of Xinjiang University's baseball team, explains that classes and dormitories at Xinjiang University are segregated, but on [[baseball]] team, both Uyghur and Chinese students play side-by-side. When a package of donated [[baseball]] equipment arrives from the US, Parhat shares his excitement with Yusufu, one of his Chinese teammates.

During Xinjiang's brutal winter, the team begins to practice underground and racial tensions between Uyghur and Chinese come to a point. Parhat must bring both sides of the team together and remind them that if the conflict persists, the team may be disbanded by the University.

On and off the field, Parhat's goal is to raise poor Uyghur students out of what he calls the Uyghurs' 'spirit sickness.' He teaches [[quantum mechanics]] to a class of Uyghur physics students, counsels the younger players on the team, and starts a baseball team at the local [[Primary education|elementary school]].

At the end of the season, the Xinjiang University team is invited to compete against the next-closest [[baseball]] team, the Qinghai Tibetan College, more than 2,000 miles to the east. On the train, the novice players brush up on the strike zone and [[Force play|force out]] rule.

Finally, both teams face off for their only game of the season. The Xinjiang team plays hard, but Tibetans are too strong: the final score is 16-0. After the game, the mood is dour and the players look to Parhat for leadership. He assures them that the experience of defeat is important and a lesson can be learned: work hard, never forget your goals, and you will ultimately succeed.

The final sequence takes us back to Parhat's village. At sunset, he goes into the streets in his baseball uniform, finds a group of kids, and begins teaching them baseball. Night falls and the kids ask his name. "Parhat," he says, which in Uyghur means 'hero.'

Drawing from more than 100 hours of material, the film employs the [[cinéma vérité]] style, with no oncamera interviews or outside narration. The film favors a personal and psychological, rather than overtly political approach. The score is drawn from 100 minutes of Uyghur folk music, and includes drones extracted and reconditioned from the folk melodies and other sound design elements by Thomas Park of the musical act 'Mystified'.

The arena's [[naming rights]] are held by [[First Transit]].

==History==
===Establishment (1998–2007)===
On March 2, 1998, Elmira city officials announced Lauridon Sports Management as the developed and operator the city's $11.6 million proposed arena. By September, the Midtown Plaza on North Main Street was selected as the site for the arena. Lauridon then committed $5 million to the $15 million project. In July 1999, five downtown businesses were notified of eviction from their properties and Elmira City Council unanimously voted to begin eminent domain proceedings against Paul Navestad, the only property owner whom the city could not reach an agreement. Demolition began on September 21. Thomas Freeman, president of Coach USA Transit Services, signed an agreement to pay $1 million for the arena to be called the Coach USA Center. By October 4, the Chemung County Legislature requested the $7.25 million promised by Lauridon Sports Management and its private investor for the project, Mostafa Afr of Ann Arbor, Michigan, must be in place by December 1, or the county would pull its $1.25 million in support for the project. On October 26: Key Bank approved Afr’s application for a $7.25 million loan to help build the center. The arena then held its groundbreaking ceremony on November 24, 1999.

On January 28, 2000, the Chemung County Industrial Development Agency closed on the county’s $1.25 million loan to the project and the rest of the financing was completed in February with the Afrs and a vice president from Key Bank in Albany closed on a $5.5 million loan. Tamer Afr, Mostafa Afr’s son and business partner, announced that Global Spectrum had replaced Lauridon Sports Management as the arena facility manager. This lasted three months before they announced that [[SMG (property management)|SMG]] would manage the arena instead. The City Council also approved a roof design for the project in June 2000 that increased the estimated cost of the arena to $16 million. 

On March 27, 2000, the [[United Hockey League]] awarded an expansion franchise to Elmira to begin play in the 2000–01 season. The team name was revealed as the [[Elmira Jackals]]. The Twin Tier Amateur Hockey Association and Tamer Afr also signed a contract for youth hockey to be played at the arena. On November 11, the first event is held at the center when the Jackals played their home opener against the [[Knoxville Speed]]. The Moody Blues were the first musical entertainment at the arena the following night.

In October 2003, the Coach USA Center was renamed First Arena. In April 2006, Mostafa Afr announced that Robbie Nichols would take over operation of both First Arena and the Jackals. He became the arena's eighth general manager in less than six years and its fourth manager in the past year.

===Financial troubles (2007–2016)===
On October 31, 2007, Elmira Downtown Arena (EDA), the arena operator, entered into an installment agreement to pay taxes on which it had defaulted. EDA then defaulted on the agreement on March 31, 2008. From 2009 to 2011, the arena continued to fail to pay its taxes. On January 17, 2012, the 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. deadline passed to pay $123,849 in overdue taxes and a foreclosure order was then signed by Chemung County Court judge Peter Buckley, starting a "redemption period" that was to end February 29. During that period, Southern Tier Economic Development (STED), the arena's owner, could get the property back by paying the overdue tax balance plus a 10% penalty totaling $136,234. On March 12, the county legislature voted to table an attempt by STED to buy back the arena. The legislature also called for the hiring of a consultant to investigate the arena's financial status and physical condition.

The EDA responded on March 22, 2012, by filing a lawsuit against Chemung County, county executive Tom Santulli, county treasurer Joseph Sartori and STED to try to force the county to accept the repurchase offer on the arena. EDA and M-Team LLC, a Michigan corporation, also filed a lawsuit against former arena general manager Robbie Nichols and former assistant general manager Donald Lewis alleging they attempted to sabotage the arena operator, the Jackals and First Arena. EDA and Key Bank filed two more lawsuits in April accusing the county of not following proper procedure in administering its foreclosure process. County judge Judith O'Shea dismissed the lawsuit filed March 22 against county officials and the suit filed against Nichols and Lewis. On May 17, 2012, a memorandum of understanding was signed by Tamer Afr for EDA, Santulli for the county and Kevin Keeley as president of STED that allowed the Jackals to play in the facility during the 2012–13 season. The agreement also allowed EDA to continue operating the arena but gave the county the same rights as STED to oversee arena operations.

On February 5, 2013, officials announced that Elm Arena LLC, a group headed by Tom Freeman, president of First Air in Big Flats, had been named as the new operator of First Arena, replacing the Afr family. The agreement ended all pending litigation.&lt;ref name="agreement"&gt;{{cite news|title=Arena Deal Draws Cheers in Elmira|first=Ray|last=Finger|url=http://www.stargazette.com/article/20130206/NEWS01/302060110/Arena-deal-draws-cheers-in-Elmira|newspaper=[[Star-Gazette]]|location=Elmira|date=February 6, 2013|accessdate=February 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ENjqIACs?url=http://www.stargazette.com/article/20130206/NEWS01/302060110/Arena-deal-draws-cheers-in-Elmira?nclick_check=1|archivedate=February 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 10, the Jackals held a press conference to name Tom Freeman and Nathan Cook the new owners of the First Arena and the Jackals. In September 2014, the Jackals were donated from Freeman to a private non-profit community organization, Twin Tiers Economic Development (TTED), a 30-member board to oversee the organization.

===Chemung County operated (2016–present)===
On January 28, 2016, the Chemung County Industrial Development Agency (IDA) entered into an "option to purchase agreement" with a down payment of $300,000, giving the IDA time to consider all factors and options about the future of the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chemung County IDA Considering Buying First Arena|url=http://www.weny.com/news/All/ida-considers-buying-first-arena-012816|date=January 28, 2016|accessdate=February 2, 2016|publisher=WENY News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDA then assumed temporary ownership of First Arena and the Jackals until a new owner can be found beginning in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Arena under new temporary ownership|url=http://www.weny.com/news/All/first-arena-under-new-temporary-ownership|publisher=''WENY News''|accessdate=28 Apr 2016|date=28 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IDA Seeks Proposals For Purchase of First Arena|url=http://www.mytwintiers.com/news/local-news/ida-seeks-proposals-for-purchase-of-first-arena|publisher=''WETM News''|accessdate=25 May 2016|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDA gave tours of the facility to several potential buyers hoping to be in a position to select a buyer by late July or early August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Potential buyers get up close with First Arena|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2016/06/02/potential-buyers-get-up-close-first-arena/85302926/|publisher=''Elmira Star Gazette''|accessdate=June 8, 2016|date=June 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no purchase proposals were received by the June 24 deadline. Negotiations continued with three interested parties. On August 24, the process had been narrowed to one party, who was also interested in buying the Jackals. The IDA hoped to complete the transaction by January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Search For New First Arena Owner Narrowed To One Prospect|url=http://www.mytwintiers.com/news/local-news/search-for-new-first-arena-owner-narrowed-to-one-prospect|publisher=''WETM News''|accessdate=August 29, 2016|date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Arena One Step Closer to Getting New Owner|url=http://www.mytwintiers.com/news/local-news/first-arena-one-step-closer-to-getting-new-owner|publisher=''WETM News''|accessdate=December 19, 2016|date=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Chemung County legislature voted to maintain the arena to be open to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Arena deal remains in the works|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2017/01/10/elmira-first-arena-deal-remains-works-chemung/96404654/|publisher=''Elmira Star-Gazette''|accessdate=January 11, 2017|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but asked the Elmira City Council to contribute nearly $1.5 million of taxpayer money over five years to repair the ice plant and repay back bills. They council voted against it saying that doing so would require a 3% property tax increase. The Chemung County IDA sarguedys that they only had enough funds to operate the arena for another week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARENA MAY GO DARK: Sale in jeopardy, official says|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2017/02/07/elmira-wont-contribute-toward-first-arena-upgrades/97593634/|publisher=''Elmira Star-Gazette''|accessdate=February 9, 2017|date=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 10, the IDA presented a counteroffer to the Elmira City Council asking for $750,000 to repair the ice plant.

On  March 7, the potential buyer dropped the request for taxpayer funding. The buyer also needed to submit paperwork to the ECHL by March 9 to ask for approval for a change in ownership, and to affirm that the Jackals would play the next season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadline Approaching on First Area Deal|url=http://www.mytwintiers.com/news/local-news/deadline-approaching-on-first-area-deal/668250484|publisher=''WETM News''|accessdate=March 8, 2017|date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 10, it was announced that local businessman Brian Barrett would take ownership of First Arena, but the Jackals would cease operations at the conclusion of the 2016–17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=First Arena has Buyer, Elmira Jackals to Fold|url=http://www.weny.com/news/local-news/first-arena-buyer-elmira-jackals-folding-031017|date=March 10, 2017|accessdate=March 10, 2017|publisher=''WENY News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finalization of the deal was contingent upon the new owner obtaining another hockey franchise. Possibilities were from an announced new amateur league called the International Developmental Hockey League (IDHL), which listed a team called the Elmira Express on its web site, or the [[Federal Hockey League]], a low-level professional league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIRST ARENA: New owner, but Jackals leaving|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2017/03/09/first-arena-county-plans-friday-announcement/98958172/|publisher=''Elmira Star-Gazette''|accessdate=March 13, 2017|date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jackals played their final game on April 8, 2017.

On July 5, 2017, [[Elmira Pioneers]] co-owner and former Jackals coach and general manager Robbie Nichols expressed a desire to bring a Federal Hockey League team to Elmira for the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers Co-Owner Robbie Nichols Talks FHL Hockey in Elmira|url=http://www.mytwintiers.com/sports/local-sports/pioneers-co-owner-robbie-nichols-talks-fhl-hockey-in-elmira/757951126|publisher=''WETM News''|accessdate=July 5, 2017|date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after meeting with county officials and the IDA, Nichols announced that they could not come to an agreement and the plan was put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robbie Nichols Update on FHL Coming to Elmira|url=http://www.mytwintiers.com/sports/local-sports/robbie-nichols-update-on-fhl-coming-to-elmira/758740586|publisher=''WETM News''|accessdate=July 5, 2017|date=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbie Nichols offered to lease the arena for a minimum of two years but the IDA rejected the proposal, saying it would leave them financially exposed.

On October 3, 2017, the City of Elmira approved a resolution proposed by the IDA to apply for a "Restore New York" grant to help repair the arena's ice plant and roof. The repairs were intended to help the IDA get the building up to par so it can be sold.

On June 25, 2018, the IDA reopened negotiations with Robbie Nichols to bring a Federal Hockey League team to Elmira with Nichols leasing the arena, not purchasing it. On July 17, Nichols and the IDA announced that Nichols would lease the arena for a year with renewals for the following two years and an option to purchase. Nichols brought in a Federal Hockey League (FHL) franchise and intends to hold other events. The new FHL team was announced as the [[Elmira Enforcers]] and began play in the 2018–19 season.

==Sports==

'''Gila River Arena''' (originally '''Glendale Arena''' and formerly '''Jobing.com Arena''') is a sports and entertainment [[arena]] in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. It is located about {{convert|12.5|mi|km}} northwest of [[downtown Phoenix]].

The [[Arizona Coyotes]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) has been the primary tenant since the building opened on December 26, 2003. It sits on the north side of West Maryland Avenue across from [[State Farm Stadium]], home of the [[National Football League]]'s (NFL) [[Arizona Cardinals]]. The venue anchors the City of Glendale's [[Westgate City Center|Westgate Entertainment District]] just east of [[Arizona State Route 101|Arizona Loop 101]].

The now-defunct [[Arizona Sting]] also had played four [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL) seasons at the arena until their 13–11 loss to the Rochester Knighthawks in the 2007 Champion's Cup game. Negotiations on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement originally delayed the start of the [[2008 NLL season]], but the Sting did not participate. They eventually ceased operations in 2009.

Completed at a construction cost of US$220 million, it seats 17,125 for [[ice hockey|hockey]] and [[lacrosse]], 18,300 for [[basketball]] and about 19,000 for concert events. The arena has 3,075 club seats and 87 luxury suites (including two Luxury Tower Suites). It also features a completely integrated video, scoring and advertising system from [[Daktronics]].&lt;ref name=system&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/en-us/photos/details?pn=WP-11123|title=Daktronics Photo Gallery: Jobing.com Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Glendalearène0601.jpg|170px|thumb|left|Gila River Arena before a Coyotes game; from south end, looking north]]
[[File:Glendalearène06.jpg|170px|thumb|left|Gila River Arena before a Coyotes game; from west side, looking east]]
The arena's construction broke ground on April 3, 2002 and the Coyotes moved into the arena in late 2003. Martin/Martin Consulting Engineers provided structural engineering for the arena. After relocating from [[Winnipeg]] on July 1, 1996, the team had spent its first 7½ seasons at America West Arena (now the [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]]) in downtown Phoenix.  The AWA was not an old arena (it had made its debut as the new home of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Phoenix Suns]] only four years earlier in 1992) but it was primarily designed for NBA basketball. It was quickly retrofitted for hockey.  However, the arena floor was just barely large enough to fit a regulation hockey rink, and several seats had badly obstructed views.  As a result, before the team's second season in Phoenix, its hockey capacity had to be cut down from over 18,000 seats to just over 16,000—the second-smallest capacity in the NHL at the time. After the Colorado Avalanche moved from [[McNichols Sports Arena]] into [[Pepsi Center]] in 1999, and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] moved from the [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] to [[Air Canada Centre]] later in the same season, America West Arena was the smallest NHL venue. A small section of seats on the lower level actually hung over the boards, obstructing the views for up to 3,000 spectators.

When the Coyotes were sold to a partnership led by [[Steve Ellman]], that group committed to building a new arena in suburban Glendale. With agreements signed with the city of Glendale in 2001, the venue opened midway through the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]] NHL season as the ''Glendale Arena'' on December 26, 2003, with the [[Arizona Sting]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] defeating the Vancouver Ravens, 16–12, the [[2004 NLL season]] opener. The first NHL game was held the next evening, as the Coyotes dropped a 3–1 decision to the [[Nashville Predators]] on December 27, 2003. The Coyotes' first win at the arena came on December 31, 2003, as they defeated the [[Los Angeles Kings]] 4-0. 

The arena was originally scheduled to receive the 2006 [[National Hockey League All-Star Game]]. However,  the new [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement]] signed following the [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05 lockout]] cancelled the game, as under the terms of the new agreement, the All-Star Game would not be held during the year of the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] in order for players to participate in the Games. Many expected Glendale to gain the [[2009 NHL All-Star Game]] as compensation; however, the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and their arena, [[Bell Centre]], were awarded the 2009 All-Star Game to celebrate [[Montreal Canadiens centennial|the team's centennial]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=193332&amp;hubname= TSN: NHL – Canada's Sports Leader]&lt;/ref&gt; Jobing.com Arena then was awarded the [[2011 NHL All-Star Game|2011 edition]], but due to the ongoing bankruptcy case, potential ownership changes in the Coyotes organization, and the possibility of relocation, the NHL decided to reopen bidding to host the game, which went on to the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]' [[RBC Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/articles/2010/04/08/carolina_to_host_2011_nhl_all_star_game/ |title=Carolina to host 2011 NHL All-Star game |last=McCreary |first=Joedy |date=2010-04-08 |work=[[Boston Globe]] |accessdate=2010-12-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vV57IR2u?url=http://www.boston.com/sports/hockey/articles/2010/04/08/carolina_to_host_2011_nhl_all_star_game/ |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hurricanes.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=514457 |title=Canes Bidding to Host 2011 All-Star Game |last=Branecky |first=Paul |date=2010-01-21 |publisher=National Hockey League |accessdate=2010-12-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127020641/http://hurricanes.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=514457 |archivedate=January 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coyotes' current owners, IceArizona, are still interested in getting an All-Star Game in Glendale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arizonasports.com/story/33793/new-phoenix-coyotes-owners-want-to-bring-nhl-all-star-game-to-arizona/ New Phoenix Coyotes owners want to bring NHL All-Star Game to Arizona]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2005, the venue has been host to the Arizona state high school basketball, volleyball, wrestling and cheerleading tournaments in a mega-event called "February Frenzy", as the result of a formal agreement between the city of Glendale and the [[Arizona Interscholastic Association]] (AIA).

The [[Arizona Sting]] did not play after the 2007 season and fully ceased operations in 2009.

Since 2004, the [[Professional Bull Riders|PBR]]'s [[Built Ford Tough Series]] bull riding tour has hosted an annual event at this venue (except for 2006 when the event was held at [[Chase Field]]).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jcomarenalogo.svg|thumb|left|Jobing.com Arena logo, 2007-2014]] --&gt;
Prior to the 2009–2010 season, this was the only current NHL arena to have never hosted a playoff game, as the Coyotes' last playoff appearance was in [[2001–02 NHL season|2002]] when they still played home games in downtown Phoenix. However, the team qualified for the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs]], ending that drought. They played the [[Detroit Red Wings|Red Wings]] and lost the series 4–3.  The 2010–2011 Coyotes season ended at Jobing.com Arena with a 4-game sweep of the Coyotes by the Detroit Red Wings.

The arena saw extra action during the [[2011–12 NHL season]] as the Coyotes not only qualified for the playoffs for the third consecutive season, but advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time in team history, losing to the eventual Stanley Cup Champion Los Angeles Kings in five games. Every home playoff game as in years past featured a "White Out", continuing the tradition of years past in both Phoenix and Winnipeg playoff series of giving fans white T-shirts to wear for the games.

The Arizona Coyotes missed the playoffs during the next 3 seasons, concluding the second half of the 2014–2015 season with a NHL worst record of 8–29–4.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/schedule/_/name/ari/year/2015/arizona-coyotes&lt;/ref&gt;  Losses mounted toward the $50 million, 5-year out clause for the Coyotes. Coyotes ownership continued to revolve, as Philadelphia hedge fund manager Andrew Barroway was announced as the new majority owner in December 2014, only to back out as majority owner less than 6 months later.  Losses for the City of Glendale on the arena management agreement continued to run at nearly $10 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glendaleaz.com/finance/documents/CityofGlendaleBudgetPackage2015-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2015, the Glendale City Council voted to terminate the arena contract with IceArizona. Mayor Jerry Weiers, Vice Mayor Ian Hugh and council members Jamie Aldama, Lauren Tolmachoff, and Bart Turner cited conflict of interest laws asserted to apply to Craig Tindall, former Glendale city attorney. Tindall was hired by IceArizona about seven weeks after the city originally approved the IceArizona contract. Councilmen Samuel Chavira and Gary Sherwood opposed voiding the contract. IceArizona has threatened legal action against the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=Peter|title=Glendale council votes to kill Coyotes deal|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2015/06/10/glendale-vote-coyotes-arena-deal/71036868/|website=AZCentral.com|publisher=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sunnucks|first1=Mike|title=Glendale votes to kill deal with Arizona Coyotes|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2015/06/10/glendale-votes-to-kill-deal-with-arizona-coyotes.html|website=BizJournals.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, a new deal was arranged where Glendale's management deal was reduced from $15 to $6.5 million per year, while the Coyotes would get all the ticket and ancillary revenue from hockey and concerts at Gila River Arena for up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2015/07/24/glendale-council-unanimously-approves-new-coyotes-arena-deal/30624025/ Glendale council unanimously approves new Coyotes arena deal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming rights==
Naming rights to the arena were initially held by Jobing.com—a Phoenix-based [[employment website]]—under a 10-year, $30 million deal established in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/10/23/daily27.html |title=Jobing.com, Glendale Arena deal confirmed |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 25, 2006 |website=Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=[[American City Business Journals]] |accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 13, 2014, the Coyotes terminated their naming rights deal with Jobing.com, and announced a new nine-year naming rights and sponsorship deal with [[Gila River Casinos]]—a group of [[Native American gaming|tribal casinos]] controlled by the [[Gila River Indian Community]]. No financial terms were announced. Team CEO Anthony LeBlanc described the new naming rights deal as the "most significant deal" made by the team under its new IceArizona ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2162553-with-new-naming-rights-to-its-arena-the-arizona-coyotes-make-economic-statement | title=With New Naming Rights to Their Arena, Arizona Coyotes Make Economic Statement | work=Bleacher Report |date=August 13, 2014|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the deal, the Gila River community became the first federally recognized Native American tribe to hold a naming rights deal with a venue for one of the [[major North American professional sports leagues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/14/an-arizona-tribe-is-going-to-be-the-first-to-have-naming-rights-to-a-professional-sports-arena/ |title=An Arizona tribe is going to be the first to have naming rights to a professional sports arena|work=Washington Post|date=August 14, 2014|accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events==
The first musical concert at the then-Glendale Arena was by [[Bette Midler]] on  February 13, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/article_2041ed2c-ac22-59f4-8dce-31db9e4f1119.html Bette Midler wows Glendale Arena crowd ]&lt;/ref&gt; While the arena gets fewer events than [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]] in Phoenix, Gila River Arena averages 14 non-hockey events per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/glendale/2015/07/22/glendale-gila-river-arena-concert-attendance-short-projections/30485779/ Glendale's Gila River Arena concert attendance short of projections]&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Super Bowl XLIX]] at nearby [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], the Gila River Arena hosted a "Super Bowl Club" hospitality event prior to the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/49/guide/gameday ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the [[Arizona Rattlers]] announced their playoffs schedule plans which included moving the [[ArenaBowl]] to Gila River Arena due to scheduling conflicts with their usual home Talking Stick Resort Arena. The game became official on August 13 when the Rattlers won the National Conference Championship and clinched home field advantage for the ArenaBowl. On August 26, 2016, the arena officially hosted [[ArenaBowl XXIX]], which featured the [[Philadelphia Soul]] and the Arizona Rattlers in front of 13,390 fans. This not only became the first Rattler home game to take place outside of their original home but became the first ever event at Gila River Arena to be broadcast across the country on [[ESPN]].

{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}
The '''golden goal''' or '''golden point''' is a rule used in [[association football]], [[bandy]], [[lacrosse]], [[field hockey]], [[ice hockey]], [[floorball]] and [[korfball]] to decide the winner of a match (typically a knock-out match) in which scores are equal at the end of normal time. It is a type of [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]. Under this rule, the game will end when a goal or point is scored; the team that scores that goal or point during [[extra time]] will be the winner. Introduced formally in 1992, though with some history before that, the rule ceased to apply to most [[FIFA]]-authorized football games in 2004. The similar silver goal supplemented the golden goal between 2002 and 2004.

The golden goal is still used in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] matches and in [[International Hockey Federation|FIH]] sanctioned [[field hockey]] games, as well as in [[Fédération Internationale de Roller Sports|FIRS]] sanctioned [[Roller hockey (quad)|roller hockey]] games. A related concept, the [[golden point]], is used in [[National Rugby League]] games. A similar golden goal rule is also used in all National Hockey League (NHL) overtime games (followed by a shootout if needed, in the regular season and preseason); however, the term "golden goal" is not used. A rule similar to the golden goal also applies in the [[National Football League]] (only if a touchdown or safety is scored first on the first possession), although again the term itself is not used.

==Historical context==
The first recorded use of the golden goal rule was in the final of the [[Cromwell Cup]], the world's second ever football competition, at [[Bramall Lane]], [[Sheffield]] in 1868, although the term ''golden goal'' was not used. The deciding goal was scored by the then newly formed team called [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], now known as Sheffield Wednesday.&lt;ref name="Garrick"&gt;{{cite web|title=Garrick F.C. |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/sheff/club/garrick.htm |accessdate=2008-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514142757/http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/sheff/club/garrick.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden goal was introduced due to perceived failings of other means of resolving a draw (tie) in [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] or [[knock-out]] tournaments where a winner is required. In particular, [[extra time]] periods can be tense and unentertaining as sides are too tired and nervous to attack, preferring to defend and play for penalties; whilst [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] are often described as based upon luck, and unrepresentative of football. [[FIFA]] introduced the golden goal rule in 1993. It was hoped that the golden goal would produce more attacking play during extra time, and would reduce the number of penalty shootouts.

==Field hockey==
International field hockey tournaments such as the [[Hockey World Cup]] and [[Hockey Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] had used golden goals to decide the winners of elimination matches. During these matches, two extra periods of 7½ minutes each were played, and if no golden goals were scored after both periods of extra time, a [[penalty shootout|penalty stroke competition]] decided the game. [[International Hockey Federation|FIH]], the sport's governing body, did away with the overtime procedure in 2013, and now teams go directly to the shootout.

==Ice hockey==
{{main|Overtime (ice hockey)}}
The golden goal rule comes into use at the end of regulation of every [[National Hockey League]] game where the score is tied. In the regular season, five minutes of three-on-three sudden-death overtime are played, with the first goal winning the game. If, however, neither team scores after this period, a shootout determines the winner. In playoff games, shootouts are not used; 20-minute periods of five-on-five hockey are played until a goal is scored to end the game. This has resulted in [[Overtime_(ice_hockey)#Notable_NHL_playoff_overtime_games|extremely long contests]], such as the "[[Easter Epic]]"; a playoff series-deciding match which ended in the midst of its fourth overtime. The term "golden goal" is not a commonly used term in hockey, rather the winning goal is known as an "overtime winner" or "overtime goal" while the format is known as "sudden death".

The [[Ice hockey at the Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics ice hockey tournament]] uses the golden goal rule only in the gold medal game, with a 20-minute period of 5-on-5. The game ends if a goal is scored; otherwise, a penalty shootout will determine the winner. This method was used to determine the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Men's tournament#Gold medal game|2010 men's final]], where [[Sidney Crosby]] scored the game-winning goal 7:40 into overtime. As that goal won Canada the Gold Medal, it has become known as "The Golden Goal". Another happened at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics - Women's tournament#Gold medal game|2014 women's final]], as [[Marie-Philip Poulin]] scored at 8:10 of overtime for Canada. In both instances, the team they beat was the United States. The two teams met in the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's tournament#Gold Medal Game|rematch]] 4 years later, and lasted the whole 20-minute overtime without a goal before the United States prevailed in double overtime for their first gold in 20 years. [[Jocelyne Lamoureux]] scored in the 6th round of that period while [[Meghan Agosta]] failed. [[Kirill Kaprizov]] scored at 9:40 of overtime as the Olympic Athletes from Russia beat Germany in the [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's tournament#Gold medal game|2018 men's final]].

==American football==
The [[National Football League]] introduced sudden death during the regular season in the NFL in [[1974 NFL season|1974]] and had always had it in its playoffs. Like the NHL, the NFL's rule comes into use at the end of regulation of any regular season game. Until 2011, it applied for playoff games as well. A new "quarter" is started, with a kickoff. Whichever team scores first—either through a [[field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] or through a [[touchdown]], or far more rarely a [[safety (American football score)|safety]]—wins the game and the game ends. Since {{NFL year|2017}} in the preseason and regular season, teams are given a "fifth quarter" of 10 minutes to decide the game. Originally if neither team scored after 15 minutes the game ended in a tie. Since the {{NFL year|2012}} season, each team gets one possession to score, unless one of them scores a touchdown or safety on its first possession. Sudden death rules apply if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. If after the OT period it remains tied during that time, the game still ends.

Because this presents a significant advantage to the team winning the coin toss to decide who receives the first overtime possession, the NFL moved in 2011 to require that if both teams have not had possession of the ball prior to the first score, then the team who does have possession must score a touchdown to end the game, preventing the team winning the coin toss from making a much shorter drive down the field and kicking a "golden goal" without the other team having a chance to touch the ball. Making the longer drive downfield and scoring a touchdown still ends the game immediately. This applied first in the postseason and later was adopted in the 2012 season. During the postseason, multiple 15-minute overtime "quarters" can be played until either team scores. The record for a number of overtimes in a professional football game is three, when on June 30, 1984, the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] defeated the [[Michigan Panthers]], 27–21, in the [[1984 USFL season|1984]] [[United States Football League|USFL]] playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.remembertheusfl.8m.com/greatestgame.html USFL's Greatest Game|publisher=Remember the USFL|accessdate=2012-08-06l]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL is the only American football league that currently uses the golden goal. Most levels of football, including high school, college, most indoor leagues, and Canadian football, use a system known as the "[[Kansas Playoff]]" that more closely resembles baseball [[Inning (baseball)|inning]]s or [[penalty shootout]]s. Some professional leagues, such as the modern [[United Football League (2009–)|United Football League]], use a system that guarantees each team has a possession before switching to sudden death.

==Rugby league==
{{Main|Golden point}}
A "Golden point" system, whereby a [[rugby league]] game whose 80 minutes have ended in a draw is decided by whichever team scores the first point (by whatever means) during a period of extra time is the winner. It was first used in 1997's [[Super League Tri-Series]].

==Association football==
Although the golden goal format was used in North American professional soccer football leagues as early as the 1970s, the term ''golden goal'' was introduced by [[FIFA]] in 1993 along with the rule change because the alternative term, "[[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]", was perceived to have negative connotations. In a knockout competition, following a draw, two fifteen-minute periods of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] are played. If either team [[Scoring in association football|scores a goal]] during extra time, the game ends immediately and the scoring team becomes the winner. The winning goal is known as the "golden goal". If there have been no goals scored after both periods of extra time, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] decides the game. The golden goal was not compulsory, and individual competitions using extra time could choose whether to apply it during extra time. The first [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] played with the rule was in [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]]; the first [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] played with the rule was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]].

The first golden goal recorded was on 13 March 1993 by [[Australia national under-20 soccer team|Australia]] against [[Uruguay national under-20 football team|Uruguay]] in a quarter-final match of the [[1993 FIFA World Youth Championship|World Youth Championship]]. The first major tournament final to be decided by such a goal was the [[1995 Football League Trophy Final|1995 Football League Trophy]], where [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] beat [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] 1–0, with a goal from [[Paul Tait (footballer, born 1971)|Paul Tait]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTFBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=fifa+youth+world+championships+goal+from+paul+tait&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-j9GwQCBPl&amp;sig=nwtDq1XZdc_3rncn5QJBaAXIc1A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixgt-R76_aAhWJwYMKHQwUAWIQ6AEINzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=fifa%20youth%20world%20championships%20goal%20from%20paul%20tait&amp;f=false|title=The Journey of the Worlds Most Popular Game- Football|last=Lakade|first=Dr Atul|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781387373734|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=self-published Lulu.com book - not sure of its reliability|date=June 2018}} followed by the [[UEFA Euro 1996 Final|1996 European Championship final]], won by [[Germany national football team|Germany]] over the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. The golden goal in this final was scored by [[Oliver Bierhoff]]. The first golden goal in World Cup history took place in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], as [[Laurent Blanc]] scored to enable [[France national football team|France]] to defeat [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in the Round of 16.

In [[Barbados v Grenada (1994)|a qualification game]] for the [[1994 Caribbean Cup]], [[Barbados national football team|Barbados]] deliberately scored a late [[own goal]] in a successful attempt to qualify for the finals by forcing golden-goal extra time against [[Grenada national football team|Grenada]], as an unusual tournament rule stated that golden goals counted double in calculating goal difference. Needing a two-goal victory to qualify, Barbados found themselves 2–1 up with three minutes left of normal time. After the Barbadians scored an own goal to bring the scoreline level at 2–2, Grenada tried to score in either net while Barbados defended both goals for the final three minutes of normal time.&lt;ref name="snopesowngoal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/sports/soccer/barbados.asp|title=Football Follies|date=July 6, 2008|publisher=snopes.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbados won the game in extra time and advanced to the next round.&lt;ref&gt;''The Barbadian'', January 3 2008, p5 &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, France defeated Italy in extra time in the [[UEFA Euro 2000 Final|2000 European Championship final]] when [[David Trezeguet]] scored a golden goal. France thus became the first holder of both the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship in history since [[West Germany]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]].

The following year, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] overcame [[Deportivo Alavés]] in the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup Final]] with an [[Own goal|own]] golden goal by [[Delfí Geli]] to make the score 5–4 to Liverpool.

The golden goal was used in the FIFA World Cup for the last time in 2002, when Turkey defeated Senegal in the quarter finals when [[İlhan Mansız]] scored what would be the final golden goal in male tournaments. However, the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup|2003 Women's World Cup]] final was decided by a golden goal as Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 with a header by [[Nia Künzer]] in the 98th minute.

===Silver goal===
For the 2002–2003 season, [[UEFA]] introduced a new rule, the silver goal, to decide a competitive match. In extra time the team leading after the first fifteen-minute half would win, but the game would no longer stop the instant a team scored. Competitions that operated extra time would be able to decide whether to use the golden goal, the silver goal, or neither procedure during extra time.

On 27 August 2003, Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] qualified for the group stage of the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds|2003–04 UEFA Champions League]] by virtue of the silver goal against Austrian club [[Grazer AK|GAK]] after the two legs finished 1–1 each after 90 minutes. In extra time, Ajax was able to take advantage of GAK having two players sent off when [[Tomáš Galásek]] scored from a penalty in the 103rd minute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2003/matches/round=1711/match=73057/postmatch/report/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a year later on 1 July 2004, Galásek would be on the field when the silver goal was featured in the only major competitive match to be decided by a silver goal: that of the semi-final match at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] between [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. However, the silver goal would eliminate the Czech Republic as [[Traianos Dellas]] scored for Greece after a [[corner kick]] in the last two seconds of the first period of extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2004/matches/round=1583/match=1059193/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2004 - History - Greece-Czech Republic – UEFA.com|first=|last=uefa.com|date=1 July 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being the only silver goal ever seen in an international match, it was also the only goal Traianos Dellas ever scored in his international career.

===Abolition===

The golden goal and silver goal were widely perceived as failed experiments. They had not brought about more active and attacking play and there was confusion when events could choose among several different extra time rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2004/m=3/news=footballing-world-cheers-end-golden-goal-90982.html|title=Footballing world cheers end of golden goal|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=1 March 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden goal in the Euro 96 final was controversial, as the Czechs, who were on the losing side argued that the Germans' winning goal was offside. The silver goal has been called illogical in that it denies the losing team the chance of saving the match simply by virtue of when the goal is scored, a point best illustrated in the Euro 2004 semi-final: if the Greek goal had been scored 15 seconds later, that is immediately after the extra-time interval (instead of the last two seconds of the first period of extra time), the Czechs would have had nearly 15 minutes to attempt to score the equalizer. Furthermore, one team could benefit unfairly from the conditions, such as if a strong wind aided one side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm|title=Time running out for silver goal|website=www.rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]] announced that, after Euro 2004, both the golden goal and silver goal methods would be removed from the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. Since the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Germany]], the golden goal has never been used in the event of a tied match during the knockout stage,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur.i1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/i/eu/fifa/regen.pdf 2006 World Cup drops golden goal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601061039/http://eur.i1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/i/eu/fifa/regen.pdf |date=2006-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[FIFA]] restored the original rules: in the event of a tied game after the original 90 minutes, two straight 15-minute periods of extra time are played. If a tie still remains after that, the winner is decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,74459,00.html|title=FIFA Rules|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''halfback''' in [[Canadian football]], and most commonly the [[Canadian Football League]], currently refers to the [[defensive back]] rather than the [[running back]], as in [[American football]].  The defensive halfback lines up inside covering the [[slotback]].  They are usually slightly larger than the [[cornerback]] to assist the [[linebacker]]s in stopping the run.  They can also be seen backing off the line early, to counter the forward [[motion (football)|motion]] of a slotback, which is allowed before the snap in the CFL.

The cause of the difference in naming between the two positions between the American and Canadian game, which otherwise uses the same names for positions, stems from the early [[history of American football|history of the game]]. In both games, the early formations featured identical offensive and defensive formations, with seven down linemen and four players (five in Canada) in the backfield. Thus, both offense ''and'' defense had quarterbacks, halfbacks and fullbacks. Over the course of the 20th century, the American and Canadian games both placed an increased emphasis on [[forward pass]]ing, resulting in both offensive and defensive formations spreading out and morphing into modern [[formation (American football)|formations]]. Furthermore, the abolition of the [[one-platoon system]] in the 1940s led to a tendency for position names being used on only one side of the ball. The American game, which still held a significant running component, kept two running backs, which led to the retention of the "halfback" and "fullback" identifications on that side of the ball. In Canadian football, however, passing was a greater portion of the game (due in part to the larger field and one less [[down (American football)|down]] in that game) and only one running back was regularly used, leading to the offensive distinction between halfback and fullback eventually becoming obsolete. The offensive halfback was similar to a [[slotback]] and lined up off the tight end, running sweeps, pass patterns and performing blocking duties, but could also run out of the backfield in front of the fullback.

The rough equivalents of the halfback position in American football are the [[strong safety]] and [[Nickelback (gridiron football)|nickelback]].

'''John Mansfield''' (dates of birth and death unknown) was a noted English [[cricket]]er of the mid-18th century who played for [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].  He was a good batsman who played for the same Sevenoaks club as [[Val Romney]].  Mansfield was adept at the [[single wicket]] form of the game which was very popular during his career.

He is first mentioned as a member of the strong Kent team that played against [[All-England Eleven|All-England]] at the [[Artillery Ground]] on 31 August 1747.&lt;ref name=ASW&gt;[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], ''At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742-1751'', ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1749 English cricket season|1749 season]], Mansfield played for All-England himself, against [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]].  He appeared in a number of teams after this as a given man or as a member of a "best eleven", as well as in single wicket.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153251/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1746.html#mansfield#mansfield From Lads to Lord's – profile].&lt;/ref&gt;

He is last recorded playing in a five-a-side single wicket match at the [[Artillery Ground]] in 1754 and it is here that his first name is given for the only time in known sources.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies, volume 1'', Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''low rider''' is type of [[luggage carrier]] for bicycles on which luggage can be carried with a low center of gravity. Low riders are most commonly used by [[Bicycle touring|cycling tourists]] who carry luggage in [[pannier]]s on the front wheel.

For optimal balance the luggage on a front carrier should be placed low, and as closely as possible to the steering axis (right behind the front wheel axis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=van der Plas |first=Rob |date= |title=Handboek Fietstechniek |trans-title=Manual bicycle technology |url= |language=Dutch |location=Rijswijk |publisher=Uitgeverij Elmar BV |isbn=90-389-0896-2 |page=203,204 |year=1999 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

Like other types of luggage carriers low riders are usually constructed out of aluminum or (stainless) steel rods or tubing. The rods and tubes bent to the right shape and then mounting points are added to it.

All low riders have horizontal rails on which panniers can be attached. The most common diameter of the rails is 10 millimeters. Some low riders have two rails on each side. The lower rail allows the luggage to be carried near the center of gravity of the wheel, while the higher rail provides more clearance from obstacles when cycling over rough terrain.&lt;ref name="jh" /&gt;

Low riders can be made out of two separate parts or joined together with a stabilizing bow, which increases the stiffness. Some low riders include a top platform on which more luggage can be packed.&lt;ref name="jh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoogstrate|first=John|title=Comparison of low rider front racks for touring bicycles|url=http://bikeshed.johnhoogstrate.nl/bicycle/rack/low_rider_comparison/|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Installation ==
Low riders are specifically designed to be mounted on a specific kind of fork.&lt;ref name="jh" /&gt;
Touring bicycles usually have a [[Bicycle fork|front fork]] with one or two threaded eyelets for [[Screw#ISO metric screw thread|M5 bolts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Sheldon|title=Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary Ta-To|url=http://sheldonbrown.com/gloss_ta-o.html|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the front [[Fork end|dropout]] on each side. These are for mounting fenders and/or luggage carrier. Another mid-fork eyelet "braze-on" is positioned 160 to 175&amp;nbsp;mm above it for mounting a low rider front luggage carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Touring - Lowrider boss location - how does your bike measure up?|url=http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-800876.html|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no established standard for the position of the mid-fork eyelet. Most low riders are adjustable to compensate for this.
Some forks have mid-fork eyelets on the inside as well as outside to provide mounting of some specialized carriers such as the Tubus Duo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tubus.com/product.php?xn=17&lt;/ref&gt;
For bicycles that do not have these eyelets or "braze-ons", various alternatives exist. Some of these come in the form of "U-Bolts", clamps, or some sort of clamp-on eyelet (see Tubus Aluminum Alloy Fork Mounting Kit) 
When installing carriers, a drop of thread locking compound is advised to ensure that the screws do not loosened from vibrations under load.

}}
{{algebraic notation|pos=example}}

An '''outpost''' is a square on the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh {{chessgloss|rank}} which is protected by a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] and which cannot be attacked by an opponent's pawn.  Such a square is a [[hole (chess)|hole]] for the opponent {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}. In the figure to the right,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1214005 [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]] vs. [[Vassily Ivanchuk|Ivanchuk]], [[Melody Amber chess tournament|Amber]], 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; c4 is an outpost, occupied by White's knight.  It cannot be attacked by Black's pawns – there is no pawn on the d-{{chessgloss|file}} and Black's pawn on the b-file is too far advanced.

Outposts are a favourable position from which to launch an attack, particularly using a [[Knight (chess)|knight]].

Knights are most efficient when they are close to the enemy's stronghold. This is because of their short reach, something not true of [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]], [[rook (chess)|rooks]] and [[queen (chess)|queens]]. They are also more effective in the centre of the board than on the edges. Therefore, the ideal to be aimed at is an outpost in one of the central (c-, d-, e- or f-) files in an advanced position (e.g. the sixth rank) with a knight. Knowledge of outposts and their effectiveness is crucial in exploiting situations involving an [[Isolated pawn|isolated queen's pawn]].

On the other hand, [[Aron Nimzowitsch|Nimzowitsch]] argued when the outpost is in one of the flank (a-, b-, g- and h-) files the ideal piece to make use of the outpost is a rook. This is because the rook can put pressure on all the squares along the rank.

The team soon find out, however, that Geiser was obliged to take the less-than-stellar players on in order to win a bet, provoking anger in Kanin, his friends and his mother Diane.

With Diane's help, the team overthrow Geiser and he is replaced by Billy, a retired school baseball coach. The team soon find out, however, that their new coach requires just as much self-assurance as they do. Through this they discover the value of teamwork.

It has hosted college football, college soccer, baseball exhibitions, boxing matches, a [[Tour DuPont|cycling]] race, a [[2002 American Le Mans Series|Le Mans]] auto race, marathons and dozens of major concerts and events.

RFK was one of the first major stadiums designed specifically as a multi-sport facility to host [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]]. Although other stadiums already served this purpose, such as [[Cleveland Stadium]] (1931) and Baltimore's [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] (1950), RFK was one of the first to employ what became known as the circular "[[cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]" design.

It is owned and operated by [[Events DC]] (the successor agency to the DC Armory Board), a quasi-public organization affiliated with the city government under a long-term lease from the [[National Park Service]], which owns the land; the lease expires in 2038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Will Study RFK Stadium Options in Wake of Soccer Deal|first=Mike|last=DeBonis|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-02/local/41000776_1_stadium-deal-soccer-deal-stadium-revenue|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 2, 2013|access-date=September 30, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914225713/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-02/local/41000776_1_stadium-deal-soccer-deal-stadium-revenue|archivedate=September 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Planning===
The idea of a stadium at this location originated in 1932 when the [[Theodore Roosevelt Association|Roosevelt Memorial Association (RMA)]] proposed a [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/cph/item/2002709006/  National Stadium] for the site and Allied Architects, a group of local architects organized in 1925 to secure large-scale projects from the government, made designs for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Pamela|last2=Tepfer|first2=Diane|title=Capital Drawings: Architectural Designs for Washington, D.C., from the Library of Congress|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tcbCO3_lq2oC}}|date=2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=0801872324|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "National Stadium" in Washington was an idea that had been pursued since 1916, when Congressman [[George Murray Hulbert|George Hulbert]] of [[New York's 21st congressional district|New York]] proposed the construction of a 50,000-seat stadium at [[East Potomac Park]] for the purpose of attracting the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]]. It was thought that such a stadium could attract [[Davis Cup]] tennis matches, polo tournaments and the annual [[Army–Navy Game|Army-Navy football game]]. A later effort by DC Director of Public Buildings and Parks [[Ulysses S. Grant III]] and Congressman [[Hamilton Fish III|Hamilton Fish]] of [[New York's 26th congressional district|New York]] sought to turn the National Stadium into a 100,000-seat memorial to [[Theodore Roosevelt]], suitable for hosting inaugurations, possibly on the [[National Mall]] or [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]]. This attracted the attention of the RMA, which suggested the East Capital location. This would allow the [[Lincoln Memorial]], then under construction west of the Capitol, and the Roosevelt memorial to become bookend monuments to the two great Republican presidents. The effort lost steam when Congress chose not to fund the stadium in time to move the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympics]] from [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dyersson|first1=Mark|last2=Trumpboer|first2=Robert|title=The Rise of Stadiums in the Modern United States: Cathedrals of Sport|date=13 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317989287|pages=59–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a stadium gained support in 1938, when Senator [[Robert Rice Reynolds|Robert Reynolds]] of [[North Carolina]] pushed for the creation of a municipal outdoor stadium within the District, citing the "fact that America is the only major country not possessing a stadium with facilities to accommodate the Olympic Games". The following year a model of the proposed stadium, to be located near the current site of RFK Stadium, was presented to the public. A few years later, on December 20, 1944, Congress created a nine-man National Memorial Stadium Commission to study the idea.&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Jay|title=Return to RFK|url=http://jay.typepad.com/william_jay/2005/01/return_to_rfk.html|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They intended the stadium to be a memorial to the veterans of the World Wars. The commission wrote a report recommending that a 100,000-seat stadium be built near the site of RFK in time for the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]], but it failed to get funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Brett|title=Capital Sporting Grounds: A History of Stadium and Ballpark Construction in Washington, Part 3|date=24 November 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786452501|pages=139–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignored in the early 1950s, a new stadium again drew interest in 1954. Congressman [[Charles R. Howell]] of [[New Jersey's 4th congressional district|New Jersey]] proposed legislation to build a stadium, again with hopes of attracting the Olympics. He pushed for a report, completed in 1956 by the National Capital Planning Commission entitled "Preliminary Report on Sites for National Memorial Stadium", which identified the "East Capitol Site" to be used for the stadium. In September 1957, "The District of Columbia Stadium Act" was introduced and authorized a 50,000-seat stadium to be used by the Senators and Redskins at the Armory site. It was signed into law by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] on July 29, 1958, with an estimated cost of $7.5 to $8.6 million.&lt;ref name="Return"/&gt; The lease for the stadium was signed by the D.C. Armory Board and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] on December 12, 1958. The stadium, the first major multisport facility built for both football and baseball, was designed by George Dahl, Ewin Engineering Associates and Osborn Engineering. Groundbreaking for the {{nowrap|$24 million}} venue was in 1960 on July 8, and construction proceeded over the following 14 months.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The existing venue for baseball (and football) in Washington was [[Griffith Stadium]], about {{convert|4|mi|0|spell=in}} northwest.

While Redskins’ owner [[George Preston Marshall]] was pleased with the stadium, Senators' owner [[Calvin Griffith]] was not. It wasn't where he wanted it to be (in Northwest) and he'd have to pay rent and let others run the parking and concessions. The Senators' attendance figures had suffered after the arrival of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in [[1954 Baltimore Orioles season|1954]] and Griffith preferred the demographics and profit potential of the [[Minnesota]] market.&lt;ref name=subsbb&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TzMaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=myUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7217%2C3690475 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=UPI |title=Subsidize baseball. attorney suggests |date=July 30, 1958 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, when Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team, Griffith proposed that he be allowed to [[relocation of professional sports teams|move]] his team to [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]] and give the expansion team to Washington. Upon league approval, the team moved to [[1961 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota]] after the [[1960 Washington Senators season|1960]] season and Washington fielded a "new [[1961 Washington Senators season|Senators]]" team, entering the junior circuit in {{mlby|1961}} with the [[1961 Los Angeles Angels season|Los Angeles Angels]].&lt;ref name="Return"/&gt;

===Opening===
The stadium opened in autumn 1961 as District of Columbia Stadium (often shortened to D.C. Stadium); its first official event was an NFL regular season game on October 1, ten days after the final MLB baseball game at [[Griffith Stadium]]. The new venue opened for football even though construction wasn't completed until the following spring&lt;!--1962--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Jail"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jail is Stadium's Newest Asset|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/90430898|access-date=January 17, 2018|date=September 2, 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1961 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]] lost that game to the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] {{nowrap|24–21}} before 36,767 fans, including [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

The first major league baseball game was on April 9, [[1962 Washington Senators season|1962]] (after two exhibition games against the [[1962 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] had been cancelled).

When it opened, D.C. Stadium hosted the Redskins, [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Senators]], and the GWU Colonial football team, all of whom had previously used Griffith Stadium. The Colonials disbanded their football team after the [[1966 college football season|1966]] season, and the Senators left in the fall of 1971 for {{nowrap|[[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]]}} and became the [[1972 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] in [[Arlington Stadium|Arlington]] in [[1972 Texas Rangers season|1972]].

=== Early years ===
From 1961 to 1963, D.C. Stadium hosted the annual City Title game, matching the D.C. public school champion and the winner of the area's premier Catholic league, played before capacity crowds on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The 1963 game between St. John's, a predominantly white school in Northwest D.C., and Eastern, a majority black school just blocks from the stadium, ended in a racially motivated riot, only three days after the [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|funeral of President Kennedy]]. The City Title game for 1964 was cancelled and never played again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worst sports moments in D.C. history|url=http://www.espn.com/page2/wash/s/list/worstmoments.html|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the stadium emerged as an element in the [[Bobby Baker]] bribery scandal. Don B. Reynolds, a Maryland insurance businessman, made a statement in August 1964 which he claimed that [[Matthew McCloskey]], a former [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman and Kennedy's [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Ireland|ambassador]] to [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], paid a $25,000 kickback through Reynolds and at the instruction of Baker to the [[John F. Kennedy presidential campaign, 1960|Kennedy-Johnson campaign]] as payback for the stadium construction contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Key Man Held Back Records|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/17435272|access-date=January 29, 2018|work=Tucson Daily Citizen|date=February 2, 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker later went to jail for tax fraud, and the FBI investigated the awarding of the stadium contract, although McClosley was never charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10391831/mccloskey_probe/ |title=McCloskey Faces Suit, FBI Probe |url-access=limited |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |via=newspapers.com |date=January 23, 1964 |access-date=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaming the stadium===
The stadium was renamed in January 1969 for [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential]] candidate [[Robert F. Kennedy]],&lt;ref name=tbldrfk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QfNOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BAIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4964%2C5819035 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |agency=Associated Press |title=Stadium renamed for Robert Kennedy |date=January 19, 1968 |page=16A}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had been [[Assassination of Robert F.

For much of the 1970s and 1980s, RFK was primarily known as the home of the Redskins, where they played during their three Super Bowl championship seasons. It also hosted several short-lived professional soccer teams and in 1983–1984 the [[Washington Federals]] of the [[USFL]]. In [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980]], it hosted the [[Soccer Bowl '80|Soccer Bowl]], the championship game of the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]].

===D.C. United moves in, Redskins move out===
Major changes to the stadium came in 1996. Following the success of hosting matches in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] and [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympics]], RFK became home to one of the charter teams of the new [[Major League Soccer]]. On April 20, 1996 it played host to the first home match of [[D.C. United]], a 2–1 loss to the [[LA Galaxy]].

However, later that year the stadium hosted the Redskins' final home game in Washington, DC. After nearly a decade of negotiating for a new stadium with Mayors [[Sharon Pratt|Sharon Pratt Kelly]] and [[Marion Barry]], abandoning them in 1992 and 1993 in search of a suburban site and then having a 1994 agreement collapse in the face of neighborhood complaints, environmental concerns and a dispute in Congress (over what some members viewed as the team's racially insensitive name and the use of federal land for private profit), [[Jack Kent Cooke]] decided to move his team to Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weil|first1=Martin|last2=Wilgoren|first2=Debbi|title=Redskins Continue Negotiations Over RFK, New Stadium|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/1997/stadium/timeline/1992/dcdeal.htm|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=8 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schneider|first1=Howard|last2=Harris|first2=Hamil R.|title=BARRY'S STADIUM PLAN WOULD REPLACE RFK|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/11/10/barrys-stadium-plan-would-replace-rfk/0623f1dc-ffa3-4abf-a020-21b72f4e5974/|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=10 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sell|first1=Dave|title=FOR JACK KENT COOKE, THIS WEEKEND WAS A VERY BIG DEAL|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1995/12/05/for-jack-kent-cooke-this-weekend-was-a-very-big-deal/ad292bc8-a697-4967-91da-5004d8d03e88/|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=5 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 1996, the Redskins won their last game at RFK Stadium 37-10 over the Dallas Cowboys, reprising their  first win there in 1961, before 65,454, the largest football crowd in stadium history. The Redskins then moved east to [[FedExField]] in [[1997 Washington Redskins season|1997]], leaving [[D.C. United]] as the stadium's only major tenant for much of the next decade, though from 2001 to 2003 they were joined by the [[Washington Freedom]] of the short-lived [[Women's United Soccer Association]].

After hosting 16 exhibition games after the Senators' departure, baseball returned to RFK on a temporary basis in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington, D.C. Ballparks|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/mlb/y2004/m09/d30/c876716.jsp|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year the [[National League]]'s newly renamed [[Washington Nationals]] made it their home while a new permanent home, [[Nationals Park]], was constructed. On April 14, 2005, before a crowd of 45,496 including President Bush and MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]], the Nationals beat the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] 5-3 victory in their first game at RFK. President [[George W. Bush]], formerly a part-owner of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (the former Senators), threw out the first pitch becoming the last president, and the first since [[Richard Nixon]], to do so in RFK Stadium.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The last MLB game at RFK, a 5-3 Nationals win over the Phillies, was played on September 23, 2007 and in [[2008 Washington Nationals season|2008]] the Nationals moved to their new stadium.

===The last team leaves===
In 2008, RFK was once again primarily the host of [[D.C. United]], though it also hosted a [[college football]] [[bowl game]], the [[Military Bowl]], from [[2008 EagleBank Bowl|2008]] to [[2012 Military Bowl|2012]], before it moved in [[2013 Military Bowl|2013]] to {{nowrap|[[Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]]}} in [[Annapolis, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="Move to Annapolis"&gt;{{cite news |title=Military Bowl Moving to Annapolis, Adds Conference USA for '13|first=Chip|last=Patterson|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/blog/eye-on-college-football/22274326/military-bowl-moving-to-annapolis-adds-conference-usa-for-13 |work=[[CBS Sports]]|date=May 20, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 25, 2013, the District of Columbia and D.C.

==Name==
The stadium opened in October 1961 named the District of Columbia Stadium, but the media quickly shortened that to D.C. Stadium and sometimes, in the early days, as "Washington Stadium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Griffith Stadium Now Ghost Park|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/294671900|accessdate=17 January 2018|date=21 September 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 1969, in the last days of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson Administration]], [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] announced that the stadium would be renamed [[Robert F. Kennedy]] Memorial Stadium, in Kennedy's honor.&lt;ref name=wtophigin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tbldrfk/&gt; The official renaming ceremony was held {{nowrap|on June 7,&lt;ref name=wtophigin/&gt;&lt;ref name=rddecer/&gt;}} but by then many had already been referring to it as "RFK Stadium" or simply "RFK".&lt;ref name=Return/&gt; Coincidentally, following the death of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the Armory Board had directed that the stadium be renamed for him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kennedy Memorial|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43144743|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=The High Point Enterprise|date=6 December 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan faltered when a few weeks later the Philadelphia city council passed a bill renaming [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Stadium]] as "John F. Kennedy Stadium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stadium Honors John F. Kennedy|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/56822776|accessdate=28 January 2018|work=The Times Record|date=27 December 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Kennedy was not without connection to the stadium; as [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] in the early 1960s, his [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] played a role in the Redskins' racial integration.&lt;ref name="Smith, Thomas G. 2011 pp. 1-2"&gt;Smith, Thomas G., – Showdown: JFK and the Integration of the Washington Redskins, Beacon Press (2011), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Udall, Kennedy threatened to revoke the team's lease at the federally owned stadium until it promised to sign [[African American]] players.&lt;ref name="Smith, Thomas G. 2011 pp. 1-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Thomas G. |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/04/140066378/a-showdown-that-changed-footballs-racial-history |title=A 'Showdown' That Changed Football's Racial History |publisher=NPR |date=2011-09-04 |accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother John attended the first event there and threw out the first pitch. In 2008, a nearby [[Ethel Kennedy Bridge|bridge]] was renamed for [[Ethel Kennedy]], Robert Kennedy's wife.

On April 14, 2005, just before the Nationals' home opener, the D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission announced an agreement with the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] under which the military would pay the city about $6 million for [[naming rights]] and the right to place recruiting kiosks and signage in the stadium. In return, the stadium would be dubbed "Armed Forces Field at RFK Stadium".&lt;ref name=armedforcesfield&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51287-2005Apr13.html|title=RFK's Field May Be Named For Military|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was dropped within days, however, after several prominent members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] questioned the use of public funds for a stadium sponsorship.&lt;ref name=profund&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/03/AR2005050301441.html|title=Investing Firm Close to Deal on Renaming RFK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar proposals to sell the naming rights to the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]],&lt;ref name=armedforcesfield /&gt; ProFunds (a Bethesda, Maryland investment company),&lt;ref name=profund /&gt; and Sony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2006/04/17/tidbits1.html|title=Surround sound|work=Washington Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; were formed and discarded in 2005 and 2006.

==Tenants==
===Redskins (1961–1996)===
RFK Stadium was home to the Redskins for 36 seasons, from [[1961 Washington Redskins season|1961]] through [[1996 Washington Redskins season|1996]]. The football field was aligned northwest to southeast, along the first base line.

&lt;!--The team's return to prominence as a football power began the same year ([[1960 Washington Redskins season|1960]]) that the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|original baseball Senators]] played their final season, relocating in [[1961 Minnesota Twins season|1961]] to Minnesota as the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]].--&gt;The Redskins' first game in D.C. Stadium was its first event, a 24–21 loss to the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 1, [[1961 Washington Redskins season|1961]]. The first win in the stadium came at the end of the season on December 17, over its future archival, the struggling second-year [[1961 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. The Redskins played 266 regular season games at RFK, compiling a {{winning percentage|173|102|3|record=y}} record, including an impressive {{nowrap|11–1}} record in the playoffs.&lt;ref name=goff20171020/&gt;

In its twelfth season, RFK hosted its first professional football playoff game on Christmas Eve [[1972 Washington Redskins season|1972]], a 16–3 Redskins' win over the [[1972 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]]. It was the city's first postseason game in three decades, following the [[1942 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship game]] victory in [[1942 Washington Redskins season|1942]]. The stadium hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] five times ([[1972–73 NFL playoffs|1972]], [[1982–83 NFL playoffs|1982]], [[1983–84 NFL playoffs|1983]], [[1987–88 NFL playoffs|1987]], and [[1991–92 NFL playoffs|1991]]), 2nd only to [[Candlestick Park]], and the Redskins won them all. They are the only team to win five NFC titles at the same stadium. In the subsequent [[Super Bowl]]s, Washington won three ([[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]], [[Super Bowl XXII|XXII]], [[Super Bowl XXVI|XXVI]]).

The Redskins' last game at the stadium was a victory, as 56,454 saw a {{nowrap|37–10}} win over the division champion [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] on December 22, [[1996 Washington Redskins season|1996]].&lt;ref name=fparfk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SeoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0QcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6112%2C4295371|work=Free Lance-Star |location=(Fredericksburg, Virginia)|agency=Associated Press |last=White |first=Joseph |title=Final play at RFK |date=December 23, 1996 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iardar&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SeoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0QcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4219%2C4328685|work=Free Lance-Star |location=(Fredericksburg, Virginia)|agency=Associated Press |last=White |first=Joseph |title=It's a Redskins day at RFK |date=December 23, 1996 |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.C. United (1996–2017)===
[[File:Rfkstadium.png|200px|right|thumb|RFK Stadium during a [[D.C. United]] soccer match in March 2009]]
[[D.C. United]] of [[Major League Soccer]] played nearly 450 matches at RFK Stadium from the team's debut in 1996 until 2017, when they moved to a new stadium. During that time, RFK hosted three [[MLS Cup]] finals, including the 1997 match won by D.C. United. With its new stadium, [[Audi Field]], due to open on July 14, 2018, D.C. United played its final game at RFK on October 22, 2017, completing 22 seasons at the stadium, during which the team won four league titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Alicia|title=DC United to open Audi Field on July 14 vs. Vancouver Whitecaps FC|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2018/01/04/dc-united-open-audi-field-july-14-vs-vancouver-whitecaps-fc|accessdate=12 January 2018|date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goff20171022&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2017/10/22/d-c-united-celebrates-its-past-on-emotional-final-day-at-rfk-stadium/|title=D.C.

When they shared the stadium with the Nationals from 2005 to 2007, the playing surface drew criticism along with the dimensions of the field that resulted from baseball use. D.C. United′s departure left RFK with no professional sports tenant, however after moving to Audi Field, D.C. United continued to use the outer practice fields at RFK  for training and leased locker room and basement space there.&lt;ref name=goff20171020/&gt;

===Senators (1962–1971)===
[[File:District of Columbia Stadium 1963.jpeg|thumb|220px|D.C. Stadium in [[1963 Washington Senators season|1963]], looking west]]
The expansion [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] of the [[American League]] played at RFK Stadium from [[1962 Washington Senators season|1962]] through [[1971 Washington Senators season|1971]]. They played their first season in [[1961 Washington Senators season|1961]] at [[Griffith Stadium]].

In its ten seasons as the Senators' home field, RFK Stadium was known as a hitters' park, aided by the stagnant heat (and humidity) of Washington summers. Slugger Frank Howard, ({{height|ft=6|in=7}}, {{convert|255|lb|abbr=on}})&lt;!--left fielder--&gt;, hit a number of tape-measure home runs, few of which landed in the center field area of the upper deck. The seats he hit with his home runs are painted white, rather than the gold of the rest of the upper deck. Howard came to the Senators from the [[1964 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] in [[1965 Washington Senators season|1965]]. He hit the Senators′ final RFK homer, in the sixth inning on September 30, 1971. With two outs in the top of the ninth,&lt;ref name=mjffss&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6t8jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5CgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3441%2C216303 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=press dispatches |title=Fans' farewell: 'Short stinks' |date=October 1, 1971 |page=14, part 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a fan riot turned a 7–5 Senators lead over the [[1971 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] into a 9–0 forfeit loss, the first in the [[Major League Baseball|majors]] in 17 years.&lt;ref name=ffothes&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B_RNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=14oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7276%2C3891864 |newspaper=Free Lance-Star |location=Fredericksburg, Virginia |agency=Associated Press |last=Lowitt |first=Bruce |title=Fans 'finish off' Senators |date=October 1, 1971 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/10/01/page/63/article/senators-last-hurrah-fans-cause-forfeit-9-0 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |agency=UPI |title=Senators last 'hurrah;' fans cause forfeit 9-0 |date=October 1, 1971 |page=1, section 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Senators' only winning season came in [[1969 Washington Senators season|1969]] at {{nowrap|{{Winning percentage|86|76|record=y}}}}; they never made the postseason. They had a home record at RFK of {{nowrap|{{winning percentage|363|441|record=y}},}}. The stadium hosted the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] twice, in [[1962 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|1962]] (first of two) and [[1969 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1969]], both won by the visiting National League. Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon all attended games there. President Johnson was scheduled to throw out the first pitch in [[1968 Washington Senators season|1968]], but the opening game was delayed following the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], so [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]] got the privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vice President Opens 1968 Baseball Season|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16960018/|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Beckley Post-Herald|date=11 April 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Nixon was to throw out the first ball at the 1969 game to celebrate baseball's centennial, but it was postponed due to rain and so Nixon chose instead to greet the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts. Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] filled in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hopes Pinned on Improved Weather Today|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/283253092|accessdate=15 January 2018|work=The Daily Times of Salisbury, Maryland|date=23 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomats (1974–1981, 1988–1990)===
Between 1974 and 1990, three soccer teams played at RFK under the name [[Washington Diplomats]]. In [[1974 North American Soccer League season|1974]], two Maryland businessmen purchased the rights to the Baltimore Bays of the semi-professional [[American Soccer League (1933–83)|American Soccer League]], moved the team to the District and renamed it the Washington Diplomats. They signed a lease calculating that an average of 12,000 spectators would allow them to break even. Despite [[white flight]], owners thought that recent completion of the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Beltway]], the stadium's 12,000 parking spaces, and future completion of a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station would facilitate attendance. Games were scheduled for Saturday and prices were set low. The Diplomats inaugural game was on May 4 with an  attendance of 10,175; Mayor [[Walter Washington]] ceremonially kicked off the game, but the Dips lost 5–1 to the [[1973 North American Soccer League season|defending]] [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|NASL]] champion [[Philadelphia Atoms]]. Attendance dropped over the course of the season.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elzey|first1=Chris|last2=Wiggins|first2=David K.|title=DC Sports: The Nation's Capital at Play|date=Jul 15, 2015|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=9781610755665|pages=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1975 North American Soccer League season|1975]], the Diplomats were informed that the recently installed natural turf at RFK would not be ready for opening day, so they scheduled their first two home games that season for [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T. Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. After the games attracted more than 10,000 fans each, the Diplomats moved most of their home games to Woodson, but then moved the last five back to RFK once soccer superstar [[Pelé]] was added to the roster of the [[New York Cosmos (1970–85)|New York Cosmos]]. Pelé was so popular that the 1975 Cosmos-Diplomats match broke the NASL attendance record at 35,620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pele Packs Stands at RFK Stadium|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43269802|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=The Capitol|date=30 June 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the success of the Cosmos game, attendance declined again and prior to the [[1976 North American Soccer League season|1976]] season the Diplomats announced that they had scheduled every home game, except the one against the Cosmos, at Woodson. During the season, they moved that game to Woodson.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

After averaging 5,963 at Woodson, the Diplomats decided to ramp up their marketing and move back to RFK in [[1977 North American Soccer League season|1977]]. Despite changes to everything from uniforms to the cheerleaders, the team's disappointing on-the-field performance hurt attendance (a ~31,000 fan game against Pelé and the Cosmos notwithstanding). In [[1978 North American Soccer League season|1978]], attendance continued to fall, even though the Dips made the playoffs. Despite success on the field during the 1978 and [[1979 North American Soccer League season|1979]] seasons (including a franchise-best 19 wins in '79) and a negligible amount of revenue from “[[Indoor soccer|indoor]] Dips” games at the D.C. Armory during the offseason, the franchise continued to lose money.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

In [[1980 North American Soccer League season|1980]], they signed Dutch international superstar [[Johan Cruyff]], the Pelé of the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], from the [[Los Angeles Aztecs]]. Needing 20,000 fans per game to break even, they managed to attract 24,000 for the opener and a District record 53,351 for the game against the Pele-less Cosmos (the fifth-largest soccer crowd at RFK ever), but the team failed to break-even financially. After racking up debts of $5 million, the first incarnation of the Dips folded.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

Three months later, the [[Detroit Express]] announced a move to D.C. for [[1981 North American Soccer League season|1981]], and that they would also be the Diplomats. They had trouble attracting fans; &lt;!--after the NASL championship game, the "[[Soccer Bowl '80|Soccer Bowl]]", was held at RFK,--&gt; and soon folded. The Diplomats of the NASL, racked up an impressive {{winning percentage|60|29|record=y}} record at RFK and were {{nowrap|1–1}} in the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Diplomats Games|url=http://soccerstats.us/teams/washington-diplomats/games/|website=Soccer Stats|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

In 1987, a new soccer team, also called the [[Washington Diplomats (1988–90)|Washington Diplomats]], was formed. They played at RFK, and sometimes at the RFK auxiliary field, for three seasons as part of the [[American Soccer League (1988–89)|ASL]] and then the [[American Professional Soccer League|APSL]]. They won the ASL Championship in 1988, but often drew fewer than 1000 fans. In 1990 they finished last in the Southern Division of the APSL East, were unable to pay the rent and folded in October 1990.&lt;ref name="Merger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jackson|first1=James H.|title=Bays,Stars merger Diplomats kick in|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-10-30/sports/1990303001_1_maryland-bays-diplomats-baltimore-washington-area|accessdate=31 January 2018|date=30 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Washington Colonials (1961–1966)===
The other team to move from Griffith to D.C. Stadium was the [[George Washington Colonials football|George Washington University Colonials]] [[college football]] team. The stadium was dedicated during the October 7, 1961 game against VMI, the first college football game there, which GWU won 30-6. The Colonials were forced to play their first three games on the road to allow the stadium to be completed. In following years, because the Senators had priority, GWU waited until October (when baseball season was over) to schedule games. From 1961 to 1964 they played road games in September, and in 1965 and 1966 they played at high school stadiums in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George Washington U Drops Grid Program|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522053/|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=20 January 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colonials, Like Cats, Seek First Win Saturday|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16522071/|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=The Daily Herald|date=27 September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colonials had no real success at D.C. Stadium. GWU was {{winning percentage|22|35|record=y}} during its D.C. Stadium years and never posted a winning record. The Colonials were 11–13 at D.C. Stadium, facing off against [[1962 Army Cadets football team|Army]] twice and against a [[1964 Liberty Bowl|Liberty Bowl]]-bound [[1964 West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] in 1964 (all losses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington Colonials School History|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/george-washington/|website=Sports Reference|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps their biggest win was the 1964 upset of [[1964 Villanova Wildcats football team|Villanova]], which came to Washington with a 6–1 record. Sophomore quarterback [[Garry Lyle]], the school's last [[1967 NFL/AFL Draft#Round three|NFL draftee]], led the Colonials to a {{nowrap|13–6 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George Washington Upsets Villanova|work=Oakland Tribune|date=15 November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The final George Washington football game to date, and the last at D.C. Stadium, came on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]], November 24, 1966, when the team lost to {{cfb link|team=Villanova Wildcats|title=Villanova}}, 16–7.&lt;ref name=lastgame&gt;Denlinger, Kenneth. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/142961877/ Villanova Claws GW In Final, 16-7]". ''The Washington Post''. November 25, 1966. p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the season was over, GW President Dr. [[Lloyd Hartman Elliott|Lloyd H. Elliott]] chose to reevaluate GW's football program.&lt;ref name= decides&gt;Denlinger, Kenneth. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/143289963/ GW Decides On Football Path Today]". ''The Washington Post''. January 19, 1967. p. G1.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 19, 1966, head coach [[Jim Camp]], conference coach of the year, resigned citing the uncertainty. The next day, a member of the Board of Trustees announced that the school would drop football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=George Washington Will Drop Football|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16521823/|accessdate=14 January 2018|date=21 December 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 19, 1967, the decision became official.&lt;ref name=endfootball&gt;Denlinger, Kenneth. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/143245607/ Within Reach GW Will Put Emphasis on Basketball Recruiters Abound Transfer Rules Waived]". ''The Washington Post''. January 20, 1967. p. E1.&lt;/ref&gt; GW decided to use the football program's funding to build a new field house for the basketball team.&lt;ref name= endfootball/&gt; Poor game attendance and the expense, estimated at $254,000 during the 1966 season, contributed to the decision. Former GW player Harry Ledford believed that most people were unwilling to drive on Friday nights to D.C. Stadium, which was perceived as an unsafe area and lacked rail transit. [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Virginia]] were nationally competitive teams that drew potential suburban spectators away from GW.&lt;ref name="gwh"&gt;[http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/1999/08/30/Sports/When-We.Played.Football.The.Gw.Boys.Of.Fall.18901966-16420.shtml When we played football: the GW boys of fall, 1890-1966] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727164627/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/1999/08/30/Sports/When-We.Played.Football.The.Gw.Boys.Of.Fall.18901966-16420.shtml |date=2011-07-27 }}, ''[[The GW Hatchet]]'', August 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationals (2005–2007)===
After playing as the [[Montreal Expos]] from [[1969 Montreal Expos season|1969]] to [[2004 Montreal Expos season|2004]], the Expos franchise moved to Washington, D.C., to become the [[Washington Nationals]] for the [[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005 season]]. The Nationals played their first three seasons ([[2005 Washington Nationals season|2005]]–[[2007 Washington Nationals season|2007]]) at RFK, then moved to [[Nationals Park]] in [[2008 Washington Nationals season|2008]]. While the Nationals played at RFK, it was the fourth-oldest active stadium in the [[Major League Baseball|majors]], behind [[Fenway Park]], [[Wrigley Field]] and [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gwhatchet.com/2007/09/24/ross-romano-nats-move-from-halfway-house-to-home/|last=Romano|first=Ross|title=Nats Move From Halfway House to Home|newspaper=GW Hatchet|date=September 24, 2007|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Nationals′ three season there, RFK then became known as a pitchers' park. While [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]] hit at least 44 home runs for three straight seasons at RFK for the [[Washington Senators (1961-1971)|second Washington Senators franchise]] from [[1968 Washington Senators season|1968]] through [[1970 Washington Senators season|1970]], the 2005 Nationals had only one hitter with more than 15 home runs, [[José Guillén]] with 24. However, in his lone season with the team in [[2006 Washington Nationals season|2006]], [[Alfonso Soriano]] hit 46 home runs.

During their three seasons at RFK the Nationals failed to make the playoffs or post a winning record.

=== Howard Bison (1970–2016) ===
No team has a longer history with RFK Stadium than the [[Howard Bison football]] team, who played there 42 times over 46 years. Between their first game in 1970 and last in 2016, they earned a {{winning percentage|22|17|3|record=y}} record, winning more games at RFK than any other college football program.

Looking to play on a bigger stage than [[William H. Greene Stadium|Howard Stadium]], they began scheduling games at RFK. Howard's first RFK game was a 24–7 victory over [[Fisk University|Fisk]] on October 24, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perfect 1920 Bisons Reunite After 50 Years|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/39194087|accessdate=19 January 2018|date=17 October 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1974 to 1976, Howard played all but one of their home games at RFK and in 1977 they played half their home games there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington, D.C.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/39204083/|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=The Pittsburgh Courier|date=10 August 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1977 season they returned to Howard Stadium, but continued to play their annual homecoming game at RFK through 1985. After the 1985 season, Howard Stadium was refurbished, and renamed, and for the next 7 years Howard played all of their home games there.

In 1992 they returned to RFK for a game against [[Bowie State University|Bowie State]] that was marked by taunting and a game-ending scuffle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hente|first1=Karl|title=HOWARD ROUTS BOWIE ST.

In 2000 that game moved to Giants Stadium and Howard spent more than a decade away from RFK.

Starting in 2011 and through the 2016 season, Howard played in the Nation's Football Classic at RFK, matching up against [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] at first and then Hampton again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Gene|title=Howard and Hampton reprise the battle for the ‘real HU’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/howard-and-hampton-reprise-the-battle-for-the-real-hu/2015/09/17/16a0aec6-5d6c-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html|access-date=January 21, 2018|date=September 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Events DC announced that they would discontinue the Classic and thus the last Bison game at RFK Stadium was a 34-7 loss to Hampton on September 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopkins|first1=Tatyana|title=Nation’s Football Classic Cancelled|url=http://washingtoninformer.com/nations-football-classic-cancelled/|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=The Washington Informer|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Gene|title=Howard football suffers demoralizing loss to Hampton in Nation’s Football Classic|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/howard-football-suffers-demoralizing-loss-to-hampton-in-nations-football-classic/2016/09/17/dc237f00-7d1b-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html|access-date=January 15, 2018|date=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom (2001–2003)===
For three seasons, RFK was home to the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] Washington team, the [[Washington Freedom]]. On April 14, 2001, the  Freedom defeated the [[Bay Area CyberRays]] 1-0 in WUSA's inaugural match before 34,198 fans, the largest crowd in WUSA history and the largest crowd to watch a women's professional sports event in DC history (the largest crowd for a women's sporting event was 45,946 for the 1996 women's Olympic soccer tournament, also at RFK). Over three years, the Freedom racked up a 15-9-6 record at RFK and finished as one of the league's top teams. They came in 2nd in 2002 and won the league's Founder's Cup in 2003. They played all of their home games at RFK, except for one in 2001 at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis to avoid the Washington Grand Prix. Their last game at RFK as part of WUSA was on August 2, 2003 when they defeated the San Jose Cyber Rays. They won the final Founder's Cup in August 2003 and returned to RFK a few days later - minus the players who were playing in the 2003 Women's World Cup - for a victory celebration with the fans, which would be their final WUSA event at RFK. WUSA suspended operation the next month. Their victory in the Founders Cup means that the Freedom won both the first and last games in WUSA history. For a time, their championship banner hung in RFK, but when the Nationals moved in, the banner was moved to the [[Maryland SoccerPlex|Maryland Soccerplex]].

The Freedom continued, first as exhibition team called the Washington Freedom Soccer Club, and then as a member of the W-League and the Women's Professional Soccer league in 2006. Their home stadium was the Maryland Soccerplex, but they continued to play a few games at RFK. In 2004, the played an exhibition at Nottingham Forest, which they won 8-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweezy|first1=Christian|title=Nothing Left to Lose|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50308-2004Jul14.html|accessdate=26 February 2018|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They returned again on June 22, 2008 in a W-League match, which they won 5-0, against the [[Richmond Kickers Destiny]] that was part of a doubleheader with DC United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Washington Freedom W-League Thread|url=http://www.bigsoccer.com/threads/2008-washington-freedom-w-league-thread-r.646674/page-2|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Freedom moved to the WPS and while they continued to play most of their home games in Maryland, they played 3 of 10 home games at RFK in 2009 and one game there in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D.C. UNITED AND WASHINGTON FREEDOM TO PLAY DOUBLE-HEADER AT RFK STADIUM MAY 1|url=http://www.dcsec.com/pdf/rfk-stadium-hosts-soccer-double-header-may%201.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goff|first1=Stephen|title=Freedom, United Kick Off First of Three Twin Bills at RFK Stadium|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/22/AR2009052203348.html|accessdate=26 February 2018|date=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after WUSA suspended operations, the Freedom went 5-0-1 at RFK, bringing their combined RFK total to 20-9-7. After the 2010 season, the Freedom's owners had had enough, and sold the team to [[Dan Borislow]], owner of the phone service [[MagicJack]]. He moved them to Boca Raton, Florida for the team's last season. The Freedom's final game at RFK was a 3-1 victory over [[Saint Louis Athletica]] on May 1, 2010.

===Whips (1967–68) ===
In 1967, D.C. Stadium became the home of its first professional soccer team, the [[Washington Whips]]. They played 23 regular season games at D.C. Stadium over 16 months, putting together a 13-5-5 home record as well as losing an exhibition against [[Pele|Pele's]] Santos Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington Whips Games|url=http://soccerstats.us/teams/washington-whips/games/|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;!--Note that the Boston Beacons game on Aug 25, 1968 is a repeat of the one from the 23rd. There was no match on the 25th --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 20,189 fans attended the Santos exhibition, more than three times as large as a typical Whips match, making it the most heavily attended soccer game in DC history at the time. The game was heavily promoted in the local press and the Whips, who were struggling to attract fans to their regular matches, provided additional incentive through a “Meet Pele” contest.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

RFK served as the venue for the inaugural match of the [[United Soccer Association]] (USA), a May 26, 1967 match between the Whips and the [[Cleveland Stokers]], won by the Stokers.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

In their first season, the Whips were one of the league's top teams and they were staffed by the Aberdeen Football Club of the Scottish Football League, or the Aberdeen Dons. They finished 5–2–5&lt;!-- The Whips played 13 matches, but a 1–1 tie with the wolves on June 20 was vacated and the game replayed at the end of the season. The Whips won that game. --&gt;, good enough to win the Eastern Division and play for the USA Championship against the [[Los Angeles Wolves]].

The owners estimated that they needed to attract 16,000 fans per game, but they never broke 10,000 and averaged only 6,200. Towards the end of the 1967 season, the Whips resorted to organizing British Isles sporting contests such as cricket, hurling, and rugby before games in hopes of luring expatriates.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

In 1968, in order to stay viable, they negotiated a reduction in the lease payment and reduced admission prices by one-third; among other discounts. The USA merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the new [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]]. Despite problems on and off the field, the team found itself in a battle for a playoff spot and towards the end of the season crowds swelled to as much as 14,227 in what proved to be the deciding match for the NASL Atlantic Division title. This September 7, 1968 match against the [[Atlanta Chiefs]] was the last for the Whips at D.C. Stadium. That season, the team went 15-10-7 drawing an average of 6,586 fans. After a tour of Europe, the Whips folded in October 1968.&lt;ref name="DartsWhipsDips"/&gt;

===Federals (1983–1984)===
Washington's only [[USFL]] team, the [[Washington Federals]], played two seasons at RFK and during that time, they had the league's worst record each season, and, in 1984, the lowest per-game attendance. For the opening game, 38,000 fans showed up to see the return of former Redskins coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], the coach of the [[Chicago Blitz]], in a game the Federals lost, 28–7. But attendance quickly dropped off, with as few as 7,303 showing up for a late-season game against the [[Boston Breakers]]. The team went 4-14 in 1983 and 3-15 in 1984, averaging 7,700 fans. 

With six games remaining in the 1984 season, owner Berl Bernhard sold the team to Florida real estate developer Woody Weiser. In the off-season, that deal fell through. Donald Dizney bought the team, moved it to Orlando and renamed it the Renegades.

After going 7–29 overall, and 5-18 at RFK, the Federals ended their run with a 20-17 win over the [[New Orleans Breakers]] on June 24, 1984.

===Team America (1983)===
[[Team America (NASL)|Team America]] was a professional version of the United States men's national soccer team which played as a franchise in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL) during the 1983 season. The team played its home games at RFK Stadium, and was intended by the NASL and the United States Soccer Federation to build fan support for the league and create a cohesive and internationally competitive national team. However, the team finished in last place drawing 12,000 fans per game.

Team America played 19 games at RFK. In those games they went 5-10 in NASL matches and tied three friendlies against [[Watford F.C.]] (from the [[United Kingdom]]), [[FC Dinamo Minsk]] (from the [[Soviet Union]]), and [[Juventus F.C.]] (from [[Italy]]).

The team's attendance averaged 19,952 through the first seven home matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com:80/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121147/index.htm|title=Red, White, Black and Blue|publisher=Sports Illustrated|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504211958/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121147/index.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the 50,108 who attended a match vs. Fort Lauderdale that featured a free [[Beach Boys]] concert. Losses led to declining attendance as the season wore on. Attendance averaged 13,002 for the entire 1983 season, after which the team disbanded after a single season of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenn.com/the_blog/?page_id=496|title=Attendance Project: NASL – kenn.com blog|website=www.kenn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The stadium's design was circular, attempting to facilitate both football and baseball. It was the first to use the so-called "[[cookie-cutter stadium|cookie-cutter]]" concept, an approach also used in [[Veterans Stadium|Philadelphia]], [[Shea Stadium|New York]], [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston]], [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta]], [[Busch Memorial Stadium|St. Louis]], [[Qualcomm Stadium|San Diego]], [[Riverfront Stadium|Cincinnati]], [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum|Oakland]], and [[Three Rivers Stadium|Pittsburgh]]. RFK Stadium ultimately outlasted all of them  except Houston, San Diego, and Oakland (the former is still standing but is no longer actively used, while the latter two are still active).

In 1961, the stadium represented a new level of luxury. It offered 50,000 seats, each {{convert|22|in|cm}} wide (at a time when the typical seat was only {{convert|15|–|16|in|cm|abbr=on}}), air-conditioned locker rooms and a lounge for player's wives. It had a machine-operated tarpaulin to cover the field, yard-wide aisles, and ramps that made it possible to empty the stadium in just 15 minutes. The ticket office was connected to the ticket windows by pneumatic tubes. The press boxes could be enclosed and expanded for big events. The stadium had a holding cell for drunks and brawlers. It had 12,000 parking spaces and was served by 300 buses. It had lighting that was twice as bright as Griffith Stadium.&lt;ref name="Jail"/&gt;

It was not ideal for either sport, due to the different geometries of the playing fields. As the playing field dimensions for football and baseball vary greatly, seating had to accommodate the larger playing surface. This would prove to be the case at nearly every multi-purpose/cookie-cutter stadium.

As a baseball park, RFK was a target of scorn from baseball purists, largely because it was one of the few stadiums with no lower-deck seats in the outfield. The only outfield seats were in the upper deck, above a high wall. According to ''[[The Sporting News|Sporting News]]'' publications in the 1960s, over 27,000 seats—roughly 60% of the listed capacity of 45,000 for baseball—were in the upper tier or mezzanine levels. The lower-to-upper proportion improved for the Redskins with end-zone seats. The first ten rows of the football configuration were nearly at field level, making it difficult to see over the players. The baseball diamond was aligned due east (home plate to center field), and the football field ran along the first base line (northwest to southeast).

{{wide image|DC United.jpg|800px&lt;!--|align-cap=center--&gt;|Panoramic view &lt;!--of Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium--&gt; in 2012, from the west corner (home plate to center field, due east)}}

A [[Movable seating|complex conversion]] was necessary, at a cost of $40,000 each time, to change the stadium from a football configuration to baseball and back again; in its final form, this included rolling the third-base lower-level seats into the outfield along a buried rail, dropping the hydraulic pitcher's mound {{convert|3|ft|1}} into the ground, and laying sod over the infield dirt. Later facilities were designed so the seating configuration could be changed more quickly and at a lower cost. The conversion was required several times per year during the Senators' joint tenancy with the Redskins (1962–71), but became much more frequent during the Nationals/D.C. United era; in 2005, the conversion was made over twenty times.

Originally the seats located behind the stadium's third-base dugout were removed for baseball games and put back in place when the stadium was converted to the football (and later soccer) configuration. When these sections were in place, RFK seated approximately 56,000. With the Nationals' arrival in 2005, this particular segment of the stands was permanently removed to facilitate the switch between the baseball and soccer configurations. These seats were not restored following the Nationals' move to Nationals Park, leaving the stadium's [[seating capacity]] at approximately 46,000. The majority of the upper-deck seats normally were not made available for D.C. United matches, so the stadium's reduced capacity normally was not problematic for the club.

&lt;!--The football/soccer field alignment is northwest to southeast, approximately along the baseball diamond's first base line.--&gt;
During the years when the stadium was without baseball (1972–2004)&lt;!--used only for Redskins games (1972–96)--&gt;, the rotating seats remained in the football configuration. If an exhibition baseball game was scheduled, the left-field wall was only {{convert|250|ft|0}} from home plate, and a large screen was erected in left field for some games.

[[File:Capitol from top of Washington Monument.JPG|250px|thumb|View east from [[Washington Monument]],&lt;br&gt;RFK Stadium in background]]
Some of RFK's quirks endear the venue to fans and players.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The large rolling bleacher section is less stable than other seating, allowing fans to jump in rhythm to cause the whole area to bounce. Also, despite its small size (it never seated more than 58,000), because of the stadium's design and the proximity of the fans to the field when configured for football, the stadium was extremely loud when the usual sell-out Redskins crowds became vocal. Legend has it that Redskins head coach [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]] would order a large rolling door in the side of the stadium to be opened when visiting teams were attempting field goals at critical moments in games so that a swirling wind from off the Potomac and Anacostia rivers might interfere with the flight of the kicked ball.

Since the stadium is on a direct sight line with the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]], light towers were not allowed; instead, [[Arc lamp|arc lights]] were placed on its curved, dipping roof.

Events D.C.—the city agency which operates RFK Stadium—began a strategic planning process in November 2013 to study options for the future of the stadium, its {{convert|80|acre|ha}} campus, and the nonmilitary portions of the adjacent [[D.C. Armory]]. Events D.C. said one option to be studied was demolition within a decade, while another would be the status quo. The strategic planning process also included design and development of options. The agency said that RFK Stadium has generated $4 million to $5 million a year in revenues since 1997, which did not cover operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/top-shelf/2013/11/events-dc-looks-at-next-steps-for-rfk.html|last=Cooper|first=Rebecca|title=Events D.C.

[[File:RFK Stadium satellite view.png|300px|thumb|right|Satellite view of stadium in pre-2005 soccer configuration; the darker red seats at the northwest end are not part of the current setup]]
The dimensions of the baseball field were {{convert|335|ft}} down the foul lines, {{convert|380|ft|0}} to the power alleys and {{convert|408|ft}} to center field during the Senators' time. The official distances when the Nationals arrived were identical, except for two additional feet to center field. After complaints from Nationals hitters it was discovered in July 2005 that the fence had actually been put in place incorrectly, and it was {{convert|394.74|ft|1}} to the power alleys in left; {{convert|395|ft}} to the right-field power alley; and {{convert|407.83|ft|1}} to center field. The section of wall containing the {{convert|380|ft|0|adj=on}} sign was moved closer to the foul lines to more accurately represent the distance shown on the signs but no changes were made to the actual dimensions.

The approximate [[elevation]] of the playing field is {{convert|10|ft|0|spell=in}} above [[sea level]].

Exactly 100 years ago, scores of Koreans arrived in Hawaii, beginning the history of Korean immigration. With the number of Koreans currently residing in the U.S. exceeding one million, a series of festivals and seminars had been scheduled in both countries to celebrate and reflect on the past 100 years. Organized by the Hankook Ilbo, sister paper of The Korea Times, and the television network SBS, the concert featured scores of famous musicians such as BoA, NRG, Babyvox, Cho Young-nam, Patty Kim, Kim Gun-mo and Jo Sung-mo, under the title "Korean-American Peace Festival". The top stars visited the Korean War Veterans Memorial at the National Mall in the capital on the eve of the concert. According to The Korea Times in New York, a local daily for Korean-American society, a large number of Korean residents throughout the U.S. attended the concert and took part in a Washington, D.C. tour package, to help local travel agencies suffering from recession.

'''Haji Mohammad Rosanan bin Abdullah Samak''' (born 18 July 1965) is a [[Bruneian people|Bruneian]] [[association football|football]] coach and former player, who played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] most notably with the [[Brunei M-League Team|Brunei team]] that played in the [[M-League System|Malaysian league]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football clinic kicks off|url=http://www.brusearch.com/news/26751|date=15 April 2008|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the team that won the 1999 [[Malaysia Cup]], which is regarded as [[Football in Brunei|Brunei football]]'s crowning achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saga of Brunei's football association|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/02/01/saga-bruneis-football-association|date=1 February 2010|publisher=[[The Brunei Times]]|accessdate=31 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916040858/http://www.bt.com.bn/art-culture/2010/02/01/saga-bruneis-football-association|archivedate=16 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club and coaching career ==

Rosanan started his career with the Bruneian team [[Kota Ranger FC]], the team won the domestic championship in 1987 and participated in that year's Asian Champions' Cup (an early edition of the [[AFC Champions League]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asian Club Competitions 1987/88|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/ascup88.html|date=31 March 2011|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the decade, he was selected to play for the [[Brunei M-League Team|Brunei team]] competing in [[Malaysia Premier League|Liga Semi-Pro Malaysia]]. His 10-year career with the Wasps culminated in the shock 2-1 win against [[Sarawak FA|Sarawak]] in the final of the 1999 [[Malaysia Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Piala Malaysia 1999: Brunei FA lawan Sarawak FA. |url=http://chedinsphere.blogspot.com/2013/03/piala-malaysia-1999-brunei-fa-lawan.html|date=6 March 2013|publisher=Che Din|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement was chronicled in ''FIFA 192: The True Story Behind the Legend of Brunei Darussalam National Football Team'', a book by British author Stanley Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Park |first=Stanley |date=September 15, 2004 |title=FIFA 192: The True Story Behind the Legend of Brunei Darussalam National Football Team |publisher=[[Universal Publishers (United States)|Universal Publishers]] |isbn=978-1581125085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosanan left the national representative side in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M-League - Operation 'Promotion' kicks off|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=986790200|date=9 April 2001|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Kota Ranger as [[player-coach]] a year later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC into Pepsi Cup final|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=996130519|date=26 July 2001|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also given opportunities to coach Bruneian exhibition sides at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football - Rosanan pledges his best|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=998470997|date=22 August 2001|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hung up his boots in 2003 and moved to [[AH United]] a year later, starting a six-year tenure in which he won the [[Brunei FA Cup]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei 2004|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/brunei04.html|date=26 May 2005|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei - List of Cup Finals|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/bruneicuphist.html|date=19 February 2015|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hired by [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam|BAFA]] as a coach in 2009, Rosanan was assigned various coaching positions since, such as the [[Tabuan Muda|Brunei Youth Team]] that played in the domestic league (2009–2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brunei 2009/10|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/brunei09.html|date=19 February 2015|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Brunei national under-21 football team|Under-21s]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Friendlies give team valuable exposure|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2012/06/19/friendlies-give-team-valuable-exposure|date=19 June 2012|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Brunei national under-15 football team|Under-15s]] as assistant coach (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NFABD U-15 still winless|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/2013/06/26/nfabd-u-15-still-winless|date=26 June 2013|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assistant to [[Kwon Oh-son]] for the [[Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]] competitions for the U21s in [[2012 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy|2012]] and [[2014 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy|2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BRUNEI’S WINNING HBT TEAM TO RECEIVE GOVERNMENT AID|url=http://www.aseanfootball.org/v2/?p=8072|date=6 April 2012|publisher=ASEAN Football Federation|accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HBT trials start in Tutong|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports/2014/01/04/hbt-trials-start-tutong|date=4 January 2014|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Notability|Organizations|date=November 2014}}
The '''Southern Masters Cycling Club''' in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] is a [[Road bicycle racing|bicycle road racing]] club for veteran riders.  Cyclists become eligible for membership at the age of 35 for males, and 30 years for females.  The club is the largest Veterans cycling club in Australia. In 2006, there are over 350 members.

==History==
The club's first official meeting was held on 23 March 1975.  In the late seventies the Southern Veterans Cycling Club formed the Veteran Cycling Association of Victoria, which later became the [[Victorian Veterans Cycling Council]] (VVCC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterancycling.com.au/ Victorian Veterans Cycling Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

The club changed its affiliation from the VVCC to [[Cycling Australia]], which is affiliated to the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] (UCI), at a special general meeting held on 29 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernvets.com.au/modules/news/article.php?storyid=235 Club News : Special General Meeting], 30 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The club subsequently changed its name from ''Southern Veterans Cycling Club'' to ''Southern Masters Cycling Club''.

==Racing locations and details==
The types of races the club provides are:

*[[Bicycling terminology#open road race|Open road race]], also referred to as a '''graded scratch race'''
*[[Bicycling terminology#criterium|Criterium]], often abbreviated to '''crit'''
*[[Bicycling terminology#handicap|Handicap]], where riders are given time handicaps in groups
*'''Club Championships''', were riders are grouped according to their age (35-39, 40-44, 45-49 etc.)

Racing is conducted all year round.

In winter, racing is based around the [[Mornington Peninsula]] and [[West Gippsland]] from April to September. These races are held on public roads for which all necessary permits are obtained.  Distances vary depending on the course but are generally in the range 50–80&amp;nbsp;km.

The summer season, from October to March, is [[criterium]] races, which usually last from 1 to 2 hours.

The club caters for a wide range in age and ability of competing riders with grades A to G. Riders are only grouped according to their age championship races which are held twice a year (for both the criterium and road seasons) at club,  state and national level.

'''Station Road''' was a [[stadium]] in [[Pendlebury]], near [[Manchester]], [[England]]. It was the home of [[Swinton Lions|Swinton Rugby League Club]] between 1929 and 1992 and was widely recognised as one of the finest grounds in the [[Rugby league|Rugby League]].

Swinton moved to Station Road when they were at their peak, having won [[All Four Cups|all four major trophies ("All Four Cups")]] the previous season, one of only three clubs (the others being [[Hunslet R.L.F.C.|Hunslet]] and [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]]) ever to do so. The decision to purchase the land, which stood alongside the railway line and [[Swinton (Manchester) railway station|Swinton railway station]], was made after a breakdown in negotiations with their existing landlord at their [[A6 road (England)|Chorley Road]] ground, their home since 1887.

==International venue==

In its heyday it boasted a capacity of 60,000, although with a record attendance of 44,621 for [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]] v [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the 1951 [[Challenge Cup]] semi-final this was never really tested. All in all 19 [[international]]s (including 15 [[test match (rugby league)|test match]]es), 5 [[Rugby Football League Championship|Championship]] finals, 17 [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] finals, 4 [[Rugby League Premiership|Premiership]] finals and 30 Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] [[semi-final]]s were played at the ground. In addition two World Cup matches were played at Station Road.

The biggest win in any international match at Station Road was when [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] defeated [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] by 50-12 in the second [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] test during the 1963 Kangaroo tour. Played in front of 30,843 fans, the match became known as the "Swinton Massacre" as the Kangaroos ran riot. {{rlp|WG}}er [[Ken Irvine]] crossed for 3 tries giving the British fans (and his opposite, Lions winger [[Mick Sullivan]]) a taste of his legendary speed, while other stars for Australia were [[Reg Gasnier]] and [[Peter Dimond]] who crossed for 2 tries each, and Gasnier's {{rlp|CE}} partner [[Graeme Langlands]] scored 2 tries and kicked 7 goals. After winning the first test 28-2 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]], the victory saw Australia regain the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] they had lost to the Lions at home in 1962.

==Vandalism and closure==

Fire damaged the disused Main Stand including offices and function rooms in July 1992, this was the last in a series of vandalism before the club moved out of Station Road. Station Road was sold at the end of the 1991–92 season by the club's directors to David McLean Homes for property development, part of the deal involved sponsoring the Lions in their first season post Station Road. The last match to be played at Station Road was a local derby versus [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] on 20 April 1992 with 3,487 witnessing Salford winning 26-18 and [[Ian Pickavance]] of [[Swinton Lions|Swinton]] scoring the last try.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/oldhamadvertiser/sport/s/436805_salford_v_swinton_has_it_all|title=Salford v Swinton has it all|date=16 January 2003|work=Oldham Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is now a housing estate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3807">'''SuperCoach Finals''' is an online [[NRL]] [[Fantasy sport|fantasy football]] game for the NRL football season finals.

'''SuperCoach Finals''' asks players to take the role of coach and selector by choosing the ultimate team from Australia's best football players in the NRL Finals Series. Working within a salary cap of $1.4 million, participants select a squad of 7 players each week.

The real-life performance of the players selected determines the participant’s tally of points.  Participants choose a new squad each week according to which NRL teams remain in the finals race. '''SuperCoach Finals''' players may also elect to play against other people by creating and joining a private league or by being placed in a public league.

'''SuperCoach Finals''' is run by thetelegraph.com.au, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] and [[The Sunday Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] newspapers in [[New South Wales]], Australia. '''SuperCoach Finals''' is also available in [[Queensland]] at [[the Courier Mail]], [[Gold Coast Bulletin]] and [[Townsville Bulletin]].

'''SuperCoach Finals''' is an extension of one of Australia’s biggest NRL fantasy football competitions, [[NRL SuperCoach]].

== Strategy ==

See strategy section in [[NRL SuperCoach]].

== Selecting the SuperCoach Finals squad ==

In '''SuperCoach Finals''', participants are required to select a complete squad of 7 players from any NRL club participating in the Finals Series. Squad selection must take into consideration a $1.4 million salary cap and the requirement to fulfil each of the following playing positions:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! QTY !! Position
|-
| 1x || Fullback
|-
| 1x || Wing/Centre
|-
| 1x || Five Eighth
|-
| 1x || Halfback
|-
| 1x || Front Row Forward
|-
| 1x || Hooker
|-
| 1x || Second Row Forward
|}

Only teams with a full squad of 7 players will earn points. When choosing a team for the upcoming week of finals, a team captain must also be nominated. The performance of the team captain will add double points towards the team score.

== Points Scoring ==


Only the best 6 selected players will earn points. If any of them are unable to play, the 7th selected player will add points towards the fantasy team's total.

By using various statistics that cover all aspects and contributions of NRL players in various playing positions, SuperCoach Finals scoring system presents an accurate way to determine how effective a player has been.

Points are awarded based on the comprehensive scoring system, as highlighted below.

 [[File:tiszalogo.jpg|frame|right|Logo of Tisza Cipő]]

'''Tisza Cipő''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] for ''Tisza Shoe'') is a brand of Hungarian sports shoes that existed in the Communist era which has made a resurgence in recent years as a hip new fashion brand in that country. "Cipő" is Hungarian for "shoe," and [[Tisza]] is a river in Central Europe. The shoes in playful colors and designs are featured on the company's web site.

== History ==

In the 1930s [[Tomáš Baťa|Thomas Bata]] came to [[Hungary]] to open a shoe factory somewhere in the country.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a journey he visited [[Martfű]] where the railway, public and water traffic meet and he found it suitable for the Tisza Cipő factory. He bought the parcel in 1939, which was 593 cadastral hold, and he paid 325000 [[pengő]] for it. The construction begun and the Cikta Rt. - which was the former name of the shoe factory - in 1942 started the production of loungers.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; During the [[Second World War]] many things changed in the factory, directors of the factory frequently alternated, however; the Shoe factory never shut down. After the war, the factory suffered many lost, for instance; wooden treaded shoes were manufactured instead of rubber ones. In August 1949, The Cikta Rt was renamed to Tisza Cipő Nemzeti Vállalat (Tisza Shoe National Corporation). During the 1950s and 1960s, the factory produced shoes for the inner market and exported only to socialist countries. At these times, they produced large quantity of boots for the [[Ministry of Interior]], the [[Minister of Defence of Hungary|Ministry of Defense]] and the Civil Guard. In December 1970, The Tisza Shoe Factory wanted to have a new logo instead of their old one and then they put in the application for authorization of their new logo, which they obtained in the first months of 1971.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; So, finally Tisza company started to produce sport shoes, which very soon became of the favourite shoes of young people. Many facts show us that the production of sport shoes was a very good decision. For instance, from May 1971 the [[France|French]] [[Adidas]] manufactured its football shoes called La Paz. From the beginning of the 1970s many new models came to light, some of them were very similar to today's old school type of shoes. One of the first shoes, which the Tisza Factory produced, was a rubber sole - vulcanized - gym shoes which were manufactured in many colours. The variety of sport shoes is widened and besides the normal shoes long legged style shoes were produced and also different shoes were produced leather and linen for different sport activities. At that time the Tisza factory was the biggest shoe factory in Hungary- where not only shoes were manufactured but other factories rubber soles. They produced 10,000,000 pairs of shoes annually and 3,000,000 of them were gym shoes.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; Besides the quantity the factory took care of the quality. In July 1970, the gym shoes which sole were made of [[PVC]] won the excellent product prize. At the 1976 Budapest International Fair, the Tisza leisure shoe family won the Fair's prize. 1976 brought several international successes for the Tisza Cipő factory. For instance, the French ADIDAS signed a multi-year contract with them and the factory's production appeared on the [[England|English]] market. At the same year an agreement was made on the first [[United States|American]] export where not only casual shoes were ordered but 50 thousands sport shoes. Tisza shoe company also produced 2 million pair of shoes for the socialist market.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; In the 1970s the Tisza shoe company's products reached the [[Kuwait]]'s and [[Liberia]]'s markets. 1976 brought further development. In the 1990s, the import increased and more and more brands could get into the domestic market. Until the middle of the 1990s, the Tisza Shoe factory made sport shoes and after that, it started manufacturing street shoes for women, men and children. From the summer of 2003 the Tisza company has again started to produce sport shoes. Besides the old models, they produce new ones.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

==Clash Kft==

In 2003, The Clash Kft has bought the rights of the usage of the Tisza trademark.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; This means that Clash company can use Tisza as a trademark and shoes can be produced anywhere, not just in the traditional Tisza Shoe Factory in Martfű. Nowadays we have three places where Tisza shoes are produced and six shops where customers can buy them. The Clash company also wants to have Tisza trademark to remain pure Hungarian, therefore, the shoes are produced only in Hungary although the completion of the shoes is very expensive. The marketing aim of the Clash Kft is a long-live company, in order to achieve this they have worked out a special marketing plan; the expansion of the company is very slow and the profit of which the company gathers a year is given back to the its origin, to develop the company. The Clash Kft also makes clothes and accessories. The idea of the whole business came from a young, talented, Hungarian man, László Vidák, who was also an importer of a very popular shoe in Hungary a couple of years ago.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

==Clash Kft and The Tisza Shoe==

In May 2009 the original Tisza Company in Martfű went bankrupt; from the 102 employees 85 quit. But the Clash Kft continues to make the Tisza Shoe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9537">[[Image:Umnumzaan Ofront.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A 1 of 20 prototype Umnumzaan folding knife, with CPM S30V blade and titanium handles]] 
The '''Umnumzaan''' is a folding [[pocket knife]] manufactured by [[Chris Reeve Knives]] of [[Boise, Idaho]], and designed by [[Chris Reeve]]. The name "Umnumzaan" is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] language, meaning "Head of the family," or "Boss" (colloq.), a tribute to Mr. Reeve's [[South Africa]] origins.&lt;ref name="blade1"/&gt;The Umnumzaan was designed to meet the needs of operators seeking a heavy-duty folder capable of handling heavy use and even abuse. Building upon the Sebenza’s success, the Umnumzaan features: a stronger pivot joint, a thicker blade, a different blade grind with a reinforced tip, improved ergonomics, thicker titanium handles, a thicker titanium lock bar, a stronger ceramic ball detent system, a larger titanium spacer (sometimes called a “stand off”), a phosphor-bronze washer system designed to act as a ‘dry-sump’ to retain lubrication and keep dirt out, an oversized ambidextrous-thumb studs &amp; extended lock bar to aid operation when wearing gloves, a lanyard pivot joint that uses pivoting lanyard tie bars, and a deeply textured grip.

==Design==
The Umnumzaan implements a version of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrisreeve.com/sebenzadetails.htm/ Integral Lock Design Principles on the Sebenza] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010200709/http://www.chrisreeve.com/sebenzadetails.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the [[Sebenza]] folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functions{{spaced ndash}}the ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position.&lt;ref name="blade1"&gt;Shackleford, Steve, Blade Magazine, The Blade Magazine 2008 Knives of the Year, October 2008, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.

The Umnumzaan blade pivot is implemented with a pivot screw and pin, and is supported by perforated phosphor bronze thrust washers. The functions of the perforations are to reduce friction due to a reduction in surface area relative to that of a solid washer, and to increase the duration of use between cleanings by housing lubricant in the perforations.&lt;ref name="blade1" /&gt; Over the life of the Umnumzaan, the pivot and washers have been incrementally modified.

The thumb lug on the Umnumzaan is used for opening the knife blade, as well as serving as the stop pin that contacts the titanium handle slabs upon lockup. Around each lug is a polyurethane o-ring that acts as a shock absorber to cushion the shock of opening, and reduce the audible noise of opening. The use of the shock absorber concept was pioneered by knife designers Grant and Gavin Hawk, and is being implemented in the Umnumzaan with their consent.&lt;ref name="data"&gt;[http://www.chrisreeve.com/umnumzaan.htm Official Umnamzaan Datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The knife also features a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip is part of the blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.

The specifications of the Umnumzaan are as follows:&lt;ref name="data"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*  Blade material:  	[[CPM S30V steel]] 
*  Blade hardness:  	58-59 [[Rockwell scale|RC]]
*  Blade finish:  	Stonewash
*  Blade length:	{{Convert|3.675|in|mm|abbr=on}}
*  Blade thickness:	{{Convert|0.140|in|mm|abbr=on}}
*  Handle length:	{{Convert|4.77|in|mm|abbr=on}}
*  Handle material:	6AI4V [[titanium]]
*  Fittings:		303 stainless steel
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Umnumzaan was introduced at the 2008 [[Blade Show]] and International Cutlery Fair, and was named the 2008 Blade Show "Overall Knife of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blademag.com/bladeshow/ 2008 Blade Show Award Winners] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610142200/http://www.blademag.com/bladeshow/ |date=2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation Revisions and Incremental Changes &amp; Upgrades==
Since the 2008 introduction, the Umnumzaan has seen several incremental improvements and one generational change. These changes have all been minor and very few visual changes have occurred since initial introduction. Around 2011, changes to the lock bar were made to make engaging the lock with one hand easier (through making the bottom portion of the lock bar slightly more flared, which was a common request voiced by owners on various knife forums). 

The second generation Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes some of the newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional hex wrench is all that is needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation washer system with larger washer perforations, which helps retain lubricating grease better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase service intervals. The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began). 

Shortly before this generational change, a Lock Bar Stabilizer (or LBS) was added to prevent 'hyperextension' of the titanium lock bar. While this change is commonly referred to as part of the second generation Umnumzaan, there are a few models made in early-mid 2012 which have both the old pivot brushing and the lock bar stabilizer, although these are relatively rare. 

The blade steel has also seen a minor revision. While not made at any specific point of revision, like other Chris Reeve Knives that had used CPM-S30V stainless blade steel, the Umnumzaan saw a blade steel phase to CPM-S35VN. While similar to S30V, S35VN is an incremental improvement in which Vanadium is used to make sharpening easier and increase toughness and Niobium to increase toughness and further refine uniform grain formation. Rockwell Hardness is still at 58-59 HRC and edge retention is not much different from S30V. This change was made progressively as S30V blade supply was exhausted. 

Dating changes and specific points of change is difficult as no single source provides all of the information on the revisions made, and Chris Reeve Knives is known for making frequent small and incremental changes to their knives over periods of years, often as a response to owner feedback and not always with any formal notice.

==Variations ==
While many folding knives are available with many different options (for example, blade steels, blade coatings, handle material, handle color, graphic designs, different blade shapes, etc.), the Umnumzaan is largely a ‘what-you-see-is-what-you-get’ knife as there are very few different variants available. When the knife was first produced, a limited edition of 20 Umnumzaans were produced with the word “UMNUMZAAN” and “1 of 20” engraved into the titanium handle. Two decorated Graphic Umnumzaans shortly followed. When Chris Reeve changed to S35VN, two Unique Graphic Umnumzaans were made which advertised a ‘mystery steel’. This steel was later revealed to be CPM-S35VN. 

As for mass-produced variants of the Umnumzaan, only three options exist: the standard Umnumzaan, a Tanto Umnumzaan, and a Wilson Combat Umnumzaan; all are available in right-handed and left-handed configurations. While the Tanto Umnumzaan looks identical to the standard Umnumzaan other than the blade shape, the Wilson Combat has a significantly different handle pattern. Commonly labeled the ‘Star Tac’, the Wilson Combat Umnumzaan has a heavily textured design that spans the entire handle, and a different lanyard with a “Wilson Combat” labeled titanium bead.
