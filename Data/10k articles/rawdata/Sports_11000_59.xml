      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6625">The '''7 post shaker''' is a piece of test equipment used to perform technical analysis on race cars.  By applying shaking forces the shaker can emulate banking loads, lateral load transfer, longitudinal weight transfer and ride height sensitive downforce to emulate specific racetracks.

==Uses==
The 7 post shaker is used for many vehicles in different driving conditions. Earlier versions were the 5 post shaker and the 4 post shaker.  The 4 post shaker is commonly used by vehicle manufacturers to investigate squeaks and rattles.  Manufacturers do not normally use a 7 post rig for road cars because these vehicles are not normally subject to the same aerodynamic effects as a race car operating at high speeds.  This technology was first used in Formula 1 in the late 1990s, and is now also used by other series such as NASCAR and the [[Indy Racing League]]. NASCAR teams with 7 post rigs include [[Hendrick Motorsports]], [[Richard Childress Racing]], [[Chip Ganassi Racing]], [[Furniture Row Racing]], and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]. The car driven by [[Jeff Gordon]] is shown on a 7 post rig in this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CalYk5VWA&amp;feature=related video].

Vehicle designers use the results of the testing on the 7 post shaker to adjust spring rates, shock valving and steering ratio to best suit conditions of a specific emulated track.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circletrack.com/techarticles/seven_post_shaker_rig_suspension_dynamics/index.html Seven-Post Shaker Rig - Suspension Dynamics Machine - Circle Track&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The 7 post shaker places forces on a vehicle and records the forces that the vehicle puts back into the system.  The 7 post applies [[lift (force)|lift]], [[downforce]], road irregularity forces and load transfer due to braking, acceleration and cornering.  The vehicle suspension and drivetrain components respond to these forces, chassis and suspension frequency oscillations (under 30&amp;nbsp;Hz), and tire, engine, transmission and drive axle vibrations at higher frequencies.  The forces applied are calculated from a model of the racetrack, the weight of the car and driver, tire pressure, engine RPM, and driveline RPM.  The forces that the testing engineers want are placed on the car through the use of four main hydraulic actuators capable of generating {{convert|25|kN}} of force with a maximum velocity in excess of {{convert|1|m/s|ft/s}} that act on the tires.  While the actuators are capable of producing frequencies as high as 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, this is not necessary as the elasticity of the rubber and air in the tires will absorb most inputs above 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.  The remaining three posts are known as '''aeroloader''' actuators, and are responsible for the sprung mass of the vehicle. The forces that these three actuators represent are inertial loads that come from entering a curve or aerodynamic loading and unloading in the form of downforce or lift from a wing. These forces are small on road cars where speeds are not normally greater than {{convert|140|km/h|mph|-1}}, but are significant on a race car where speeds can exceed {{convert|300|km/h|mph|-1}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ftpw006.html F1 - Grandprix.com &gt; Features &gt; Technical &gt; Movers and shakers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The very basic parameters that need to be initialized are the vertical input forces to the vehicle from the road surface.  The drivers and engineers want to look at how the car reacts to specific tracks, as the car will respond differently at the tri oval at [[Talladega Superspeedway]] where speeds can approach {{convert|320|km/h|mph|-1}} than [[Bristol Motor Speedway]] where the corners are [[Banked turn|banked]] 24 to 30 degrees.  This data is extremely hard to collect and assemble as the road surface is highly irregular.  Once a racetrack is loaded into the testing computer, the vehicle can be loaded onto the 7 post, in the absence of actual track data swept-sine waves can be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcindy.com/7-post.html ARC 7-Post]&lt;/ref&gt;  Further variables are eliminated by using ballast for the weight of the driver and the weight of the fuel in the tank.  The test lab temperature is highly regulated to [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature]] of {{convert|21|°C|°F}}.  Once the unit is started [[transducers]] in the form of [[accelerometers]] and strain gauges, convert the mechanical movement of the vehicle into an electrical signal.  This signal is sent to a processor which converts and amplifies the signal, and sends it on to the computer.

Also of particular interest to the engineer is the force between the tire and the road.  This is of interest to the car designer because it reflects the grip that the tire has on the road surface.  This is more difficult to test because the [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] frequency has to be at least five times as high as the highest frequency.{{Citation needed|reason= This rate does not seem difficult for analog to digital converters. Also the Nyquist bound is 2x, not 5x. |date=February 2013}}  In this case the incoming frequency is 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, so the sampling frequency must be at least 500&amp;nbsp;Hz.

In vibration analysis, as in all engineering problems, the output data must be looked at in a methodical way.  When testing on the 7 post shaker, all variables are inter-related and can be analyzed while the effects of the actual installation can be quantified.  The damping force curve can be extracted from the data to understand how installation stiffness and other variables affect the damping force.  Some seemingly unimportant trends need to be verified so the engineers can be sure that the trend will not continue or that the trend is expected.

The analysis path in this case is:

* Input - The road or race track
* Unsprung mass - Weight not felt by the springs
** Tires - Act as dampers to the input forces
** Wheels - Add weight
** Brakes - Add weight
** Springs - Respond directly to the input forces
* Sprung mass - The rest of the vehicle, in particular:
** Shocks - Dampen input forces appreciably
** Frame/Rollcage - Distributes input forces over the entire vehicle
** Driver - Directly fatigued by vibration, body roll, and steering wheel feedback

In 1988, Carpentier Alting finished in 36th place at [[Luge at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Men's singles|men's singles luge.]]  He and [[Bart Drechsel]] finished 29th in the [[Bobsleigh at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Two-man|two-man bobsleigh event]].

The event included competitors from countries with little or no snow.[2] These countries included Jamaica (whose involvement spurred the movie Cool Runnings), Mexico, and New Zealand. An informal "Caribbean Cup" of such countries was won by New Zealand's Alexander Peterson and Peter Henry, who finished equal twentieth. In the two-man event, the best result from a completely snow-less country was twenty-ninth by Bart Carpentier Alting and Bart Dreschsel of the Netherlands Antilles]].

At the 1992 Olympics, Carpentier Alting and [[Dudley den Dulk]] were placed 29th in the [[Bobsleigh at the 1988 Winter Olympics – Two-man|two-man bobsleigh competition]].

'''Bursa Atatürk Stadium''' ({{lang-tr|Bursa Atatürk Stadyumu}}) was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Bursa]], Turkey.  It was currently used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches and was the home ground of [[Bursaspor]]. The stadium holds 25,213 and was built in 1979.&lt;ref name="ws"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/middle_east/countries/turkey/marmara.shtml |title=Stadiums in Turkey :: Marmara |publisher=World Stadiums |date=2015-11-17 |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stadium has existed on this site since 1930 when a stand with a capacity of 300 was built for an amateur football club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sporx.com/futbol/superlig/bursaspor/bursa-stadi-goz-kamastirdiSXHBQ203481SXQ |title=Bursa Stadı göz kamaştırdı - Bursaspor |website=Sporx.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was demolished in 2016.

==Capacity extended==
It was given an extensive refurbishment after Bursaspor's Championship winning season 2009–10 to make it fit for [[UEFA]] regulations and participation for the [[2010-11 UEFA Champions League]]. The capacity, which was originally 18,517 was increased to 25,213 as well as exterior upgrades taking place.

It was one of the 9 candidate host stadiums of [[Turkish Football Federation|Turkish]] bid for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], after reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro2016adayiturkiye.com/cities/bursa |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423113621/http://www.euro2016adayiturkiye.com/cities/bursa |archivedate=2010-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New stadium plans==
The New Bursa Atatürk Stadium, also known as the [[Timsah Arena]] ({{lang-en|Crocodile Arena}}), is a reconstruction project by Bursa City Council. The stadium's project was introduced to the Turkish press on July 10, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/Spor/SonDakika.aspx?aType%3DSonDakika%26ArticleID%3D1116250 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715150003/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/Spor/SonDakika.aspx?aType=SonDakika&amp;ArticleID=1116250 |archivedate=2009-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It will have a seating capacity for 45,000 spectators and will be totally covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bursakentkonseyi.org.tr/?sayfa=icerik&amp;id=49 |title=Bursa Kent Konseyi |publisher=Bursa Kent Konseyi |date= |accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction works are scheduled to be completed in 24–30 months.

==Architectural form==
Hexagonal figures found in the green mosque of Bursa as part of the historical Islamic art deduced the structure of the roof structure. The transformation into a significant architectural frame is the basic idea for the New Bursa Stadium. The smooth transition from the stadium roof into a tree roof makes the stadium naturally situated. The arena is not only a stadium – is marks a new meeting point for the locals in the heart of the city.

The VIP, Sponsor hospitality and media areas are situated in the west stand at the park side of the stadium. A multifunctional use is designated and contains different events in the stadium bowl as well as the permanent use of the restaurants, cafeterias and kiosks around.

The compact design of the main stand building, the shadowing of internal areas by the extended roof (reduced air condition/passive ventilation) joined by natural daylight due to the translucent roof cover, use of grey water (water conservation/rainwater; 50%+ reduction of potable water use), permanent local gas cogeneration (usually 30% higher energy efficiency than general power grid) and roof integrated solar panels not only reduce the energy necessity of the stadium but contain also the chance for the stadium operator to supply the neighbourhood with excessive power. Furthermore, according to the building sustainability long-life recyclable materials produced with a minimized energy input are applied as far as possible.

==Getting there==
The stadium and the surrounding park are well connected with the public transport system with a metro, a tram and a bus station aside. Also the city centre is just a minutes-walk away.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2368">A '''cage ball''', also known as an '''Earth ball''', is a large, inflated [[ball]], used in many American [[elementary schools]] [[physical education]] programs.  Cage balls typically have a diameter of 48" or 60", though 72" diameter models are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapeupshop.com/games/cageballs.html Cage balls | | lightweight ultralight Rhino cageballs | giant push play balls for camps | school PE class and recreation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The inventor of the cage ball is Doctor Emmett Dunn Angell.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Physical education teachers will make many uses of cage balls, but perhaps the most common use is to employ it in a pseudo-soccer game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:UFRROucjMcsJ:www.personal.psu.edu/cdc175/Cageball%2520Activities%2520Handbook%255B1%255D.doc+%22Cage+Ball%22+games+use+in+PE+class&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its size, the ball is virtually impossible to [[dribble]] downfield, and students simply push against it with their bodies, often with several children climbing on the ball at once.  As normally inflated, the ball yields easily to pressure.  Some teachers use a rule under which children are permitted only to use their legs and not kick the ball.  Cage balls are also used in "cooperative games".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpad.org/326/1960/Maintaining~or~Improving~Fitness~in~Childhood~Disorders NCHPAD : Maintaining or Improving Fitness in Childhood Disorders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cage balls are often used to play [[crab soccer]] in American schools.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

Cage balls have an internal rubber bladder to contain the air.  The outside is sometimes [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], though for many years the covering was only made of [[canvas]].  Although [[spherical]] (when not being pushed), the cage ball shares the [[American football]]'s "[[Shoelaces|laces]]", which hold the bladder in.

==Games==
In addition to pseudo-soccer, there is also Omnikin, a Canadian game. Omnikin (also known as [[Kin-Ball]]) is a game among primarily three teams who work together to earn points by making the other teams drop the ball.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6540">The '''Canadian National Pond Hockey Championships''' are held annually at the [[Deerhurst Resort]] in [[Huntsville, Ontario|Huntsville]], [[Muskoka District Municipality]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

The pond hockey variant used at the nationals plays 4 on 4 without a goalie, with two 15-minute halves and 5-minute halftime break. The winners of the three championship divisions are awarded the coveted '''Maple Cup'''.

== Men's Ontario Championship ==
The Ontario qualifier for the Canadian Nationals lasted only one year.  The host site was Valen's Conservation Area in Flamborough, Ontario.  The tournament is otherwise an annual event.  The Barrie Bruins defeated the Milton Moose Knuckles 14-8 to take the Ontario title.

The '''Cori cycle''' (also known as the Lactic acid cycle), named after its discoverers, [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] and [[Gerty Cori]],&lt;ref&gt;acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/carbohydratemetabolism.html&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the metabolic pathway in which [[lactic acid|lactate]] produced by anaerobic [[glycolysis]] in the muscles moves to the liver and is converted to glucose, which then returns to the muscles and is metabolized back to lactate.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, David L., &amp; Cox, Michael M.(2005) ''Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry Fourth Edition''. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, p. 543.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycle==
[[File:Gerty Theresa Radnitz Cori (1896-1957) and Carl Ferdinand Cori.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Cori]] and [[Gerty Cori]] jointly won the 1947 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], not however for their discovery of the Cori cycle but for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.]]
Muscular activity requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which is provided by the breakdown of [[glycogen]] in the [[skeletal muscles]]. The breakdown of glycogen, a process known as [[glycogenolysis]], releases [[glucose]] in the form of [[glucose-1-phosphate]] (G-1-P). The G-1-P is converted to G-6-P by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. [[glucose-6-phosphate|G-6-P]] is readily fed into [[glycolysis]], (or can go into the pentose phosphate pathway if G-6-P concentration is high) a process that provides [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to the [[muscle cells]] as an energy source. During muscular activity, the store of ATP needs to be constantly replenished. When the supply of [[dioxygen|oxygen]] is sufficient, this energy comes from feeding [[pyruvate]], one product of glycolysis, into the [[Krebs cycle]].

When oxygen supply is insufficient, typically during intense muscular activity, energy must be released through [[anaerobic metabolism]]. [[Lactic acid fermentation]] converts pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate]] by [[lactate dehydrogenase]]. Most importantly, fermentation regenerates [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], maintaining the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration so that additional glycolysis reactions can occur. The fermentation step oxidizes the [[NADH]] produced by glycolysis back to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, transferring two electrons from [[NADH]] to reduce pyruvate into lactate. (Refer to the main articles on [[glycolysis]] and [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] for the details.)

Instead of accumulating inside the muscle cells, lactate produced by anaerobic fermentation is taken up by the [[liver]]. This initiates the other half of the Cori cycle. In the liver, [[gluconeogenesis]] occurs. From an intuitive perspective, gluconeogenesis reverses both glycolysis and fermentation by converting lactate first into pyruvate, and finally back to glucose. The glucose is then supplied to the muscles through the [[bloodstream]]; it is ready to be fed into further glycolysis reactions. If muscle activity has stopped, the glucose is used to replenish the supplies of glycogen through [[glycogenesis]].&lt;ref name="Elmhurst"&gt;"[http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/615coricycle.html Cori Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423042037/http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/615coricycle.html |date=2008-04-23 }}". Retrieved May 3, 2008, from Elmhurst, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the glycolysis part of the cycle produces 2 ATP molecules at a cost of 6 ATP molecules consumed in the gluconeogenesis part. Each iteration of the cycle must be maintained by a net consumption of 4 ATP molecules. As a result, the cycle cannot be sustained indefinitely. The intensive consumption of ATP molecules indicates that the Cori cycle shifts the [[metabolic]] burden from the muscles to the liver.

==Significance==
The cycle's importance is based on the prevention of [[lactic acidosis]] in the muscle under anaerobic conditions. However, normally before this happens the lactic acid is moved out of the muscles and into the liver.&lt;ref name="Elmhurst" /&gt;

The cycle is also important in producing ATP, an energy source, during muscle activity. The Cori cycle functions more efficiently when muscle activity has ceased. This allows the oxygen debt to be repaid such that the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain can produce energy at peak efficiency.&lt;ref name="Elmhurst" /&gt;

The Cori cycle is a much more important source of substrate for [[gluconeogenesis]] than food.&lt;ref name="pmid11213896"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerich JE, Meyer C, Woerle HJ, Stumvoll M | title = Renal gluconeogenesis: Its importance in human glucose homeostasis | journal = [[Diabetes Care]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 382–391 | year = 2001 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hans-Juergen_Woerle/publication/12117257_Renal_Gluconeogenesis_Its_importance_in_human_glucose_homeostasis/links/55fff2ba08aec948c4f9c79f.pdf | pmid = 11213896 | doi=10.2337/diacare.24.2.382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18561209"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Nuttall FQ, Ngo A, Gannon MC | title=Regulation of hepatic glucose production and the role of gluconeogenesis in humans: is the rate of gluconeogenesis constant? | journal= Diabetes/metabolism Research and Reviews | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=438–458 | year=2008 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mary_Gannon3/publication/5293921_Regulation_of_hepatic_glucose_production_and_the_role_of_gluconeogenesis_in_humans_Is_the_rate_of_gluconeogenesis_constant/links/00b7d53a5e9652ec3a000000.pdf | doi= 10.1002/dmrr.863  | pmid = 18561209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of Cori cycle lactate to overall glucose production increases with [[fasting]] duration before plateauing.&lt;ref name="pmid9725823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Katz J, Tayek JA | title=Gluconeogenesis and the Cori cycle in 12-, 20-, and 40-h-fasted humans | journal= [[American Journal of Physiology]] | volume=275 | issue=3 Pt 1 | pages=E537–E542 | year=1998 | url=http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/275/3/E537.long  | pmid = 9725823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, after 12, 20, and 40 hours of fasting by human volunteers, gluconeogenesis accounts for 41%, 71%, and 92% of glucose production, but the contribution of Cori cycle lactate to gluconeogenesis is 18%, 35%, and 36%, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid9725823" /&gt; The remaining glucose production comes from protein breakdown,&lt;ref name="pmid9725823" /&gt; muscle glycogen,&lt;ref name="pmid9725823" /&gt; and [[glycerol]] from [[lipolysis]].&lt;ref name="pmid16848698"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cahill GF | title=Fuel metabolism in starvation | journal= [[Annual Review of Nutrition]] | volume=26 | pages=1-22 | year=2006 | url=http://blog.shlidor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Survival-in-starvation-George-Cahill-2006.pdf | doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111258 | pmid = 16848698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drug [[metformin]] can cause lactic acidosis in patients with renal failure because metformin inhibits the hepatic gluconeogenesis of the Cori cycle, particularly the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1.&lt;ref&gt;Vecchio, S. et al. "Metformin accumulation: lactic acidosis and high plasmatic metformin levels in a retrospective case series of 66 patients on chronic therapy.", Clin Toxicol. 2014;52(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The buildup of lactate and its substrates for lactate production, pyruvate and alanine, lead to excess lactate.&lt;ref&gt;Sirtori CR, Pasik C. "Re-evaluation of a biguanide, metformin: mechanism of action and tolerability". Pharmacol Res 1994; 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the excess lactate would be cleared by the kidneys, but in patients with renal failure, the kidneys cannot handle the excess lactic acid.

'''Falke Nürnberg''' was a professional [[basketball]] club that was based in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]]. The club was also known as Dimplex Falke Nürnberg for sponsorship reasons, and was previously known as Baskets Nürnberg, or Sellbytel Baskets Nürnberg, for sponsorship reasons. With a budget of only €900,000 [[euros]], the club had the lowest budget in the [[Basketball Bundesliga|German League]], when it competed in the league. The club was at one time also the [[farm team]] of the German League club [[Brose Baskets]]. 

==History==
Under the name of Baskets Nürnberg, the club played in the [[German basketball league system|German top-tier level]] [[Basketball Bundesliga]], in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. The club was then [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] from the top German division, and spent the 2007–08 season in the [[ProA|German 2nd Division]], operating as the [[farm]] team of the German top-tier level club [[Brose Baskets]], and under the name of Falke Nürnberg. The club was then dissolved before the 2008–09 season, after the [[Nürnberg Falcons BC|Nürnberg Falcons]] took over the club's rights and licensing.

==Arena==
The club's home arena was the [[Arena Nürnberger Versicherung]].

The '''FFA Football Federation Australia Hall of Fame'''&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/misc/hall-of-fame-about/ast5ib9063an1pob8wl6l2wrt|publisher=FFA|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to celebrate and highlight the achievements of the all-time top Australian soccer talents, as well as non-Australian players, managers and other participants who have become significant figures in the history of the Australian game. New members are added each year, with inductions announced towards the year's end.

The Hall was first established as the '''Soccer Hall of Fame''' in 1999.

==Selection==
All nominees must be Australian citizens. For non-players, inclusion is based on "overall sustained contribution to the game". Only retired players may be included.&lt;ref name=criteria&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Football Federation Australia]]|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/misc/hall-of-fame-eligibility/62itw7u3rpkd1rhqggspqa4d8|title=Hall of Fame – Eligibility|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Previously, there were several categories based on the nature of an individuals contribution (three levels, each split into two awards for players and non-players). From highest to lowest, these were:

* Hall of Champions (players) / Hall of Honour (non-players)
* Medal of Excellence (players) / Roll of Honour (non-players)
* Award of Distinction (players) / Roll of Honour (non-players)

These distinctions are no longer drawn, with the only divide being between players and "participants" (non-players).

Name affixes used for him are ''l'Apruzzese'',&lt;ref&gt;BAFFIONI, PROF. GIOVANNI: Giulio Cesare Polerio, l’Apruzzese, Maestro di Scacchi Europeo (XVI-XVII), Litografia Botolini srl, Lanciano, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Giu[o]lio Cesare ''da Lanciano'' (Salvio/Walker&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h3wEAAAAQAAJ The Chess player's chronicle, The light and lustre of chess, by George Walker, 1843]&lt;/ref&gt;), and ''Lancianese'',&lt;ref&gt;BAFFIONI, PROF.

== Polerio as a chess player ==
[[Image:Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona-Mussini.jpg|thumb|right|250px| "Sfida scacchistica alla corte del Re di Spagna" showing [[Giovanni Leonardo]] ("[[Il Puttino]]") at the court of [[Philip II of Spain]], around 1575, painting by [[Luigi Mussini]] (1883). Games of Giò Leonardo, including those against [[Ruy López de Segura]], are recorded in the Codexes of Polerio.]]

The first printed matter in which the name Giulio Cesare da Lanciano occurs is the so-called "[[Il Puttino]]" of [[Alessandro Salvio]] first published in 1634.&lt;ref&gt;SALVIO NAPOLITANO, DOTTOR ALESSANDRO: IL PVTTINO Altramente detto, IL CAVALIERO ERRANTE DEL SALVIO , Sopra il gioco de'Scacchi, con la sua Apologia contra il Carrera, diuiso in tre Libri. IN NAPOLI, Nella Stampa di Gio: Domenico Montanaro. Con licenza de'Superiori, 1634&lt;/ref&gt; The story recounted in [[Il Puttino]] must have occurred around 1575, thus, published by Salvio some 60 years later. "Il Puttino, altramente detto il Cavaliere errante"&lt;!-- provide translation --&gt; is a nickname used by Alessandro Salvio for [[Giovanni Leonardo]]. According to Alessandro Salvio, Giulio Cesare da Lanciano accompanied Giovanni Leonardo on his way to [[Madrid]] until [[Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Salvio/Walker: "After prolonging his visit yet a few days, the Puttino then sailed for Spain, with Giulio Cesare da Lanciano, but passing Naples by the way, halted for a short space of time at Genoa. ... So Leonardo departed for Marseilles, leaving his friend and follower, Giulio Cesare, at Genoa, as a medium of correspondence with his secretly betrothed bride." http://mark_weeks.tripod.com/chw04c15/chw04c15.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to Rome around 1584,&lt;ref&gt;Sanvito 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Polerio became a chess player and writer in ordinary of [[Giacomo Boncompagni]],&lt;ref&gt;in terms of the hand of Polerio: "Dedica a Iacomo Buoncompagno" (Codice Vaticano Boncompagni Ludovisi 3) see Baffioni, Lanciano, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke of Sora]] and son of [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory XIII (born Ugo Boncompagni)]].

Polerio wrote a number of [[codex]]es in which a lively international chess is described (exchanges of ideas among Italy, Portugal, and Spain). In these codexes, besides of own and new ideas in [[chess opening]]s, some matches played by himself are noted by the hand of Polerio.

In the Puttino, Salvio mentions that, starting in 1606 from "''Città di Piazza''", after a long travel on his way to Rome (p.&amp;nbsp;43) ... (p.&amp;nbsp;44: ''"il detto Signor Cascio poi andando a Roma, vinse Giulio Cesare compagno del Puttino il primo a Roma, in casa dell'Eccelenza del Sig. Giacobo Buoncompagno Duca di Sora"'') this Mr. [[Geronimo Cascio]], on his way to Rome, beat Giulio Cesare (Polerio), companion of Il Puttino, the best in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;recalling the dates of life of Giovanni Leonardo, the sentence could mean that Salvio considered Polerio as the best player of Rome in 1606-07&lt;/ref&gt; in the house/court of his Excellence [[Giacomo Boncompagni]], [[Duke of Sora]].&lt;ref&gt;see also Baffioni, 1993 (p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Codexes of Giulio Cesare Polerio==
The first systematic investigation of the Codexes of Polerio was published by [[Antonius van der Linde]] in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;in Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts. Nach unedirten Quellen bearbeitet, Verlag von Julius Springer, Berlin 1874&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of the investigations by Van der Linde can be found at the [[Bibliotheca Van der Linde-Niemeijeriana]], part of the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands]].

The current systematics of the Codexes of Polerio has been performed and published by Alessandro Sanvito in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;SANVITO, ALESSANDRO: I codici scacchistici di Giulio Cesare Polerio e Gioacchino Greco, Messaggerie Scacchistiche, {{ISBN|88-901525-8-3}}, Brescia, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Polerio on chess history and theory (before 1874)==

The systematic organisation of overall seven [[Codex]]es, described and called A-G by Van der Linde, and attributed to Polerio in 1874, had major impact on the further description of chess history, and history of chess theory. A relevant part of the work of Van der Linde was to compare Codexes of Polerio and [[Gioacchino Greco]] even superfine. According to this investigation, most of the analytic work of Polerio was mediated outside of Italy, up to 1874, via Gioacchino Greco. The clue, which potentially could link both chess players, may be seen in the person [[Giacomo Boncompagni]], or the [[Duchy of Sora]] respectively.

==Impact of Polerio on chess terminology (after 1874)==
{{chess notation|pos=secleft}}

===Polerio Gambit===

On p.&amp;nbsp;186 of "Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts" van der Linde wrote in '''1874''':

"'''D. Polerio-Gambit'''

224

1. e2-e4 e7-e5
2. f2-f4 e5-f4:
3. Sg1-f3 g7-g5
4. Lf1-c4 g5-g4
5. 0-0! g4-f3:
6. Dd1-f3: ''e cosi ancor che habbia perso un pezzo resta con buonissima postura di poter uencere il gioco sapendo guidarlo à presso, il che sarebbe superfluo inogni modo se si uolesse mostrare la fine di tutti giochi, e per questo basta insino à un certo che, tanto che si conosca apartemente il uantagio del gioco, si come per la postura di dette giochi ogni giudicioso giocatore lo potrà  facilmente cognoscere''."&lt;ref&gt;reference made to C, Nr. 12 = nowadays '''3''' in Sanvito 2005, as well as "12. Gambitto." p. 87-88 in Baffioni 1993&lt;/ref&gt;)

... in modern terms:

"Polerio Gambit: 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0! gxf3 6.Qxf3 +/-"

Exactly this move order was also found later even in a second Polerio [[Codex]] discovered and described by J.A. Leon in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;(10,- (224)) or '''6''' according to Sanvito 2005.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Of note is that the position after 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 may be considered by most recent [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmasters]] as a forced win for White - provided that 5.0-0 would mean "free [[castling]]", i.e. bringing the White King from e1 to h1. Actually, Polerio did claim 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3 to be favourable for White although the White King of Polerio did stand, after 5.0-0, on h1 but not on g1 (i.e. castling as defined in our days).

However, in '''1874''', the move order 1. e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0!&lt;ref&gt;The exclamation mark summarizes the general view on the move in about 1874, or 19th century in general.&lt;/ref&gt; was already occupied by the term "[[Muzio Gambit]]". This term derives from a translation of a work of [[Alessandro Salvio]], supposedly the third book of the reprint of 1723, by Sarrat in '''1813'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=itBelZLYuZcC The works of Damiano, Ruy-Lopez, and Salvio on the game of chess, by J. H. Sarratt, Damiano, Ruy López de Sigura, Alessandro Salvio, Printed for T. Boosey, 1813 Original von Oxford University]&lt;/ref&gt; On page 209 [[Jacob Sarratt|Jacob Henry Sarratt]] (translated) and wrote:

"SALVIO states that the following Gambit was sent to him by Signor Muzio, ..."&lt;ref&gt;of note is that Sarrat on is reporting [https://books.google.com/books?id=itBelZLYuZcC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA359-IA2,M1 page 359 of the work of 1813] on several games from a treatises published 1769, all with "5. K to Rook's square". These games compare very well with those reported on [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnACAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA217,M1 p. 217 ff.] of the work of the [https://books.google.com/books?id=pnACAAAAYAAJ Opera d'Autore Modenese] in 1769.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, [[Alessandro Salvio]] never stated this. Rather, in the third book of the Il Puttino he wrote that Signor Mutio&lt;ref&gt;Muzio is a revision of the spelling occurring in the reprint of 1723&lt;/ref&gt; d'Alessandro did see that [[Geronimo Cascio]] did play the move order (with free castling, also called "Italian method" of castling&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=itBelZLYuZcC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA212,M1 ref. for the usage of the term "Italian method of castling"]&lt;/ref&gt;).

With [https://books.google.com/books?id=qkoCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA164&amp;vq=muzio&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1#PPA165,M1 p. 165],&lt;ref&gt;linked is actually the version of 1828, which is, however, nearly identical with the version of 1821, compare also the living dates of [[Jacob Sarratt]]&lt;/ref&gt; vol. 2, of the '''1821''' edition of A New Treatise of the Game of Chess the term Muzio Gambit was coined by [[Jacob Sarratt|Jacob Henry Sarratt]]. And with the latter work of Sarrat, in '''1821''' the modern theory of the "Muzio Gambit" with castling according modern rules started - an idea and a position already Polerio analysed in 1579/80.

Thus, Antonius van der Linde, changed the view on the historical development of the move order 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 in '''1874''', most notably in the last editions of the [[Handbuch des Schachspiels|Handbuch]]. Thereafter, a trend can be seen to call this move order either with hyphenated terms such as Muzio-Polerio, Polerio-Muzio, or simply Polerio Gambit. Such a [[terminology]] is both in honour of Giulio Cesare Polerio and partially misleading since the major body of the theory of this opening was generated in the time span in-between 1821 and 1874. The number of games played by [[Adolf Anderssen]], [[Paul Morphy]], and  [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]&lt;ref&gt;see e.g [http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1019152 Steinitz-Anderssen, 1862]&lt;/ref&gt; with 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 or 5.d4 in the time span 1821-1874 was already rather high. The rules for [[Chess opening#Opening nomenclature|Chess opening nomenclature]], and their historical development, should be taken into account while assessing van der Linde's claim of 1874 "D. Polerio-Gambit".

==="Polerio Gambits and Variations"===

In 1874, Van der Linde suggested as well (p.&amp;nbsp;188) to rename the move order 1. e4 e5 2. f4 ef 3.Nf3 g5 4.Bc4 Bg7 5.h4 h6 6.d4 d6 7.Nc3 e6 8.hg hg 9.Rxh8 Bxh8 10.Ne5 into "Polerio's second Gambit". This suggestion is based on the observation that "[[Handbuch des Schachspiels|im Handbuch]] ('''1864''', S.. 366, § 3)" this move order is called "das Gambit des Calabresen". This is a rather interesting observation since in the [[Handbuch des Schachspiels|"Handbuch"]] in its [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb8nAAAAYAAJ 2nd] edition as of 1852, on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb8nAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA205,M1 p. 205] it is mentioned that the move order 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 can be found "at the Calabrese". That's a rather wise wording since both 1.e4 e5 2.Bc4 f5 and 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 f5, according to Codexes of Polerio, occurred in games of "Gio. Leonardo" (games 236-238, p.&amp;nbsp;190 in van der Linde). Both [[Giovanni Leonardo]] and [[Gioacchino Greco]] derived from [[Calabria]], the first from [[Cutro]], the second from [[Celico]](?&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Gioachino Greco]] Celico?&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Guildford Bason''' (or Basin) is a former [[cricket]] ground on [[Merrow Down]], on the outskirts of [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]].

==Cricket on Merrow Down==
In July 1730, Merrow Down is stated as the venue for a match between Mr Andrews’ XI and the [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond’s XI]].&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In September 1741, Merrow Down is the venue for a famous match between, to quote the Duke of Richmond: "poor little Slyndon against almost your whole county of Surrey".&lt;ref&gt;McCann, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Slindon, featuring [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]], won "almost in one innings".  

In 1762 there is another Guildford reference at Merrow Down with the Guildford club losing by two runs to [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guildford Bason references==
The first actual reference to Guildford Bason is the game played 31 July – 1 August 1769 between Caterham and [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]]. Hambledon won by 4 wickets thanks to "the batting of Messrs [[John Small (cricket)|Small]] and [[John Bayton|Bayton]]".&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sussex lawyer John Baker, a regular spectator at Georgian matches, described some of them in his diary. One is the All-England v Hampshire game in July 1772 which Baker attended with his parson friend, John Woodward. He writes that Hambledon was already batting when they arrived. It was a cheerful scene and "the Basin on Merrow Down" was ringed by a big crowd of spectators, most of them standing. Indeed, contemporary paintings of matches show no sign of seating accommodation for the ordinary folk. The local publicans were doing good business in their booths, some of them rented by the local nobility and thus the equivalent of the present-day sponsors’ tents or boxes. As in our own times, the occupants were often more interested in the food and drink than in the cricket. Guildford had fixed up a small grandstand "with benches above one another over his booth below", but it was already full. Baker then talks about "finding a small booth where we had a good cold dinner and good cider and ale". He says this was better and cheaper than the one they had on the following day in the ''White Hart'' booth.&lt;ref&gt;Underdown, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last known use of Guildford Bason for a [[First-class cricket|first-class match]] is the [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/40.html All-England v Hampshire] match in August 1777.&lt;ref&gt;Haygarth, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; This produced a tense finish with Hampshire scoring 162-9 in the last innings to win by 1 wicket. [[Thomas Taylor (cricketer)|Tom Taylor]] scored 62 and it required several runs by the last pair ([[Tom Sueter]] and [[Richard Nyren]]) to secure the win with [[Edward "Lumpy" Stevens|Lumpy]] bowling to them.

'''Harp Okulu SK''', formerly known as '''Harbiye''', is the [[sports club]] of the [[Turkish Military Academy]] based in [[Ankara]], Turkey. Originally founded in [[Istanbul]] under the name Harbiye, the club relocated to the capital Ankara in 1936. The name was changed to Harp Okulu in the following years. Being active in numerous sports, the club has won its greatest successes in [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]].

The football department won the [[Turkish Football Championship]] in [[1924 Turkish Football Championship|1924]] and thus became the first champions in Turkish football history.&lt;ref name=TamSaha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tff.org.tr/Resources/Tamsaha/126/files/assets/basic-html/page34.html|title=Memleketin ilk futbol birincisi|pages=60–66|publisher=[[Turkish Football Federation]]|date=May 2015|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s they won the championship title again in [[1942 Turkish Football Championship|1942]] and [[1945 Turkish Football Championship|1945]]. The basketball department won the former [[Turkish Basketball Championship]] twice in a row in 1951 and 1952.

'''Illovszky Rudolf Stadion''' is going to be a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It is going to be used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and is going to be the home stadium of [[Vasas SC]]. The stadium is going to be able to hold 5,054 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/designs/hun/illovszky_stadion|title=Illovszky Rudolf Stadion|publisher=Stadiumdb.com|date=8 December 2015|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Planning===
On 8 December 2015 it was announced that a completely new stadium will be built by the end of the year 2017. László Markovits, president of Vasas SC, said that the constructions will begin in the [[2016–17 Nemzeti Bajnokság I]] season. Therefore, the club will have to move to the newly built [[Hidegkuti Nándor Stadium]] to play the rest of the matches. The capacity of the stadium will be 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetisport.hu/labdarugo_nb_i/vasas-2017-re-angyalfoldon-is-elkeszulhet-az-uj-stadion-2454587|title=Vasas: 2017-re Angyalföldön is elkészülhet az új stadion|publisher=[[Nemzeti Sport]]|date=8 December 2015|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2016, the last match was played at the stadium. [[Vasas SC]] hosted [[Videoton FC]] on the 14 match day of the [[2016–17 Nemzeti Bajnokság I]] season. The first goals was scored by [[Mohamed Remili|Remili]] in the 37th minute. However, the last goal was scored by [[Danko Lazović|Lazović]] in the 92nd minute. The match ended with a 1–1 draw in front of 5,050 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2016/10/29/hungary/nb-i/budapesti-vasas-sc/fc-fehervar/2277408/?ICID=PL_MS_07|title=Vasas 1–1 Videoton|publisher=Soccerway.com|date=29 October 2016|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2016, it was revealed that the new stadium will be rotated minimally. The new stadium will be [[perpendicular]] to Fáy utca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetisport.hu/labdarugo_nb_i/vasas-minimalisan-forgatjak-el-az-uj-stadiont-helyszinrajz-2534013|title=Vasas: minimálisan forgatják el az új stadiont – helyszínrajz|publisher=[[Nemzeti Sport]]|date=1 November 2016|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 2017, the supporters of Vasas wrote an open letter asking for a stadium with a bigger capacity. Vasas FC backed the idea to apply for a bigger stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetisport.hu/labdarugo_nb_i/vasas-nem-szeretnenk-mini-stadiont-irjak-a-szurkolok-2545293|title=Vasas: Nem szeretnénk mini stadiont! – írják a szurkolók|publisher=[[Nemzeti Sport]]|date=7 January 2017|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2017 [[László Markovits]], president of Vasas SC, signed the contract with the Market-KÉSZ [[consortium]]. The capacity of the stadium will be 5,154 but the eastern stand can be expanded reaching a total capacity of 6,204. The construction will be finished by the summer of 2018. Markovits also said that the expansion of the stadium would postpone the constructions by 1 and half years. However, it was rumored that [[Viktor Orbán]] would support the idea to build a bigger stadium in Fáy utca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetisport.hu/labdarugo_nb_i/vasas-kezdodhet-az-uj-stadion-epitese-bovitheto-befogadokepesseg-2557919|title=Vasas: A meglévő beruházást nem akartuk kockáztatni – Markovits|publisher=[[Nemzeti Sport]]|date=16 March 2017|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium was redesigned by the German architectural companies [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners]] and [[Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The stadium is a part of the Jawaharlal Nehru sports complex which houses the headquarters of the [[Sports Authority of India]], the field arm of the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]] and [[Indian Olympic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/File1571.pdf|title=Sports Authority Of India|accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Delhi was selected as the host city of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] on 14 November 2003 during the [[Commonwealth Games Federation|CGF]] General Assembly in [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]], defeating bid from [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2003/11/15/stories/2003111507551800.htm|title=The Hindu : India to host 2010 Commonwealth Games|website=www.thehindu.com|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Government of India|Indian government]] decided to renovate the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for the Commonwealth Games. 

The Indian government chose the design of the German architectural company [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmp-architekten.com/projects/jawaharlal-nehru-stadion-in-new-delhi.html|title=Jawaharlal Nehru Stadion in New Delhi|website=gmp Architekten von Gerkan, Marg und Partner|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovation of the stadium started in 2007. Nearly 4,000 construction workers worked on the stadium in double shifts. The remodelled stadium was inaugurated on 27 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/Remodelled-Nehru-Stadium-inaugurated/article16212303.ece|title=Remodelled Nehru Stadium inaugurated|date=2010-07-27|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-09-13|others=Special Correspondent|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was given a new roof, improved seating, and other facilities to meet international standards as it hosts the athletic events and the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The capacity of the stadium was reduced from 78,000 to 60,254. The cost of the renovation was around US$150 million (₹961 crores).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/cwg-scam-new-stadium-costs-rs-84-cr-jln-renovation-rs-961-cr/articleshow/6254491.cms|title=CWG scam: New stadium costs Rs 84 cr, JLN renovation Rs 961 cr!|date=2010-08-04|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 53,800 m² [[Teflon]]-coated roof, designed by the German structural engineering and consulting firm [[Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner]], was built at a cost of US$48 million (₹308 crores).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sbp.de/en/project/jns-jawaharlal-nehru-stadium/|title=JNS Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium|website=www.sbp.de|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taiyo Membrane Corporation]] supplied and installed the [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] glass fibre fabric roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/special-report/taiyo-designs-installs-tensile-membrane-for-stadia/articleshow/6674915.cms|title=Taiyo designs &amp; installs tensile membrane for stadia|last=Duttagupta|first=Ishani|date=2010-10-03|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the one of the largest membrane roof system in the world. 8,500 tonnes of steel were used in the construction of the stadium's roof and its support structure. The support structure for the new roof is similar to London's [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]].  In case of emergency, the construction allows spectators to evacuate within 6 minutes.

A new Electro-Voice professional audio system by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] Communications was set up in the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-05/delhi/28221211_1_speakers-opening-ceremony-sound-system/|title=JNS audio system heard loud and clear|author=Rahul Tripathi|date=5 October 2010|work=The Times of India|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new 10-lane synthetic track, synthetic warm-up track, and a synthetic lawn ball field were added. A 400-metre warm-up track was also constructed. A 150 metre long tunnel was constructed for the opening and closing ceremonies. The design is similar to [[Foshan Stadium]] in [[China]], built by the same designers. 

Two new venues were constructed next to the stadium for the Games: four synthetic greens for the [[lawn bowls]] event and a 2,500-seat gymnasium for the [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] event. The stadium is a part of the Jawaharlal Nehru sports complex which houses the headquarters of the [[Sports Authority of India]], the field arm of the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]] and [[Indian Olympic Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in/index1.asp?ls_id=511|title=Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium|last=India|first=Sports Authority of|website=sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010 Commonwealth Games ==
[[File:Commonwealth-Games-2010-Opening-Ceremony.jpg|thumb|[[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony]] at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]]
Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was the main venue for the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. It hosted the [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening]] and [[2010 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|closing]] ceremonies as well as athletics events for the games. The stadium underwent massive redesign and reconstruction for the biggest multi-sport event hosted by India to that date. It was opened to the general public on 27 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d2010.thecgf.com/jawaharlal_nehru_sports_complex|title=Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex {{!}} XIX Commonwealth Games 2010 Delhi|website=d2010.thecgf.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, the first-ever Asian All Asian Athletics Championship was held. Over 1,500 students from schools came to see the event. The opening ceremony of the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] has been held. Security for the ceremony used NSG, CRPF and Delhi police personnel. Tickets were checked by electronic ticket checking machine similar to the ones used in the Delhi Metro. There are over 350 CCTV cameras in the venue. Delhi was closed, in the sense that all the malls, shops, offices, and call-centers in Delhi were closed before and during the ceremony.

== Football ==
[[I League]] matches have also been played here. The stadium was the main venue for the [[2011 South Asian Football Federation Cup]].

On 10 January 2012, the [[Government of India]], and [[Audi]], co-hosted a friendly football exhibition match between the [[India national football team|Indian National Football Team]] and [[Bayern Munich]] at Jawaharlal Nehru stadium. In this one-sided affair, the German club has defeated Indian team by 4-0 in front of 30,000 spectators. This was the farewell match to [[Baichung Bhutia]] as Indian National Football Team captain.

Since [[2014 Indian Super League season]], it has been home ground for [[Delhi Dynamos FC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiansuperleague.com/delhi-dynamos-fc/venue|title=ISL - Indian Super League {{!}} Salt Lake Stadium, Kolkata|last=www.indiansuperleague.com|website=www.indiansuperleague.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted 8 matches (including 2 Round of 16 matches) of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the end of [[2017–18 Indian Super League season]], the football pitch in the stadium was named as "Best Pitch" in the league by [[Indian Super League|ISL]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/IndianSuperLeague/photos/a.312230682286195.1073741828.158120631030535/959391210903469/?type=3&amp;source=48|title=ISL season awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was headlined by [[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; The [[E Street Band]], and also featured [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], and [[Ravi Shankar]].

The project was led and managed by Mr. Ramji Lal from [[CPWD]].

[[Michael Jackson]] was scheduled to perform 2 concerts at the stadium in December 1993 as a part of his [[Dangerous World Tour]]. Some tickets were also sold. This would have been the first time Jackson would have performed in India. [[MTV India]] and other T.V. channels played Jackson's music videos months before the concert which created mass hysteria and anticipation in the public for the concerts and Jackson's visit to India. 
Both the concerts were expected to be sold out. These two concerts were scheduled to be the last performances of the tour. Unfortunately the concerts in Delhi along with the dates for Indonesia and Australia were cancelled due to Jackson's health problems.

==Cricket==

The Stadium has hosted two [[One Day International]] matches featuring [[Indian cricket team|India]] against [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in 1984 which incidentally, was the first day night one day international in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150517.html Wisden Almanack]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] in 1991, again the fixture being a day night one (also being the second ever day-night cricket match in India)  . Batsman [[Kepler Wessels]] played in both the matches but for different countries and scored 107 for [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and 90 for [[South African cricket team|South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150909.html Wisden Almanack 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

A special feature of the ground was the running track being used as a part of the cricket playing area, which the ICC playing regulations eventually discontinued and thus the stadium was felt no longer suitable for cricket.

The '''1994 [[Asian Games]]''' also known as '''XII Asiad''' were held from October 2 to October 16, 1994 in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. The main theme of this edition was to promote peace and harmony among Asian nations. It was emphasized by the host because the venue was the site of the first [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb attack]] 49 years earlier. Due to the [[First Gulf War]], Iraq was suspended from the games.&lt;ref name="beijing "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/58/81/article212058158.shtml |title=Past Asian Games &amp;ndash; Hiroshima 1994 Asian Games |publisher=beijing2008.cn (official website of 2008 Beijing Olympics) |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=May 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617120725/http://en.beijing2008.cn/58/81/article212058158.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gz2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gz2010.cn/08/0427/17/4AI8DV6I0078003F.html | title=12th Asian Games Hiroshima 1994 - Poppo &amp; CuCCu | publisher=gz2010.cn (official website of 2010 Asian Games) | work=GAGOC | date=April 27, 2008 | accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kennington Common''' was a large area of [[common land]] mainly within the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. The area was notable for being one of the earliest venues for [[cricket]] within London and top-class matches were played there from 1724 to 1785.&lt;ref name=GB18&gt;[[G B Buckley]], ''Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket'', Cotterell, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[[H T Waghorn]], ''The Dawn of Cricket'', Electric Press, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; The common was also used for [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom#Notable executions in the United Kingdom|public executions]], fairs and public gatherings.

==Early history==
[[File:Doctor Rock, an itinerant vendor of medicines, selling his w Wellcome L0010548.jpg|thumb|An engraving of Doctor Rock, an itinerant vendor of medicines, selling his wares from a horse-drawn carriage to a crowd at Kennington common while [[John Wesley|John]] and [[Charles Wesley]] preach in the background c. 1743.]]
In 1600, the common was bounded on the south west by Vauxhall Creek.  It extended over marshy land to the south west of the Roman road called Stane Street, now Kennington Park Road.  There is a 1660 record of a common keeper being paid for grazing. In 1661, the [[Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens]] were laid out nearby (its location is noted as the Vauxhall End at [[The Oval]]). The large open space was often used for a variety of purposes by people living on the southbank of the [[River Thames]].

===Sports===
Cricket has been played at Kennington since the late 17th century although there are no definite records.&lt;ref name=LL&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153249/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1701.html#kennington#kennington From Lads to Lord's – Kennington Common]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1725 players were known to use the Horns tavern as their clubhouse. This was recorded a year after the first known cricket match had taken place. Other sports to have been periodically played on the common included [[quoits]] and [[bowls]].

===Mass meetings===
[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|thumb|The Great Chartist Meeting on Kennington Common, April 10, 1848.]]
People would gather at the common to listen to public speakers. In 1739, the Methodists [[John Wesley]] and [[George Whitefield]] preached to an audience of 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Dallimore, Arnold. George Whitefield -  The life and times of the great evangelist of the 18th century revival. Banner of Truth Trust, 1979, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 1848, Irish [[Chartism|Chartist]] leader, [[Feargus O'Connor]] addressed up to 50,000 people at Kennington over a petition in support of the [[Land Plan]].

===Executions=== 
The "Surrey gallows" were located on the common. These were the south London equivalent of [[Tyburn]] when the entire area was still part of the [[Surrey|County of Surrey]] (prior to the formation of the [[London County Council]] in 1889).
The gallows stood on the site of St. Mark's Church not far from [[Oval tube station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/localonline/d/0026jhan.htm UK local online]&lt;/ref&gt; Records show public executions were conducted frequently throughout the period that the common was also hosting cricket matches. In total 129 men and 12 women were executed at Kennington but there may well have been others. The first person was Sarah Elston who was [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] for the killing her husband on 24 April 1678. The last person executed was a forger on 5 August 1799.

In 1746, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] officer [[Francis Towneley]], along with other members of the [[Manchester Regiment (Jacobite)|Manchester Regiment]], who had been captured during the failed [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], were convicted of [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]] and condemned to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the common on 30 July. However, by then executioners possessed some discretion as to how much the condemned should suffer before death. Towneley was killed before his body was eviscerated. His head was placed on a pike on [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vauxhallcivicsociety.org.uk/history/executions/|title=Executions at Kennington Common|publisher=The Vauxhall Society|accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Frederick Prince of Wales.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales]], began his patronage of cricket after he attended a match on Kennington Common]]

The earliest recorded use of the common for cricket was the [[London Cricket Club|London]] v [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] match on 18 June 1724.  This has been classified a [[first-class cricket|first-class match]]&lt;ref name=FC&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121010153247/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/histories/matches.html Classification of cricket matches from 1697 to 1825]&lt;/ref&gt; given that it featured the two leading clubs of the time.

In August 1726, a combined London and Surrey XI played the Kent XI of leading patron [[Edwin Stead]] for a purse of 25 guineas.&lt;ref name="DC"/&gt;

In 1729, the 7 August edition of the ''London Evening Post'' reported: "On Tuesday was played a great cricket match on Kennington Common between the Londoners and the Dartford men for a considerable sum of money, wager and bets, and the latter beat the former very much".&lt;ref name="GB18"/&gt;

There was a very close contest on the common in August 1730 when London defeated Surrey by 1 run.  The report said that it "was thought to be one of the completest matches that ever was played".&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[[H T Waghorn]], ''Cricket Scores, Notes, etc. (1730-1773)'', Blackwood, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

The London v Sevenoaks game on 12 July 1731 is the first known to have been played in an enclosed ground. The report said "the ground will be roped round and all persons are desired to keep without side of the same".&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

The Surrey v London game on 28 September 1731 was promoted as "likely to be the best performance of this kind that has been seen for some time".  The ground was again enclosed: "for the convenience of the gamesters, the ground is to be staked and roped out".  It seems therefore that enclosure quickly became common practice in 1731. In addition, the advertisement refers to "the whole county of Surrey as London's opponents". The [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] was expected to attend and this is his first recorded involvement in cricket.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

Newspaper reports of the time were more concerned with odds than results and players were hardly ever mentioned by name.  There was an exception on 7 August 1735 when the ''General Evening Post'' announced a single wicket match on the common the following Monday involving seven players of the London Club. The game would be three against four with Mr Wakeland, Mr Dunn and Mr Pool against Mr Marshall, Mr Ellis and two others.&lt;ref name=GB18/&gt;  Ellis is known to have been London's best bowler while Dunn was a noted batsman.

In June 1736, a report of a single wicket match names Mr Wakeland, the distiller, and Mr George Oldner playing together against two famous Richmond players who are "esteemed the best two in England" (one of them may have been [[William Sawyer (cricketer)|William Sawyer]]). Unfortunately the esteemed pair were not named, though one of them suffered serious facial injuries in this game when the ball came off his bat and hit his nose. The report rails against "human brutes who insisted he should play on despite his injuries". This is a reflection of gambling's stranglehold on the sport at the time.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

When Surrey played [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] on 20 September 1736, three soldiers apprehended a deserter but the crowd turned on them, rescued the deserter and "after a severe discipline let them go about their business"! Meanwhile, Surrey won the match by 2 wickets and, unusually for the time, the team scores are known: Kent 41 &amp; 53; Surrey 71 &amp; 24-8.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

From this time on, the London club increasingly used the [[Artillery Ground]] for its home matches and that also became the main venue for the highly popular [[single wicket]] contests of the 1740s. The common became one of several home venues used by [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]]: for example, [[Moulsey Hurst]], [[Laleham Burway]] and others. Very few major matches were played on the common thereafter. Executions did continue and it is possible that this association eventually drove the cricketing patrons away, especially given their subsequent withdrawal from the Artillery Ground because of its reputation for uncontrolled gambling.

There was one particularly violent execution on 30 July 1746 when nine men of the Manchester Regiment who had joined the Jacobite Rising were hanged, drawn and quartered. There are no reports of cricket on the common that year but a match did take place at the Artillery Ground on the same day.

In all, 22 first-class matches were played on the common until the last in May 1785 which was, curiously, not a Surrey game but Middlesex v Essex.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt; Numerous minor matches were also recorded there.

==Demise ==
[[File:Cricket, WG Grace, 1891- Kennington Oval.jpg|thumb|Kennington Oval in 1891.]] 
The common continued to stage executions until the end of the 18th century while fairs, orators and other popular events continued into the 19th century.

Under a scheme sponsored by the royal family, the common was enclosed in the mid 19th century. [[Kennington Park]] was opened in 1854. It was created using the land between [[Kennington Park Road]] and [[St Agnes Place]]. However, with the growth of London throughout the next century, the remaining parts of the common have been consumed by urbanisation.

Cricket remains at Kennington. In 1845 the newly formed [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] established [[The Oval]] (formerly the Kennington Oval) on part of the old common that was used as a market garden.

The Canadian Soccer League (CSL) is an unsanctioned semi-professional league in Canada, formerly sanctioned by the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA). Despite its name, the CSL is not a national league as the teams are located solely in [[Southern Ontario]]. On September 12, 2012, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] reported that a CSL game held in September 2009 was fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/09/10/soccer-canada-match-fixing.html |title=EXCLUSIVE &amp;#124; Canadian soccer match fixed by global crime syndicate – Canada – CBC News |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 31, 2013, the CSA announced it was decertifying the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rycroft|first=Ben|title=CSA cuts ties with Canadian Soccer League|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports-content/soccer/opinion/2013/01/csa-cuts-ties-with-canadian-soccer-league.html |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=January 31, 2013 |accessdate=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the 2013 announcement, the Canadian [[MLS]] teams [[Toronto FC]] and [[Montreal Impact]] both withdrew their academy teams from participation in the CSL.

After the defeat the Romanian team headed to their hotel in Belgrade and some journalists saw [[Adrian Mutu]] leaving to celebrate with Butorović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertatea.ro/detalii/articol/nationala-juniori-umilita-sarbi-calificare-euro-poze-interlop-ratko-buturovici-397165.html|title=Umiliţi de sârbi în calificările pentru Euro, juniorii s-au mândrit cu pozele cu interlopul Ratko Buturovici|work=libertatea.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, Serbia U-19 side played Romania in [[2012 UEFA European Under-19 Championship elite qualification]] the Serbs won 3–0 in Serbia, before the match three Romanian players were seen taking photos with Butorović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsp.ro/fotbal/nationala/de-git-cu-ultraboss-juniorii-u19-s-au-fotografiat-alaturi-de-interlopul-sirb-ratko-buturovici-336191.html|title=De gît cu "ultraboss" » Juniorii U19 s-au fotografiat alături de interlopul sîrb Ratko Buturovici|work=GSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Mirko Poledica]] President of the Sindicate of Professional Footballers in Serbia, it had been a public secret for years that matches were fixed in the country's [[Football in Serbia|football championships]]. 'People have known about match-fixing for a long time, but this is the first time that players talk about it in public. Unfortunately, there is a lot of crime and there are a lot of hooligans in Serbian football. Many of those who know something, have no courage to talk about fixed matches, because of their personal safety. Some of the players have received threatening text messages: if they do not keep quiet, they will suffer serious consequences.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fifpro.org/en/news/serbian-union-we-want-to-clean-our-football|title=Serbian union: 'We want to clean our football'|work=FIFPro World Players' Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sierra Leone==
In July 2014 a total of 15 people were indefinitely suspended by the [[Sierra Leone Football Association]] over allegations of match-fixing - 4 players ([[Ibrahim Kargbo]], [[Ibrahim Koroma]], [[Samuel Barlay]] and [[Christian Caulker]]) as well as 3 referees and 8 officials, including [[Rodney Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28325794|title=Sierra Leone match-fixing: Captain Kargbo one of 15 suspended|date=16 July 2014|accessdate=16 July 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koroma later denied the allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28344985|title=Sierra Leone's Ibrahim Koroma denies match-fixing claims|date=17 July 2014|accessdate=22 July 2014|author=Ian Hughes|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an inquiry into the allegations was also announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28440467|title=Fifa backs Sierra Leone match-fixing inquiry|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014|author=Mohamed Fajah Barrie|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bans on the 15 players was lifted in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31820051|title=Sierra Leone: Bans on 15 alleged match-fixers lifted|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=11 March 2015|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nine's Wide World of Sports''''' is a long running sports anthology brand on Australian [[television]], aired on the [[Nine Network]]. All major sports, events and series covered by the network are broadcast under this brand, the flagship sports being [[rugby league]] ([[National Rugby League]]) and [[Australian Open|Australian Open Tennis]]. Previous sporting rights include the [[Australian Football League]], [[Australian Cricket Team]] home season, spring and autumn [[horse racing]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] until 2008, and golf ([[U.S. Masters]]) since 2018.

==History==
Wide World of Sports (WWoS) is a long-used title for Nine's sport programming. All sports broadcasts on Nine air under the WWoS brand. It was also the name of a popular sports magazine program that aired most Saturdays and Sundays. This program filled many of the summer daytime hours. The program premiered at 1:00 pm on Saturday, 23 May 1981, and was initially hosted by [[Mike Gibson (sports journalist)|Mike Gibson]] and [[Ian Chappell]], before being hosted in the 1990s by [[Max Walker (cricketer)|Max Walker]] and [[Ken Sutcliffe]]. Ian Maurice was the regular anchor at the WWOS Update Desk. The show ended in 1999, due in large part to the rise of [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] (which Nine's owner owned half of) and other subscription sport channels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, but the show returned in 2008 on Sunday mornings.

From the early 1970s, the main sport aired nationally under the WWoS brand was cricket. Nine's majority owner [[Kerry Packer]] created [[World Series Cricket]] in part because he couldn't obtain the rights to Australian test matches at home, even though he offered the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] a $1.5 million 3-year contract which was rejected by the ACB who signed a 3-year deal with the ABC to broadcast test matches. This led to Packer signing in secret some of the world's best cricket players for a breakaway competition. The ABC and Nine then signed a truce after a long dispute in 1972, with Nine securing the exclusive rights to telecast Australian cricket.

From that point until 2006, Nine based its summer schedule around broadcasts of cricket internationally and domestic. Its cricket broadcasts in that era revolutionised the way the sport was covered, featuring cameras placed at both ends of the field (after Packer famously complained about seeing "cricketer's bums" every second over), instant replays, and other innovations. World Series Cricket made many other changes to cricket, having a huge impact on the game.

In 1984, [[Billy Birmingham]] (''[[The Twelfth Man]]'') released a best-selling comedy album making fun of the cricket portion of the show. He went on to release a series of albums ridiculing all aspects of Wide World of Sports, calling the show "Wired World of Sports". From the first to the most recent (2006), all have reached number one on the Australian album chart.

January 1995 saw the beginning of Premier Sports Network, the channel that was to become [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]]. It secured the rights to Australia's cricket tour of the West Indies, Nine's first challenge since winning its World Series war. Nine tried to stop the broadcast under Australia's "anti-siphoning" rules, which exist to stop certain popular sporting events being screened exclusively on pay television. But it failed when Premier Sports Network came to an agreement to broadcast the tour free to air on Network 10. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

WWoS's other main sport was and is [[rugby league]]. This was challenged in 1997 by the establishment of [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], the repercussions of which led to Nine's parent company owning half of Fox Sports that year, and ultimately Nine's move away from popular live sport.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

This partial purchase of Fox Sports roughly coincided with the end of Nine's traditional Saturday and Sunday daytime schedule of sports programming. What had once filled it now filled subscription channels, mainly Fox Sports. Old movies and other low rating programs filled much of the space.

Between the late 1970s and 1997, when Australians had wanted to watch continuous sport at home on a summer weekend, they had largely done so by tuning to Nine. Those in NSW, Queensland and the ACT did this all year round, due to rugby league's popularity in those areas. Now Fox Sports had that mantle, and gave viewers continuous sport all week long.

On 25 January 2001, The [[Nine Network]] acquired broadcast rights for Friday night and Sunday games in the [[Australian Football League]], the elite [[Australian rules football]] competition in 2001. They shared the rights with [[Network Ten]] and [[Foxtel]] from 2002 through to 2006, but the deal assigned the rights for finals matches to Network Ten, a deal which reportedly flabbergasted Nine boss [[Kerry Packer]].

As it also had the rights for all major swimming competitions until 2008, with major swimming competitions shown in primetime. During the early to mid-2000s, Nine for the first time had the FTA rights to the highest competitions of Australia's four biggest spectator sports: rugby league, Australian rules (shared with Ten), cricket and swimming.
While Nine no longer had the volume of sport it once had, during the 2000-2006 period it dominated non-Olympic sport broadcasting in Australia.

In January 2006, the [[Seven Network]] and [[Network Ten]] exercised their "first and last" rights agreement with the AFL to trump the Nine Network's $780 million bid for broadcasting rights for the years 2007 to 2011. If Seven and Ten were unable to match the AFL's "quality of coverage" demands by 5 May 2006 (better coverage into regional areas, northern states and on pay television, as promised in the Nine bid) the AFL would have been allowed to award the broadcasting rights back to Nine.  The Seven/Ten consortium, however, obtained the rights, with Nine broadcasting its last AFL match on a Sunday hosted by [[Tony Jones (sports journalist)|Tony Jones]] with a guest appearance from Nine's then [[chief executive]] and former AFL commentator [[Eddie McGuire]].

From the beginning of the 2006-2007 cricket season, Nine no longer broadcast Australian domestic cricket but replaced the coverage with delayed [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] matches. The domestic cricket matches, long a mainstay of Nine's summer programming, moved exclusively to Fox Sports.

It was thought that the [[Seven Network]] would continue its tradition of airing the [[Olympic Games]] for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]]. However, Nine in joint partnership with [[Foxtel]], has secured broadcasting rights which the network has described as the most comprehensive coverage of the Olympics. The partnership also won the rights to the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].

For more than 40 years, the Nine Network had also broadcast the prestigious [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tennis tournament before ultimately dropping it after the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|2010 tournament]], citing declining ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/nine-to-bet-its-bank-on-footy/story-e6frg12c-1225893290399 Channel Nine to bet its bank on footy | PerthNow]&lt;/ref&gt; The last Wimbledon match televised by Nine was the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Men's Singles|men's singles final]] played between [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Tomáš Berdych]], which Nadal won. The [[Seven Network]] have since picked up the broadcasting rights to Wimbledon, from [[2011 Wimbledon Championships|2011]] onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/tv-radio/seven-snatches-wimbledon-tennis-coverage/story-e6frf9ho-1226033315376 Seven snatches Wimbledon tennis coverage | Herald Sun]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return==
After a ten-year hiatus, it was announced that the ''Wide World of Sports'' program would return to Nine on 16 March 2008.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Wilson | title=A 'Wide World' opens for Gilly | date=2008-03-01 | publisher=Daily Telegraph | url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23305387-5001023,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; This show is hosted by the previous host [[Ken Sutcliffe]], with footy show star [[James Brayshaw]] as well as former Australian cricketer [[Adam Gilchrist]].

In 2009, revolving co-hosts included former swimmers [[Giaan Rooney]], [[Nicole Livingstone]] and former cricketer [[Michael Slater]]. The show originally aired for 90 minutes but was recently extended to two hours. It airs on Sunday mornings at 9am till 11am.

Wide World of Sports returned for another year in 2009. [[Michael Slater]] and [[Grant Hackett]] joined the team as co-hosts alongside [[Ken Sutcliffe]] and [[Giaan Rooney]]. Nicole Livingstone did not return to the program in 2009, as she joined [[Network Ten]] as a commentator. [[Giaan Rooney]] resigned from the [[Nine Network]] at the end of 2012 to join the [[Seven Network]].

The show was nominated for the "Most Popular Sports Program" award at the 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 [[Logie Awards]], being beaten by ''[[The NRL Footy Show]]'' on all occasions.

The show is no longer airing as of 2017. [[Sports Sunday]] replaced the show in the Sunday 10am timeslot.

'''Polden''' (first name and dates unknown) was an English [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who made a single known appearance for [[All-England cricket teams|All-England]] against [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]] at [[Laleham Burway]] on 10–11 September 1778.&lt;ref name=GB86&gt;Buckley, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CA45"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/45.html |publisher=''CricketArchive'' |title=Chertsey v All-England 1778 |accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polden scored 10 runs with a highest score of 8. He took 4 wickets (all bowled) in his only innings.&lt;ref name="CA45"/&gt; Polden may have played in the return match at the [[Artillery Ground]] on 15 September, but no details of that match have survived.&lt;ref name=GB86/&gt;

As Polden had established his reputation by 1778, he must have been active for some years previously. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports and there are no other references to Polden.

In July 2001, The Coca-Cola Company launched a new formula for Powerade including vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, which play a role in energy metabolism.&lt;ref name="foodaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodaq.com/html/Non-Alcoholic-Drinks/36447.html|title=Powerade vs. soda? - FoodAQ|work=foodaq.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, The Coca-Cola Company updated the bottles of the standard Powerade (previous logo styling) to a new sport-grip [[bottle]].

In 2002, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Powerade Option to the [[United States]], in response to Gatorade's popular [[Propel Fitness Water|Propel]]. Option is a "low Calorie sports drink" that is colorless and sweetened with [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[sucralose]], and [[acesulfame potassium]], to provide sugar-conscious consumers with another rehydration choice. Powerade Option took 36% of the Fitness Water category behind Propel's 42%.

In 2007, Powerade Zero was released,  a sports drink with [[electrolytes]], which contains no sugar, no calories and no carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://avenueform.com/best-sports-drinks/|title=Best Sports Drinks|author=Kristin Goett|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=June 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811063724/http://avenueform.com/best-sports-drinks/|archive-date=August 11, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today article"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2008-05-06-powerade-zero_N.htm|title=PowerAde's zero-calorie sports drink takes on Gatorade&amp;nbsp;— USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerade Option was subsequently discontinued.&lt;ref name="adweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/client/e3i43f8401a4817748c80be9b9e19d11174|title=Adweek: How Powerade Downed Gatorade in Court, August 6, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, The Coca-Cola Company bought [[Glacéau]], owner of brands such as VitaminWater and SmartWater, for $4.1 billion, a price tag that signaled the company’s seriousness in pursuing growth of non-carbonated beverages. Since then, the company has also given its Glacéau management team control of its Powerade sports drink brand.

==Competition==
Powerade's main competition is [[Gatorade]] marketed by the [[Quaker Oats Company]], a division of [[PepsiCo]].  Gatorade, which was branded at the University of Florida in 1965, was the first commercially available sports drink in the United States. It now holds a commanding share of the market. As of 2011, Gatorade held a 70 percent market share to Powerade's 28.5 percent.&lt;ref name="AdAge Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/watch-spot-2-powerade-launches-underdog-campaign/233082/|title=Watch the Spot: No. 2 Powerade Launches 'Underdog' Campaign - News - Advertising Age|author=Shareen Pathak.|date=2 March 2012|work=adage.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[All Sport]] is a competitor marketed by All Sport, Inc. and distributed by the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group. All Sport was marketed by PepsiCo until 2001, when Gatorade's maker, the [[Quaker Oats Company]] was acquired by PepsiCo. All Sport was sold to the Monarch Beverage Company soon after. Powerade and All Sport have each been distributed through their own direct store deliver channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assessing the Consequences of a Channel Switch|jstor = 40057143|journal = Marketing Science|date = 2008-05-01|pages = 398–416|volume = 27|issue = 3|first = Xinlei (Jack)|last = Chen|first2 = George|last2 = John|first3 = Om|last3 = Narasimhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently purchased by Gary Smith, the Chairman &amp; CEO of All Sport, Inc. based in Austin, Texas.

Outside the United States the [[Lucozade]] [[energy drink]] (manufactured since 1927 by the pharmaceutical company now known as [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) competes with Powerade. Lucozade's formulation differs in that it uses primarily [[glucose]] and contains caffeine. The more direct competitor to Powerade and Gatorade is Lucozade Sport.

==Criticism==
Like its main competitor, Gatorade, Powerade is made with sugar, syrups and salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/22/business/22soda.html?ex=1186372800&amp;en=6331daea5be3b848&amp;ei=5070|title=Critics Say Soda Policy for Schools Lacks Teeth|author=Melanie Warner|publisher=New York Times|date=August 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One Powerade [[ad campaign]] saying that Powerade ION4 is superior to Gatorade has been accused of being deceptive and false by Pepsi, the parent owner of [[Gatorade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/21/sitroom.02.html| work=CNN|title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts ruled in favor of Powerade as of August 2009.

==Club History==

T. Turnbull, George and Joseph Boothby and around 15 others. The Governor, [[Sir James Fergusson, 6th Baronet|Sir James Fergusson]] was club patron. An inaugural game of 14 holes (7 holes played twice) was played on the Adelaide Racecourse (later renamed Victoria Racecourse) on 15 May 1870, when Lindsay and John Gordon tied for first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39208681 |title=Golf |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=17 May 1870 |accessdate=23 May 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nine-hole course was laid out and a greenkeeper appointed, but when Fergusson was recalled in 1873, membership in the Adelaide Golf Club declined and folded around 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59388452 |title=Fore ! |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=1 April 1933 |accessdate=23 May 2015 |page=1 Section: Magazine Section |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Firs Stadium''' was a [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] stadium in Cromer Road, [[Norwich]].

==History==
The stadium was built on an empty field situated in the Hellesdon area on the west side of where the Holt Road and Cromer Road meet. The address was listed as Aylsham Road but this is a little misleading because although the Cromer Road is effectively a continuation of the Aylsham Road it was unequivocally on the Cromer Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/621280/311589/12/100707|title=OS County Series Essex 1919|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been named after the nearby Firs House.

==Speedway==
{{main article|Norwich Stars}}

The stadium was owned by the Eastern Speedways and was a popular speedway venue opening on 17 August 1930 and closing on 31 October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defunctspeedway.co.uk/norwich.htm|title=Norwich Speedway|publisher=Defunct Speedway Tracks}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.national-speedway-museum.co.uk/norwich%20-%20the%20firs.html|title=Norwich, The Firs Stadium|publisher=The National Speedway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greyhound racing==
The Firs Stadium was the first of four greyhound tracks that operated in the city. It was a short lived enterprise only lasting from 1932 until 1935.&lt;ref name=DM&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|page =420|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening night was 30 July 1932 two months before the opening of the [[Boundary Park Stadium]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=To-Night, Greyhound Racing at the Firs Stadium, 15 October|year=1932|newspaper=Eastern Daily Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only survived until 14 January 1935 probably due to stiff competition from other Norwich tracks.&lt;ref name=DM/&gt; The racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body).

[[File:The Jackie Robinson Story (1950) still 1.jpg|thumb|270px|&lt;center&gt;[[Ruby Dee]] and [[Joel Fluellen]] (center)]]
'''''The Jackie Robinson Story''''' is a 1950 [[biographical film]] directed by [[Alfred E. Green]] (who had directed ''[[The Jolson Story]]'', "one of the biggest hits of the 40s")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://entertainment.time.com/2008/02/04/the-25-most-important-films-on-race/slide/the-jackie-robinson-story-1950/| title=The Jackie Robinson Story| first= Richard|last= Corliss |authorlink=Richard Corliss |date= February 4, 2008|work = Top 25 Important Movies On Race| publisher= Time |accessdate= 2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starring [[Jackie Robinson]] as himself. The film focuses on Robinson's struggle with the abuse of bigots as he becomes the first [[African-American]] [[Major League Baseball]] player of the modern era.

The film is among the [[list of films in the public domain in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Aisha|title=When Jackie Robinson Played Himself|date=11 April 2013|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)]]''|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/04/11/the_jackie_robinson_story_differs_from_42_in_important_ways_watch_it_here.html|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However a new copyrighted "restored and in color" version was released in conjunction with the Jackie Robinson Foundation in 2008.

==Plot==
The film begins with Robinson as a boy. He is given a worn-out [[baseball glove]] by a stranger impressed by his fielding skills.  As a young man, he becomes a multi-sport star at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], but as he nears graduation, he worries about his future. His older brother [[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Mack]] was also an outstanding college athlete and graduate, but the only job he could get was that of a lowly [[Street sweeper|street cleaner]].

When America enters [[World War II]], Robinson is drafted, serving as an athletic director. Afterward, he plays baseball with a professional African-American team. However, the constant travel keeps him away from his college sweetheart, [[Rachel Robinson|Rae]].

Then one day, [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] scout [[Clyde Sukeforth]] invites him to meet [[Branch Rickey]], president of the Major League Baseball team. At first, Robinson considers the offer to be a practical joke, as African Americans are not allowed to play in the segregated major leagues. When he is convinced that the opportunity is genuine, he and Rickey size each other up. After thinking over Rickey's warning about the hatred and abuse he would have to endure ''without'' being able to strike back, Robinson signs with the Dodgers' [[International League]] [[farm team]], the [[Montreal Royals]]. Though he wants to delay marrying Rae to shield her, she insists on an immediate wedding so she can support her man in the trying times ahead.

Robinson leads the league in hitting in his first year, and despite the grave concerns expressed by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, Rickey goes ahead and promotes him to the Dodgers. Reviled at first by many of the fans and some of his own teammates, Robinson gets off to a shaky start, playing out of position at first base and going through a hitting slump, but then gradually wins people over with his talent and determination. The team goes on to win the pennant, with Robinson driving in the tying run and scoring the winning one in the deciding game.

At the end, Robinson is invited to address the [[United States House of Representatives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Production==
[[Principal photography]] for the film took place in the off-season following his [[1949 Brooklyn Dodgers season|third season with the Brooklyn Dodgers]].&lt;ref name="tcm"/&gt;  Much of the film was shot at Gilmore Field, home of the PCL Hollywood Stars.

==Reception==
Even during its initial release&amp;mdash;in the era of [[racial segregation]]&amp;mdash;the film received critical praise and fared well at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.legendaryauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=117189&amp;searchby=0&amp;searchvalue=None&amp;page=9&amp;sortby=0&amp;displayby=2&amp;lotsperpage=100&amp;category=1&amp;seo=1950-%E2%80%9CThe-Jackie-Robinson-Story%E2%80%9D-Lobby-Cards-Complete-Set-(8)| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120318121318/http://www.legendaryauctions.com/LotDetail.aspx?lotid=117189&amp;searchby=0&amp;searchvalue=None&amp;page=9&amp;sortby=0&amp;displayby=2&amp;lotsperpage=100&amp;category=1&amp;seo=1950-%E2%80%9CThe-Jackie-Robinson-Story%E2%80%9D-Lobby-Cards-Complete-Set-%288%29 | archivedate= 2012-03-18| title= Lot #985: 1950 "The Jackie Robinson Story" Lobby Cards Complete Set (8) | date= March 2011 | quote=Baseball biopics, in general, are harshly panned by the critics, and lightly ridiculed by the customers. The 1950 release of “The Jackie Robinson Story,” on the other hand, met a measure of critical approval, and it fared well at the box office. |publisher= LegendaryAuctions.com |accessdate= 2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bosley Crowther]], "What is surprising...in this new film ...is the sincerity of the dramatization and the integrity of Mr. Robinson playing himself. Too often, in films of this nature about sports figures, fanciful or real, the sentiments are inflated and the heroics glorified. Here the simple story of Mr. Robinson's trail-blazing career is re-enacted with manifest fidelity and conspicuous dramatic restraint. And Mr. Robinson, doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:
* 2006: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers]] – Nominated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/cheers300.pdf |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers Nominees |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colorized version==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
On April 19, 2005, [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Legend Films]] released a [[film colorization|colorized]] version of the film, donating a portion of the proceeds to the [[Jackie Robinson Foundation]], a charity that benefits education for gifted students. An "official" version remains in release by [[MGM Home Entertainment]] (whose sister company, [[United Artists]], produced this film).

'''West Park Oval''' is an Australian Rules football, cycling and athletics venue located on the shores of Bass Strait in Burnie, Tasmania.
It is the current home of the Burnie Dockers in the [[Tasmanian Football League|Tasmanian State League]] and previously in the NTFL and  in the original [[Tasmanian Football League|TFL Statewide League]].

==History==
'''West Park Oval''' was also home of the former Cooee Football Club (later renamed Burnie Hawks in 1987 and the former Burnie Tigers Football Club in the [[North West Football Union]] (NWFU) and later of the NTFL until both clubs amalgamated in early 1994.

The ground hosted five Tasmanian State Grand Finals between 1961 and 1978, including the final State Premiership decider held in 1978, and was also the site of some of Tasmanian football's most infamous matches.

During an NWFU match in 1936 a hurricane hit West Park in the final quarter of a match between Burnie Tigers and Penguin, and as players were unable to keep their feet in the blinding rain and wind, many lay flat in the mud as there was great panic in the crowd as the hurricane threatened to demolish the Main Stand. Burnie (finishing the match with eleven men on the field) won 8.10 (58) to Penguin (who finished with six men on the field) 2.5 (17).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article52094679 |title=IN HURRICANE. |newspaper=[[The Examiner (Tasmania)|The Examiner]] |location=Launceston, Tasmania |date=17 August 1936 |accessdate=4 October 2011 |page=2|edition=DAILY|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably, Tasmanian football's most controversial match was the [[1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final]] between Wynyard and North Hobart, where hundreds of Wynyard fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts as North Hobart's Dickie Collins went back to take a kick after the siren with Wynyard leading by one point. Umpires, players, team officials and police attempted to clear a path for Collins to take his kick, but Collins was eventually escorted from the ground under police protection, taking the match ball with him as a souvenir. The Tasmanian Football League declared the match a "no result" and withheld the 1967 State Premiership.

In 1967, a ground record crowd for a football match of 12,951 attended an exhibition match between the [[North Western Football Union]] representative team and the defending [[Victorian Football League]] premiers, {{AFL Stk}}. St Kilda 35.27 (237) defeated NWFU 13.7 (85).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=10 July 1967|title=A double century to Saints|publication-place=Melbourne|page=46|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, visiting side [[Hobart Football Club|Hobart]] became the first side in the [[Tasmanian Football League|TFL]] in 38 years not to register a goal in a senior match, managing a paltry 0.5 (5) against the [[Burnie Dockers Football Club|Burnie Dockers]] and losing by 97 points in atrocious conditions.

The lowest attendance ever recorded at a [[Tasmanian Football League|TFL]] final was recorded at West Park in atrocious weather conditions in 1997 where only 1,010 braved the elements to see the [[Burnie Dockers Football Club|Burnie Dockers]] defeat [[Clarence Football Club|Clarence]] 14.4 (88) to 2.8 (20) in the Qualifying Final (the two sides would meet again three weeks later in the Grand Final at [[North Hobart Oval]] and fight out a 38-goal thriller, with [[Clarence Football Club|Clarence]] turning the tables on the hapless Dockers).&lt;br /&gt; 
It hosted AFL pre-season practice matches in the early 1990s, with over 12,000 attending the Carlton v St Kilda match in 1991.&lt;br /&gt; 
West Park was the first Tasmanian football venue to install lights for night football, the first night match was played between Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in a Foster's NFL Shield match on 9 June 1989 where the visiting team won by 14 points in wet and cold conditions.&lt;br /&gt; 
It became the first ground to host a night match in TFL history on 15 May 1993 when [[Burnie Hawks Football Club|Burnie Hawks]] defeated coastal-rival [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] by 51 points.

West Park is also the home of the Burnie Athletics Club and the City  of Burnie Cycling Club; the ground hosts the [[Burnie Gift]] and Burnie Wheel each year.

In 1977 cyclist Danny Clark staged one of the most memorable moments in Tasmanian sporting history when he surged from the rear of the pack, 100m behind on the final lap to scream home to take out the 1977 Burnie Wheel before almost 15,000 screaming fans on 1 January 1977. The legendary call of the finish of the race by North West Coastal sporting identity Harold 'Tiger' Dowling is etched in Coastal sporting folklore.
West Park has three grandstands, the 1914-built Burnie Athletic Club Memorial Stand on the Bass Strait side of the ground, an open stand on the opposite wing opened during the 1960s and the newly built The Point members pavilion opened in 2009.

A State cricket match between Tasmania and New South Wales was held at the venue on 4 December 2010. 
After losing the toss Tasmania were put in and scored 189 in the hybrid one-day format. New South Wales won by 7 wickets.  The crowd was 4,552, the highest crowd at the venue since the former [[Statewide Football in Tasmania|TFL Statewide League]]. The match was played under foggy but clearing skies to a fine 26 degrees. Glenn McGrath was a special guest at the match. Since the small boundary towards the Southern End is approximately 70 metres, Phil Hughes hit a ball onto the Bass Highway to the delight of the crowd.   The ground is scheduled to hold another List A match in November 2011 between Tasmania and [[South Australia cricket team|South Australia]] in the [[2011–12 Ryobi One-Day Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/2/4972_a.html|title=List A Matches played on NWTCA Ground, Burnie|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
