      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Abortion in the Czech Republic''' is legally allowed up to 12 weeks of [[pregnancy]], with medical indications up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, in case of grave problems with the [[fetus]] at any time. Those performed for medical indications are covered by [[universal healthcare|public health insurance]], but, otherwise [[abortion]] is relatively affordable in the [[Czech Republic]].  In [[Czech language|Czech]], induced abortion is referred to as ''interrupce'' or ''umělé přerušení těhotenství'', often colloquially ''potrat'' ("miscarriage").

==History==
[[Image:AbortionCzechRepublic.png|thumb|450px|The number of induced abortions in the Czech Republic between 1958 and 2005.]]
In 1957 abortions were legalized in [[Czechoslovakia]], although with restrictions that depended on the current policy of the [[government]]. In 1986 the restrictions were lifted resulting in growth of the number of abortions.

Since 1993, abortions for non-medical reasons have not been paid for by the public health system. The absolute peak of the number of abortions was reached in 1990 at over 100,000 per year, but has declined steadily down since then, reaching less than 1/3 of the peak level in 2004. Reasons for this decrease have included the wider availability of [[contraception]] and better [[sex education]].

Medical abortion (with [[mifepristone]]) was registered in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/page/3226/czech-republic&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Total number of abortions in 2009 was 40 528 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uzis.cz/download_file.php?file=3682|title=Potraty v roce 2009|language=Czech|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-05-06|publisher=Ústav zdravotnických informací a statistiky (Office of Medical Information and Statistics)}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitalia.cz/tiskove-zpravy/potraty-2009-v-cislech/ |title=Potraty 2009 v číslech |language=Czech |accessdate=2010-05-06 |date=2010-05-05 |publisher=[IInfo.cz] |work=[Vitalia.cz]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100507075225/http://www.vitalia.cz/tiskove-zpravy/potraty-2009-v-cislech/| archivedate= 7 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 14 629 (i.e. 3.1%) were spontaneous abortions,  24 636 (60,79%) induced abortions (historically the lowest number ever) of which 77% were "mini-interruptions" (within 8 weeks of pregnancy). 1,300 [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancies]] were aborted. Total abortions per woman is 0.53, induced abortions is 0.34.

{{as of|2010}}, the abortion rate was 10.7 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years.&lt;ref name="un2013"&gt;{{cite web | title = World Abortion Policies 2013 | publisher = United Nations | year = 2013 | url = https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/policy/world-abortion-policies-2013.shtml | accessdate = 3 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regionally, the highest abortion ratio is in northern and north-western [[Bohemia]] due the structure of the population (in 2002 in [[Tachov District]] 31.3% of abortions were induced). The lowest ratios are in rural districts of southern [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemian-Moravian Highlands]] (in 2002 in [[Žďár nad Sázavou District]] 15.5% of abortions were induced).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional ratios of induced abortions in 2002|url=http://www.czso.cz/csu/2004edicniplan.nsf/t/E50044958A/$File/402804m2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional ratios of induced abortions in 2006|url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/domaci/spolecnost/foto.phtml?id=99998&amp;cid=478979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Abortion ratios in large industrial cities are generally higher compared to small towns and the countryside.

Married women form the largest segment but their ratio is decreasing in favour of unmarried young women. Women with tertiary level of education have about 6% of induced abortions. In 2009 7.5% of the women are foreigners living in the Czech Republic. Official statistics about [[abortion tourism]] (mainly from neighbouring [[Poland]] where legal induced abortion is strictly limited) do not exist but the numbers are estimated to be low.

==Public opinion==
{{Main|Societal attitudes towards abortion}}
The public in the Czech Republic generally supports the legality of abortion. This has been confirmed by a number of [[opinion polls]].

*An April 2003 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]/ORC Macro report examined opinions on abortion among women aged 15 to 44, asking, "Do you think that a woman always has the right to decide about her pregnancy, including whether to have an abortion?" In 2003, 85% of Czechs surveyed thought a woman always had the right to an abortion and 15% did not. Of those 15%, 91% believed abortion was acceptable in cases of life endangerment, 74% in cases of fetal defects, 72% in cases of risk to health, 71% in cases of rape, 16% if the family could not financially support a child, and 8% if the woman was unmarried.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ORC Macro.

Retrieved February 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A May 2005 [[Euro RSCG]]/[[Taylor Nelson Sofres|TNS Sofres]] poll examined attitudes toward abortion in 10 [[Europe]]an countries, asking polltakers whether they agreed with the statement, "If a woman doesn't want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion". 66% of [[Czechs]] replied "very much", 15% replied "a little", 8% replied "not really", and replied 10% "not at all". Support for the availability of abortion in the Czech Republic, at 81%, was the highest out of all the nations featured in the poll.&lt;ref&gt;TNS Sofres. (May 2005).

Retrieved January 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A May 2007 CVVM poll found that 72% of Czechs believe that abortion should be allowed "at the request of the woman", 19% that it should be allowed for "societal reasons", 5% that it should be allowed only if "a woman’s health is at risk", 1% that it should be "banned".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/16054 Most in Czech Republic Support Abortion Rights]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}."

'''Alcoholic liver disease''' is a term that encompasses the [[liver]] manifestations of [[alcohol]] overconsumption, including [[fatty liver]], [[alcoholic hepatitis]], and chronic [[hepatitis]] with liver [[fibrosis]] or [[cirrhosis]].&lt;ref name=AASLD10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Shea RS, Dasarathy S, McCullough AJ |title=Alcoholic liver disease: AASLD Practice Guidelines |journal=Hepatology |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=307–28 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20034030 |doi=10.1002/hep.23258 |url=http://www.aasld.org/practiceguidelines/Documents/Bookmarked%20Practice%20Guidelines/AlcoholicLiverDisease1-2010.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the major cause of [[liver disease]] in Western countries. Although [[steatosis]] (fatty liver) will develop in any individual who consumes a large quantity of alcoholic beverages over a long period of time, this process is transient and reversible.&lt;ref name=AASLD10/&gt; Of all chronic heavy drinkers, only 15–20% develop hepatitis or cirrhosis, which can occur concomitantly or in succession.&lt;ref name=Menon01&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Menon KV, Gores GJ, Shah VH |title=Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of alcoholic liver disease |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=76 |issue=10 |pages=1021–9 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11605686 |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)62487-7/pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.4065/76.10.1021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism behind this is not completely understood. 80% of alcohol passes through the liver to be detoxified. Chronic consumption of alcohol results in the secretion of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s ([[TNF-alpha]], [[Interleukin 6]] [IL6] and [[Interleukin 8]] [IL8]), [[oxidative stress]], [[lipid peroxidation]], and [[acetaldehyde]] [[toxicity]]. These factors cause [[inflammation]], [[apoptosis]] and eventually [[fibrosis]] of liver cells. Why this occurs in only a few individuals is still unclear. Additionally, the liver has tremendous capacity to regenerate and even when 75% of [[hepatocytes]] are dead, it continues to function as normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Risk factors==
The risk factors presently known are:
* '''Quantity of alcohol taken''': Consumption of 60–80g per day (14g is considered one standard drink in the USA, i.e., 1.5 fl oz hard liquor, 5 fl oz wine, 12 fl oz beer; drinking a six-pack of beer daily would be in the middle of the range) for 20 years or more in men, or 20g/day for women significantly increases the risk of hepatitis and fibrosis by 7% to 47%,&lt;ref name=AASLD10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mandayam S, Jamal MM, Morgan TR |title=Epidemiology of alcoholic liver disease |journal=Semin. Liver Dis. |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=217–32 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15349801 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-832936 |citeseerx=10.1.1.594.1256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pattern of drinking:''' Drinking outside of meal times increases up to 3 times the risk of alcoholic liver disease.&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt;
* '''Sex:''' Women are twice as susceptible to alcohol-related liver disease, and may develop alcoholic liver disease with shorter durations and doses of chronic consumption. The lesser amount of alcohol dehydrogenase secreted in the gut, higher proportion of body fat in women, and changes in fat absorption due to the menstrual cycle may explain this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt;
* '''Hepatitis C infection''': A concomitant hepatitis C infection significantly accelerates the process of liver injury.&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt;
* '''Genetic factors:''' Genetic factors predispose both to alcoholism and to alcoholic liver disease. Both monozygotic twins are more likely to be alcoholics and to develop liver cirrhosis than both dizygotic twins. Polymorphisms in the enzymes involved in the metabolism of alcohol, such as ADH, [[ALDH]], CYP4502E1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine polymorphism may partly explain this genetic component. However, no specific polymorphisms have currently been firmly linked to alcoholic liver disease.
* '''[[Iron overload]] (Hemochromatosis)'''
* '''Diet''': Malnutrition, particularly vitamin A and E deficiencies, can worsen alcohol-induced liver damage by preventing regeneration of hepatocytes. This is particularly a concern as alcoholics are usually malnourished because of a poor diet, anorexia, and encephalopathy.&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Pathogenesis alcoholic liver injury.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Pathogenesis of alcohol induced liver injury]]

===Fatty change===
{{Main|Fatty liver}}
Fatty change, or [[steatosis]] is the accumulation of fatty acids in [[hepatocyte|liver cells]]. These can be seen as fatty globules under the microscope. Alcoholism causes development of large fatty globules ([[Macroscopic|macro]] [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicular]] steatosis) throughout the liver and can begin to occur after a few days of heavy drinking.&lt;ref name=Inaba04&gt;{{cite book |last2=Cohen |first2=William B. |last1=Inaba |first1=Darryl |title=Uppers, downers, all arounders: physical and mental effects of psychoactive drugs |publisher=CNS Publications |location=Ashland, Or |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-926544-27-7 |edition=5th |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alcohol is metabolized by [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] ([[Alcohol dehydrogenase|ADH]]) into [[acetaldehyde]], then further metabolized by [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] (ALDH) into [[acetic acid]], which is finally oxidized into [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) and water ({{H2O}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Inaba|Cohen|2004|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process generates [[NADH]], and increases the NADH/[[NAD+]] ratio. A higher NADH concentration induces [[fatty acid synthesis]] while a decreased NAD level results in decreased fatty acid oxidation. Subsequently, the higher levels of fatty acids signal the liver cells to compound it to [[glycerol]] to form [[triglyceride]]s. These triglycerides accumulate, resulting in fatty liver.

===Alcoholic hepatitis===
{{Main|Alcoholic hepatitis}}
Alcoholic hepatitis is characterized by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993).  While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others.  This is called alcoholic [[Fat cell|steato]] [[necrosis]] and the inflammation appears to predispose to liver [[fibrosis]]. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased intestinal permeability due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the portal circulation. The Kupffer cells of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt;

===Cirrhosis===
{{Main|Cirrhosis}}
Cirrhosis is a late stage of serious liver disease marked by [[inflammation]] (swelling), [[fibrosis]] (cellular hardening) and damaged membranes preventing detoxification of chemicals in the body, ending in scarring and [[necrosis]] (cell death). Between 10% to 20% of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis of the liver (NIAAA, 1993). [[Acetaldehyde]] may be responsible for alcohol-induced fibrosis by stimulating [[collagen]] deposition by [[hepatic stellate cell]]s.&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt; The production of oxidants derived from NADPH oxi- dase and/or [[cytochrome]] P-450 2E1 and the formation of acetaldehyde-protein adducts damage the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref name=Menon01/&gt;
[[Symptom]]s include [[jaundice]] (yellowing), liver enlargement, and pain and tenderness from the structural changes in damaged liver architecture. Without total abstinence from alcohol use, cirrhosis will eventually lead to [[liver failure]]. Late complications of cirrhosis or liver failure include [[portal hypertension]] (high [[blood pressure]] in the [[portal vein]] due to the increased flow resistance through the damaged liver), [[Coagulopathy|coagulation disorders]] (due to impaired production of coagulation factors), [[ascites]] (heavy abdominal swelling due to buildup of fluids in the tissues) and other complications, including [[hepatic encephalopathy]] and the [[hepatorenal syndrome]].
Cirrhosis can also result from other causes than alcohol abuse, such as [[viral hepatitis]] and heavy exposure to [[toxin]]s other than [[ethanol|alcohol]].  The late stages of cirrhosis may look similar medically, regardless of cause. This phenomenon is termed the "final common pathway" for the disease.
Fatty change and alcoholic hepatitis with [[abstinence]] can be reversible. The later stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis tend to be irreversible, but can usually be contained with abstinence for long periods of time.

==Diagnosis==
In the early stages, patients with ALD exhibits subtle and often no abnormal physical findings. It is usually not until development of advanced liver disease that stigmata of chronic liver disease become apparent. Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels are found to be elevated. These usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis with inflammation are seen in liver biopsy specimens. These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatosis usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol use will result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, [[hepatomegaly]], and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation.Tender hepatomegaly may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCullough|first1=AJ|last2=O'Connor|first2=JF|title=Alcoholic liver disease: proposed recommendations for the American College of Gastroenterology.|journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology|date=November 1998|volume=93|issue=11|pages=2022–36|pmid=9820369|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.00587.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laboratory findings ===
In people with alcoholic hepatitis, the serum [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST) to [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) ratio is greater than 2:1. AST and ALT levels are almost always less than 500. The elevated AST to ALT ratio is due to deficiency of [[pyridoxal phosphate]], which is required in the ALT enzyme synthetic pathway. Furthermore, alcohol metabolite–induced injury of hepatic [[mitochondria]] results in AST isoenzyme release. Other laboratory findings include red blood cell [[macrocytosis]] ([[mean corpuscular volume]] &gt; 100) and elevations of serum [[gamma-glutamyl transferase]] (GGT), [[alkaline phosphatase]] (Alk Phos), and [[bilirubin]] levels. [[Folate]] level is reduced in alcoholic patients due to decreased intestinal absorption, increased bone marrow requirement for folate in the presence of alcohol, and increased urinary loss. The magnitude of [[leukocytosis]] ([[white blood cell]] depletion) reflects severity of liver injury. Histologic features include [[Mallory bodies]], giant mitochondria, hepatocyte [[necrosis]], and [[neutrophil]] infiltration in the area around the veins. Mallory bodies, which are also present in other liver diseases, are condensations of cytokeratin components in the hepatocyte cytoplasm and do not contribute to liver injury. Up to 70% of patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis already have cirrhosis identifiable on biopsy examination at the time of diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Biomarkers in alcoholism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niemelä|first1=O|title=Biomarkers in alcoholism.|journal=Clinica Chimica Acta|date=February 2007|volume=377|issue=1–2|pages=39–49|pmid=17045579|doi=10.1016/j.cca.2006.08.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Not drinking further alcohol is the most important part of treatment.&lt;ref name=World2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suk|first1=KT|last2=Kim|first2=MY|last3=Baik|first3=SK|title=Alcoholic liver disease: treatment.|journal=World Journal of Gastroenterology|date=28 September 2014|volume=20|issue=36|pages=12934–44|pmid=25278689|doi=10.3748/wjg.v20.i36.12934|pmc=4177474}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with chronic HCV infection should abstain from any alcohol intake, due to the risk for rapid acceleration of liver disease.&lt;ref name="Biomarkers in alcoholism"/&gt;

=== Medications ===
A 2006 Cochrane review did not find evidence sufficient for the use of [[androgenic anabolic steroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rambaldi|first1=A|last2=Gluud|first2=C|title=Anabolic-androgenic steroids for alcoholic liver disease.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 October 2006|issue=4|pages=CD003045|pmid=17054157|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003045.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corticosteroids are sometimes used; however, this is recommended only when severe liver inflammation is present.&lt;ref name=World2014/&gt;

=== Transplantation ===
Although in rare cases liver cirrhosis is reversible, the disease process remains mostly irreversible. Liver transplantation remains the only definitive therapy. Today, survival after liver transplantation is similar for people with ALD and non-ALD. The requirements for transplant listing are the same as those for other types of liver disease, except for a 6-month sobriety prerequisite along with psychiatric evaluation and rehabilitation assistance (i.e., Alcoholics Anonymous). Specific requirements vary among the transplant centers. Relapse to alcohol use after transplant listing results in delisting. Re-listing is possible in many institutions, but only after 3–6 months of sobriety. There are limited data on transplant survival in patients transplanted for acute alcoholic hepatitis, but it is believed to be similar to that in nonacute ALD, non-ALD, and alcoholic hepatitis with MDF less than 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuberger|first1=J|last2=Schulz|first2=KH|last3=Day|first3=C|last4=Fleig|first4=W|last5=Berlakovich|first5=GA|last6=Berenguer|first6=M|last7=Pageaux|first7=GP|last8=Lucey|first8=M|last9=Horsmans|first9=Y|last10=Burroughs|first10=A|last11=Hockerstedt|first11=K|title=Transplantation for alcoholic liver disease.|journal=Journal of Hepatology|date=January 2002|volume=36|issue=1|pages=130–7|pmid=11804676|pmc=1837536|doi=10.1016/s0168-8278(01)00278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for people with ALD depends on the liver histology as well as cofactors, such as concomitant chronic viral hepatitis. Among patients with alcoholic hepatitis, progression to liver cirrhosis occurs at 10–20% per year, and 70% will eventually develop cirrhosis. Despite cessation of alcohol use, only 10% will have normalization of histology and serum liver enzyme levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=W|last2=Jamil|first2=LH|last3=Brown|first3=LS|last4=Wiesner|first4=RH|last5=Kim|first5=WR|last6=Menon|first6=KV|last7=Malinchoc|first7=M|last8=Kamath|first8=PS|last9=Shah|first9=V|title=MELD accurately predicts mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|journal=Hepatology|date=February 2005|volume=41|issue=2|pages=353–8|pmid=15660383|doi=10.1002/hep.20503}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, the MDF has been used to predict short-term mortality (i.e., MDF ≥ 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 50–65% without corticosteroid therapy, and MDF &lt; 32 associated with spontaneous survival of 90%).The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has also been found to have similar predictive accuracy in 30day (MELD &gt; 11) and 90-day (MELD &gt; 21) mortality. Liver cirrhosis develops in 6–14% of those who consume more than 60–80 g of alcohol daily for men and more than 20 g daily for women. Even in those who drink more than 120 g daily, only 13.5% will suffer serious alcohol-related liver injury. Nevertheless, alcohol-related mortality was the third leading cause of death in 2003 in the United States. Worldwide mortality is estimated to be 150,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheth|first1=M|last2=Riggs|first2=M|last3=Patel|first3=T|title=Utility of the Mayo End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score in assessing prognosis of patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|journal=BMC Gastroenterology |date=2002|volume=2|pages=2|pmid=11835693|doi=10.1186/1471-230X-2-2|pmc=65516|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

W. Meigen]] in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Meigen, J. W. (1818). Systematische Beschreibung der Bekannten Europäischen Zweiflügeligen Insekten Vol. 1. Forstmann, Aachen, 332 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; About 460 species are recognised; while over 100 can transmit human [[malaria]], only 30–40 commonly transmit parasites of the genus ''[[Plasmodium]]'', which cause malaria in humans in [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] areas. ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' is one of the best known, because of its predominant role in the transmission of the most dangerous malaria parasite species (to humans) – ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''.

The name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|αν}}, ''{{lang|el|an}}'', meaning "not", and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:όφελος|όφελος]]}}, ''{{lang|el|óphelos}}'', meaning "profit", and translates to "useless".&lt;ref name="dict"/&gt; ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes kill about 440,000 people each year because of malaria.

Some species of ''Anopheles'' also can serve as the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] for canine [[heartworm]] ''Dirofilaria immitis'', the [[filariasis]]-causing species ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' and ''[[Brugia malayi]]'', and [[virus]]es such as one that causes [[O'nyong'nyong]] fever. An association of [[brain tumor]] incidence and [[malaria]] suggests the ''Anopheles'' might transmit a virus or other agent that could cause a brain tumor.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt;

Mosquitoes in other genera (''[[Aedes]]'', ''[[Culex]]'', ''[[Culiseta]]'', ''[[Haemagogus]]'', and ''[[Ochlerotatus]]'') can also serve as vectors of disease agents, but not human malaria.

Nucleic Acids Res &lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' and ''[[Anopheles funestus]]'' clades diverged between {{Ma|80}} and {{Ma|36}}. A molecular study of several genes in seven species has provided additional support for an expansion of this genus during the [[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="Dixit2010"/&gt; 

The ''Anopheles'' genome, at 230–284 million base pairs (Mbp), is comparable in size to that of ''[[Drosophila]]'', but considerably smaller than those found in other culicine genomes (528 Mbp–1.9 Gbp). Like most culicine species, the genome is [[diploid]] with six [[chromosome]]s.

The only known [[fossil]]s of this genus are those of ''Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) dominicanus'' &lt;small&gt;Zavortink &amp; Poinar&lt;/small&gt; contained in [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[amber]] from the Late [[Eocene]] ({{Ma|40.4}} to {{Ma|33.9}}) and ''[[Anopheles rottensis]]'' &lt;small&gt;Statz&lt;/small&gt;  contained in [[Germany|German]] amber from the Late [[Oligocene]] ({{Ma|28.4}} to {{Ma|23.0}}).

==Systematics==
{{main|Taxonomy of Anopheles}}
The genus ''Anopheles'' Meigen (nearly worldwide distribution) belongs to the subfamily Anophelinae together with another two genera:  ''[[Bironella]]'' Theobald ([[Australia]] only) and ''[[Chagasia]]'' Cruz ([[Neotropics]]). The taxonomy remains incompletely settled. Classification into species is based on morphological characteristics – wing spots, head anatomy, larval and pupal anatomy, chromosome structure, and more recently, on DNA sequences.

The genus has been subdivided into seven subgenera based primarily on the number and positions of specialized [[setae]] on the [[gonocoxite]]s of the [[male]] [[genitalia]]. The system of subgenera originated with the work of Christophers, who in 1915 described three subgenera: ''Anopheles'' (widely distributed), ''Myzomyia'' (later renamed ''[[Cellia (subgenus)|Cellia]]'') ([[Old World]]) and ''[[Nyssorhynchus]]'' (Neotropical). ''Nyssorhynchus'' was first described as ''Lavernia'' by [[Frederick Vincent Theobald]]. [[Frederick Wallace Edwards]] in 1932 added the subgenus ''[[Stethomyia]]'' (Neotropical distribution). ''[[Kerteszia]]'' was also described by Edwards in 1932, but then recognised as a subgrouping of ''Nyssorhynchus''. It was elevated to subgenus status by Komp in 1937, and it is also found in the Neotropics. Two additional subgenera have since been recognised: ''[[Baimaia]]'' (Southeast Asia only) by Harbach ''et al.'' in 2005 and ''[[Lophopodomyia]]'' (Neotropical) by Antunes in 1937.

Two main groupings within the genus ''Anopheles'' are used: one formed by the ''Cellia'' and ''Anopheles'' subgenera and a second by ''[[Kerteszia]]'', ''Lophopodomyia'' and ''Nyssorhynchus''. Subgenus ''Stethomyia'' is an outlier with respect to these two taxa. Within the second group, ''[[Kerteszia]]'' and ''Nyssorhynchus'' appear to be sister taxa.

The number of species currently recognised within the subgenera is given here in parentheses: ''Anopheles'' (206 species), ''Baimaia'' (1), ''Cellia'' (216), ''[[Kerteszia]]'' (12), ''Lophopodomyia'' (6), ''Nyssorhynchus'' (34) and ''Stethomyia'' (5).

Taxonomic units between subgenus and species are not currently recognised as official zoological names. In practice, a number of taxonomic levels have been introduced. The larger subgenera (''Anopheles'', ''Cellia'' and ''Nyssorhynchus'') have been subdivided into sections and series which in turn have been divided into groups and subgroups. Below subgroup but above species level is the species complex. Taxonomic levels above species complex can be distinguished on morphological grounds. Species within a species complex are either morphologically identical or extremely similar and can only be reliably separated by microscopic examination of the chromosomes or DNA sequencing. The classification continues to be revised.

Subgenus ''Nyssorhynchus'' has been divided in three sections: ''Albimanus'' (19 species), ''Argyritarsis'' (11 species) and ''Myzorhynchella'' (4 species). The ''Argyritarsis'' section has been subdivided into ''Albitarsis'' and ''Argyritarsis'' groups.

The ''Anopheles'' group was divided by Edwards into four series: ''Anopheles'' (worldwide), ''Myzorhynchus'' (Palearctic, Oriental, Australasian and Afrotropical), ''Cycloleppteron'' (Neotropical) and ''Lophoscelomyia'' (Oriental); and two groups, ''Arribalzagia'' (Neotropical) and ''Christya'' (Afrotropical). Reid and Knight (1961) modified this classification and consequently subdivided the subgenus ''Anopheles'' into two sections, ''Angusticorn'' and ''Laticorn'' and six series. The Arribalzagia and Christya Groups were considered to be series. The Laticorn Section includes the ''Arribalzagia'' (24 species), ''Christya'' and ''Myzorhynchus'' series. The ''Angusticorn'' section includes members of the ''Anopheles'', ''Cycloleppteron'' and ''Lophoscelomyia'' series.

All species known to carry human malaria lie within either the ''Myzorhynchus'' or the ''Anopheles'' series.

==Life stages==

Like all mosquitoes, anophelines go through four stages in their life cycles: [[egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and [[imago]]. The first three stages are aquatic and together last 5–14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature. The adult stage is when the female ''Anopheles'' mosquito acts as [[malaria]] [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. The adult females can live up to a month (or more in captivity), but most probably do not live more than two weeks in nature.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/ |title=Anopheles Mosquitoes |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=December 21, 2016 |date=October 21, 2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eggs===
[[File:Anopheles egg 2.jpg|thumb |Anopheles egg]]
Adult females lay 50–200 eggs per [[oviposition]]. The eggs are quite small (about 0.5 × 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm). Eggs are laid singly and directly on water. They are unique in that they have floats on either side. Eggs are not resistant to drying and hatch within 2–3 days, although hatching may take up to 2–3 weeks in colder climates.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

===Larvae===

The mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] and a nine-segment [[abdomen]]. It has no legs. In contrast to other mosquitoes, the ''Anopheles'' larva lacks a respiratory siphon, so it positions itself so that its body is parallel to the surface of the water.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; In contrast, the feeding larva of a nonanopheline mosquito species attaches itself to the water surface with its posterior siphon, with its body pointing downwards.

Larvae breathe through [[spiracle]]s located on the eighth abdominal segment, so must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on [[algae]], [[bacteria]], and other microorganisms in the surface microlayer. They dive below the surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either by jerky movements of the entire body or through [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] with the mouth brushes.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

Larvae develop through four stages, or [[instar]]s, after which they [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into [[pupae]]. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their exoskeletons, or skin, to allow for further growth.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; First-stage larvae are about 1&amp;nbsp;mm in length; fourth-stage larvae are normally 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in length.

The process from egg-laying to emergence of the adult is temperature dependent, with a minimum time of seven days.

The larvae occur in a wide range of habitats, but most species prefer clean, unpolluted water. Larvae of ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes have been found in freshwater or saltwater marshes, mangrove swamps, rice fields, grassy ditches, the edges of streams and rivers, and small, temporary rain pools. Many species prefer habitats with vegetation. Others prefer habitats with none. Some breed in open, sun-lit pools, while others are found only in shaded breeding sites in forests. A few species breed in tree holes or the leaf axils of some plants.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

===Pupae===
Pupa is also known as tumbler.The pupa is comma-shaped when viewed from the side.  The head and [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] are merged into a [[cephalothorax]] with the abdomen curving around underneath. As with the larvae, pupae must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do through a pair of respiratory trumpets on their cephalothoraces. After a few days as a pupa, the dorsal surface of the cephalothorax splits and the adult mosquito emerges.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; The pupal stage lasts around 2–3 days in temperate areas.

===Adults===
[[File:Anopheles Culex adult resting position-USDA.jpg|left|thumb|Resting positions of adult ''Anopheles'' (A, B), compared to a nonanopheline mosquito (C)]]
The duration from egg to adult varies considerably among species, and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as little as five days, but it can take 10–14 days in tropical conditions.

Like all mosquitoes, adult ''Anopheles'' species have slender bodies with three sections: head, thorax and abdomen.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

The head is specialized for acquiring sensory information and for feeding. It contains the eyes and a pair of long, many-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. The antennae are important for detecting host odors, as well as odors of breeding sites where females lay eggs. The head also has an elongated, forward-projecting [[proboscis]] used for feeding, and two [[maxilla|maxillary palps]].&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; These palps also carry the receptors for [[carbon dioxide]], a major attractant for the location of the mosquito's host.

The [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] is specialized for locomotion. Three pairs of legs and a pair of wings are attached to the thorax.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

The abdomen is specialized for food digestion and egg development. This segmented body part expands considerably when a female takes a blood meal. The blood is digested over time, serving as a source of [[protein]] for the production of eggs, which gradually fill the [[abdomen]].&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be distinguished from other mosquitoes by the [[palp]]s, which are as long as the proboscis, and by the presence of discrete blocks of black and white scales on the wings. Adults can also be identified by their typical resting position: males and females rest with their abdomens sticking up in the air rather than parallel to the surface on which they are resting.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

Adult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large [[swarm]]s, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

Males live for about a week, feeding on [[nectar]] and other sources of [[sugar]]. Females will also feed on sugar sources for energy, but usually require a blood meal for the development of eggs. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes 2–3 days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

The cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

In a study by the [[London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine]] researchers found that female mosquitoes carrying malaria parasites are significantly more attracted to human breath and odours than uninfected mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130515174404.htm|title=Science Daily|work=sciencedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research team infected laboratory-raised ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'' mosquitoes with [[Plasmodium]] parasites, leaving a control group uninfected. Then tests were run on the two groups to record their attraction to human smells. Female mosquitoes are particularly drawn to foot odours, and one of the tests showed infected mosquitoes landing and biting a prospective host repeatedly. The team speculates that the parasite improves the mosquitoes' sense of smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23543-malaria-bug-may-give-mosquitoes-a-super-sense-of-smell.html|title=Malaria bug may give mosquitoes a super sense of smell|work=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also reduce its risk aversion.

==Habitat==
Although malaria is nowadays limited to tropical areas, most notoriously the regions of sub-Saharan Africa, many ''Anopheles'' species live in colder latitudes (see [https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/biology/mosquitoes/map.html this map] from the CDC). Indeed, malaria outbreaks have, in the past, occurred in colder climates, for example during the construction of the [[Rideau Canal]] in Canada during the 1820s.&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; Since then, the ''Plasmodium'' parasite (not the ''Anopheles'' mosquito) has been eliminated from first world countries.

The CDC warns, however, that "''Anopheles'' that can transmit malaria are found not only in malaria-endemic areas, but also in areas where malaria has been eliminated. The latter areas are thus constantly at risk of reintroduction of the disease.

==Susceptibility to become a vector of disease==
Some species are poor vectors of [[malaria]], as the [[parasite]]s do not develop well (or at all) within them. There is also variation within species. In the laboratory, it is possible to select strains of ''A. gambiae'' that are [[wikt:refractory|refractory]] to infection by [[malaria]] parasites. These refractory strains have an [[immune]] response that encapsulates and kills the parasites after they have invaded the mosquito's [[stomach]] wall. Scientists are studying the [[genetics|genetic]] mechanism for this response. Genetically modified mosquitoes refractory to malaria possibly could replace wild mosquitoes, thereby limiting or eliminating malaria transmission.

===Malaria transmission and control===
Understanding the biology and behavior of ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can help understand how malaria is transmitted, and can aid in designing appropriate control strategies. Factors affecting a mosquito's facility to transmit malaria include its innate susceptibility to ''[[Plasmodium]]'', its host choice and its longevity. Factors that should be taken into consideration when designing a control program include the susceptibility of malaria vectors to [[insecticide]]s and the preferred feeding and resting location of adult mosquitoes.

On December 21, 2007, a study published in [[PLoS Pathogens]] found the hemolytic C-type [[lectin]] CEL-III from ''Cucumaria echinata'', a [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] found in the [[Bay of Bengal]], impaired the development of the malaria parasite when produced by transgenic ''A.&amp;nbsp;stephensi''.&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; This could potentially be used to control malaria by spreading genetically modified mosquitoes refractory to the parasites, although numerous scientific and ethical issues must be overcome before such a control strategy could be implemented.

===Preferred sources for blood meals ===
One important behavioral factor is the degree to which an ''Anopheles'' species prefers to feed on humans ([[anthropophily]]) or animals such as cattle or birds (zoophily). Anthropophilic ''Anopheles'' are more likely to transmit the malaria parasites from one person to another. Most ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes are not exclusively anthropophilic or zoophilic. However, the primary malaria vectors in [[Africa]], ''A. gambiae'' and ''A. funestus'', are strongly anthropophilic and, consequently, are two of the most efficient malaria vectors in the world.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

Once ingested by a mosquito, malaria parasites must undergo development within the mosquito before they are infectious to humans. The time required for development in the mosquito (the extrinsic [[incubation period]]) ranges from 10–21 days, depending on the parasite species and the temperature. If a mosquito does not survive longer than the extrinsic incubation period, then she will not be able to transmit any malaria parasites.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

It is not possible to measure directly the lifespans of mosquitoes in nature, but indirect estimates of daily survivorship have been made for several ''Anopheles'' species. Estimates of daily survivorship of ''A. gambiae'' in [[Tanzania]] ranged from 0.77 to 0.84, meaning at the end of one day, between 77% and 84% will have survived.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

Assuming this survivorship is constant through the adult life of a mosquito, less than 10% of female ''A. gambiae'' would survive longer than a 14-day extrinsic incubation period. If daily survivorship increased to 0.9, over 20% of mosquitoes would survive longer than the same period. Control measures that rely on [[insecticide]]s (e.g. [[indoor residual spraying]]) may actually impact malaria [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] more through their effect on adult longevity than through their effect on the population of adult mosquitoes.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

===Patterns of feeding and resting===
Most ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes are [[crepuscular]] (active at dusk or dawn) or [[nocturnal]] (active at night). Some feed indoors (endophagic), while others feed outdoors (exophagic). After feeding, some blood mosquitoes prefer to rest indoors (endophilic), while others prefer to rest outdoors (exophilic),&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; though this can differ regionally based on local vector ecotype, and vector chromosomal makeup, as well as housing type and local microclimatic conditions.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Biting by nocturnal, endophagic ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes can be markedly reduced through the use of [[insecticide]]-treated bed nets or through improved housing construction to prevent mosquito entry (e.g. [[window screen|window screens]]). Endophilic mosquitoes are readily controlled by indoor spraying of residual insecticides. In contrast, exophagic/exophilic vectors are best controlled through source reduction (destruction of the breeding sites).&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;

===Gut flora===
Because transmission of disease by the mosquito requires ingestion of blood, the gut flora may have a bearing on the success of infection of the mosquito host. This aspect of disease transmission has not been investigated until recently.&lt;ref name=Wang2011/&gt; The larval and pupal gut is largely colonised by photosynthetic cyanobacteria, while in the adult, [[Proteobacteria]] and [[Bacteroidetes]] predominate. Blood meals drastically reduce the diversity of organisms and favor enteric bacteria.

==Insecticide resistance==
[[Insecticide]]-based control measures (e.g. indoor spraying with insecticides, bed nets) are the principal ways to kill mosquitoes that bite indoors. However, after prolonged exposure to an insecticide over several [[generation]]s, mosquito populations, like those of other [[insect]]s, may evolve resistance, a capacity to survive contact with an insecticide. Since mosquitoes can have many generations per year, high levels of resistance can evolve very quickly. Resistance of mosquitoes to some insecticides has been documented with just within a few years after the insecticides were introduced. Over 125 mosquito [[species]] have documented resistance to one or more insecticides. The evolution of resistance to insecticides used for indoor residual spraying was a major impediment during the [[Global Malaria Eradication Campaign]]. Judicious use of insecticides for mosquito control can limit the evolution and spread of resistance. However, use of insecticides in agriculture has often been implicated as contributing to resistance in mosquito populations. Detection of evolving resistance in mosquito populations is possible, so control programs are well advised to conduct surveillance for this potential problem.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt;. In Malawi and other places, a shrub known as mpungabwi (''[[Ocimum americanum]]'') is used to repel mosquitoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dembo |first=Edson |date=November 2012 |url=https://malariaworld.org/sites/default/files/mwjournal/article/MWJ%202012_3_11_0.pdf |title=Community health workers' perceptions of barriers to utilisation of malaria interventions in Lilongwe, Malawi: A qualitative study |journal=MalariaWorld Journal |volume=3 |issue=11 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eradication==
With substantial numbers of malaria cases affecting people around the globe, in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions, especially in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], where millions of children are killed by this infectious disease, eradication is back on the global health agenda.&lt;ref name="Tanner"/&gt;

Although malaria has existed since old times, its eradication was possible in [[Europe]], [[North America]], the [[Caribbean]] and parts of [[Asia]] and southern Central America during the first regional elimination campaigns in the late 1940s. However, the same results were not achieved in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Tanner"/&gt;

Though the [[World Health Organization]] adopted a formal policy on the control and eradication of the malaria parasite since 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwru.edu/med/epidbio/mphp439/Malaria.htm |title=Malaria Eradication |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; only recently, after the Gates Malaria Forum in October 2007, did key organizations start the debate on the pros and cons of redefining eradication as a goal to control malaria. 
 
Clearly, the cost of preventing malaria is much less than treating the disease, in the long run. However, eradication of mosquitoes is not an easy task. For effective prevention of malaria, some conditions should be met, such as conducive conditions in the country, data collection about the disease, targeted technical approaches to the problem, very active and committed leadership,  total governmental support, sufficient monetary resources, community involvement, and skilled technicians from different fields, as well as an adequate implementation.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt;

A wide range of strategies is needed to achieve malaria eradication, starting from simple steps to complicated strategies which may not be possible to enforce with the current tools. 

Although mosquito control is an important component of malaria control strategy, elimination of malaria in an area does not require the elimination of all ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes. For instance, in North America and Europe, although the vector ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes are still present, the parasite has been eliminated. Some socioeconomic improvements (e.g., houses with screened windows, [[air conditioning]]), once combined with vector reduction efforts and effective treatment, lead to the elimination of malaria without the complete elimination of the vectors. Some important measures in mosquito control to be followed are: discourage egg-laying, prevent development of eggs into larvae and adults, kill the adult mosquitoes, do not allow adult mosquitoes into places of human dwelling, prevent mosquitoes from biting human beings and deny them blood meals.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;

Research in this sense continues, and a study has suggested sterile mosquitoes might be the answer to malaria elimination. This research suggests using the [[sterile insect technique]], in which sexually sterile male insects are released to wipe out a pest population, could be a solution to the problem of malaria in Africa. This technique brings hope, as female mosquitoes only mate once during their lifetimes, and in doing so with sterile male mosquitoes, the insect population would decrease.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; This is another option to be considered by local and international authorities that may be combined with other methods and tools to achieve malaria eradication in sub-Saharan Africa.

==Parasites==
A number of parasites of this genus are known to exist, including [[microsporidia]] of the genera ''[[Amblyospora]]'', ''[[Crepidulospora]]'', ''[[Senoma]]'' and ''[[Parathelohania]]''.&lt;ref name="Simakova2008"/&gt;

Microsporidia infecting the aquatic stages of insects, a group that includes mosquitoes and [[black fly|black flies]], and copepods appear to form a distinct clade from those infecting terrestrial insects and fish. Two distinct life cycles are found in this group.  In the first type, the parasite is transmitted by the oral route and is relatively species nonspecific. In the second, while again the oral route is the usual route of infection, the parasite is ingested within an already infected intermediate host. Infection of the insect larval form is frequently tissue-specific, and commonly involves the fat body. Vertical (transovarial) transmission is also known to occur.

Few phylogenetic studies of these parasites have been done, and their relationship to their mosquito hosts is still being determined. One study suggested ''Parathelohania'' is an early diverging genus within this group.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

The parasite ''[[Wolbachia]]'' bacteria have also been studied for use as control agents.&lt;ref name="Discovery Article"&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/animals/mosquito-parasite-disease-fighting.html Mosquito Parasite Fights Infectious Disease : Discovery News].

An '''auxiliary ego''', also known as simply an auxiliary, is the position taken by other participants in a [[role-playing]] exercise, or [[psychodrama]], in order to simulate particular situations for the [[protagonist]]s. As role-playing can include more than one protagonist, each may be operating in the role of auxiliary ego to each other as the exploration of each role changes with the entrance of new situations. The director of the role-play, often a [[teacher]] or counselor, can also be an auxiliary and typically is when clients are in the position of protagonist.

'''Cookie decorating''' dates back to at least the 14th century when in Switzerland, [[springerle]] cookie molds were carved from wood and used to impress Biblical designs into [[cookies]].&lt;ref name="Cookie History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm|title=History of Cookies|website= whatscookingamerica.net|publisher=What's Cooking America|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic element of cookie making also can be traced back to [[Medieval]] [[Germany]] where [[Lebkuchen]] was crafted into fancy shapes and decorated with sugar. The story of "Hansel and Gretel " published with [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] in 1812 inspired German gingerbread cookie Christmas cards.&lt;ref name="Learn-America"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learn-america.com/the-history-of-fruit-cake-and-other-christmas-goodies/|title=The History of Fruit Cake and other Christmas Goodies|first=Arlene|last=Wright-Correll|website=www.learn-america.com|publisher=Learn-America|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also during the 17th century, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and German settlers introduced [[cookie cutter]]s, decorative molds, and festive holiday cookie decorations to the United States.&lt;ref name="Christmas Food"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/christmasfood.html#cookies|title=Christmas Food History|first=Lynne|last=Olver|year=2002|website=www.foodtimeline.org|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today cookie decorating traditions continue in many places in the world and include such activities as cookie decorating parties, competitions, creating [[cookie bouquets]] and cookie gift baskets, and simply decorating cookies with children as a fun family activity.

Glaze, [[royal icing]] and [[Fondant icing|fondant]] are all popular choices for decorating cookies.

==History==

One of the earliest recorded forms of cookie decorating is the springerle, and the oldest known springerle mold is housed at the Swiss national museum in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Connie|publisher=House on the Hill|website=www.springerlecookies.com|title=Springerle Cookies|url=http://www.springerlecookies.com/|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This round-shaped mold was carved from wood in the 14th century and pictures the Easter Lamb.&lt;ref name="Cookie History"/&gt;

A springerle mold or press (carved rolling pins) is used to imprint a picture or design on to a cookie. These cookies have been the traditional Christmas cookies in [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]] for centuries. To add to the decorative effect, the designs may be colored with food coloring, or when used for decorative purposes only, with tempera or acrylic paints.&lt;ref name="Cookie History"/&gt;

Springerle cookies originally displayed biblical scenes and were used to teach the illiterate about the Bible. Eventually, the cookies were decorated with secular scenes depicting images of life events, such as marriages and births.&lt;ref name="Cookie History"/&gt;[[Image:Springerle ready baken.jpg|thumb|Springerle]]

Food historians also trace the artistic element of cookie making back to Medieval Germany where Lebkuchen (gingerbread) was crafted into fancy shapes and decorated with sugar. However, the Lebkuchen guilds only permitted professional gingerbread bakers to make this, with the exceptions of Christmas and Easter when anyone was free to make their own.&lt;ref name="Food Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html|title=Food Timeline: cookies, crackers &amp; biscuits|first=Lynne|last=Olver|year=2000|website=www.foodtimeline.org|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first gingerbread man may have been a Renaissance Man! This cookie is often credited by food historians to [[Queen Elizabeth I]], who during her reign (1558 to 1603) gifted VIP visitors to the court with gingerbread cookies decorated in their likenesses.

These gingerbread "portraits" were decorated with cloves dipped in gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://64.143.71.42/media/Gbread_facts.html|title=The Science of Gingerbread Fact Sheet|website=www.discoverycube.com|accessdate=22 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714112351/http://64.143.71.42/media/Gbread_facts.html|archivedate=14 July 2007|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, guild employed master bakers and artisans created intricate works of art with their gingerbread houses and cookies.&lt;ref name="Learn-America"/&gt; It was also during this period in Germany when cookies, in the form of Lebkuchen, were introduced as Christmas decorations.&lt;ref name="Food Timeline"/&gt;

In 1812, [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] was published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashliman|first=D.L.|title=Grimm Brothers' Home Page|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm.html|year=2013|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the tale of "Hansel and Gretel" inspired 19th century bakeries to add to their fanciful gingerbread entourage, decorated gingerbread cookie Christmas cards and finely detailed molded cookies. Tinsmiths rose to the call and crafted cookie cutters into all imaginable forms for bakeries and homemakers who relished having unique cookie cutters.&lt;ref name="Learn-America"/&gt;

Many a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Christmas tree was adorned with decorated cookies in the shapes of animals and gingerbread men.&lt;ref name="Learn-America"/&gt;

Also during the 17th century, Dutch and German settlers introduced cookie cutters, decorative molds, and festive holiday decorations to the United States. Gingerbread was likely the first U.S.-made Christmas cookie. Sugar cookies, one of the most widely decorated of cookies today, evolved from the English.&lt;ref name="Food Timeline"/&gt;

The German cookie cutters produced more stylized cookies, many with secular Christmas subjects, and for less cost, than the local American tinsmiths. When import laws opened the floodgates to low-cost, German-imported cooking utensils, including cookie cutters, between 1871 and 1906, the American tradition of decorating cookies for Christmas tree ornamentation took hold. In response to this cookie cutter boom, U.S. published cookbooks began featuring cookies in decorative shapes such as bells and Santa Clauses.&lt;ref name="The Christmas Cook"&gt;''The Christmas Cook: Three Centuries of American Yuletide Sweets'' Harper Perennial:New York, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Today cookie decorating traditions continue in many places in the world and include: decorating cookies for Christmas and other holidays, cookie decorating parties, decorating cookies for cookie bouquets and gift baskets, trimming the Christmas tree with decorated cookies, and decorating cookies with the children, to name a few.

Cookie decorating events can even be found at history and art museums. And they are frequently found at holiday events, community centers and classrooms. Decorated cookies also win ribbons at county and state fairs.

==Cookie cutters==

Many decorating techniques used today do not require elaborate cookie cutters. The simplest of shapes can be quite versatile in serving various themes. For example, a star-shaped cutter can be used for Christmas, 4 July, and messages of congratulations. A circle can be decorated as a sun, ball, flower, spider web, or smiley face.

But some occasions call for special [[cookie cutter]]s, even custom-made ones. For example, in honor of a 50th wedding anniversary, a photograph of the couple's first car could be sent to a company, and the cutter would be custom made to depict this. Then, the person making the cookies would decorate them to complete the depiction.

==Icing==

[[Royal icing]] is often used to decorate cookies because it dries hard. At the White House 2005 Christmas, Thaddeus DuBois, the White House Executive Pastry Chef at that time, decorated snowflake cookies with brushed and piped royal icing. In this case, as with many of the decorated cookies Dubois made for the president, his family and their guests, the traditional royal icing was used, a mixture of raw egg whites, powdered sugar, and a drop of lemon juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ask/20051209.html|title=Ask the White House|date=9 December 2005|first=Thaddeus|last=DuBois|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to health issues with raw egg consumption, such as [[salmonella]], an egg-free variation of royal icing is sometimes alternatively used by decorators. Meringue powder is used instead of the egg whites to create stiffness. Pasteurized refrigerated egg whites are sold at grocery stores for a safer traditional recipe.

A sugar [[Glaze (cooking technique)|glaze]] made without egg whites and consisting of powdered sugar, water, corn syrup and flavoring (such as almond) is another popular choice for decorating cookies.
To decorate a cookie with glaze, an outline is piped just inside the edge of the cookie. Then the design is filled by piping a line of glaze back and forth across the cookie, while staying within the boundaries of the outline.&lt;ref name="Cookie Decorating Made Easy: Volume 2"&gt;[http://www.CookiesMadeEasy.com ''Cookie Decorating Made Easy: Volume 2''], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The glaze must be applied quickly because royal icing crusts quickly, but it needs to be moist enough for the piped lines to melt into each, so that the design is smooth.
When the icing may crust faster than a design can be filled, the design can be blocked off first into smaller sections. To block off the design, cookie decorators pipe the outline of the cookie as usual, but then section it off in smaller sections, filling them in one at a time. Empty nooks and crannies that the decorating tip didn't pipe into can be filled by carefully dragging a toothpick through the icing into any empty spaces.&lt;ref name="Cookie Decorating Made Easy: Volume 2"&gt;[http://www.CookiesMadeEasy.com ''Cookie Decorating Made Easy: Volume 2''], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cookies can be decorated with more than one color of icing. This is accomplished by allowing the first color to dry completely (often for as long as 2 hours) before adding the second color of icing.&lt;ref name="Cookie Decorating Made Easy: Volume 2"/&gt;

While the goal is usually to keep the colors separated when filling in a design on a cookie with icing (such as the white of Santa's beard from the red of his suit), sometimes the colors or bled together on purpose to create a design such as a spider web design. First a white outline is piped and filled in with white. Then using the black icing, a spiral from the center to the outer edge is piped. The web is created by dragging a toothpick in a straight line from the center across the spiral to the outer edge. The more lines, the more intricate the web.
[[Cake decorating#Cake Decorating Terms|decorating bags]],one filled with white icing and another with black, and both fit with small round [[Cake decorating#Cake Decorating Terms|tips]].

==Fondant==

Fondant is another type of icing that is used to decorate cookies. Fondant can be colored by kneading the coloring into the dough. It can be rolled out, and then cut in shapes to match the cookies or their designs. Fondant can be purchased ready-made; however it is not favored for its taste. A homemade fondant that is often praised for its taste and function is marshmallow fondant, which is also used by [[Cake decorating|cake decorators]] for covering cakes.

When rolling fondant, a silicone mat or parchment will eliminate the need for dusting the rolling surface with powdered sugar, and this will make it easier to lift and transfer the cut pieces to the cookies.

The rolled out fondant may be cut into shapes with the same cookie cutters used to cut the cookies. Once cut out, the fondant is placed on top of the cookie. Some types of fondant will adhere right away to the cookie. If the fondant doesn't stick well, the cookie surface may be brushed with a little vanilla extract, corn syrup or piping gel to provide more sticking power.

Fondant covered cookies, just like plain or icing covered cookies, lend themselves well to embellishments such as silver dragees and other shiny decorations. Tweezers can be a great help in positioning the tiny ornaments.

==Decorating the fondant==

An impression mat can be used with fondant to add design and/or texture. First the fondant is rolled out and then the mat is placed face down on the fondant. Finally, by gently but firmly going over the mat with the rolling pin, the impression is made in the fondant. Then the shapes are cut out.

For example, to create a lace heart, a patch of white fondant is rolled out first on a silicone mat. Then an embossed fondant roller is slowly rolled across the surface of the fondant. A heart shaped cookie cutter is used to cut out the fondant hearts. The heart shaped fondant is then peeled off the silicone mat carefully so as not to mar the embossed design. Next, the fondant is trimmed and placed on top of the cookie. Finally the fondant-covered cookie may be brushed with a light dusting of pearl luster dust.

Many of the same decorations used by cake decorators are also used on cookies. Sprinkles, as dragees, colored sugars, beads, non-pareils and finely chopped nuts, as well as more expensive decorations like edible gold leaf, are used to decorate cookies.

==Edible silver and gold==

The [[Silver#Human exposure and consumption|silver]] and [[Gold#Toxicity|gold]] covered [[Dragée]]s and other silver and gold cake and cookie decorations sometimes used have not been [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved in the United States. Some of these have been approved for human consumption in other countries, such as Easy Leaf's edible gold and silver in Italy.{{fact|date=June 2015}}

Edible gold and silver have been used for centuries to garnish foods and drinks. The precious metals come in sprinkles, small flakes and leaves and are available at specialty stores and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fancyflours.com/site/edible-gold-leaves.html|title=Edible Gold and Silver Leaves, Flakes, and Sprinkles|website=www.fancyflours.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026153206/http://www.fancyflours.com/site/edible-gold-leaves.html|archivedate=26 October 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However this usage is controversial. According to ''The Washington Post'', a U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff expert said that edible gold and silver had not gone through pre-market safety evaluations at the FDA "because no one has sought pre-market approval."&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdn.com/lifestyles/article_e8c2dc35-518b-5e17-ab2b-db05950e7d97.html|title=Real gold garnish provides glittery wow — or waste|date=28 December 2005|publisher=Washington Post|website=tdn.com|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Washington Post'' article also reported the expert (who reportedly spoke only on the condition of anonymity) as saying he had not taken a position on edible metals, that they pass right through the body, and are "an expensive way to throw away gold."
Tobias Freccia, founder of an edible gold retail website, was also quoted in the article saying a "book of 500 gold leaves may cost $495, but a 100 mg shaker of the precious metals sells for $19.95."&lt;ref name="Washington Post"/&gt;

'''Daniel Little McFadden''' (born July 29, 1937) is an American [[econometrics|econometrician]] who shared the 2000 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] with [[James Heckman]]. McFadden's share of the prize was "for his development of theory and methods for analyzing [[Discrete Choice Modelling|discrete choice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2000 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2000/index.html |accessdate=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the Presidential Professor of Health Economics at the [[University of Southern California]] and Professor of the Graduate School at [[University of California, Berkeley]].

McFadden was born in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].  He attended the [[University of Minnesota]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Physics]], and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Behavioral Science (Economics) five years later (1962).  While at the University of Minnesota, his graduate advisor was [[Leonid Hurwicz]], who was awarded the Economics Nobel Prize in 2007.&lt;ref name = laureates&gt;{{cite web  |title=All Laureates in Economics |  publisher = Nobelprize.org   |year=2007  |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/index.html |accessdate=2007-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 McFadden joined the faculty of UC Berkeley, focusing his research on choice behavior and the problem of linking economic theory and measurement.  In 1974 he introduced [[Conditional logit analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elsa.berkeley.edu/reprints/mcfadden/zarembka.pdf ''Conditional Logic Analysis of Qualitative Choice Behavior'']&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1975 McFadden won the [[John Bates Clark Medal]]. In 1977 he moved to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  In 1981 he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. He returned to Berkeley in 1991, founding the Econometrics Laboratory, which is devoted to statistical computation for economics applications.  He remains its director. He is a trustee of the [[Economists for Peace and Security]]. In 2000 he won the [[Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics]].

In January 2011 McFadden was appointed the Presidential Professor of Health Economics at the [[University of Southern California]] (USC), and the announcement of this appointment was published on January 10, 2011. McFadden will have joint appointments at the [[USC Price School of Public Policy]] and the Department of Economics at the [[USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences]] to examine fundamental problems facing the health care sector, looking specifically at how consumers make choices about health insurance and medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nobel Winner, Dr. McFadden, Appointed Presidential Professor at USC |publisher=usc.edu |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/university/nobel_winner_appointed_presidential_professor.html |accessdate=2011-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115034932/http://uscnews.usc.edu/university/nobel_winner_appointed_presidential_professor.html |archivedate=2011-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''deCODE genetics, Inc.''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: '''''Íslensk erfðagreining''''') is a biopharmaceutical company based in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]]. The company was founded in 1996 by [[Kári Stefánsson]]&lt;ref&gt;Herper, Matthew (6 March 2001) [https://www.forbes.com/2001/03/06/0306schizo.html DeCode-ing Schizophrenia] Forbes, Retrieved 28 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; to identify human genes associated with common diseases using population studies, and apply the knowledge gained to guide the development of candidate drugs. The company isolated genes believed to be involved in cardiovascular disease, [[cancer]] and [[schizophrenia]], among other diseases (the company's research concerning the latter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stefansson H, Sarginson J, Kong A |title=Association of neuregulin 1 with schizophrenia confirmed in a Scottish population |journal=Am.

deCODE's approach to identifying genes, and in particular its proposal to set up an Icelandic Health Sector Database (HSD) containing the medical records of all Icelanders, was controversial, and prompted national and international criticism for its approach to the concepts of [[privacy]] and [[consent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Genome and Nation: Iceland's Health Sector Database and its Legacy | author=David E.

The company was removed from the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lee| first = Wayne| title =Semi-Annual Changes to the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index | work = Press Release | publisher = NASDAQ Newsroom | date = 2008-11-14 | url = http://www.nasdaq.com/newsroom/news/newsroomnewsStory.aspx?textpath=pr2008\ACQPMZ200811142002PRIMZONEFULLFEED154749.htm&amp;cdtime=11%2f14%2f2008%20+8%3a02PM&amp;title=Semi-Annual%20Changes%20to%20the%20NASDAQ%20Biotechnology%20Index| accessdate = 19 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2009 the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in a US court, listing total assets of $69.9&amp;nbsp;million and debt of $313.9&amp;nbsp;million. According to American law, deCODE was allowed to continue its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=deCODE Genetics declare bankruptcy, will sell core business to US investors| publisher=scienceblogs.com| url=http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/11/decode_genetics_finally_goes_u.php| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515111234/http://scienceblogs.com/geneticfuture/2009/11/decode_genetics_finally_goes_u.php| archivedate=2012-05-15| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010  most of deCODE genetics Inc.’s assets were purchased by Saga Investments LLC – an investment company whose owners include [[Polaris Venture Partners]] and [[ARCH Venture Partners]] - who said they intended to continue most services including deCODE diagnostics and deCODEme™ personal genome scans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decode.com/news/news.php?story=112 |title=Announcing the new deCODE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117064033/http://www.decode.com/news/news.php?story=112 |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and management team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decode.com/company/management.php |title=deCODE Management team |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001054058/http://www.decode.com/company/management.php |archivedate=2012-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, deCODE genetics was purchased by [[Amgen]] for $415&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newswire|first=PR|title=Amgen to Acquire deCODE Genetics, a Global Leader in Human Genetics|url=http://www.amgen.com/media/media_pr_detail.jsp?releaseID=1765710|work=amgen.com|publisher=Amgen|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in October 2013 spun off deCODE genetics' systems and database to a new company called NextCODE Health&lt;ref&gt;Proffit, Allison (24 October 2013) [http://www.bio-itworld.com/els/2013/10/24/nextcode-health-launches-decode-platform.html NextCODE Health Launches deCODE's Clinical Genomics Platform] Bio IT World, Retrieved 28 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  which in turn was acquired in January 2015 by the Chinese company [[WuXi PharmaTech]] for $65&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;(9 January 2015) [http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wuxi-pharmatech-acquires-nextcode-health-to-create-global-leader-in-genomic-medicine-300018311.html WuXi PharmaTech Acquires NextCODE Health to Create Global Leader in Genomic Medicine] PR Newswire, Retrieved 28 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DeCODE was founded in 1996&lt;ref&gt;http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=129032&amp;pageId=1866979&amp;lang=is&amp;q=erf%F0agreining&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ernir Kristján Snorrason]], [[Kári Stefánsson]], and [[Kristleifur Kristjánsson]].&lt;ref&gt;'Andlát: Dr. Ernir K. Snorrason', ''Morgunblaðið'' (30.4.2012), http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2012/04/30/andlat_dr_ernir_k_snorrason/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s deCODE proposed to create the world's first population-wide genomic biobank by collecting data from the entire population of Iceland, which numbered 270,000 at the time.&lt;ref name="underpinnings"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Greely | first1 = H. T. | title = The Uneasy Ethical and Legal Underpinnings of Large-Scale Genomic Biobanks | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 8 | pages = 343–364 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17550341 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115721}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan had these three major components: creating a [[Genealogy|genealogical]] database, collecting [[biobank specimens]] by means of which [[genotype|genotyping]] could be done, and creating a national electronic health record system to connect genetic data to each individual's [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name="underpinnings"/&gt;

In December 1998 with lobbying from deCODE, the [[Icelandic Parliament]] passed the [[Act on Health Sector Database]] which permitted public bidding for the right of a company to create this health database and use it for various purposes.&lt;ref name="underpinnings"/&gt; The parliament shortly thereafter granted deCODE the right to create this database after the company made a successful bid to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chadwick | first1 = R. | title = The Icelandic database—do modern times need modern sagas? | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7207 | pages = 441–444 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10445931 | pmc = 1127047 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7207.441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==deCODEme==
As a step toward the [[personal genomics|personal genome]], the company has announced that its deCODEme service is available for $985 to anyone who wishes to send a [[cheek]] [[Cotton swab|swab]] to learn details about disease risk and ancestry. This service was launched in November 2007 and thereby became the first web-based service to offer a comprehensive genome scan and an online analysis of an individual's [[DNA]]. More than one million [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s are included in the scan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snpedia.com/index.php?title=DeCODEme |title=deCODEme}}&lt;/ref&gt; deCODEme claims  that the DNA profile it provides can supply its customers with a basis from which they are able calculate the relative risk of developing these diseases and thereby enable them to make better informed decisions about [[Preventive medicine|medical prevention]] and treatment. The deCODEme service currently includes information on the genetic susceptibility to close to 45 common diseases such as [[myocardial infarction]], [[atrial fibrillation]], several types of cancers and [[type-2 diabetes]] as well as providing insights into distant [[Genealogy|ancestry]] and geographical origins.

The deCODEme service was discontinued in January 2013 and deCODE genetics stopped selling personal genetic tests altogether.&lt;ref&gt;decodeme.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in popular culture==

The work of deCODE is criticised by Arnaldur Indriðason's novel ''[[Jar City]]'' from 2000, which was adapted as a [[Jar City (film)|film]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Lucy, 'Genetics and the Scene of the Crime: DeCODING ''Tainted Blood''&lt;nowiki/&gt;', ''Journal of Literary &amp; Cultural Disability Studies'', 6 (2012), 193–208. doi:10.3828/jlcds.2012.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

deCODE and Kári Stefánsson are satirised as VikingDNA and Professor Lárus Jóhannsson in ''[[Dauðans óvissi tími]]'' by [[Þráinn Bertelsson]] (Reykjavík: JPV Útgáfu, 2004).

deCODE and specifically Kári Stefánsson is presented as the creator of monstrous genetic hybrids in [[Óttar M. Norðfjörð|Óttar M. Norðfjörð's]] satirical 2007 work ''Jón Ásgeir &amp; afmælisveislan ''([Reykjavík]: Sögur, 2007), and the history of DeCODE appears both directly and in allegorised form (under the fictional name OriGenes) in the same author's ''[[Lygarinn: Sönn saga]]'' (Reykjavík: Sögur, 2011). deCODE is the model for the company CoDex, in ''[[CoDex 1962]]'' by [[Sjón]].&lt;ref&gt;Reykjavík: JPV, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einar Kári Jóhannsson, '[https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/30273/1/%C3%9Ej%C3%B3%C3%B0sagaSj%C3%B3ns.Einar.K%C3%A1ri..pdf Þjóð(ar)saga Sjóns: Pólitísk ummyndun á sameiginlegum minningum Íslendinga í sögulegum skáldverkum Sjóns]' (unpublished MA thesis, University of Iceland, 2018), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a man can reach orgasm within a few minutes of active thrusting during [[sexual intercourse]], whereas a man with delayed ejaculation either does not have orgasms at all or cannot have an orgasm until after prolonged intercourse which might last for 30–45 minutes or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Knowles |first=David R. |encyclopedia=A.D.A.M.

It is the least common of the male sexual dysfunctions, and can result as a side effect of some medications. In one survey, 8% of men reported being unable to achieve orgasm over a 2-month period or longer in the previous year.&lt;ref name = Oxford2009&gt;Strassberg, D. S., &amp; Perelman, M. A. (2009).

==Signs and symptoms==
Delayed ejaculation can be ''mild'' (men who still experience orgasm during intercourse, but only under certain conditions), ''moderate'' (cannot ejaculate during intercourse, but can during [[fellatio]] or manual stimulation), ''severe'' (can ejaculate only when alone), or ''most severe'' (cannot ejaculate at all).&lt;ref name = Oxford2009/&gt; All forms may result in a sense of [[sexual frustration]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatzimouratidis, Konstantinos, et al.

==Causes==
Medical conditions that can cause delayed ejaculation include [[hypogonadism]], [[thyroid]] disorders, [[pituitary]] disorders such as [[Cushing's disease]], [[prostate]] surgery outcome, and drug and alcohol use.&lt;ref name=Oxford2009/&gt; Difficulty in achieving orgasm can also result from [[pelvic]] [[surgery]] that involved [[Physical trauma|trauma]] to pelvic nerves responsible for orgasm. Some men report a lack of sensation in the nerves of the glans penis, which may or may not be related to external factors, including a history of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;Dias J, Freitas R, Amorim R, Espiridião P, Xambre L, Ferraz L, Adult circumcision and male sexual health: a retrospective analysis, Andrologia, 20 April 2013 {{DOI|10.1111/and.12101}} [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/and.12101/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Delayed ejaculation is a possible [[adverse effect|side effect]] of certain [[medications]], including [[SSRI|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[opiates]] such as [[morphine]], [[methadone]], or [[oxycodone]], many [[benzodiazepines]] such as Valium, certain antipsychotics, and [[antihypertensives]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drugs.com/enc/delayed-ejaculation.html drugs.com &gt; Delayed ejaculation] Review Date: 6/5/2007.

 | doi = 10.1080/00926239808414667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Sank (1998) wrote about the "Traumatic masturbatory syndrome", when the sensations a man feels when masturbating may bear little resemblance to the sensations he experiences during intercourse. Factors such as pressure, angle and [[death-grip|grip]] during masturbation can make for an experience so different from sex with a partner that the ability to ejaculate is reduced or eliminated.

On the same note, it may be the visual factor present in masturbation that may delay vaginal ejaculation. As the sensation during masturbation is intrinsically linked with the visual input of a sexual model, be it male or female, the diminished view during sex may result in the loss of that link, and as such, delay ejaculation in the man. A possible cure for this may be a better view of the partner during intercourse. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Treatment==

===Sex therapy===
Therapy usually involves homework assignments and exercises intended to help a man get used to having orgasms through [[insertional intercourse]], vaginal, anal, or oral, that is through the way to which he is not accustomed.

Sometimes, this is not an easy matter as a man may be used to having orgasms alone. After a man learns to ejaculate in the presence of his partner, the man's hand is replaced with the hand of his partner. In the final stage, the receptive partner inserts the [[insertive partner]]'s [[penis]] into the partner's vagina, anus, or mouth as soon as the ejaculation is felt to be imminent. Thus, a man gradually learns to ejaculate inside the desired orifice by an incremental process.&lt;ref name=Oxford2009/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1035">'''Enamel infractions''' are microcracks seen within the [[dental enamel]] of a [[tooth]]. They are commonly the result of [[dental trauma]] to the brittle enamel, which remains adherent to the underlying [[dentine]]. They can be seen more clearly when [[transillumination]] is used. 

Enamel infractions are found more often in older teeth, as the accumulated trauma is greatest. 
Enamel infractions can also be found as a result of [[iatrogenic]] damage inadvertently caused by instrumentation during dental treatments.

==Treatment==
Minor infraction may not require any treatment, however major infraction may require treatment including smoothing, fluoride treatment and crown restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dentaltraumaguide.org/free-dental-guides/permanent-teeth/infraction|title=Infraction – Dental Trauma Guide|website=dentaltraumaguide.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''George Frederick Dick''' (July 21, 1881 – October 10, 1967) was an American [[physician]] and [[bacteriologist]] best known for his work with [[scarlet fever]].

Dick studied [[scarlet fever]] whilst serving the [[Army Medical Department (United States)|Army Medical Corps]] during [[World War I]].  Dick continued with his research into scarlet fever following the war, and in 1923, in collaboration with his wife [[Gladys Rowena Dick]], managed to locate the cause of the disease in a [[toxin]] produced by a strain of [[Streptococcus]] [[bacteria]].  Using this, they were able to create an [[antitoxin]] for treatment and a non-toxic vaccine for immunization.

He was a professor of clinical medicine at [[Rush Medical College]], [[Chicago]] (1918–33), and then became the head of the department of medicine at the [[University of Chicago]] (1933–45).

GHIs classify a type of global initiative, which is defined as an organized effort integrating the involvement of organizations, individuals, and stakeholders around the world to address a global issue (i.e.: climate change, human rights, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shiffman|first=Jeremy|last2=Smith|first2=Stephanie|date=2007-10-13|title=Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673607615797|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9595|pages=1370–1379|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7|issn=0140-6736|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of GHIs are the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR), the [[Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] (Global Fund), and the [[World Bank]]'s [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/EXTAFRHEANUTPOP/EXTAFRREGTOPHIVAIDS/0,,contentMDK:20415735~menuPK:1001234~pagePK:34004173~piPK:34003707~theSitePK:717148,00.html Multi-country AIDS Programme] (MAP), all of which focus on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].  The [[Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance|Gavi]] (formerly the GAVI Alliance) focuses on immunization, particularly with respect to child survival.

==GHI Functions==
In terms of their institutional structure, GHIs have little in common with each other. In terms of their function – specifically their ability to raise and disburse funds, provide resources and coordinate and/or implement disease control in multiple countries – GHIs share some common ground, even if the mechanisms through which each of these functions is performed are different.&lt;ref&gt;Biesma R., Brugha R., Harmer A., Walsh A., Spicer N. and Walt G.

== Political Economy of GHIs ==
{{Cleanup section|reason=Check for original research, needs more sourcing, general cleanup|date=June 2018}}

The amount of political priority given to Global Health Initiatives varies between national and international governing powers. Though evidence shows that there exists an inequity between resource allocation for initiatives concerning issues such as child immunization, HIV/AIDS, and family planning in comparison to initiatives for high-burden disorders such as malnutrition and pneumonia, the source of this variance is unknown due to lack of systematic research pertaining to this subject. Global political priority is defined as the extent to which national and international political leaders address an issue of international concern through support in the forms of human capital, technology, and/or finances in order to aid efforts to resolve the problem. Global political priority is demonstrated through national and international leaders expressing sustained concern both privately and publicly, political systems and organizations enacting policies to help alleviate the issue, and national and international agencies providing resource levels that reflect the severity of the given crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The amount of attention a given global initiative receives is considerably dependent on the power and authority of actors connected to the issue, the power and impact of ideas defining and describing the issue, the power of political contexts framing the environments in which the actors operate to address the issue, as well as the weight and power of issue characteristics indicating the severity of the issue (i.e.: statistical indicators, severity metrics, efficacy of proposed interventions, etc.). Factors including objective measurability, scalability of the issue and proposed interventions, ability to track and monitor progress, risk of perceived harm, as well as simplicity and affordability of proposed solutions all contribute to the degree to which a given global initiative is likely to receive political attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, case studies have shown that the likelihood of global initiatives garnering public and political attention is not limited to the aforementioned factors. For example, initiatives concerning polio eradication continue to receive substantial resources in spite of the relatively small global burden of disease as compared to chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and some communicable diseases such as pneumonia which comparatively attract fewer worldwide resources irrespective of the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with such diseases. These cases highlight the need for extensive research methods and evaluative measures to assess the relative causal weights of factors used to determine how global political priority is attributed to global health initiatives. Existing debates also attribute factors such as the increasing influences of economic globalization, international organizations, and economic actors with little to no previous health remit as each contributing to the evolution of global health governance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230249486_1|title=Global Health Governance|last=Kay|first=Adrian|last2=Williams|first2=Owain|date=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|isbn=9781349302284|series=International Political Economy Series|pages=1–23|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780230249486_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of GHIs on Country Health Systems==
There is much discussion about the extent to which the volume of these additional funds creates multiple effects that positively and/or negatively impact both health systems and health outcomes for specific diseases. Assessing the direct impact of GHIs on specific diseases and health systems poses challenges pertaining to the issue of attributing particular effects to individual GHIs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As such, a common response in evaluations of GHIs is to acknowledge the inherent limitations of establishing causal chains in what is a highly complex public health environment, and to base conclusions on adequacy statements resulting from trends that demonstrate substantial growth in process and impact indicators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, existing literature argues that this approach towards evaluating GHIs can inadvertently result in overlooking the impact of social determinants on a disease, as implementers and evaluators are less likely to tackle the complexity of a disease within the larger social, political, cultural, and environmental system. Even if a GHI is effectively evaluated– perhaps showing a decrease in disease prevalence– the challenge remains of comprehensively analyzing the long-term impacts of the GHI by addressing the root social, political, or environmental causes of the disease. Accordingly, existing debates suggest that GHIs should be less concerned with the eradication of specific diseases, and should instead focus primarily on factors– such as basic living conditions, sanitation, and access to nutritious food– that are essential to delivering a sustainable heath program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Paul E.|last2=Nizeye|first2=Bruce|last3=Stulac|first3=Sara|last4=Keshavjee|first4=Salmaan|date=October 2006|title=Structural violence and clinical medicine |journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |pmc=1621099|pmid=17076568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on the effects of GHIs==
A small number of institutions have shaped, and continue to shape, research on GHIs.  In 2003, researchers at [http://www.abtassociates.com/ Abt Associates] devised an influential framework for understanding the system-wide effects of the Global fund which has informed much subsequent research, including their own studies of system-wide effects of the Global Fund in Benin, Ethiopia, Georgia and Malawi - often referred to as the 'SWEF' studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalfund.org/documents/library/studies/evaluation_framework/EF1_full.pdf Bennett S. and Fairbank A, The system-wide effects of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria: A conceptual framework, Oct 2003, Partners for Health Reform''plus'' and Abt Associates Inc.] Document summaries and links to each of the SWEF studies are accessible through the [http://ghinet.org/database.asp Global health Initiatives Network database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abt continues to support ongoing research on the effects of GHIs in multiple countries. The Washington-based [[Center for Global Development]] has also been very active in its analysis of GHIs, particularly PEPFAR financing. The Center's [http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/hivmonitor HIV/AIDS Monitor] is essential reading for researchers of GHIs. With hubs in London and Dublin, the [http://ghinet.org/index.asp Global Health Initiatives Network] (GHIN) has been coordinating and supporting research in 22 countries on the effects of GHIs on existing health systems.

Knowledge of the effects of GHIs on specific diseases and on health systems comes from multiple sources.[[Longitudinal studies]] enable researchers to establish baseline data and then track and compare GHI effects on disease control or country health systems over time. In addition to Abt Associates' SWEF studies, additional early examples of this type of analysis were three-year, multi-country studies of the Global Fund in Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=59 Brugha et al (2005) Global Fund Tracking Study: A Cross-country Comparative Analysis, LSHTM, London]. PDFs of each country study is accessible through the [http://ghinet.org/database.asp GHIN database]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, research findings were published from tracking studies in [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_europe_kyrgyzstan.asp Kyrgyzstan], [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_americas_peru.asp Peru] and [http://ghinet.org/countrystudies_europe_ukraine.asp Ukraine] that sought to identify the health effects of the Global Fund at national and sub-national levels.

In contrast to longitudinal studies, multi-country analyses of GHIs can provide a ‘snapshot’ of GHI effects but are often constrained by “aggressive timelines”.&lt;ref&gt;Interactions between Global Health Initiatives and Health Systems: Evidence from Countries. The Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium, June 2009, p6.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.who.int/healthsystems/GHIsynergies/en/index.html Maximising Positive Synergies Academic Consortium], for example, reported in 2009 on the effects of the Global Fund and PEPFAR on disease control and health systems, drawing on data from 20 countries.&lt;ref&gt;World health Organisation Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group, An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. Lancet 2009, 373:2137-69&lt;/ref&gt; Most GHI evaluations – both internally and externally commissioned – rely on this type of short-term analysis and, inevitably, there is often a trade-off between depth and breadth of reporting.

Synthesis of data from multiple sources is an invaluable resource for making sense of the effects of GHIs. Early synthesis studies include a 2004 synthesis of findings on the effects of the Global Fund in four countries&lt;ref&gt;Brugha et al (2004) The Global Fund: Managing Great Expectations, Lancet, 364:95-100&lt;/ref&gt; by researchers at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] (LSHTM), a 2005 study by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;Global health Partnerships: Assessing Country Consequences, 2005, McKinsey and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; and an assessment of the comparative advantages of the Global Fund and World Bank AIDS programs.&lt;ref&gt;Shakow A. Global Fund and world Bank HIV/AIDS Program: Comparative Advantage Study, 2006, Global Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

Two wide-ranging studies were published in 2009: a study of interactions between GHIs and country health systems commissioned by the World Health Organisation&lt;ref&gt;WHO Maximising Positive Synergies Collaborative Group. An assessment of interactions between global health initiatives and country health systems. The Lancet 373, June 20th pp2137-2169&lt;/ref&gt; and a study by researchers from LSHTM and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. The latter study - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=117 The effects of global health initiatives on country health systems: a review of the evidence from HIV/AIDS control] – reviewed the literature on the effects of the Global fund, the World Bank MAP and PEPFAR on country health systems with respect to: 1) national policy; 2) coordination and planning; 3) stakeholder involvement; 4) disbursement, absorptive capacity and management; 5) [[monitoring &amp; evaluation]]; and 6) human resources (Table 2).

==Evaluations of GHIs==
In a comparison between the three largest donors in sponsoring efforts to win the fight against AIDS in Africa, a research study found that PEPFAR performs best in money transfer and data collection; the Global Fund outperforms in tailoring programmatic initiatives and sharing data; and MAP performs highest in collaborating with government systems, strengthening health systems, and helping to build the capacity of local recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Oomman, Nandini, et al. ''Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia''. Center for Global Development, HIV/AIDS Monitor, 2007, p. xvii, ''Following the Funding for HIV/AIDS: a Comparative Analysis of the Funding Practices of PEPFAR, the Global Fund and World Bank MAP in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia'', www.popline.org/node/199919.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the four GHIs summarized has been evaluated at least once since 2005 and all four produce their own annual reports.

===World Bank MAP===
The primary purpose of the MAP initiative was to introduce a major upscaling of multi-sectoral approach to responding to the HIV/AIDS crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa by involving a multitude of stakeholders including community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), line ministries, and state governments at the highest levels.&lt;ref name="Sophie Harman 2007, pp. 485-492"/&gt;

[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=46 A comprehensive study of MAP programs] published in 2007 reviewed whether MAP was implemented as designed, but did not evaluate MAP or assess its impact. In addition, there have been two evaluations that provide important additional insight into the effectiveness of the Bank's HIV/AIDS programmes (though not specifically MAP focused). In 2005, the Bank conducted an internal evaluation - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=51 Committing to Results: Improving the Effectiveness of HIV/AIDS Assistance] - which found that National AIDS strategies were not always prioritised or costed.

Supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), were weak; civil society had not been engaged; political commitment and capacity had been overestimated, and mechanisms for political mobilisation were weak; and bank research and analysis, whilst perceived to be useful, was not reaching policy makers in Africa.  In 2009, a hard-hitting evaluation of the Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population support – [http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTOED/EXTWBASSHEANUTPOP/0,,contentMDK:22153992~menuPK:6080533~pagePK:64829573~piPK:64829550~theSitePK:4422776~isCURL:Y,00.html Improving Effectiveness of Outcomes for the Poor in Health, Nutrition and Population] – found that a third of the Bank’s HNP lending had not performed well, and that while the performance of the Bank’s [[International Finance Corporation]] investments had improved, accountability was weak.

===Global Fund===
Unlike many implementing agencies, the Global Fund has no presence in the countries it supports; rather it is a financial mechanism which provides funding to countries in the form of grants through a Secretariat in Geneva on the competitive basis of country proposals. Special emphasis is placed on proposals demonstrating country ownership as well as those that meet other evidence-based, performance-based, and inclusivity-based criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707263866|title=Handbook of transnational governance : institutions and innovations|date=2011|publisher=Polity|others=Hale, Thomas (Thomas Nathan), Held, David.|isbn=9780745650609|location=Cambridge|oclc=707263866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year, comprehensive evaluation of the Global Fund published a synthesis report in 2009 of findings from three Study areas. The Fund’s Technical Evaluation Research Group (TERG) [http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/terg/evaluations/5year/ Five Year Evaluation] (5YE) of the Global Fund drew on data from 24 countries to evaluate the Fund’s [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=131 organisational effectiveness and efficiency], partnership environment and [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=119 impact on AIDS, TB and Malaria]. The Evaluation highlighted the possible decline in HIV incidence rate in some countries, and rapid scale up of funding for HIV/AIDS, access and coverage, but also identified major gaps in support for national health information systems, and poor drug availability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Macro International Inc. 2009, The Impact of Collective Efforts on the Reduction of Disease Burden, Global Fund FiveYear Evaluation: Study Area 3, Submitted to the Global Fund, Macro International Inc., Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;

===GAVI Alliance===
Though GHIs have been instrumental in bringing national and international attention to crucial global health issues, existing debates suggest that they can also negatively impact country health systems. As such, disease-specific GHIs such as GAVI have worked to integrate health system strengthening (HSS) measures into programmatic implementation. However, the existing global debate questions the efficacy of HSS programs aimed at targeting technical solutions with clear measurable outcomes versus those more broadly focused on supporting holistic health systems.&lt;ref&gt;Katerini T. Storeng (2014) The GAVI Alliance and the ‘Gates approach’ to health system strengthening, Global Public Health, 9:8, 865-879, DOI: 10.1080/17441692.2014.940362&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an evaluation of GAVI’s vaccine and immunization support - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=124 Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 performance] - reported increased coverage of HepB3, Hib3 and DTP3 and increased coverage in rural areas but also a lack of cost data disaggregated by vaccine that prevented GAVI from accurately evaluating the cost effectiveness of its programs and vaccines, and an “unrealistic” reliance by GAVI on the market to reduce the cost of vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;Chee G., Molldrem V., Hsi N. and Chankova S. (2008) Evaluation of the GAVI Phase 1 Performance. Abt Associates Inc. p15&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, a study of the financial sustainability of GAVI vaccine support - [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=122 Introducing New Vaccines in the Poorest Countries: What did we learn from the GAVI Experience with] - found that although GAVI funding equated to $5 per infant in developing countries per year for the period 2005-10, resource need was accelerating faster than growth in financing.

Findings from two evaluations of GAVI’s support for [[health systems strengthening]] (HSS) were published in 2009. An external evaluation by [http://www.hlsp.org/ HLSP]&lt;ref&gt;[http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=142 GAVI Health Systems Strengthening Support Evaluation: Key Findings and Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt; found insufficient technical support provided to countries applying for GAVI grants, an under-performing Independent Review Committee (IRC), and weaknesses in GAVI’s monitoring of grant activities. The study also found that countries were using GAVI grants for ‘downstream’ short-term HSS fixes rather than ‘upstream’ and long-term structural reform.
A study by [[John Snow, Inc]] praised the multi-year, flexible and country-driven characteristics of GAVI HSS grant funding and encouraged GAVI to continue this support. But also found weak M&amp;E of grant activity, low Civil Society involvement in the HSS proposal development process, unclear proposal writing guidelines, and over-reliance by countries on established development partners for assistance in implementing health system reform.&lt;ref&gt;Plowman B. and Abramson W. (2009) Final Synthesis Report - Health Systems Strengthening Tracking Study GAVI RFP00308. JSI Research and Training Institute, Inc. and In-Develop IPM.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PEPFAR===
A quantitative study by Stanford University in 2009 – [http://ghinet.org/summary.asp?Study_StudyID=115 The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Africa: An Evaluation of Outcomes] – calculated a 10.5% reduction in the death rate in PEPFAR’s 12 focus countries, equating to 1.2 million lives saved at a cost of $2450 per death averted. In 2007, an evaluation of PEPFAR by the [[Institute of Medicine]] found that PEPFAR had made significant progress in reaching its targets for prevention, treatment and care but also reported that budget allocations "limit the Country Teams ability to harmonize PEPFARs activities with those of the partner government and other donors", and PEPFARs ABC (Abstinence, Be faithful, and correct and consistent Condom use) priorities "fragment the natural continuum of needs and services, often in ways that do not correspond with global standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medicine|first=Institute of|date=2007-09-17|title=PEPFAR Implementation|url=https://doi.org/10.17226/11905|language=en|doi=10.17226/11905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PEPFAR program has brought about substantial impact in its recipient countries. The level of urgency and scale of initiatives led through the PEPFAR program were commensurate with that of the HIV/AIDS epidemic at the time of implementation. Existing debates suggest that the next phase of the program consider placing emphasis on the development of knowledge surrounding HIV/AIDS programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Padian, Nancy|last2=B|first2=Holmes, Charles|last3=I|first3=McCoy, Sandra|last4=Rob|first4=Lyerla,|last5=D|first5=Bouey, Paul|last6=P|first6=Goosby, Eric|title=Implementation Science for the US Presidentʼs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)|url=https://www.academia.edu/33942595/Implementation_Science_for_the_US_President%CA%BCs_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief_PEPFAR_|journal=JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|language=en|volume=56|issue=3|issn=1525-4135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''French health care system''' is one of [[universal health care]] largely financed by government [[national health insurance]].  In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the "close to best overall health care" in the world.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/media_centre/press_release/en/ |title=World Health Organization Assesses the World's Health Systems |publisher=Who.int |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, France spent 11.6% of [[GDP]] on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,&lt;ref name="WHO country facts: France"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/countries/fra/en/ |title=WHO country facts: France |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but [[Health care compared#International comparisons|less than in the US]]. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.

Most general physicians are in private practice but draw their income from the public insurance funds.  These funds, unlike their German counterparts,  have never gained self-management responsibility. Instead, the government has taken responsibility for the financial and operational management of health insurance (by setting premium levels related to income and determining the prices of goods and services refunded).&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; The French government generally refunds patients 70% of most [[health care costs]], and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them nonprofit, [[mutual insurer]]s. Until 2000, coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers or retirees), excluding some poor segments of the population; the government of [[Lionel Jospin]] put into place [[Couverture maladie universelle|universal health coverage]] and extended the coverage to all those legally resident in France.  Only about 3.7% of hospital treatment costs are reimbursed through private insurance, but a much higher share of the cost of spectacles and prostheses (21.9%), drugs (18.6%) and dental care (35.9%) (figures from the year 2000). There are public hospitals, non-profit independent hospitals (which are linked to the public system), as well as private for-profit hospitals. 

==History==
[[French Third Republic|France 1871–1914]] followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252–75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats &amp; Public Health in France, 1888–1902'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal &amp; Infant Health Policy in the United States &amp; France, 1890–1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there was a long battle over a public health law which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902." ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 54.1 (1980): 4+&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1945===
[[File:First-World-Infant-Mortality-Trends.jpg|475px|right|thumb|The reduction in [[infant mortality]] between 1960 and 2008 for France in comparison with Ireland, Switzerland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States.]]

The current system has undergone several changes since its foundation in 1945, though the basis of the system remains state planned and operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/9994.php |title=Medical News Today |publisher=Medical News Today |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean de Kervasdoué]], a health economist, believes that French medicine is of great quality and is "the only credible alternative to the Americanization of world medicine."  According to Kervasdoué, France's surgeons, clinicians, psychiatrists, and its emergency care system (SAMU) are an example for the world.  However, despite this, Kervasdoué criticizes the fact that hospitals must comply with 43 bodies of regulation and the nit-picking bureaucracy that can be found in the system.  Kervasdoué believes that the state intervenes too much in regulating the daily functions of French hospitals.

Furthermore, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands have health care systems with comparable performance to that of France's, yet spend no more than 8% of their GDP (against France's spending of more than 10% of its GDP).

According to various experts,{{who|date=February 2014}} the battered state of the French social security system's finances is causing the growth of France's health care expenses.  To control expenses, these experts{{who|date=February 2014}} recommend a reorganization of access to health care providers, revisions to pertinent laws, a repossession by CNAMTS{{clarify|date=September 2013}} of the continued development of medicines, and the democratization of budgetary arbitration to counter pressure from the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

==Health care system==
[[File:Total health expenditure per capita, US Dollars PPP.png|thumb|right|350px|Total health spending per capita, in U.S. dollars [[Purchasing power parity|PPP-adjusted]], of France compared amongst various other first world nations.]]

The entire population must pay compulsory health insurance. The insurers are non-profit agencies that annually participate in negotiations with the state regarding the overall funding of health care in France. There are three main funds, the largest of which covers 84% of the population and the other two a further 12%. A premium is deducted from all employees' pay automatically. The 2001 Social Security Funding Act, set the rates for health insurance covering the statutory health care plan at 5.25% on earned income, capital and winnings from gambling and at 3.95% on benefits (pensions and allowances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e83126.pdf |title=France-prel.indd |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After paying the doctor's or dentist's fee, a proportion is reimbursed.  This is around 75 to 80%, but can be as much as 100% (if you have a long duration medical problem such as a cancer). The balance is effectively a co-payment paid by the patient but it can also be recovered if the patient pays a regular premium to a voluntary health insurance scheme (more than 99% of the population as every worker is entitled, per law, to access to a company subsidized plan). Most of them are managed by non-for-profit groups.

Under recent rules (the coordinated consultation procedure, in French: "''parcours de soins coordonné''"), [[general practitioner]]s ("''médecin généraliste''" or "''docteur''") are expected to act as "gate keepers" who refer patients to a specialist or a hospital when necessary. However the system offers free choice of the reference doctor, which is not restricted to only general practitioner and may still be a specialist or a doctor in a public or private hospital. The goal is to limit the number of consultations for the same illness.&lt;ref name="ameli-choice"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ameli.fr/assures/soins-et-remboursements/comment-etre-rembourse/le-parcours-de-soins-coordonnes/choisir-et-declarer-votre-medecin-traitant.php How to choose and declare his referring doctor in France to get maximum health care benefits], Ameli.fr (official web site of the ''Assurance Maladie'')&lt;/ref&gt; The incentive is financial in that expenses are reimbursed at much lower rates for patients who go directly to another doctor (except for dentists, ophthalmologists, gynaecologists and psychiatrists); vital emergencies are still exempt from requiring the advice from the reference doctor, which will be informed later. As costs are borne by the patient and then reimbursed (most of the time on the spot as all doctors and drugstores can read the "[[Carte Vitale]]", a smart card with all information on the patient and the co-insurance company), patients have freedom of choice of where to receive health care services.&lt;ref name="ameli-choice"/&gt;

Around 62% of hospital beds in France are provided by public hospitals, around 14% by private non-profit organizations, and 24% by for-profit companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nombre de lits installés par type d'établissement en hospitalisation complète et de semaine|url=http://www.fhf.fr/Presse-Communication/Chiffres-cles/Offre-de-soins/Offre-hospitaliere|website=French Hospital Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minister of Health (France)|Minister of Health and Solidarity]] is a cabinet position in the [[Cabinet of France|government of France]]. The healthcare portfolio oversees the public services and the health insurance part of Social Security. As ministerial departments are not fixed and depend on the Prime Minister's choice, the Minister sometimes has other portfolios among Work, Pensions, Family, the Elderly, Handicapped people and Women's Rights. In that case, they are assisted by junior Ministers who focus on specific parts of the portfolio.

===Fees and reimbursements===
{{Unreferenced_section|date=December 2016}}

The global system (social security system) will cover 70% of the global cost unless you have an ALD (long duration medical problem) such as cancer or diabetes where all expenses are covered (100%). In the Alsace-Moselle region, due to its special history as having belonged to France and Germany at one time or another, the social security system covers 90% of the global cost. People can subscribe to a "mutuelle" (non profit insurance) or a private for-profit insurance for additional cover. All workers have access to a specific plan where their company has to pay at least 50% of the cost.

Prices range from €10/month (full basic coverage i.e. 100% of all expenses and medicines) to €100/month (luxury coverage including high level chamber while in hospital, professors for children if they have to remain at home, housemaid at home if needed...).

In large cities, such as Paris, the physicians (especially specialists) charge significantly more for consultations (i.e. 70-80 EUR as opposed to 25 EUR). Because they are not adhering to the fees imposed by the Assurance Maladie, patients are very poorly reimbursed (usually a fraction of that amount) with the mutuelle covering the rest of up to 100% of the official fees. For instance, for an ophthalmologist in Paris, if the patient pays 80 EUR, he will be reimbursed 5.9 EUR by the Assurance Maladie and a maximum of 25 EUR by the mutuelle.

===''Médecin généraliste, médecin traitant''===
{{Main article|General practitioner#France}}

The ''médecin généraliste'' is the responsible doctor for a patient long-term care. This implies prevention, education, care of diseases and [[Physical trauma|trauma]]s that do not require a specialist. They also follow severe diseases day-to-day (between acute crises that may require a specialist). Since 2006, every patient has to declare one generalist doctor as a "médecin traitant" (treating doctor) to the healthcare fund, who has to be consulted before being eventually referred to consult any specialist (gynecologists, psychiatrists, ophtamologists and dentists aside). This policy has been applied to unclog overconsultations of specialists for non severe reasons. 

They survey [[epidemy|epidemics]], fulfil a legal role (consultation of traumas that can bring compensation, certificates for the practice of a sport, death certificates, certificates for hospitalization without consent in case of mental incapacity), and a role in [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] (they can be called by the ''[[Emergency medical services in France|SAMU]]'', the [[emergency medical service]]). They often go to a patient's home if the patient cannot come to the consulting room (especially in case of children or old people) and they must also perform night and week-end duty.

===Health insurance===
Because the model of finance in the French health care system is based on a [[social insurance]] model, contributions to the program are based on income. Prior to reform of the system in 1998, contributions were 12.8% of gross earnings levied on the employer and 6.8% levied directly on the employee. The 1998 reforms extended the system so that the more wealthy with capital income (and not just those with income from employment) also had to contribute; since then the 6.8% figure has dropped to 0.75% of earned income. In its place a wider levy based on total income has been introduced, gambling taxes are now redirected towards health care and recipients of social benefits also must contribute.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/document/e83126.pdf Health Care Systems in Transition – France:  WHO&lt;/ref&gt; Because the insurance is compulsory, the system is effectively financed by general taxation rather than traditional insurance (as typified by auto or home insurance, where risk levels determine premiums).

The founders of the French social security system were largely inspired by the [[Beveridge Report]] in the United Kingdom and aimed to create a single system guaranteeing uniform rights for all. However, there was much opposition from certain socio-professional groups who already benefited from the previous insurance coverage that had more favourable terms. These people were allowed to keep their own systems. Today, 95% of the population are covered by 3 main schemes. One for commerce and industry workers and their families, another for agricultural workers and lastly the national insurance fund for self-employed non-agricultural workers.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;

All working people are required to pay a portion of their income into a health insurance fund, which mutualizes the risk of illness and which reimburses medical expenses at varying rates. Children and spouses of insured individuals are eligible for benefits, as well. Each fund is free to manage its own budget and reimburse medical expenses at the rate it saw fit.

The government has two responsibilities in this system:
* The first is a government responsibility that fixes the rate at which medical expenses should be negotiated and it does this in two ways. The Ministry of Health directly negotiates prices of medicine with the manufacturers, based on the average price of sale observed in neighbouring countries. A board of doctors and experts decides if the medicine provides a valuable enough medical benefit to be reimbursed (note that most medicine is reimbursed, including homeopathy). In parallel, the government fixes the reimbursement rate for medical services. Doctors choose to be in Sector 1 and adhere to the negotiated fees, to Sector 2 and be allowed to charge higher fees within reason ("tact and mesure") or Sector 3 and have no fee limits (a very small percentage of physicians, and their patients have reduced reimbursements). The social security system will only reimburse at the pre-set rate. These tariffs are set annually through negotiation with doctors' representative organisations.
* The second government responsibility is oversight of health-insurance funds, to ensure that they are correctly managing the sums they receive, and to ensure oversight of the public hospital network.

Today, this system is more or less intact. All citizens and legal foreign residents of France are covered by one of these mandatory programs, which continue to be funded by worker participation. However, since 1945, a number of major changes have been introduced. Firstly, the different health care funds (there are five: General, Independent, Agricultural, Student, Public Servants) now all reimburse at the same rate. Secondly, since 2000, the government now provides health care to those who are not covered by a mandatory regime (those who have never worked and who are not students, meaning the very rich or the very poor). This regime, unlike the worker-financed ones, is financed via general taxation and reimburses at a higher rate than the profession-based system for those who cannot afford to make up the difference.

Finally, to counter the rise in health care costs, the government has installed two plans (in 2004 and 2006), which require most people to declare a referring doctor in order to be fully reimbursed for specialist visits, and which installed a mandatory co-payment of €1 (about US$1.35) for a doctor visit (limited to 50 € annually), 0.50 € (about US$0.77) for each prescribed medicine (also limited to 50 € annually) and a fee of €16–18 ($20–25) per day for hospital stays (considered to be the "hotel" part of the hospital stay; that is, an amount people would pay anyway for food, etc.) and for expensive procedures. Such declaration is not required for children below 16 years old (because they already benefit from another protection program), for foreigners without residence in France (who will get benefits depending on existing international agreements between their own national health care program and the French Social Security), or those benefiting from a health care system of French overseas territories, and for those people that benefit from the minimum medical assistance.

An important element of the French insurance system is solidarity: the more ill a person becomes, the less they pay. This means that for people with serious or chronic illnesses (with vital risks, such as cancers, AIDS, or severe mental illness, where the person becomes very dependent of his medical assistance and protection) the insurance system reimburses them 100% of expenses and waives their co-payment charges.

Finally, for fees that the mandatory system does not cover, there is a large range of private complementary insurance plans available. The market for these programs is very competitive. Such insurance is often subsidised by the employer, which means that premiums are usually modest. 85% of French people benefit from complementary private health insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ameli.fr |title=L'assurance maladie |publisher=Ameli.fr |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John S. Ambler, "The French Welfare State: surviving social and ideological change", New York University Press, 30 September 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-0626-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality===
A government body, ANAES, Agence Nationale d'Accréditation et d'Evaluation en Santé (The National Agency for Accreditation and Health Care Evaluation) was responsible for issuing recommendations and practice guidelines. There are recommendations on clinical practice (RPC), relating to the diagnosis, treatment and supervision of certain conditions, and in some cases, to the evaluation of reimbursement arrangements. ANAES also published practice guidelines which are recommendations on good practice that doctors are required to follow according to the terms of agreements signed between their professional representatives and the health insurance funds. There are also recommendations regarding drug prescriptions, and to a lesser extent, the prescription or provision of medical examination. By law, doctors must maintain their professional knowledge with ongoing professional education. ANAES was combined with other commissions in the High Authority of Health on 13 August 2004.

==Emergency medicine==
[[File:Ambulance-p1030618.jpg|thumb|Private Ambulance in Pontarlier]]
{{Main article|Emergency medicine in France}}
Ambulatory care includes care by general practitioners who are largely self-employed and mostly work alone, although about a third of all GPs work in a group practice. GPs do not exercise gatekeeper functions in the French medical system and people can see any registered medical practitioner of choice including specialists. Thus ambulatory care can take place in many settings.

==Spending==

While private medical care exists in France, the 75% of doctors who are in the national program provide care free to the patient, with costs being reimbursed from government funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article625 |title=French Embassy to the US |publisher=Ambafrance-us.org |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yglesias |first=Matthew |url=http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/07/strange-criticisms-of-french-health-care.php |title=Matthew Yglesias article |publisher=Yglesias.thinkprogress.org |date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most countries, France faces problems of rising costs of prescription medication, increasing unemployment, and a large aging population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drum |first=Kevin |url=http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/08/vive-la-healthcare |title=Mother Jones Magazine |publisher=M.motherjones.com |date=6 August 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expenses related to the healthcare system in France represented 10.5% of the country's GDP and 15.4% of its public expenditures.  In 2004, 78.4% of these expenses were paid for by the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/World-Medical-Care-Armand-Lefemine/dp/1477119965| title=US and World Medical Care| author= Armand A. Lefemine MD|year=2012|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2015 the cost had risen to 11.5% of GDP - the third highest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ballas|first1=Dimitris|last2=Dorling|first2=Danny|last3=Hennig|first3=Benjamin|title=The Human Atlas of Europe|date=2017|publisher=Policy Press|location=Bristol|isbn=9781447313540|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sample of 13 developed countries France was first in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in both 2009 and 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of health Economics|title=International Comparison of Medicines Usage: Quantitative Analysis|url=http://www.abpi.org.uk/our-work/library/industry/Documents/meds_usage.pdf|publisher=Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hospitals==

About 62 percent of French hospital capacity is met by publicly owned and managed hospitals. The remaining capacity is split evenly (18% each) between non-profit sector hospitals (which are linked to the public sector and which tend to be owned by foundations, religious organizations or mutual-insurance associations) and by for-profit institutions.&lt;ref name="euro.who.int"/&gt;

==Doctors==

While French doctors only earn about 60% of what American doctors make, their expenses are reduced because they pay no tuition for medical school (cost for a year range from €200 to 500 but students get paid during their internships in hospitals) and malpractice insurance is less costly compared with the United States (as all doctors subscribe to the same fund).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/fp/cusf/analysis/dutton.pdf|title=HEALTH CARE IN FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES:LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER|format=pdf|author=Paul V. Dutton|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217234207/http://www.brookings.edu/fp/cusf/analysis/dutton.pdf|archivedate=17 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low medical malpractice insurance may also be the byproduct of past litigations often favoring the medical practitioners. This started to change due to the implementation of the Patients' Rights Law of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://malpracticecenter.com/states/france|title=French Medical Malpractice Laws - Claims &amp; SOL|work=Medical Malpractice Center|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French National Insurance system also pays for a part of social security taxes owed by doctors that agree to charge the government-approved fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urssaf.fr/profil/independants/professionnel_de_sante_secteur_1/vous_-_vos_cotisations/base_de_calcul_02.html|title=Accueil|website=www.urssaf.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of French doctors has recently declined. Reasons for this may be because they prefer to specialize and get jobs at hospitals rather than setting up General Practices. The workload for general practice doctors requires more hours and responsibility than workplace and supply doctors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/Archive/Doctor-numbers-decline-in-France|title=Doctor numbers decline in France|last=France|first=Connexion|website=www.connexionfrance.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perception==

Historian Dannielle Horan claims that while many in the US deride the French system as "[[socialized medicine]]", the French do not consider their mixed public and private system "socialized" and the population tends to look down upon British- and Canadian-style socialized medicine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

According to the [[Euro health consumer index]] the French healthcare system has a tendency to "medicalize a lot of conditions, and to give patients a lot of drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Outcomes in EHCI 2015|url=http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2015/EHCI_2015_report.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2016|publisher=Health Consumer Powerhouse|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waiting times and access ==
Siciliani and Hurst did a major comparison of countries reporting long waits for health care and countries that did not.  In a comparison of health care funding, institutions and level of resources between countries, prevention of long waiting lists in France was attributed to a high number of doctors and hospital beds, combined with fee-for-service funding of doctors and private hospitals.

In France, many specialists treat patients outside hospitals; these ambulatory specialists are paid fee-for-service.  Private hospitals were also paid by diem daily rates and fee-for-service in 2003, and provided much of total surgery.   Fee-for-service rather than limited budgets, with access for patients with public health insurance helped prevent long waits for surgery (Siciliani and Hurst, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Explaining Waiting Times Variations for Elective Surgery across OECD Countries.|last=Siciliani, L.|first=&amp; Hurst, J.|publisher=Organisation de Coopération et de Développement Economiques Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|year=2003|isbn=|location=https://search.oecd.org/els/health-systems/17256025.pdf|pages=69–70|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Now, public, private nonprofit hospitals and for-profit hospitals are all paid by a DRG system (source needed),

However, assertions that France does not have waiting lists at all are not true.  Long waits apparently remain unusual.  However, some moderate waits have developed.  French patients were relatively unlikely to report forgoing care because of waits (Eurostat, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat. (2012).  European Union statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC).  Luxembourg: European Commission.  Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.eui.eu/Research/Library/ResearchGuides/Economics/Statistics/DataPortal/EU-SILC.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;   However,  there are wait times for some procedures such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans, perhaps relating to low numbers of scanners, and in certain areas for certain specialties like ophthalmology, partly relating to unequal distributions of doctors (Chevreul et al., 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;182).&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul K, Berg Brigham K, Durand-Zaleski I, Hernández-Quevedo C.  (2015).  France: Health system review.  ''Health Systems in Transition'', 2015; ''17''(3), 1–218.   Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/297938/France-HiT.pdf?ua=1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Commonwealth Fund 2010 Health Policy Survey in 11 Countries reported found that a relatively high percentage of French patients reported waiting more than four weeks to see their most recent specialist appointment in France (higher than New Zealand, the U.K and Australia).  This percentage held relatively constant over time, showing that waiting lists in France for appointments and elective surgery are not a new phenomenon.     Fifty three percent of specialist appointments took less than 1 month (relatively low), and 28% more than two months. However, while moderate waits for elective surgery were common (only 46% said they had waited less than one month) the percentage reporting four-month-plus waits was only 7%, low and similar to the U.S., Switzerland, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;The Commonwealth Fund.  (2010).  ''Commonwealth Fund 2010 Health Policy Survey in 11 Countries''.  New York, NY: Author.  Retrieved from [http://www.commonwealthfund.org/%7E/media/files/publications/chartbook/2010/pdf_2010_ihp_survey_chartpack_full_12022010.pdf http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/files/publications/chartbook/2010/pdf_2010_ihp_survey_chartpack_full_12022010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  So, it appears that extremely long waits (like those in the U.K.'s NHS in the 1990s) are still rare. 

This study has limitations.  The number of people surveyed may not have been perfectly representative, although the figures held similar over time.  The study also did not state the percentage of total appointments taking this long (whether a patient's appointments after the initial appointment were more timely or not), although the most recent appointment would presumably reflect both initial and subsequent appointments), or the total number of appointments available.  The waits were self-reported, rather than collected from statistics; this may also lead the data to be not completely representative.  &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In terms of health care supply, France has far more doctors per capita than the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  This suggests that while French patients in some cases have similar to current waiting times to the first 3 countries, the number of patients who receive appointments and treatment is significantly higher than in the U.K., Australia and New Zealand (whose global budgets for hospitals also likely capped the supply at lower levels).  It is also relevant that while American, Swiss and German patients generally reported short waits, a significant minority of American patients reported waiting longer than 4 weeks for a specialist appointment (about 20%), and longer than 1 month for elective surgery (30%) &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.  Thus, while waiting times in the U.S. are usually short, a higher percentage waits in the U.S. are longer than generally assumed.  One study reported longer waiting times for uninsured American patients, who may face a disproportionate number of longer waiting times (citation needed)(founder Alejandro Castillo) .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2865">In terms of major [[health indicators]], '''health in Paraguay''' ranks near the median among [[South America]]n countries. In 2003 [[Paraguay]] had a [[child mortality]] rate of 29.5 deaths per 1,000 children, ranking it behind [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], and [[Uruguay]] but ahead of [[Brazil]] and [[Bolivia]]. The health of Paraguayans living outside urban areas is generally worse than those residing in cities. Many preventable diseases, such as [[Chagas' disease]], run rampant in rural regions. Parasitic and respiratory diseases, which could be controlled with proper medical treatment, drag down Paraguay's overall health. In general, [[malnutrition]], lack of proper health care, and poor [[sanitation]] are the root of many health problems in Paraguay.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Paraguay.pdf Paraguay country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Health care funding from the national government increased gradually throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Spending on health care rose to 1.7 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2000, nearly triple the 0.6 percent of GDP spent in 1989. But during the past decade, improvement in health care has slowed. Paraguay spends less per capita (US$13−20 per year) than most other Latin American countries. A 2001 survey indicated that 27 percent of the population still had no access to medical care, public or private. Private health insurance is very limited, with pre-paid plans making up only 11 percent of private expenditures on health care. Thus, most of the money spent on private health care (about 88 percent) is on a fee-for-service basis, effectively preventing the poor population from seeing private doctors. According to recent estimates, Paraguay has about 117 [[physician]]s and 20 [[nurse]]s per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In 2003 the prevalence rate of [[human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS) in Paraguay was estimated at 0.5 percent of the population, and officials reported 600 deaths from AIDS. The [[United Nations]] cautions that although the prevalence rate in Paraguay remains low, HIV/AIDS is increasing among stigmatized population groups. Transmission of the virus is primarily through sexual contact. According to 2004 estimates, nearly 15,000 Paraguayans were infected with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

[[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] is caused by a [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), which originated in non-human [[primate]]s in [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]]. While various sub-groups of the virus acquired human infectivity at different times, the global pandemic had its origins in the emergence of one specific strain – HIV-1 subgroup M – in [[Kinshasa|Léopoldville]] in the [[Belgian Congo]] (now Kinshasa in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=pppppavab&gt;{{Cite news|title=Aids: Origin of pandemic 'was 1920s.

There are two types of HIV: '''[[HIV-1]]''' and '''[[HIV-2]]'''. 

'''HIV-1''' is more virulent, is more easily transmitted and is the cause of the vast majority of HIV infections globally.&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reeves JD, Doms RW | title = Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 83 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1253–65 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12029140 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-83-6-1253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pandemic strain of HIV-1 is closely related to a virus found in [[chimpanzee]]s of the subspecies ''[[Central chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes troglodytes]]'', which live in the forests of the Central African nations of [[Cameroon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Republic of Congo]] (or Congo-Brazzaville), and [[Central African Republic]]. 

'''HIV-2''' is less transmittable and is largely confined to West Africa, along with its closest relative, a virus of the [[sooty mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys atys''), an Old World monkey inhabiting southern [[Senegal]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and western [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=Reeves/&gt;&lt;ref name=Santiago2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santiago ML, Range F, Keele BF, Li Y, Bailes E, Bibollet-Ruche F, Fruteau C, Noë R, Peeters M, Brookfield JF, Shaw GM, Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in Free-Ranging Sooty Mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys) from the Tai Forest, Cote d'Ivoire: Implications for the Origin of Epidemic Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 79 | issue = 19 | pages = 12515–27 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16160179 | pmc = 1211554 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.79.19.12515-12527.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission from non-humans to humans ==
The majority of HIV researchers agree that HIV evolved at some point from the closely related [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV), and that SIV or HIV (post mutation) was transferred from non-human primates to humans in the recent past (as a type of [[zoonosis]]). {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Research in this area is conducted using [[molecular phylogenetics]], comparing viral genomic sequences to determine relatedness.

=== HIV-1 from chimpanzees and gorillas to humans ===

Scientists generally accept that the known strains (or groups) of [[HIV-1]] are most closely related to the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) endemic in wild [[ape]] populations of West Central African forests. In particular, each of the known HIV-1 strains is either closely related to the [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] that infects the [[chimpanzee]] subspecies ''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'' (SIVcpz) or closely related to the SIV that infects [[western lowland gorilla]]s (''Gorilla gorilla gorilla''), called SIVgor.&lt;ref name=Keele&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keele BF, Van Heuverswyn F, Li Y, Bailes E, Takehisa J, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, Chen Y, Wain LV, Liegeois F, Loul S, Ngole EM, Bienvenue Y, Delaporte E, Brookfield JF, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Peeters M, Hahn BH |author-link16=Paul M.

However, reviews of the epidemiological evidence of early HIV-1 infection in stored blood samples, and of old cases of AIDS in Central Africa, have led many scientists to believe that HIV-1 group M early human centre was probably not in Cameroon, but rather further south in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], more probably in its capital city, [[Kinshasa]] (formerly Léopoldville).&lt;ref name=Keele/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gao&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, Chen Y, Rodenburg CM, Michael SF, Cummins LB, Arthur LO, Peeters M, Shaw GM, Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes | journal = Nature | volume = 397 | issue = 6718 | pages = 436–441 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9989410 | doi = 10.1038/17130 | bibcode = 1999Natur.397..436G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sousa2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Sousa JD, Müller V, Lemey P, Vandamme AM | title = High GUD Incidence in the Early 20th century Created a Particularly Permissive Time Window for the Origin and Initial Spread of Epidemic HIV Strains | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = e9936 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20376191 | pmc = 2848574 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009936 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.9936S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[HIV-1]] sequences preserved in human biological samples along with estimates of viral mutation rates, scientists calculate that the jump from chimpanzee to human probably happened during the late 19th or early 20th century, a time of rapid urbanisation and colonisation in equatorial Africa. Exactly when the [[zoonosis]] occurred is not known. Some molecular dating studies suggest that HIV-1 group M had its [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) (that is, started to spread in the human population) in the early 20th century, probably between 1915 and 1941.&lt;ref name=Salemi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salemi M, Strimmer K, Hall WW, Duffy M, Delaporte E, Mboup S, Peeters M, Vandamme AM | title = Dating the common ancestor of SIVcpz and HIV-1 group M and the origin of HIV-1 subtypes by using a new method to uncover clock-like molecular evolution | journal = The FASEB Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 276–78 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11156935 | doi = 10.1096/fj.00-0449fje }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Korber&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korber B, Muldoon M, Theiler J, Gao F, Gupta R, Lapedes A, Hahn BH, Wolinsky S, Bhattacharya T | title = Timing the Ancestor of the HIV-1 Pandemic Strains | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5472 | pages = 1789–96 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10846155 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5472.1789 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1789K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2004/&gt; A study published in 2008, analyzing viral sequences recovered from a biopsy made in Kinshasa, in 1960, along with previously known sequences, suggested a common ancestor between 1873 and 1933 (with central estimates varying between 1902 and 1921).&lt;ref name=Worobey2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Worobey M, Gemmel M, Teuwen DE, Haselkorn T, Kunstman K, Bunce M, Muyembe JJ, Kabongo JM, Kalengayi RM, Van Marck E, Gilbert MT, Wolinsky SM | title = Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7213 | pages = 661–4 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18833279 | pmc = 3682493 | doi = 10.1038/nature07390 | bibcode = 2008Natur.455..661W }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic recombination]] had earlier been thought to "seriously confound" such phylogenetic analysis, but later "work has suggested that recombination is not likely to systematically bias [results]", although recombination is "expected to increase variance".&lt;ref name=Worobey2008/&gt; The results of a 2008 phylogenetics study support the later work and indicate that HIV evolves "fairly reliably".&lt;ref  name=Worobey2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCNature&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7646255.stm Colonial clue to the rise of HIV].

Sample analyses resulted in little data due to the rarity of experimental material.  The researchers, however, were able to hypothesize a phylogeny from the gathered data.

=== HIV-2 from sooty mangabeys to humans ===
{{see also|HIV subtypes}}

Similar research has been undertaken with [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] strains collected from several wild [[sooty mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys atys'') (SIVsmm) populations of the West African nations of [[Sierra Leone]], Liberia, and [[Ivory Coast]]. The resulting phylogenetic analyses show that the viruses most closely related to the two strains of [[HIV-2]] that spread considerably in humans (HIV-2 groups A and B) are the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest, in western [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=Santiago2005/&gt;

There are six additional known [[HIV-2]] groups, each having been found in just one person. They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from [[sooty mangabey]]s to humans. Groups C and D have been found in two people from [[Liberia]], groups E and F have been discovered in two people from [[Sierra Leone]], and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the [[Ivory Coast]]. These [[HIV-2]] strains are probably [[host (biology)|dead-end infection]]s, and each of them is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from [[sooty mangabeys]] living in the same country where the human infection was found.&lt;ref name=Santiago2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marx2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marx PA, Alcabes PG, Drucker E | title = Serial human passage of simian immunodeficiency virus by unsterile injections and the emergence of epidemic human immunodeficiency virus in Africa | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 356 | issue = 1410 | pages = 911–20 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11405938 | pmc = 1088484 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2001.0867 | url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/356/1410/911.abstract | author4 = Marx PA, Alcabes PG, Drucker E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bushmeat practice ===

According to the [[natural transfer]] theory (also called "hunter theory" or "bushmeat theory"), the "simplest and most plausible explanation for the cross-species transmission"&lt;ref name=Sharp2001/&gt; of SIV or HIV (post mutation), the virus was transmitted from an [[ape]] or [[monkey]] to a human when a hunter or [[bushmeat]] vendor/handler was bitten or cut while hunting or butchering the animal. The resulting exposure to blood or other bodily fluids of the animal can result in SIV infection.&lt;ref name="avert"&gt;{{cite web|author=Annabel Kanabus &amp; Sarah Allen. Updated by Bonita de Boer|publisher=[[AVERT]] (an international HIV and AIDS charity based in the UK)|year=2007|url=http://www.avert.org/origins.htm|title=The Origins of HIV &amp; the First Cases of AIDS|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to WWII, some Sub-Saharan Africans were forced out of the rural areas because of the European demand for resources.  Since rural Africans were not keen to pursue agricultural practices in the jungle, they turned to non-domesticated meat as their primary source of protein.  This over-exposure to bushmeat and malpractice of butchery increased blood-to-blood contact, which then increased the probability of transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chitnis A, Rawls D, Moore J | year = 2000 | title = Origin Of HIV Type 1 In Colonial French Equatorial Africa? | url = | journal = AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 5–8 | doi=10.1089/088922200309548 | pmid=10628811}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent serological survey showed that human infections by [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] are not rare in Central Africa: the percentage of people showing seroreactivity to [[antigen]]s—evidence of current or past SIV infection—was 2.3% among the general population of [[Cameroon]], 7.8% in villages where bushmeat is hunted or used, and 17.1% in the most exposed people of these villages.&lt;ref name=Kalish2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalish ML, Wolfe ND, Ndongmo CB, McNicholl J, Robbins KE, Aidoo M, Fonjungo PN, Alemnji G, Zeh C, Djoko CF, Mpoudi-Ngole E, Burke DS, Folks TM | title = Central African hunters exposed to simian immunodeficiency virus | journal = Emerg Infect Dis | volume = 11 | issue = 12 | pages = 1928–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16485481 | pmc = 3367631 | doi = 10.3201/eid1112.050394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; How the SIV virus would have transformed into HIV after infection of the hunter or bushmeat handler from the ape/monkey is still a matter of debate, although natural selection would favour any viruses capable of adjusting so that they could infect and reproduce in the [[T cell]]s of a human host.

However, the types of apes shown to carry the SIV virus are different in South America.  The primary point of entry, according to researchers, is somewhere in the jungles of Brazil.&lt;ref name="Jones2009"/&gt;  An SIV strain, closely related to HIV, was interspersed within a certain [[Cladistics|clade]] of primates.  This suggests that the zoonotic transmission of the virus may have happened in this area.&lt;ref  name="Jones2009"/&gt;  Continual emigration between countries escalated the transmission of the virus.  Other scientists believe that the HIV-1C strain circulated in South America at around the same time that the HIV-1C strain was introduced in Africa.&lt;ref  name="Jones2009"/&gt;  Little research has been done on this theory because it is fairly young.

== Emergence ==

&lt;!--Hide unreferenced definition not essential to article === Conditions for successful zoonosis ===

[[Zoonosis]] (transfer of a [[pathogen]] from non-human animals to humans) and subsequent spread of the pathogen between humans, requires the following conditions:
#a human population
#a nearby population of a host animal
#an infectious pathogen in the host animal that can spread from animal to human
#interaction between the species to transmit enough of the pathogen to humans to establish a human foothold, which could have taken millions of individual exposures
#ability of the pathogen to spread from human to human (perhaps acquired by [[mutation]])
#some process allowing the pathogen to disperse widely, preventing the infection from "burning out" by either killing off its human hosts or provoking immunity in a local population of humans. --&gt;

=== Unresolved questions about HIV origins and emergence ===

The discovery of the main HIV / SIV phylogenetic relationships permits explaining ''broad'' HIV [[biogeography]]: the early centres of the [[HIV-1]] groups were in Central Africa, where the  primate reservoirs of the related SIVcpz and SIVgor viruses ([[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s) exist; similarly, the [[HIV-2]] groups had their centres in West Africa, where [[sooty mangabey]]s, which harbour the related SIVsmm virus, exist. However, these relationships do not explain more detailed patterns of biogeography, such as why epidemic HIV-2 groups (A and B) only evolved in the [[Ivory Coast]], which is one of only six countries harbouring the sooty mangabey.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It is also unclear why the SIVcpz endemic in the [[chimpanzee]] subspecies ''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'' (inhabiting the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], Central African Republic, [[Rwanda]], Burundi, [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]) did not spawn an epidemic HIV-1 strain to humans, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was the main centre of HIV-1 group M, a virus descended from SIVcpz strains of a subspecies (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'') that does not exist in this country. It is clear that the several HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains descend from SIVcpz, SIVgor, and SIVsmm viruses,&lt;ref name=Santiago2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanHeuv/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plantier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharp2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gao/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt; and that [[bushmeat]] practice provides the most plausible venue for cross-species transfer to humans.&lt;ref name=Sharp2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gao/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kalish2005/&gt; However, some loose ends remain.

It is not yet explained why only four HIV groups ([[HIV-1]] groups M and O, and [[HIV-2]] groups A and B) spread considerably in human populations, despite bushmeat practices being widespread in Central and West Africa,&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt; and the resulting human [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infections being common.&lt;ref name=Kalish2005/&gt;

It also remains unexplained why all epidemic HIV groups emerged in humans nearly simultaneously, and only in the 20th century, despite very old human exposure to SIV (a recent phylogenetic study demonstrated that SIV is at least tens of thousands of years old).&lt;ref name=Worobey2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Worobey M, Telfer P, Souquière S, Hunter M, Coleman CA, Metzger MJ, Reed P, Makuwa M, Hearn G, Honarvar S, Roques P, Apetrei C, Kazanji M, Marx PA | title = Island Biogeography Reveals the Deep History of SIV | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5998 | page = 1487 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20847261 | doi = 10.1126/science.1193550 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1487W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origin and epidemic emergence ===

Several of the theories of HIV origin accept the established knowledge of the HIV/SIV phylogenetic relationships, and also accept that [[bushmeat]] practice was the most likely cause of the initial transfer to humans. All of them propose that the simultaneous epidemic emergences of four HIV groups in the late 19th-early 20th century, and the lack of previous known emergences, are explained by new factor(s) that appeared in the relevant African regions in that timeframe. These new factor(s) would have acted either to increase human exposures to SIV, to help it to adapt to the human organism by [[mutation]] (thus enhancing its between-humans transmissibility), or to cause an initial burst of transmissions crossing an [[epidemiological]] threshold, and therefore increasing the probability of continued spread.

Genetic studies of the virus suggested in 2008 that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to the [[Belgian Congo]] city of [[Léopoldville]] (modern [[Kinshasa]]), circa 1910.&lt;ref name=Worobey2008 /&gt; Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of [[colonialism]] and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of non-monogamous sexual activity, the spread of [[prostitution]], and the concomitant high frequency of [[genital ulcer]] diseases (such as [[syphilis]]) in nascent colonial cities.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010 /&gt;

In 2014, a study conducted by scientists from the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, revealed that because approximately one million people every year would flow through the prominent city of Kinshasa,&lt;ref name=pppppavab /&gt; which served as the origin of the first known HIV cases in the 1920s,&lt;ref name=pppppavab /&gt; passengers riding on the region's Belgian railway trains were able to spread the virus to larger areas.&lt;ref name=pppppavab /&gt;  The study also attributed a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics as other factors which contributed to the emergence of the Africa HIV epidemic.&lt;ref name=pppppavab /&gt;

==== Social changes and urbanization ====

Beatrice Hahn, [[Paul M. Sharp]], and their colleagues proposed that "[the epidemic emergence of HIV] most likely reflects changes in population structure and behaviour in Africa during the 20th century and perhaps medical interventions that provided the opportunity for rapid human-to-human spread of the virus".&lt;ref name=Sharp2001/&gt; After the [[Scramble for Africa]]  started in the 1880s, European colonial powers established cities, towns, and other colonial stations. A largely masculine labor force was hastily recruited to work in [[fluvial]] and sea ports, railways, other infrastructures, and in plantations. This disrupted traditional tribal values and favored casual sexual activity with an increased number of partners. In the nascent cities women felt relatively liberated from rural tribal rules&lt;ref name=Egerton1938&gt;Egerton FC (1938) African Majesty: A Record of Refuge at the Court of the King of Bangangté in the French Cameroons.

Leipzig: Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accompanied by unprecedented increase in people's movements.

Michael Worobey and colleagues observed that the growth of cities probably played a role in the epidemic emergence of HIV, since the phylogenetic dating of the two older strains of [[HIV-1]] (groups M and O), suggest that these viruses started to spread soon after the main Central African colonial cities were founded.&lt;ref name=Worobey2008/&gt;

==== Colonialism in Africa ====

Amit Chitnis, Diana Rawls, and Jim Moore proposed that HIV may have emerged epidemically as a result of the harsh conditions, forced labor, displacement, and unsafe injection and [[vaccination]] practices associated with [[colonialism]], particularly in [[French Equatorial Africa]].&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chitnis A, Rawls D, Moore J | title = Origin of HIV Type 1 in Colonial French Equatorial Africa? | journal = AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10628811 | doi = 10.1089/088922200309548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The workers in plantations, construction projects, and other colonial enterprises were supplied with [[bushmeat]], which would have contributed to an increase in hunting and, it follows, a higher incidence of human exposure to SIV. Several historical sources support the view that bushmeat hunting indeed increased, both because of the necessity to supply workers and  because firearms became more widely available.&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merfield&gt;Merfield FG (1957) Gorillas were my Neighbours. London: The Company Book Club.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CVidrovich&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coquery-Vidrovitch C |title=The Upper-Sangha in the Time of the Concession Companies |journal=Yale F &amp; ES Bulletin |volume=102 |pages=72–84 |year=1998 |url=http://www.umich.edu/~infosrn/PDF_FILES/ENGLISH_.PDF/SEC._1/COQUERY-.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial authorities also gave many [[vaccination]]s against [[smallpox]], and injections, of which many would be made without sterilising the equipment between uses (unsafe or unsterile injections). Chitnis ''et al.'' proposed that both these [[parenteral]] risks and the prostitution associated with forced labor camps could have caused serial transmission (or [[serial passage]]) of SIV between humans (see discussion of this in the next section).&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000/&gt; In addition, they proposed that the conditions of extreme stress associated with forced labor could depress the [[immune system]] of workers, therefore prolonging the primary [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period of someone newly infected by SIV, thus increasing the odds of both adaptation of the virus to humans, and of further transmissions.&lt;ref name=Moore2001&gt;Moore J (2001) About this paper and comments on 'The River' url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~jmoore/publications/HIVorigin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors proposed that HIV-1 originated in the area of French Equatorial Africa in the early 20th century (when the colonial abuses and forced labor were at their peak). Later research established these theories were mostly correct: HIV-1 groups M and O started to spread in humans in late 19th–early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Salemi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Korber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lemey P, Pybus OG, Rambaut A, Drummond AJ, Robertson DL, Roques P, Worobey M, Vandamme AM | title = The Molecular Population Genetics of HIV-1 Group O | journal = Genetics | volume = 167 | issue = 3 | pages = 1059–68 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15280223 | pmc = 1470933 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.104.026666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Worobey2008/&gt; In addition, all groups of HIV-1 descend from either SIVcpz or SIVgor from [[ape]]s living to the west of the [[Ubangi River]], either in countries that belonged to the French Equatorial Africa federation of colonies, in [[Equatorial Guinea]] (then a Spanish colony), or in [[Cameroon]] (which was a German colony between 1884 and 1916, and then fell to Allied forces in World War I, and had most of its area administered by France, in close association with French Equatorial Africa).

This theory was later dubbed "Heart of Darkness" by Jim Moore,&lt;ref name=Moore2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore J |title=The Puzzling Origins of AIDS |journal=American Scientist |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–47 |year=2004 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/my_amsci/restricted.aspx?act=pdf&amp;id=3539589813439 |doi=10.1511/2004.6.540}}&lt;/ref&gt; alluding to [[Heart of Darkness|the book of the same title]] written by [[Joseph Conrad]], the main focus of which is colonial abuses in equatorial Africa.

==== Unsterile injections ====

In several articles published since 2001, Preston Marx, Philip Alcabes, and Ernest Drucker proposed that HIV emerged because of rapid serial human-to-human transmission of [[Simian Immunodeficiency Virus|SIV]] (after a [[bushmeat]] hunter or handler became SIV-infected) through unsafe or unsterile injections.&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drucker2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drucker E, Alcabes PG, Marx PA | title = The injection century: massive unsterile injections and the emergence of human pathogens | journal = Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9297 | pages = 1989–92 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11747942 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06967-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=syringe&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Donald G.

Before 1910, no Central African town had more than 10,000 people. But urban migration rose, increasing sexual contacts and leading to red-light districts.|work=New York Times |date=September 16, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both Chitnis ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000/&gt; and Sharp ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Sharp2001/&gt; also suggested that this may have been one of the major risk factors at play in HIV emergence (see above), Marx ''et al.'' enunciated the underlying mechanisms in greater detail, and wrote the first review of the injection campaigns made in colonial Africa.&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drucker2001/&gt;

Central to Marx ''et al.'' argument is the concept of adaptation by [[serial passage]] (or serial transmission): an [[Adventitiousness#Medicine|adventitious]] virus (or other [[pathogen]]) can increase its biological [[adaptation]] to a new host species if it is rapidly transmitted between hosts, while each host is still in the [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period. This process favors the accumulation of [[adaptive mutation]]s more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted viral variant will appear in the host before the [[immune system]] suppresses the virus.&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt; Such better adapted variant could then survive in the human host for longer than the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period, in high numbers (high [[viral load]]), which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread.

Marx ''et al.'' reported experiments of cross-species transfer of SIV in captive monkeys (some of which made by themselves), in which the use of [[serial passage]] helped to adapt SIV to the new monkey species after passage by three or four animals.&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;

In agreement with this model is also the fact that, while both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] attain substantial [[viral load]]s in the human organism, adventitious [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV [[viral load]].&lt;ref name=Kalish2005/&gt; This suggests that both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] are adapted to humans, and [[serial passage]] could have been the process responsible for it.

Marx ''et al.'' proposed that unsterile injections (that is, injections where the needle or syringe is reused without sterilization or cleaning between uses), which were likely very prevalent in Africa, during both the colonial period and afterwards, provided the mechanism of [[serial passage]] that permitted HIV to adapt to humans, therefore explaining why it emerged epidemically only in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drucker2001/&gt;

===== Massive injections of the antibiotic era =====

Marx ''et al.'' emphasize the massive number of injections administered in Africa after [[antibiotic]]s were introduced (around 1950) as being the most likely implicated in the origin of HIV because, by these times (roughly in the period 1950 to 1970), injection intensity in Africa was maximal. They argued that a [[serial passage]] chain of 3 or 4 transmissions between humans is an unlikely event (the probability of transmission after a needle reuse is something between 0.3% and 2%, and only a few people have an acute SIV infection at any time), and so HIV emergence may have required the very high frequency of injections of the [[antibiotic]] era.&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;

The molecular dating studies place the initial spread of the epidemic HIV groups before that time (see above).&lt;ref name=Salemi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Korber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worobey2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt; According to Marx ''et al.'', these studies could have overestimated the age of the HIV groups, because they depend on a [[molecular clock]] assumption, may not have accounted for the effects of [[natural selection]] in the viruses, and the [[serial passage]] process alone would be associated with strong [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;

===== Injection campaigns against sleeping sickness =====

David Gisselquist proposed that the mass injection campaigns to treat [[trypanosomiasis]] ([[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]) in Central Africa were responsible for the emergence of HIV-1.&lt;ref name=Gisselquist2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gisselquist D | title = Emergence of the HIV type 1 epidemic in the twentieth century: comparing hypotheses to evidence | journal = AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 1071–78 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14709242 | doi = 10.1089/088922203771881158 | url = http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089%2F088922203771881158 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx ''et al.'',&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt; Gisselquist argued that the millions of unsafe injections administered during these campaigns were sufficient to spread rare HIV infections into an epidemic, and that evolution of HIV through [[serial passage]] was not essential to the emergence of the HIV epidemic in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Gisselquist2003/&gt;

This theory focuses on injection campaigns that peaked in the period 1910–40, that is, around the time the [[HIV-1]] groups started to spread.&lt;ref name=Salemi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Korber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worobey2008/&gt; It also focuses on the fact that many of the injections in these campaigns were intravenous (which are more likely to transmit SIV/HIV than subcutaneous or intramuscular injections), and many of the patients received many (often more than 10) injections per year, therefore increasing the odds of SIV [[serial passage]].&lt;ref name=Gisselquist2003/&gt;

===== Other early injection campaigns =====

Jacques Pépin and Annie-Claude Labbé reviewed the colonial health reports of [[Cameroon]] and [[French Equatorial Africa]] for the period 1921–59, calculating the incidences of the diseases requiring intravenous injections. They concluded that [[trypanosomiasis]], [[leprosy]], [[yaws]], and [[syphilis]] were responsible for most intravenous injections. [[Schistosomiasis]], [[tuberculosis]], and vaccinations against [[smallpox]] represented lower [[parenteral]] risks: schistosomiasis cases were relatively few; tuberculosis patients only became numerous after mid-century; and there were few smallpox vaccinations in the lifetime of each person.&lt;ref name=Pepin2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pépin J, Labbé AC | title = Noble goals, unforeseen consequences: control of tropical diseases in colonial Central Africa and the iatrogenic transmission of blood-borne viruses | journal = Trop Med Int Health | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 744–53 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18397182 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02060.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors suggested that the very high prevalence of the [[Hepatitis C]] virus in southern [[Cameroon]] and forested areas of [[French Equatorial Africa]] (around 40–50%) can be better explained by the unsterile injections used to treat [[yaws]], because this disease was much more prevalent than [[syphilis]], [[trypanosomiasis]], and [[leprosy]] in these areas. They suggested that all these parenteral risks caused not only the massive spread of [[Hepatitis C]] but also the spread of other [[pathogen]]s, and the emergence of [[HIV-1]]: "the same procedures could have exponentially amplified HIV-1, from a single hunter/cook occupationally infected with SIVcpz to several thousand patients treated with arsenicals or other drugs, a threshold beyond which sexual transmission could prosper."&lt;ref name=Pepin2008/&gt; They do not suggest specifically [[serial passage]] as the mechanism of adaptation.

According to Pépin's 2011 book, ''The Origins of AIDS'',&lt;ref name=AIDS&gt;{{cite book|last= Pépin|first=Jacques|title=The Origins of AIDS|year=2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn=978-0-521-18637-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the virus can be traced to a central African bush hunter in 1921, with colonial medical campaigns using improperly sterilized syringe and needles playing a key role in enabling a future epidemic.  Pépin concludes that AIDS spread silently in Africa for decades, fueled by urbanization and prostitution since the initial cross-species infection. Pépin also claims that the virus was brought to the Americas by a Haitian teacher returning home from Zaire in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="pepin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Pépin|title=The Origins of AIDS|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2011|page=311|isbn=978-0-521-18637-7|oclc=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sex tourism and contaminated blood transfusion centers ultimately propelled AIDS to public consciousness in the 1980s and a worldwide pandemic.&lt;ref name=AIDS/&gt;

==== Genital ulcer diseases and evolution of sexual activity====

João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme proposed that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, helped by a high frequency of [[genital ulcer]]s, caused by [[genital ulcer disease]]s (GUD).&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt; GUD are simply [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that cause genital ulcers; examples are [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]], [[lymphogranuloma venereum]], and [[genital herpes]]. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01–0.1% to 4–43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated [[T cell]]s expressing the [[CCR5]] co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cameron&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron DW, Simonsen JN, D'Costa LJ, Ronald AR, Maitha GM, Gakinya MN, Cheang M, Ndinya-Achola JO, Piot P, Brunham RC | title = Female to male transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1: risk factors for seroconversion in men | journal = Lancet | volume = 334 | issue = 8660 | pages = 403–407 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2569597 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(89)90589-8 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90589-8/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Probable time interval of cross-species transfer =====

Sousa ''et al.'' use molecular dating techniques to estimate the time when each HIV group split from its closest [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] lineage. Each HIV group necessarily crossed to humans between this time and the time when it started to spread (the time of the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]]), because after the MRCA certainly all lineages were already in humans, and before the split with the closest [[simian]] strain, the lineage was in a simian. HIV-1 groups M and O split from their closest SIVs around 1931 and 1915, respectively. This information, together with the datations of the HIV groups' MRCAs, mean that all HIV groups likely crossed to humans in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;

===== Strong GUD incidence in nascent colonial cities =====

The authors reviewed colonial medical articles and archived medical reports of the countries at or near the ranges of [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[sooty mangabey]]s, and found that [[genital ulcer disease]]s peaked in the colonial cities during their early growth period (up to 1935). The colonial authorities recruited men to work in railways, fluvial and sea ports, and other infrastructure projects, and most of these men did not bring their wives with them. Then, the highly male-biased [[sex ratio]] favoured prostitution, which in its turn caused an explosion of [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] (especially [[syphilis]] and [[chancroid]]). After the mid-1930s, people's movements were more tightly controlled, and mass surveys and treatments (of [[arsenical]]s and other drugs) were organized, and so the GUD incidences started to decline. They declined even further after World War II, because of the heavy use of [[antibiotic]]s, so that, by the late 1950s, Léopoldville (which is the probable center of HIV-1 group M) had a very low GUD incidence. Similar processes happened in the cities of [[Cameroon]] and [[Ivory Coast]], where HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 respectively evolved.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;

Therefore, the peak GUD incidences in cities&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt; have a good temporal coincidence with the period when all main HIV groups crossed to humans and started to spread.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Salemi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Korber/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worobey2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lemey2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt; In addition, the authors gathered evidence that [[syphilis]] and the other GUDs were, like injections, absent from the densely forested areas of Central and West Africa before organized [[colonialism]] socially disrupted these areas (starting in the 1880s).&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt; Thus, this theory also potentially explains why HIV emerged only after the late 19th century.

===== Female genital mutilation =====

Uli Linke has argued that the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (i.e., clitoridectomy and/or infibulation) is responsible for the high incidence of AIDS in Africa, since intercourse with a female who has undergone clitoridectomy is conducive to exchange of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Linke | first=Uli | title = AIDS in Africa | journal = Science | volume = 231 | page = 203 | date = January 1986 | doi=10.1126/science.231.4735.203-b | issue=4735|bibcode = 1986Sci...231..203L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Male circumcision distribution and HIV origins=====

Male [[circumcision]] may reduce the probability of HIV acquisition by [[Circumcision and HIV|men]]. Leaving aside blood [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s, the highest [[HIV-1]] transmissibility ever measured was from GUD-suffering female prostitutes to uncircumcised men—the measured risk was 43% in a single sexual act.&lt;ref name=Cameron/&gt; Sousa ''et al.'' reasoned that the adaptation and epidemic emergence of each HIV group may have required such extreme conditions, and thus reviewed the existing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] literature for patterns of male [[circumcision]] and hunting of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s for [[bushmeat]], focusing on the period 1880–1960, and on most of the 318 [[ethnic group]]s living in Central and West Africa.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt; They also collected censuses and other literature showing the ethnic composition of colonial cities in this period. Then, they estimated the circumcision frequencies of the Central African cities over time.

Sousa ''et al.'' charts reveal that male circumcision frequencies were much lower in several cities of western and central Africa in the early 20th century than they are currently. The reason is that many [[ethnic group]]s not performing circumcision by that time gradually adopted it, to imitate other ethnic groups and enhance the social acceptance of their boys ([[colonialism]] produced massive intermixing between African ethnic groups).&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedrichs1924/&gt; About 15–30% of men in Léopoldville and [[Douala]] in the early 20th century should be uncircumcised, and these cities were the probable centers of HIV-1 groups M and O, respectively.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;

The authors studied early [[circumcision]] frequencies in 12 cities of Central and West Africa, to test if this variable correlated with HIV emergence. This [[correlation]] was strong for [[HIV-2]]: among 6 West African cities that could have received immigrants infected with SIVsmm, the two cities from the [[Ivory Coast]] studied ([[Abidjan]] and [[Bouaké]]) had much higher frequency of uncircumcised men (60–85%) than the others, and epidemic [[HIV-2]] groups emerged initially in this country only. This correlation was less clear for [[HIV-1]] in Central Africa.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;

===== Computer simulations of HIV emergence =====

Sousa ''et al.'' then built [[computer simulation]]s to test if an 'ill-adapted SIV' (meaning a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] already infecting a human but incapable of transmission beyond the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period) could spread in colonial cities. The simulations used [[parameter]]s of sexual transmission obtained from the current HIV literature. They modelled people's 'sexual links', with different levels of sexual partner change among different categories of people (prostitutes, single women with several partners a year, married women, and men), according to data obtained from modern studies of sexual activity in African cities. The simulations let the parameters (city size, proportion of people married, [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] frequency, male [[circumcision]] frequency, and transmission parameters) vary, and explored several scenarios. Each scenario was run 1,000 times, to test the probability of SIV generating long chains of sexual transmission. The authors postulated that such long chains of sexual transmission were necessary for the SIV strain to adapt better to humans, becoming an HIV capable of further epidemic emergence.

The main result was that [[genital ulcer]] frequency was by far the most decisive factor. For the GUD levels prevailing in Léopoldville in the early 20th century, long chains of SIV transmission had a high probability. For the lower [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] levels existing in the same city in the late 1950s (see above), they were much less likely. And without GUD (a situation typical of villages in forested equatorial Africa before [[colonialism]]) SIV could not spread at all. City size was not an important factor. The authors propose that these findings explain the temporal patterns of HIV emergence: no HIV emerging in tens of thousands of years of human slaughtering of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s, several HIV groups emerging in the nascent, GUD-riddled, colonial cities, and no epidemically successful HIV group emerging in mid-20th century, when GUD was more controlled, and cities were much bigger.

Male [[circumcision]] had little to moderate effect in their simulations, but, given the geographical [[correlation]] found, the authors propose that it could have had an indirect role, either by increasing [[genital ulcer disease]] itself (it is known that [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]], and several other GUDs have higher incidences in uncircumcised men), or by permitting further spread of the HIV strain, after the first chains of sexual transmission permitted [[adaptation]] to the human organism.

One of the main advantages of this theory is stressed by the authors: "It [the theory] also offers a conceptual simplicity because it proposes as causal factors for SIV adaptation to humans and initial spread the very same factors that most promote the continued spread of HIV nowadays: promiscuous [sic] sex, particularly involving sex workers, GUD, and possibly lack of circumcision."&lt;ref name=Sousa2010/&gt;

==== Iatrogenic and other theories ====

[[Iatrogenic]] theories propose that medical interventions were responsible for HIV origins. By proposing factors that only appeared in Central and West Africa after the late 19th century, they seek to explain why all HIV groups also started after that.

The theories centred on the role of [[parenteral]] risks, such as unsterile injections, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s,&lt;ref name=Marx2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gisselquist2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pepin2008/&gt; or [[smallpox]] vaccinations&lt;ref name=Chitnis2000/&gt; are accepted as plausible by most scientists of the field.

[[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories]] include several iatrogenic theories, such as the [[OPV AIDS hypothesis|polio vaccine hypothesis]] which argues that the early [[Polio vaccine|oral polio vaccine]]s were contaminated with a chimpanzee virus, leading to the Central African outbreak.&lt;ref name= Lancet&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramsay S | year = 2001 | title = Cold water downstream from The River | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)04536-0/fulltext#article_upsell | journal = The Lancet | volume = 357 | issue = 9265| page = 1343 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04536-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathogenicity of SIV in non-human primates ==

In most non-human primate species, natural [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infection does not cause a fatal disease (but see below). Comparison of the gene sequence of SIV with HIV should, therefore, give us information about the factors necessary to cause disease in humans. The factors that determine the virulence of HIV as compared to most SIVs are only now being elucidated. Non-human SIVs contain a ''nef'' gene that down-regulates [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], and [[MHC class I]] expression; most non-human SIVs, therefore, do not induce immunodeficiency; the [[HIV-1]] ''nef'' gene, however, has lost its ability to down-regulate CD3, which results in the immune activation and apoptosis that is characteristic of chronic HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schindler M, Münch J, Kutsch O, Li H, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, Müller-Trutwin MC, Novembre FJ, Peeters M, Courgnaud V, Bailes E, Roques P, Sodora DL, Silvestri G, Sharp PM, Hahn BH, Kirchhoff F | title = Nef-mediated suppression of T cell activation was lost in a lentiviral lineage that gave rise to HIV-1 | journal = Cell | volume = 125 | issue = 6 | pages = 1055–67 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16777597 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.04.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a long-term survey of [[chimpanzee]]s naturally infected with SIVcpz in Gombe, [[Tanzania]] found that, contrary to the previous [[paradigm]], chimpanzees with SIVcpz infection do experience an increased mortality, and also suffer from a Human AIDS-like illness.&lt;ref name=Keele2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keele BF, Jones JH, Terio KA, Estes JD, Rudicell RS, Wilson ML, Li Y, Learn GH, Beasley TM, Schumacher-Stankey J, Wroblewski E, Mosser A, Raphael J, Kamenya S, Lonsdorf EV, Travis DA, Mlengeya T, Kinsel MJ, Else JG, Silvestri G, Goodall J, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Pusey AE, Hahn BH | title = Increased mortality and AIDS-like immunopathology in wild chimpanzees infected with SIVcpz | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7254 | pages = 515–19 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19626114 | pmc = 2872475 | doi = 10.1038/nature08200 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7254/full/nature08200.html | bibcode = 2009Natur.460..515K }}&lt;/ref&gt; SIV pathogenicity in wild animals could exist in other chimpanzee subspecies and other primate species as well, and stay unrecognized by lack of relevant long term studies.

{{Main|Timeline of early HIV/AIDS cases}}

===1959: David Carr===
David Carr was an apprentice printer (usually mistakenly referred to as a sailor; Carr had served in the Navy between 1955 and 1957) from Manchester, England who died August 31, 1959, and was for some time mistakenly reported to have died from AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (ADOIs). Following the failure of his immune system, he succumbed to pneumonia. Doctors, baffled by what he had died from, preserved 50 of his tissue samples for inspection. In 1990, the tissues were found to be HIV-positive. However, in 1992, a second test by AIDS researcher David Ho found that the strain of HIV present in the tissues was similar to those found in 1990 rather than an earlier strain (which would have mutated considerably over the course of 30 years). He concluded that the DNA samples provided actually came from a 1990 AIDS patient. Upon retesting David Carr's tissues, he found no sign of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How scientists discovered false evidence on the world's "first AIDS victim"|author=Steve Connor|date=March 24, 1995|work=The Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/how-scientists-discovered-false-evidence-on-the-worlds-first-aids-victim-1612471.html|accessdate=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earliest AIDS Case Is Called Into Doubt|author=Lawrence K.

He was incorrectly called "Patient Zero" because at least 40 of the 248 people known to be infected by HIV in 1983 had had sex with him, or with someone who had sexual intercourse with him.

Anna Thompson writes on the website TheBody.com in an article dated Autumn 1993: "Many women were dying in the late '70s of pneumonia, cervical cancer, and other illnesses complicated by "mysteriously" suppressed immune systems. Yet, it was not until 1981 that a case of AIDS in a woman was first reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)."&lt;ref name=Thompson_1&gt;{{cite web| title=After All That's Unsaid and Undone| author=Anna Thompson| url=http://www.thebody.com/content/art578.html| publisher=Remedy Health Media| date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continues: "The CDC's refusal to address women's issues led to the overall perception that women do not get AIDS."&lt;ref name=Thompson_1/&gt;

In an article published in "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism", author [[Douglas Crimp]] draws attention to anecdotal evidence about junkie pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Crimp_1&gt;{{cite web| title=How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic| author=Douglas Crimp| url=http://www.academia.edu/5756608/How_to_Have_Promiscuity_in_an_Epidemic| publisher=The MIT Press| page=249| date=October 1987| access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting: "Even these statistics are based on [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] [[epidemiology]] that continues to see the beginning of the epidemic as 1981 ... in spite of widespread anecdotal reporting of a high rate of deaths throughout the 1970s from what was known as "junkie pneumonia" and was likely Pneumocystis pneumonia."&lt;ref name=Crimp_1/&gt; The statistics Crimp writes about were taken from a [[New York Times]] article from October 1987 about a NYC Department of Health study that showed that 53% of AIDS sufferers were people who injected drugs - more than 150 percent higher than previously reported.&lt;ref name=Sullivan_1&gt;{{cite web| title=AIDS Deaths in New York Are Showing New Pattern| author=Ronald Sullivan| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/22/nyregion/aids-deaths-in-new-york-are-showing-new-pattern.html| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=22 October 1987| access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting: "City health officials estimated that half of the city's 200,000 intravenous drug users were infected with the virus that causes AIDS".&lt;ref name=Sullivan_1/&gt;

The study "HIV-1 Infection Among Intravenous Drug Users in Manhattan, New York City, from 1977 through 1987", published in February 1989, seeks to understand long term trends in the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users (IDUs).&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt; AIDS surveillance data and studies which detail the number of persons who tested HIV positive in Manhattan are used to compile information deemed critical to realising the extent of the AIDS epidemic. It starts by stating that up to September 1988, IDU was the risk behaviour in 19,139 (or 26.4%) of the first 72,223 cases of AIDS in the USA.&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt; Cases among IDUs in New York in the same period numbered 6,182 (approximately a third of national IDU cases). The study continues to outline the [[methodology]] used in the compilation of data. It says that while truly representative samples of IDUs within a community are probably impossible to obtain, samples of IDUs entering treatment provide a good source for monitoring trends. In the "RESULTS" section it states (quoting): "The first evidence for HIV-1 infection among IV drug users in New York is from three cases of AIDS in children born in 1977. These cases were later reported to the New York City Department of Health AIDS Surveillance Unit. These children did not receive any known [[Blood transfusion|transfusions]] prior to developing AIDS and were born to mothers known to be IV drug users."&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt;

It continues to outline that the earliest known case of AIDS in an adult IDU occurred in 1979 (mixed risk) and that known cases among IDUs increased rapidly from the 8 cases in 1980 (3 mixed risk), to 31 cases in 1981, to 160 cases in 1982, and to 340 cases in 1983.&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt; Statistics on the amount of positive tests for HIV, mainly using archived samples, are: 1978 1 out of 11; 1979 13/50; 1980 8/21; 1981-83 14/28; 1984 75/137 and 38/63; 1986 36/55 and 1987 169 out of 294.&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt; In the COMMENTS section, it states: "The three cases in 1977 of apparent [[Vertically transmitted infection|perinatal transmission]] (mother-to-child) from IV drug-using women strongly suggest that the introduction of HIV-1 into the IV drug-use group occurred around 1975 or 1976, or perhaps even earlier."&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt; It says that without extensive samples from this period, it is not possible to be certain about the spread of HIV among IDUs, but the samples from IDUs with chronic [[liver disease]] suggest that the rates of infection were below 20% for the first 3 or 4 years after its introduction.&lt;ref name=Jarlais_1/&gt;

===1981–1982: From GRID to AIDS===
The AIDS epidemic officially began on June 5, 1981, when the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in its ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]'' newsletter reported unusual clusters of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)]] caused by a form of [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis carinii'']] (now recognized as a distinct species [[Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)|''Pneumocystis jirovecii'']]) in five homosexual men in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=MMWR2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Pneumocystis pneumonia—Los Angeles | journal = MMWR Morb.

Over the next 18 months, more PCP clusters were discovered among otherwise healthy men in cities throughout the country, along with other opportunistic diseases (such as [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Update on Kaposi's sarcoma and opportunistic infections in previously healthy persons—United States | journal = MMWR Morb.

In June 1982, a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in [[Southern California]] suggested that a [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted]] [[infectious disease|infectious agent]] might be the [[etiology|etiological]] agent,&lt;ref name="MMWR Weekly, 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = A cluster of Kaposi's sarcoma and ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia among homosexual male residents of Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California | journal = MMWR Morb.

Health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not homosexual men. The same opportunistic infections were also reported among [[hemophiliacs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = ''Pneumocystis carinii'' pneumonia among persons with hemophilia A | journal = MMWR Morb.

By August 1982, the disease was being referred to by its new CDC-coined name: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marx JL | title = New disease baffles medical community | journal = Science | volume = 217 | issue = 4560 | pages = 618–21 | date = August 1982 | pmid = 7089584 | doi = 10.1126/science.7089584 | bibcode = 1982Sci...217..618M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism by AIDS patients and families==

In New York City, Nathan Fain, Larry Kramer, Larry Mass, Paul Popham, Paul Rapoport, and Edmund White officially established the [[Gay Men's Health Crisis|Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC)]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Gay Men's Health Crisis timeline"&gt;[http://www.gmhc.org/about-us/gmhchivaids-timeline GMHC/HIV/AIDS Timeline], Gay Men's Health Crisis, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4wkVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR23#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gay%20Men%E2%80%99s%20Health%20Crisis%20%22%20intitle%3Ahealth AIDS and Mental Health Practice: Clinical and Policy Issues], Edited by Michael Shernoff, MSW, New York, London: Routledge (Haworth Press), 1999.

Also in 1982, [[Michael Callen]] and [[Richard Berkowitz]] published ''[[How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach]].''  In this short work, they described ways gay men could be sexual and affectionate while dramatically reducing the risk of contracting or spreading HIV.  Both authors were themselves gay men living with AIDS.  This booklet was one of the first times men were advised to use condoms when having sexual relations with other men.&lt;ref name="1982 booklet by Callen and Berkowitz on safer sex"&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/surviving_and_thriving.html NLM Launches “Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture" - Traveling Banner Display and Online Exhibition], NIH, U.S. National Library of Medicine, Sept. 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of the virus==

===May 1983: LAV===
In May 1983, a team of doctors at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France including [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] and [[Luc Montagnier]] reported that they had isolated a new [[retrovirus]] from [[lymph node|lymphoid ganglions]] that they believed was the cause of AIDS.&lt;ref name=Barre/&gt; The virus was later named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) and a sample was sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which was later passed to the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).&lt;ref name=Barre&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barré-Sinoussi F, Chermann JC, Rey F, Nugeyre MT, Chamaret S, Gruest J, Dauguet C, Axler-Blin C, Vézinet-Brun F, Rouzioux C, Rozenbaum W, Montagnier L | title = Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 868–71 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6189183 | doi = 10.1126/science.6189183 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..868B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kingman, Sharon |author2=Connor, Steve |title=The search for the virus |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth [Eng.] |year=1989 |isbn=0-14-011397-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 1984: HTLV-III===
In May 1984 a team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States confirmed the discovery of the virus, but they renamed it human T lymphotropic virus type III ([[Human T-lymphotropic virus#HTLV-III and HTLV-IV|HTLV-III]]).&lt;ref name=Popovic&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popovic M, Sarngadharan MG, Read E, Gallo RC | title = Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS | journal = Science | volume = 224 | issue = 4648 | pages = 497–500 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6200935 | doi = 10.1126/science.6200935 | bibcode = 1984Sci...224..497P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===August 1984:  ARV===
Dr. Jay Levy's group at the University of California, San Francisco also played a role in the discovery of HIV. He independently isolated the AIDS virus in 1983 and named it the AIDS-associated Retrovirus (ARV), publishing his findings in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, J.A., et al., Isolation of lymphocytopathic retroviruses from San Francisco patients with AIDS.

===January 1985: both found to be the same===
In January 1985, a number of more-detailed reports were published concerning LAV and HTLV-III, and by March it was clear that the viruses were the same --- indeed, it was later determined that the virus isolated by the Gallo lab was from the lymph nodes of the patient studied in the original 1983 report by Montagnier&lt;ref name="newscientist2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14881-was-robert-gallo-robbed-of-the-nobel-prize/|title=Was Robert Gallo robbed of the Nobel prize?|last=Coghlan|first=Andy|date=7 October 2008|work=The New Scientist|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; --- and was the etiological agent of AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marx JL | title = A virus by any other name . . | journal = Science | volume = 227 | issue = 4693 | pages = 1449–51 | date = March 1985 | pmid = 2983427 | doi = 10.1126/science.2983427 | bibcode = 1985Sci...227.1449M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang SY, Bowman BH, Weiss JB, Garcia RE, White TJ | title = The origin of HIV-1 isolate HTLV-IIIB | journal = Nature | volume = 363 | issue = 6428 | pages = 466–9 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8502298 | doi = 10.1038/363466a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v363/n6428/abs/363466a0.html | bibcode = 1993Natur.363..466C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===May 1986: the name HIV===
In May 1986, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] ruled that both names should be dropped and a new name, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coffin J, Haase A, Levy JA, Montagnier L, Oroszlan S, Teich N, Temin H, Toyoshima K, Varmus H, Vogt P | title = What to call the AIDS virus? | journal = Nature | volume = 321 | issue = 6065 | page = 10 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3010128 | doi = 10.1038/321010a0 | bibcode = 1986Natur.321...10. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nobel===
Whether Gallo or Montagnier deserve more credit for the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS has been a matter of [[Robert Gallo#HIV/AIDS research and subsequent controversy|considerable controversy]].  Together with his colleague [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]], Montagnier was awarded one half of the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his "discovery of human immunodeficiency virus".&lt;ref name="Nobel_2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/index.html | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008 | accessdate=October 28, 2009 | publisher=Nobel Foundation
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Harald zur Hausen]] also shared the prize for his discovery that [[human papilloma virus]] leads to [[cervical cancer]], but Gallo was left out.&lt;ref name="science nobel"/&gt; Gallo said that it was "a disappointment" that he was not named a co-recipient.&lt;ref name="nytimes-nobel"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = New York Times | date = 2008-10-06 | accessdate = 2008-10-06 | last = Altman | first = Lawrence | title = Three Europeans Win the 2008 Nobel for Medicine | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/health/07nobel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montagnier said he was "surprised" Gallo was not recognized by the Nobel Committee: "It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that.

==Case definition for epidemiological surveillance==
Since June 5, 1981, many definitions have been developed for [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] surveillance such as the [[1985 World Health Organization AIDS surveillance case definition|Bangui definition]] and the [[1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition]].

==Genetic studies==
{{Further|Simian immunodeficiency virus#History}}
According to a study published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] in 2008, a team led by Robert Shafer at [[Stanford University School of Medicine]] has discovered that the [[gray mouse lemur]] has an [[endogenous]] [[lentivirus]] (the genus to which HIV belongs) in its genetic makeup. This suggests that lentiviruses have existed for at least 14 million years, much longer than the currently known existence of HIV. In addition, the time frame falls in the period when Madagascar was still connected to what is now the African continent; the said lemurs later developed immunity to the virus strain and [[Middle Miocene disruption|survived an era]] when the lentivirus was widespread among other [[mammal]]s. The study is being hailed as crucial, because it fills the blanks in the origin of the virus, as well as in its evolution, and may be important in the development of new antiviral drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gifford RJ, Katzourakis A, Tristem M, Pybus OG, Winters M, Shafer RW | title = A transitional endogenous lentivirus from the genome of a basal primate and implications for lentivirus evolution | journal = Proc.

In 2010, researchers reported that [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] had infected monkeys in [[Bioko]] for at least 32,000 years.

A 2016 Czech study of the genome of [[Malayan flying lemur]]s, an order of mammals parallel to primates and sharing an immediate common ancestor with them, found endogenous lentiviruses that emerged an estimated 40-60 million years ago based on rates of viral mutation versus modern lentiviruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elleder|first1=et.al.|title=Life history of the oldest lentivirus: characterization of ELVgv integrations in the dermopteran genome|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=2016|volume=33|issue=10|pages=2659–2669|doi=10.1093/molbev/msw149|pmid=27507840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discredited hypotheses==
{{main|Discredited AIDS origins theories}}

Other hypotheses for the origin of AIDS have been proposed. [[AIDS denialism]] argues that HIV or AIDS does not exist or that AIDS is not caused by HIV; some of its proponents believe that AIDS is caused by lifestyle, including sexuality or drug use, and not by HIV. Some conspiracy theories allege that HIV was created in a bioweapons laboratory, perhaps as an agent of [[genocide]] or an accident. These hypotheses have been rejected by [[scientific consensus]]; it is generally accepted among pathologists that "…the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/771|title=Confronting AIDS: Update 1988|last=Medicine|first=Institute of|date=1969-12-31|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780309038799|location=|pages=2|language=en|doi=10.17226/771|quote="... the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most "scientific" arguments for denialism are based on misrepresentations of outdated data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/hivaids|title=HIV/AIDS {{!}} NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|website=www.niaid.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-04-01|year=|title=Denying science|url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v12/n4/full/nm0406-369.html|journal=Nature Medicine|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=369–369|doi=10.1038/nm0406-369|issn=1078-8956|quote=To support their ideas, some AIDS denialists have also misappropriated a scientific review in Nature Medicine which opens with this reasonable statement: "Despite considerable advances in HIV science in the past 20 years, the reason why HIV-1 infection is pathogenic is still debated."|via=|pmid=16598265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hugo Danner''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of [[Philip Wylie]]'s 1930 [[Genre fiction|novel]] ''[[Gladiator (novel)|Gladiator]]''. Born in the late 19th century with [[superhuman]] abilities via [[prenatal]] chemical experimentation, Danner tries to use his powers for good, making him a precursor of the [[superhero]].&lt;ref name=spiderman&gt;{{cite web | author = Lalumière, Claude  | title=Classic Science Fiction Reviews: ''Gladiator'' |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue372/classic.html | publisher = Scifi.com | accessdate=2007-09-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212046/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue372/classic.html |archivedate = October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Danner grows disillusioned with his inability to find a permanent outlet for his great strength, and dies frustrated.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, Philip. ''Gladiator''. New York: Shakespeare House, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Wylie's novel, the character has also appeared in a [[feature film]] and publications by [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. Comedic actor [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] portrayed him in a 1938 movie adaptation of the book.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web | author = | title=The Gladiator (1938) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030186/| publisher = The Internet Movie Database | accessdate=2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later the character starred in an adaptation titled "Man-God" in Marvel's black-and-white [[comics]]-[[magazine]] ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #9 (Winter 1976). He next appeared in DC's standard color [[comic book]] ''[[Young All-Stars]]'' in 1988 and 1989, as the estranged father of an illegitimate son named [[Iron Munro]]. In 2005, he returned in the comic-book [[miniseries]] ''[[Legend (comics)|Legend]]'', published by the DC [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Wildstorm]]. Here Danner, in the late 1960s, fights as a [[U.S. Army]] [[supersoldier]] in the [[Vietnam War]] rather than as a super [[French Foreign Legion|Legionnaire]] in [[World War I]].

== Publication history ==

=== Creation ===
In early February 1930, Wylie described the inspiration for Danner's creation in the introduction to one of the earliest printings of ''Gladiator'':
{{quote|text=A temperamental consciousness of material force brought Hugo Danner into being. The frustration of my own muscles by things, and the alarming superiority of machinery started the notion of a man who would be invincible. I gave him a name and planned random deeds for him. I let him tear down Brooklyn Bridge and lift a locomotive. Then I began to speculate about his future and it seemed to me that a human being thus equipped would be foredoomed to vulgar fame or to a life of fruitless destruction. He would share the isolation of geniuses and with them would learn the inflexibility of man's slow evolution. To that extent Hugo became symbolic and Gladiator a satire. The rest was adventure and perhaps more of the book derives from the unliterary excitement of imagining such a life than from a studious juxtaposition of incidents to a theme"&lt;ref name=wp&gt;Wylie, Philip. "Gladiator". ''The Book League Monthly'' vol. III, no. 5 (March 1930)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Development ===
The novel begins during the closing years of the 19th century, as [[Colorado]] science Professor Abednego Danner searches for a way to  [[Eugenics|improve the innate weaknesses]] of human biology and create a new "race that doesn't know fear — because it cannot know harm".&lt;ref name=w16&gt;Wylie: pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; After 14 years of research he finally discovers "[[Radical (chemistry)|alkaline radicals]]" that vastly improve "muscular strength and the nervous [[Oxidative phosphorylation|discharge of energy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Following very successful animal testing, which yields super-strong tadpoles and a [[bulletproof]] kitten capable of taking down cattle as prey, he injects this super-serum into the womb of his pregnant wife, Matilda. Hugo Danner is born on Christmas several months later.

His parents imbue him with a strong moral compass during his formative years and warn him never to use his great strength in anger. However, during kindergarten, Danner nearly kills the school's bully in a one-sided fight after being assaulted by the child. This event brands him as an outsider in the eyes of the other children. Because they treat him with such abhorrence, his only solace comes in the form of unleashing his powers within the Colorado wilderness (uprooting trees, throwing huge boulders, leaping to the mountain tops, etc.). This stigma eventually wears off, though, and is forgotten by the time Danner enters high school.

Danner leaves Colorado after graduating high school to attend Webster University. There, he becomes an unstoppable football star and the most popular boy in school. During the summer months, he works as a circus [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strong man]] and even enters a fight competition for money. However, after returning to college and accidentally killing another player during a game, he quits school and becomes a sailor. A year later, his ship is trapped in France by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.

He and a fellow American sign up with the [[French Foreign Legion]] and find themselves on the battlements after a short training period. He eventually reveals his powers to his Legionnaire superiors, who believe him to be a devil or supernatural [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and he is given free rein to roam the battlefield and kill as many German soldiers as he possibly can. Stories of "Le Colorado" (The Colorado) quickly spread from trench to trench and Danner becomes a sort of mythical hero. After a short stint in an American Legionnaire unit, Danner grows weary of war and devises a plan with an airplane:

{{quote|text=He would drive it far into Germany. When its petrol failed, he would crash it. Stepping from the ruins, he would hasten on in the darkness, on, on, like [[Pheidippides]], till he reached the centre of the enemy government. There, crashing through the petty human barriers, he would perform his last feat, strangling the Emperor, slaying the generals, pulling buildings apart with his Samsonian arms, and disrupting the control of the war.&lt;ref name=w120&gt;Wylie: pg. 120&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] is signed the very day he prepares to leave, and so he is forced to abort his mission, much to his dismay. He returns to the United States and works in a number of professions — steel mill worker, bank teller, farm hand, and [[disarmament]] [[lobbyist]] — but his unique stature among mortal men forever brings him grief. He eventually offers his services to a noted history professor preparing a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] archaeological dig and travels with the group to the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].

During the trip, Danner wonders if the Mayans and [[Egyptians]] had discovered the same formula as his father, "which could be poured into the veins of the slaves [who built the pyramids], making them stronger than engines".&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; There, he works as the head steward of the hired Mayan helpers and proves himself an asset to the team. But when a mishap reveals his great strength to the professor, the elderly man suggests Danner use his father's formula to create a new race of men known as the "Sons of Dawn",&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; who will use their powers to right the world's wrongs. The idea appeals to him at first, but Danner fears that these sons would also be hated by humanity for their superiority and treated much the same as himself. In the end, he climbs a mountain amidst an oncoming thunderstorm, and is struck dead by lightning while praying to God. The formula is lost in the resulting fire. The professor discovers his charred remains three days later and buries him among the Mayan ruins.

== Powers and abilities ==
Even during his early years, Danner displays [[superhuman strength]].  He demolishes his wooden crib as a [[newborn]],&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; saves a man's life by lifting a two-ton supply wagon at 6 years old,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and uproots entire trees at 10.&lt;ref name=w28&gt;Wylie: pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He progressively grows stronger as he gets older. During his twenties, he can stop and kill a charging bull with a single punch,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; bend a railroad rail,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt; lift a [[75 mm gun (US)#75 mm howitzer|seventy-five millimeter howitzer cannon]] singlehandedly,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 102&amp;ndash;103&lt;/ref&gt; lift a car and its driver singlehandedly,&lt;ref name="Wylie: pg 141"&gt;Wylie: pg. 141&lt;/ref&gt; rip open a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} bank vault,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt; and easily catch a falling 8,000-pound block of stone.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Danner's physical strength extends to his legs, allowing him to leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 feet into the air and run faster than a train.&lt;ref name=w28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world [[track and field|track]] record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 40&amp;ndash;41&lt;/ref&gt; While in the service of the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[World War I]], he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148&amp;nbsp;mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 99&amp;ndash;100&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.

He first learns of his body's superior resistance to physical injury during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Bullets and [[bayonets]] glance off his tough skin.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 100 and 108&amp;ndash;109&lt;/ref&gt; He believes he can even survive a plane crash.&lt;ref name=w120/&gt; The only weaponry capable of penetrating his skin at the time are the largest artillery shells.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 101 and 108&lt;/ref&gt; Although, he still feels the effects of the elements, sweating under the heat of the sun and freezing during winter. Danner's only vulnerability is [[lightning]], which ultimately kills him.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Danner's bodily tissues have a somewhat greater density than those of an ordinary human being. Though he has an athletic build, his strength is far greater than what his frame would naturally allow. People guess him to be 155 pounds, but he actually weighs 211.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 43&lt;/ref&gt; During his stint as a sailor, he goes [[pearl diving]] with the natives of [[Cristóbal, Colón|Cristobal]] and is able to dive deeper and stay under longer because of his density.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

His body can heal damaged tissue much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human can. He collapses from exhaustion and wounds sustained from artillery shells after he goes berserk against the Germans to avenge a friend's death. When he wakes up in an army hospital, he finds "his wounds had healed without the necessity of a single stitch".&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Long periods of comatose sleep (up to 20 hours) and the consuming of huge meals also aid in his regenerative process.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 26 and 100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Danner was portrayed by comedic actor [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] in the 1938 film ''[[The Gladiator (1938 film)|The Gladiator]]'', which loosely adapted science-fiction [[drama]] as a [[comedy]], and, among the many changes, renamed the [[protagonist]] "Hugo Kipp". The film begins when Kipp wins a large sum of money in a contest and decides to return to college. There, he is talked into joining the [[American football|football]] team and fails to live up to his athletic father's legendary reputation. But after a Professor Danner ([[Lucien Littlefield]]) injects Kipp with a serum that gives him superhuman strength, he becomes an unstoppable player and wins the heart of the self-centered [[quarterback]]'s girlfriend ([[June Travis]]). In the end, he faces [[Man Mountain Dean]] in a wrestling match, but the serum runs out at the last minute.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

=== Comics ===
[[File:Man-God.jpg|alt=Muscular man, wearing pants and boots, stands with legs wide while a woman lies on the floor between them. She holds her arm up, as if to protect herself.|thumb|left|upright|''Marvel Preview'' #9 (Winter 1976). Cover art by [[Earl Norem]]]]
In comics, Danner [[first appeared]] in the 52-page story "Man-God", by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[Tony DeZuniga]] (credited as Antony DeZuniga) in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #9 (Winter 1976). Only the first half of the novel is adapted.

Danner next appeared in [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Young All-Stars]]'' #9-11 (Feb.-April 1988) and #28-31 (Aug.-Nov. 1989), as the estranged father of [[Iron Munro]], his illegitimate son. Munro was not a character or even a possibility in the original novel, where, as Danner's ailing scientist father explained, "the effect of the process is not inherited by the future generations. It must be done over each time".&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In this storyline, Munro comes into possession of his father’s diary and learns of Danner's troubled life as the 20th century’s first [[metahuman]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Young All-Stars]]'' # 9&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt; After having read the diary, Munro turns to the government's secret Project M, demanding to know the location of the "[[Dinosaur Island]]" mentioned by Danner. There he meets a person who leads him instead to Maple White Land in South America. Munro is surprised when he finds his father is alive. Danner apparently faked his death in the Yucatan and briefly returned home to have a one-night stand with his former high school sweetheart Anna Blake. The resulting union bore Munro, who took his surname from his mother's new husband (who believed the child to be his own).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Young All-Stars]]'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; Danner has, by this time, succeeded in rearing the first generation of the Sons of Dawn. He later reveals to the Young-All Stars that the villain [[Axis Amerika|Übermensch]] has stolen the formula in order to create his own race of supermen.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Young All-Stars]]'' #29 (Sept. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Munro is forced to oppose his father when Danner orders the Sons of Dawn to attack a Brazilian city.&lt;ref&gt;'Young All-Stars'' #30 (Oct. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The combined might of the All-Star Squadron defeats the Sons of Dawn and Danner is killed during the final battle.&lt;ref&gt;''Young All-Stars'' #31 (Nov. 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Danner starred in the four-issue [[miniseries]] ''[[Legend (comics)|Legend]]'' (April–July 2005) by writer [[Howard Chaykin]] and artist [[Russ Heath]], published by the DC imprint [[Wildstorm]].&lt;ref name=legend&gt;{{cite web | author = | title= Legend|url= http://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=11066 | publisher =The Comic Book Database | accessdate=2007-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cover blurbs on the first two issues read, "Inspired by Philip Wylie's Novel ''Gladiator''". The story now takes place in the second half of the 20th century, with the [[Vietnam War]] replacing [[World War I]], but the story remaining for the most part intact.

== Comparison with later heroes ==
No confirmation exists that [[Superman]] co-creator [[Jerry Siegel]] was influenced by ''Gladiator''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cracked.com/article_17299_6-famous-characters-you-didnt-know-were-shameless-rip-offs.html 6 Famous Characters You Didn't Know Were Shameless Rip Offs]&lt;/ref&gt; He and co-creator [[Joe Shuster]] began developing Superman in 1934.

Superman as originally conceived came from an unnamed planet whose inhabitants were millions of years more evolved than humans. When they reached maturity, "the people of his race became gifted with titanic strength".&lt;ref name=a1&gt;''Action  Comics'' #1 (June 1938)&lt;/ref&gt; Their advanced evolution and great strength accounted for Superman's superhuman abilities on earth. As Siegel described them: "When maturity was reached, he discovered he could easily: leap {{Fraction|1|8}}&lt;small&gt;th&lt;/small&gt; of a mile; hurdle a twenty-story building...raise tremendous weights...run faster than an express train...and that nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his skin!"&lt;ref name=a1/&gt;

Siegel and Shuster compared Superman's strength and leaping abilities to those of an [[ant]] and a [[grasshopper]], respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]] | Artist =[[Joe Shuster|Shuster, Joe]] | Story = A Scientific Explanation of Superman's Amazing Strength--! | Title = Superman | Issue = 1 | Date = Summer 1939 | Publisher = [[National Periodical Publications]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did Abednego for his son.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 4 and 29&lt;/ref&gt; Danner also claims descent from a far-off land (Colorado) inhabited by a race of super-strong, indestructible men. In order to keep his true "experimental" origins a secret, he tells his [[French Foreign Legion|Legionnaire]] superiors, "[Colorado is a] place in America. A place that has scarcely been explored. I was born there. All the men of Colorado are born as I was born and are like me. We are very strong. We are great fighters. We cannot be wounded except by the largest shells."&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pg. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of similarities include both of their biological fathers are scientists ([[Jor-El]] and Abednego), both grow up in rural settings ([[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] and Indian Creek, Colorado), both are imbued with a strong moral compass from a young age&lt;ref&gt;Wylie: pp. 90&amp;ndash;121&lt;/ref&gt; both lift cars over their heads,&lt;ref name="Wylie: pg 141"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Action Comics #1, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and both hide their powers from the world.

One critic noted that Danner's "creation and upbringing by a scientist father recall [[Doc Savage]]'s origins" and a "prototype for the famous scene in which the fledgling Spider-Man defeats a hulking wrestler to make money is found in Wylie's novel; Hugo's bout in the ring is similar to that in the [[Spider-Man]]'s origin story in 1962's ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15."&lt;ref name=spiderman /&gt;

[[File:Erect penis measurement.png|thumb|Diagram showing how to measure the length and circumference of an erect human penis]]

The most accurate measurement of the size of a [[human penis]] can be derived from several readings at different times since there is natural minor variability in size depending upon arousal level, time of day, room temperature, frequency of sexual activity, and reliability of measurement. When compared to other primates, including large examples such as the gorilla, the human penis is thickest, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body.

Measurements vary, with studies that rely on self-measurement reporting a significantly higher average than those with a health professional measuring. {{As of|2015}}, a [[systematic review]] of 15,521 men, and the best research to date on the topic, as the subjects were measured by health professionals, rather than self-measured, has concluded that the average length of an [[Erection|erect]] human penis is 13.12&amp;nbsp;cm (5.17 inches) long, while the average circumference of an erect human penis is 11.66&amp;nbsp;cm (4.59 inches).&lt;ref name=veale2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/bju.13010 |pmid=25487360 |title=Am I normal? A systematic review and construction of nomograms for flaccid and erect penis length and circumference in up to 15 521 men |journal=BJU International |volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=978–986 |year=2015 |last1=Veale |first1=David |last2=Miles |first2=Sarah |last3=Bramley |first3=Sally |last4=Muir |first4=Gordon |last5=Hodsoll |first5=John }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flaccid penis length can sometimes be a poor predictor of erect length.

Most human penis growth occurs between infancy and the age of five, and between about one year after the onset of [[puberty]] and, at latest, approximately 17 years of age.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Ch. 1. Adolescent Growth and Development|url=http://www.epi.umn.edu/let/pubs/img/adol_ch1.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=26 November 2012|author1=Stang, Jamie  |author2=Story, Mary|page=3|editor=Stang J, Story M |title= Guidelines for Adolescent Nutrition Services |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statistically significant correlation between penis size and the size of other body parts has not been found in research. Some environmental factors in addition to genetics, such as the presence of [[endocrine disruptor]]s, can affect penis growth. An adult penis with an erect length of less than {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}}, but otherwise formed normally, is referred to in medicine as a [[micropenis]].

==Studies==

[[File:Human penis sizes girth only.svg|thumb|Distribution of penis sizes by circumference. Erect penises (green) are 81% between 10 and 13 cm in circumference.&lt;ref name=veale2015/&gt;]]

While results vary slightly across reputable studies, the consensus is that the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] human penis, when erect, is in the range {{convert|12.9|–|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=pmid8709382&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(01)65682-9 |pmid=8709382 |title=Penile Length in the Flaccid and Erect States: Guidelines for Penile Augmentation |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=156 |issue=3 |pages=995–7 |year=1996 |last1=Wessells |first1=Hunter |last2=Lue |first2=Tom F |last3=McAninch |first3=Jack W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11416836&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3900627 |pmid=11416836 |title=Predicting penile size during erection |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=328–33 |year=2001 |last1=Chen |first1=J |last2=Gefen |first2=A |last3=Greenstein |first3=A |last4=Matzkin |first4=H |last5=Elad |first5=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lifestyles_condoms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esvc000171.wic049u.server-web.com/education/research.htm|title=ANSELL RESEARCH – The Penis Size Survey|accessdate=2006-07-13|date=March 2001|publisher=[[Ansell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 [[systematic review]] published by Veale et al. of medical research on the topic over the previous 30 years published in ''BJU International'' showed similar results, giving mean flaccid, stretched non-erect, and erect lengths of 9.16&amp;nbsp;cm, 13.24&amp;nbsp;cm, and 13.12&amp;nbsp;cm respectively, and mean flaccid and erect circumferences of 9.31&amp;nbsp;cm and 11.66&amp;nbsp;cm respectively. Erect lengths in the included studies were measured by pushing the pre-pubic fat pad to the bone, and flaccid or erect girth (circumference) was measured at the base or mid-shaft of the penis.&lt;ref name=veale2015/&gt;

===Length===

====Flaccid====
One study found the mean flaccid penis length to be {{convert|3.5|in|cm}} (measured by staff).&lt;ref name=pmid8709382/&gt; A review of several studies found average flaccid length to be {{convert|9|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=pmid17355371/&gt; Length of the flaccid penis does not necessarily correspond to length of the erect penis; some smaller flaccid penises grow much longer, while some larger flaccid penises grow comparatively less.&lt;ref name=kinsey /&gt;

The penis and scrotum can contract involuntarily in reaction to cold temperatures or nervousness, referred to by the slang term "shrinkage", due to action by the [[cremaster muscle]]. The same phenomenon affects cyclist and exercise bike users, with prolonged pressure on the [[perineum]] from the [[bicycle saddle]] and the straining of the exercise causing the penis and scrotum to contract involuntarily. An incorrect saddle may ultimately cause [[erectile dysfunction]] (see [[bicycle saddle#Crotch pressure|crotch pressure]] for more information).

====Stretched====
Neither age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicted erectile length. Stretched length has correlated with erect length in some cases.&lt;ref name=pmid8709382/&gt; However, studies have also shown drastic differences between stretched and erect length.&lt;ref name="Promodu 558–563"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901569 |pmid=17568760 |title=Penile length and circumference: An Indian study |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=558–563 |year=2007 |last1=Promodu |first1=K |last2=Shanmughadas |first2=K V |last3=Bhat |first3=S |last4=Nair |first4=K R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2015 study of 15,521 men, found that the average length of a stretched flaccid penis was 13.24&amp;nbsp;cm (5.21 inches) long, which is near identical to the average length of an erect human penis which is 13.12&amp;nbsp;cm (5.17 inches) long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2015/03/03/is_your_penis_normal_theres_a_chart_for_that_109106.html|title=Is Your Penis Normal? There's a Chart for That - RealClearScience|website=realclearscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An Italian study of about 3,300 men published in ''[[European Urology]]'' concluded that flaccid stretched length was measured on average to about {{cvt|12.5|cm|in}}. In addition, they checked for correlations in a random subset of the sample consisting of 325 men. They found a few statistically significant [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient|Spearman's correlations]]: between flaccid length and height of 0.208, −0.140 with weight, and −0.238 with BMI, flaccid circumference and height 0.156, stretched length and height 0.221, weight −0.136, BMI −0.169. They also reported a few non-significant correlations.&lt;ref name=pmid11223678&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000052434 |pmid=11223678 |title=Penile Length and Circumference: A Study on 3,300 Young Italian Males |journal=European Urology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=183–6 |year=2001 |last1=Ponchietti |first1=Roberto |last2=Mondaini |first2=Nicola |last3=Bonaf&amp;Egrave |first3=Massimiliano |last4=Di Loro |first4=Filippo |last5=Biscioni |first5=Stefano |last6=Masieri |first6=Lorenzo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Erect====
Scientific studies have been performed on the [[erection|erect]] length of the adult penis. Studies that have relied on self-measurement, including those from Internet surveys, consistently reported a higher average length than those that used medical or scientific methods to obtain measurements.&lt;ref name="lifestyles_condoms"/&gt;&lt;ref name=average&gt;{{cite web |first= Paul| last= Aitken| website= altpenis.com| url= http://www.altpenis.com/news/average_size.shtml |title=What's Average?|accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following staff-measured studies are composed of different subgroups of the human population (in other words, specific age range or race; selection of those with sexual medical concerns or [[self-selection bias|self-selection]]) that could cause a [[sampling bias|sample bias]].&lt;ref name= "average" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title= Biased sample| url= https://www.bja.gov/evaluation/glossary/glossary_b.htm| work= Glossary| via= BJA.gov| quote= A sample that is not representative of the population to which generalizations are to be made.

*In a study of 80 healthy males published in the September 1996 ''[[Journal of Urology]]'' an average erect penis length of {{cvt|12.9|cm}} was measured.&lt;ref name=pmid8709382/&gt; The purpose of the study was to "provide guidelines of penile length and circumference to assist in counseling patients considering penile augmentation." Erection was pharmacologically induced in 80 physically normal American men (varying ethnicity, average age 54). It was concluded: "Neither patient age nor size of the flaccid penis accurately predicted erectile length."
*A study published in the December 2000 ''[[International Journal of Impotence Research]]'' found that average erect penis length in 50 Jewish Caucasian males was {{cvt|13.6|cm}} (measured by staff).&lt;ref name=pmid11416836/&gt; The study intended "to identify clinical and engineering parameters of the flaccid penis for prediction of penile size during erection."&lt;ref name=pmid11416836/&gt; Erection was pharmacologically induced in 50 Jewish Caucasian patients who had been evaluated for [[erectile dysfunction]] (average age 47±14y). Patients with penis abnormalities or whose ED could be attributed to more than one psychological origin were omitted from the study.
*A review published in the 2007 issue of ''[[BJU International]]'' showed the average erect penis length to be {{convert|14|–|16|cm|in|abbr=on}} and girth to be {{convert|12|–|13|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The paper compared results of twelve studies conducted on different populations in several countries. Various methods of measurements were included in the review.&lt;ref name=pmid17355371/&gt;
*An [[India]]n study of 500 men ages 18 to 60 published in the ''International Journal of Impotence Research'' found flaccid, stretched and erect length to be {{cvt|8.21|cm}}, {{cvt|10.88|cm}} and {{cvt|13.01|cm}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="Promodu 558–563"/&gt;
*A [[Korea]]n study (published in 1970) of 702 men ages 21 to 31 identified the average erect penile length to be {{cvt|12.70|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| via= KoreaMed.org| url= https://www.koreamed.org/SearchBasic.php?DT=1&amp;RID=1020KJU%2F1971.12.4.401| title= A Study on the Penile Size of Korea men| last= |date= December 1971 | volume= 12| number= 4| pages= 401–404| publisher= | access-date= 26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study (from 1998) of 150 Koreans found the average erect penile length to be {{cvt|13.42|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| via= KoreaMed.org| url= https://koreamed.org/SearchBasic.php?RID=1020KJU/1998.39.11.1061&amp;DT=1| work= Korean J Urol.| date= November 1998 | volume= 39| number= 11| pages= 1061–1064| title= The Relationship between Height and Body Weight and Penile Size in University Students| last1= Yoon |first1= JS| last2= Lee |first2= GH| last3=  Chang |first3= DS | publisher= | access-date= 26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third study (published in 1999) of 279 Korean males found the average erect penile length to be {{cvt|12.66|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=559088970406446;res=IELHEA | title= Erect penile size of Korean men| work= Venereology |volume= 12 |number= 4 |year= 1999| last1= Choi| first1= SU| last2= Park| first2= SH| last3= Lee| first3= BS| last4= Han| first4= JH| via= informit.com.au| publisher= | access-date= 26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erect circumference===
Similar results exist regarding studies of the [[circumference]] of the adult fully [[erection|erect]] penis, with the measurement usually taken mid-shaft.&lt;ref name=pmid17355371/&gt; As with length, studies that relied on self-measurement consistently reported a significantly higher average than those with staff measuring. In a study of penis size where measurements were taken in a laboratory setting, the average penis circumference when erect was 11.66&amp;nbsp;cm (4.59 inches).&lt;ref name=veale2015/&gt;

===Size at birth===
The average stretched penile length at birth is about {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and 90% of newborn boys will be between {{convert|2.4|and|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Limited growth of the penis occurs between birth and 5 years of age, but very little occurs between 5 years and the onset of [[puberty]]. The average size at the beginning of puberty is {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} with adult size reached about 5 years later. W.A. Schonfeld published a penis growth curve in 1943.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1943.02010160019003 |title=Primary and Secondary Sexual Characteristics |journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=535 |year=1943 |last1=Schonfeld |first1=William A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size with ageing===
Authors of a paper reviewing research on area of penis sizes conclude that "flaccid penile length is just under {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} at birth and changes very little until puberty, when there is marked growth."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid17355371&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2007.06806.x |pmid=17355371 |title=Penile size and the ?small penis syndrome? |journal=BJU International |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=1449–55 |year=2007 |last1=Wylie |first1=Kevan R |last2=Eardley |first2=Ian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age is not believed to negatively correlate with penis size. "Individual research studies have... suggested that penis size is smaller in studies focusing on older men, but Wylie and Eardley found no overall differences when they collated the results of various studies [over a 60 year period]."&lt;ref name=pmid17355371/&gt;

===Size and height===
A 2015 review of the literature found two studies finding height and stretched or flaccid length to be moderately correlated, seven studies finding weak correlation for flaccid, stretched, or erect length, and two studies that found no correlation between flaccid length and height.&lt;ref name="veale2015" /&gt;

===Size and race===
The belief that penis size varies according to race is not supported by scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=pmid17355371/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/4489-penis-myths-debunked.html|title=Penis Myths Debunked|work=Live Science|access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study reported that "there is no scientific background to support the alleged 'oversized' penis in black people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05238.x |pmid=15638885 |title=Idiopathic short penis: Myth or reality? |journal=BJU International |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=8–9 |year=2005 |last1=Mondaini |first1=Nicola |last2=Gontero |first2=Paolo }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, a study of 253 men from [[Tanzania]] found that the average stretched flaccid penis length of Tanzanian males is 11&amp;nbsp;cm (4.53 inches) long, smaller than the worldwide average, stretched flaccid penis length of 13.24&amp;nbsp;cm (5.21 inches), and average erect penis length of 13.12&amp;nbsp;cm (5.17 inches).&lt;ref name=pmid23473900&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2013.02.3200 |pmid=23473900 |title=Penile Measurements in Tanzanian Males: Guiding Circumcision Device Design and Supply Forecasting |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=190 |issue=2 |pages=544–50 |year=2013 |last1=Chrouser |first1=Kristin |last2=Bazant |first2=Eva |last3=Jin |first3=Linda |last4=Kileo |first4=Baldwin |last5=Plotkin |first5=Marya |last6=Adamu |first6=Tigistu |last7=Curran |first7=Kelly |last8=Koshuma |first8=Sifuni }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of 115 men from [[Nigeria]] found that the average flaccid stretched penis length of Nigerian males is 13.37&amp;nbsp;cm (5.26 inches) long, which is near identical to the worldwide average, stretched flaccid penis length of 13.24&amp;nbsp;cm (5.21 inches) and average erect penis length of 13.12&amp;nbsp;cm (5.17 inches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17191423 |year=2006 |last1=Orakwe |first1=J.

U }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 systematic review found that it was not possible to draw any conclusions about size and race from the available literature and that further research needed to be conducted.&lt;ref name="veale2015" /&gt;

==Biochemistry==
[[Androgen]]s like [[testosterone]] are responsible for penis enlargement and elongation during puberty.&lt;ref name="RosenthalBurchum2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Laura Rosenthal|author2=Jacqueline Burchum|title=Lehne's Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice Providers - E-Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfYoDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA551|date=17 February 2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-44779-9|pages=551–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penis size is positively correlated with increasing testosterone levels during puberty.&lt;ref name="NieschlagBehre2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eberhard Nieschlag|author2=Hermann Behre|title=Andrology: Male Reproductive Health and Dysfunction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05fsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-04491-9|pages=54–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after puberty, administration of testosterone is not capable of affecting penis size, and androgen deficiency in adult men only results in a small decrease in size.&lt;ref name="NieschlagBehre2013" /&gt; [[Growth hormone]] (GH) and [[insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) are also involved in penis size, with deficiency (such as that observed in [[growth hormone deficiency]] or [[Laron syndrome]]) at critical developmental stages having the potential to result in micropenis.&lt;ref name="PorstBuvat2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hartmut Porst|author2=Jacques Buvat|title=Standard Practice in Sexual Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4GJio79XOUC&amp;pg=PA263|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-7872-3|pages=263–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variance==

===Genetics===
There are certain genes, like [[homeobox]] (Hox a and d) genes, which may have a role in regulating penis size. In humans, the [[AR (gene)|AR gene]] located on the [[X chromosome]] at Xq11-12 which may determine the penis size. The [[SRY gene]] located on the [[Y chromosome]] may have a role to play. Variance in size can often be attributed to [[De novo mutations|''de novo'' mutations]]. Deficiency of [[pituitary growth hormone]] or [[gonadotropins]] or mild degrees of androgen insensitivity can cause small penis size in males and can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood.

===Conditions===
{{Main|Micropenis}}
An adult penis with an erect length of less than 7&amp;nbsp;cm or 2.76&amp;nbsp;inches but otherwise formed normally is referred to in a medical context as having the [[micropenis]] condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/12/041206205001.htm|title=Surgeons Pinch More Than An Inch From The Arm To Rebuild A Micropenis|accessdate=2007-07-25|date=7 December 2004}} "Whereas the average size of the human penis is around 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm or 5 inches, a micropenis spans less than 7&amp;nbsp;cm or just over two inches."&lt;/ref&gt; The condition affects 0.6% of men.&lt;ref name=kinsey&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Kinsey Institute|year=2009|title=Penis Size FAQ &amp; Bibliography|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/bib-penis.html|accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the identifiable causes are [[growth hormone deficiency|deficiency of pituitary growth hormone]] or [[gonadotropin]]s, mild degrees of [[androgen insensitivity syndrome|androgen insensitivity]], a variety of genetic syndromes and variations in certain [[homeobox]] genes. Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or [[testosterone]] treatment in early childhood. Operations are also available to increase penis size in cases of micropenis in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Length-boosting surgery for 'micro-penises'|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6761-lengthboosting-surgery-for-micropenises.html|date=6 December 2004|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental influence===
It has been suggested that differences in penis size between individuals are caused not only by [[genetics]], but also by environmental factors such as [[culture]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and chemical or pollution exposure.&lt;ref name=pmid16079079&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.8100 |pmid=16079079 |pmc=1280349 |title=Decrease in Anogenital Distance among Male Infants with Prenatal Phthalate Exposure |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=113 |issue=8 |pages=1056–1061 |year=2005 |last1=Swan |first1=Shanna H |last2=Main |first2=Katharina M |last3=Liu |first3=Fan |last4=Stewart |first4=Sara L |last5=Kruse |first5=Robin L |last6=Calafat |first6=Antonia M |last7=Mao |first7=Catherine S |last8=Redmon |first8=J.

The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] believed that small penises were ideal.&lt;ref name="Dover1989"/&gt; Scholars believe that most ancient Greeks probably had roughly the same size penises as most other Europeans,&lt;ref name="Dover1989"/&gt; but Greek artistic portrayals of handsome youths show them with inordinately small, [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] penises with disproportionately large [[foreskin]]s,&lt;ref name="Dover1989"/&gt; indicating that these were seen as ideal.&lt;ref name="Dover1989"/&gt; Large penises in [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]] are reserved exclusively for comically grotesque figures,&lt;ref name="Dover1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; such as [[satyr]]s, a class of hideous, horse-like woodland spirits, who are shown in Greek art with absurdly massive penises.&lt;ref name="Dover1989"/&gt; [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Actors]] portraying male characters in [[ancient Greek comedy]] wore enormous, fake, red penises, which dangled underneath their costumes;&lt;ref name="StorieAllen2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storie|first1=Ian C.|last2=Allen|first2=Arlene|title=A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts, Oxford, England, and Victoria, Australia|isbn=978-1-4051-0215-5|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z2t1cIVk-A8C&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=phalli+in+ancient+Greek+comedy#v=onepage&amp;q=phalli%20in%20ancient%20Greek%20comedy|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; these were intended as ridiculous and were meant to be laughed at.&lt;ref name="StorieAllen2005"/&gt;

In [[Aristophanes]]'s comedy ''[[The Clouds]]'', "Mr. Good Reason" gives the character Pheidippides a description of the ideal youth: "A glistening chest and glowing skin,/Broad shoulders, a small tongue,/A mighty bottom and a tiny prong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roche|first1=Paul|title=Aristophanes: The Complete Plays: A New Translation by Paul Roche|date=2005|publisher=New American Library|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0-451-21409-6|page=178|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[Priapus]], the god of fertility, had an impossibly large penis that was always permanently erect.&lt;ref name="Kerényi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kerényi|first=Karl|authorlink=Károly Kerényi|title=The Gods of the Greeks|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London, England|date=1951|pages=175–176|isbn=978-0-500-27048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; Priapus was widely seen as hideous and unattractive.&lt;ref name="Kerényi"/&gt; A ''[[scholia|scholion]]'' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]'s ''[[Argonautica]]'' states that, when Priapus's mother [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love and beauty, gave birth to him, she was so horrified by the size of his penis, his massive [[Abdominal obesity|potbelly]], and his huge tongue that she [[Child abandonment|abandoned him to die]] in the wilderness.&lt;ref name="Kerényi"/&gt; A herdsman found him and raised him as his son,&lt;ref name="Kerényi"/&gt; later discovering that Priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants.&lt;ref name="Kerényi"/&gt;

Nonetheless, there are indications that the Greeks had an open mind about large penises.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; A statue of the god [[Hermes]] with an exaggerated penis stood outside the main gate of [[Classical Athens|Athens]]&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; and in [[Alexandria]] in 275 BC, a procession in honor of [[Dionysus]] hauled a 180-foot phallus through the city and people venerated it by singing hymns and reciting poems.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; The Romans, in contrast to the Greeks, seem to have admired large penises&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman_art"/&gt; and large numbers of large phalli have been recovered from the ruins of [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; Depictions of Priapus were very popular in Roman erotic art and literature.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman_art"/&gt; Over [[Priapeia|eighty obscene poems dedicated to him]] have survived.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;

Penis size is alluded to in the [[Bible]]:&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses. {{bibleref|Ezekiel|23:18–20|ESV}}, [[English Standard Version]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ancient Chinese legend holds that a man named [[Lao Ai]] had the largest penis in history and that he had an affair with [[Queen Dowager Zhao]] ({{circa}} 280–228 BC), the mother of [[Qin Shi Huang]], by pretending to be a [[eunuch]].&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; [[Ancient Korea]]ns admired large penises and [[Jijeung of Silla|King Jijeung]] (437–514 AD) of the [[Silla|Silla Dynasty]] is said to have had a forty-five-centimeter penis that was so large his subordinates had to search for a woman that fit him.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; Traditional [[Japan]]ese erotic paintings usually show genitals as exaggeratedly large.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; The oldest known painting of this type, found in the [[Hōryū-ji|Hōryū-ji Temple]] in [[Ikaruga, Nara|Ikaruga]], dates to the eighth century AD and depicts a fairly large penis.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;

The ancient Indian sexual treatise ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', originally written in [[Sanskrit]], probably between the second and fourth centuries AD, divides men into three classes based on penis size: "hare" size (5–7&amp;nbsp;cm when erect), "bull" size (10–15&amp;nbsp;cm), and "horse" size (18–20&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; The treatise also divide women's vaginas into three sizes ("deer", "mare", and "elephant")&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; and advises that a man match the size of the vagina of the woman he is having sex with to the size of his own penis.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; It also gives medically dubious advice on how to enlarge one's penis using [[wasp sting]]s.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
[[File:Angelo Bronzino 055.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Lodovico Caponi'' (painted {{circa}} 1550–1555) by [[Bronzino|Angelo Bronzino]] shows a [[codpiece]] peaking from underneath the young man's jacket.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; Larger codpieces were regarded as more fashionable.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;]]

In medieval [[Arabic literature]], a longer penis was preferred, as described in an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member". As a witty [[satire]] of this fantasy, the 9th-century [[Afro-Arab]] author [[Al-Jahiz]] wrote: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]]" (the tribe to which [[Muhammad]] belonged and from which he descended).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ulrich Marzolph|title=The Arabian Nights: An Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|year=2004|pages=97–8|isbn=978-1-57607-204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;

The medieval [[Norsemen]] considered the size of a man's penis as the measure of his manliness,&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Steven A.|title=Witchcraft and Magic in the Nordic Middle Ages|date=2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-8122-4290-4|pages=55–57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=shCXJLB6mDAC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=penis+size+in+the+middle+ages#v=onepage&amp;q=penis%20size%20in%20the%20middle%20ages|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a thirteenth-century Norse magic [[talisman]] from [[Bergen]], a [[Stave (wood)|wooden stave]] inscribed with writing in [[Runic inscriptions|runic script]], promises its wearer: "You will fuck Rannveig the Red. It will be bigger than a man's prick and smaller than a horse's prick."&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; A late fourteenth century account of the life of [[Olaf II of Norway|Saint Óláfr]] from the ''[[Flateyjarbók]]'' describes a pagan ritual, which centered around a preserved horse's penis used as a cult artifact,&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; which members of the cult would pass around in a circle,&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; making up verses in praise of it,&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; encouraging it and the other members of the group to behave in sexually suggestive ways.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], some men in Europe began to wear [[codpiece]]s, which accentuated their genitals.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; There is no direct evidence that it was necessarily worn to enhance the apparent size of the wearer's penis,&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt; but larger codpieces were seen as more fashionable.&lt;ref name="Kim2016"/&gt;

==Contemporary perceptions==

===Shrinking and enlarging===
Widespread private concerns related to penis size have led to a number of [[folklore]] sayings and [[popular culture]] reflections related to penis size. [[Penis panic]] is a form of [[mass hysteria]] involving the believed removal or shrinking of the penis, known as [[genital retraction syndrome]]. The penis can significantly shrink due to scar tissue formation from a condition called [[Peyronie's disease]] which affects up to 10% of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0970-1591.27633 |title=Peyronie's disease and erectile dysfunction: Current understanding and future direction |journal=Indian Journal of Urology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=246 |year=2006 |last1=Levine |first1=Laurencea }}&lt;/ref&gt; Products such as penis pumps, pills, and other dubious means of [[penis enlargement]] are some of the most marketed products in [[email spam]].

===Among male homosexuals===
A study undertaken at [[Utrecht University]] found that the majority of homosexual men in the study regarded a large penis as ideal, and having one was linked to self-esteem.&lt;ref name=gay&gt;{{cite web|title=Size does matter (to gays)|date=20 February 2006|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2006-02-20-size-does-matter|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] online|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study analysing the self-reported [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey]] data set found that the average penis of a homosexual man was larger than the average penis of their heterosexual counterparts (6.32&amp;nbsp;inches [16.05&amp;nbsp;cm] in length amongst gay men versus 5.99&amp;nbsp;in [15.21&amp;nbsp;cm] in heterosexuals, and 4.95&amp;nbsp;inches [12.57&amp;nbsp;cm] circumference amongst gay men versus 4.80&amp;nbsp;in [12.19&amp;nbsp;cm] in heterosexual men).&lt;ref name=pmid10410197&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1018780108597 |pmid=10410197 |year=1999 |last1=Bogaert |first1=Anthony F |title=The relation between sexual orientation and penile size |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=213–21 |last2=Hershberger |first2=Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research says erect gay penises are bigger|date=4 November 1999|url=http://salon.com/health/sex/urge/world/1999/11/04/size/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304084315/http://salon.com/health/sex/urge/world/1999/11/04/size/index.html|archivedate=4 March 2007|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon.com]]|accessdate=2006-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size of other body parts===
A statistically significant correlation between penis size and the size of other body parts has not been found in research. One study, Siminoski and Bain (1988), found a weak correlation between the size of the stretched penis and foot size and height; however, it was too weak to be used as a practical estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00849563 |title=The relationships among height, penile length, and foot size |journal=Annals of Sex Research |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=231–235 |year=1988 |last1=Siminoski |first1=Kerry |last2=Bain |first2=Jerald }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another investigation, Shah and Christopher (2002), which cited Siminoski and Bain (1988), failed to find any evidence for a link between shoe size and stretched penis size, stating "the supposed association of penile length and shoe size has no scientific basis".&lt;ref name=pmid12230622&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2002.02974.x |title=Can shoe size predict penile length? |journal=BJU International |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=586–587 |year=2002 |last1=Shah |first1=J |last2=Christopher |first2=N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cecil |first=Adams |title=The size of things to come |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=26 August 2003 |url=http://www.snopes.com/risque/penile/size.asp |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081216223820/http://www.snopes.com/risque/penile/size.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-16 |accessdate=2006-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be a link between the malformation of the genitalia and the human limbs. The development of the penis in an embryo is controlled by some of the same [[Hox gene]]s (in particular [[HOXA13]] and [[HOXD13]])&lt;ref name=pmid12357469&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ajmg.10776 |pmid=12357469 |title=Limb malformations and the humanHOX genes |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=256–65 |year=2002 |last1=Goodman |first1=Frances R }}&lt;/ref&gt; as those that control the development of the limbs.

==Studies of size preferences among sexual partners==
In a small study conducted by [[University of Texas–Pan American]] and published in BMC Women's Health, 50 undergraduate women were surveyed by two popular male athletes on campus about their perceptions of sexual satisfaction and it was concluded that the width of a penis feels better than the length of a penis, when subjects are asked to choose between the two (size was left unspecified). It was also concluded that this may show that penis size overall affects sexual satisfaction since women chose between the two options they were given.&lt;ref name=pmid11415468&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1472-6874-1-1 |pmid=11415468 |pmc=33342 |title=Penis size: Survey of female perceptions of sexual satisfaction |journal=BMC Women's Health |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=1 |year=2001 |last1=Eisenman |first1=Russell }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cover story by ''[[Psychology Today]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199411/mens-bodies-the-survey|work=Psychology Today|title=Men's bodies—the survey|accessdate=2007-07-17|author1=Michael Pertschuk |author2=Alice Trisdorfer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200910/the-beefcaking-america|work=Psychology Today Nov–Dec 1994 (web edition last reviewed 2004-8-30)|title=The beefcaking of America|accessdate=2007-07-20|author=Jill Neimark}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,500 readers (about two-thirds women) were surveyed about male body image. Many of the women were not particularly concerned with penis size and over 71% thought men overemphasized the importance of penis size and shape. Generally, the women polled cared more about width than men thought, and less about length than men thought, although the strength of caring for either among women showed a similar pattern.

Another study, conducted at [[Groningen University Hospital]], asked 375 sexually active women (who had recently given birth) the importance of penis size the results of which showed that 21% of women felt length was important and 32% felt that girth was important.&lt;ref name=pmid12429149&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0302-2838(02)00396-2 |pmid=12429149 |title=What Importance Do Women Attribute to the Size of the Penis? |journal=European Urology |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=426–31 |year=2002 |last1=Francken |first1=A.B |last2=Van De Wiel |first2=H.B.M |last3=Van Driel |first3=M.F |last4=Weijmar Schultz |first4=W.C.M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted at the [[Australian National University]], published in early 2013, showed that penis size influences a man's sex appeal, and the taller the man, the bigger the effect.&lt;ref name=pmid23569234&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1219361110 |pmid=23569234 |pmc=3637716 |title=Penis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=110 |issue=17 |pages=6925–30 |year=2013 |last1=Mautz |first1=B. S |last2=Wong |first2=B. B. M |last3=Peters |first3=R. A |last4=Jennions |first4=M. D |bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6925M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed 3D computer generated images at life size, altering the height and other physical attributes, with women typically registering preferences in under 3 seconds. A preference for taller men's larger penis size was notable.

A U.S. study published in 2015 of the stated preferences of a panel of 75 women using [[3D-printed]] models as scale references showed a preferred penis length of 16&amp;nbsp;cm and a preferred circumference of 12.2&amp;nbsp;cm for long-term sexual partners, with slightly larger preferred sizes of a length of 16.3&amp;nbsp;cm and circumference of 12.7&amp;nbsp;cm for one-time sexual encounters.&lt;ref name=pmid26332467&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0133079 |pmid=26332467 |pmc=4558040 |title=Women's Preferences for Penis Size: A New Research Method Using Selection among 3D Models |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=9 |pages=e0133079 |year=2015 |last1=Prause |first1=Nicole |last2=Park |first2=Jaymie |last3=Leung |first3=Shannon |last4=Miller |first4=Geoffrey |bibcode=2015PLoSO..1033079P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''size queen'' is slang for anyone who prefers their sexual partner(s) to have a larger-than-average penis.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Alexa Joy and Tocantins, Nicole (2004) ''The Happy Hook-Up: A Single Girl's Guide to Casual Sex'', Ten Speed Press, p. 208, {{ISBN|1580086098}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
{{see also|Sexual selection in human evolution#Sexual anatomy}}
The human penis is thicker than that of any other primate, both in absolute terms and relative to the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Small|first=Meredith F.|title=What's Love Got to Do With It? The Evolution of Human Mating|year=1995|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-0-385-47702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research, based on inaccurate measurements, concluded that the human penis was also longer. In fact, the penis of the [[common chimpanzee]] is no shorter than in humans, averaging 14.4&amp;nbsp;cm (5.7 inches), and some other primates have comparable penis sizes relative to their body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dixson, A. F. | year = 2009 | title = Sexual selection and the origins of human mating systems | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 61–65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRTniKE2liYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage| isbn = 9780191569739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary reasons for the increased thickness have not been established.&lt;ref name=pmid18158617&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9297-6 |pmid=18158617 |title=Why the Human Penis is Larger than in the Great Apes |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=361 |year=2007 |last1=Bowman |first1=Edwin A }}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation is that thicker penises are an [[adaptation]] to a corresponding increase in [[Human vaginal size|vaginal size]]. The vaginal canal is believed to have expanded in humans to accommodate the larger size of a newborn's [[cranium]]. Women may then have [[Sexual selection|sexually selected]] men with penises large enough to fit their vagina, to provide [[sexual stimulation]] and ensure [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name=pmid18158617/&gt;

==Condom use==
One Australian study of 184 men looked at penis length and circumference in relationship to condom breakage or slippage. 3,658 condoms were used. The study found that when used correctly, condoms had a breakage rate of 1.34% and a slippage rate of 2.05%, for a total failure rate of 3.39%. Penile dimensions did not influence slippage, although penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated, with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage.&lt;ref name=pmid9702591&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1258/0956462981922593 |pmid=9702591 |title=Does penis size influence condom slippage and breakage? |journal=International Journal of Std &amp; Aids |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=444–7 |year=2016 |last1=Smith |first1=Anthony M A |last2=Jolley |first2=Damien |last3=Hocking |first3=Jane |last4=Benton |first4=Kim |last5=Gerofi |first5=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperviscosity syndrome''' is a group of symptoms triggered by increase in the [[viscosity]] of the [[blood]]. Symptoms of high [[blood viscosity]] include spontaneous bleeding from [[mucous membrane]]s, visual disturbances due to [[retinopathy]], and neurologic symptoms ranging from [[headache]] and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] to [[seizures]] and [[coma]].

Hyperviscosity occurs from pathologic changes of either cellular or protein fractions of the blood such as is found in [[polycythemia]]s, [[multiple myeloma]] (particularly IgA and IgG3), [[leukemia]], [[Monoclonal gammopathy|monoclonal gammopathies]] such as [[Waldenström macroglobulinemia]], [[sickle cell anemia]], and [[sepsis]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Types of hyperviscosity syndromes vary by pathology; including [[Serum (blood)|serum]] hyperviscosity, which may cause neurologic or ocular disorders; polycythemic hyperviscosity, which results in reduced blood flow or capillary [[perfusion]] and increased organ congestion; and syndromes of hyperviscosity, caused by reduced [[Erythrocyte deformability|deformability]] of [[red blood cells]], often evident in sickle cell anemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kwaan |first1=Hau |last2=Bongu |first2=Anurekha |title=The Hyperviscosity Syndromes |journal=Seminars in Thrombosis and Hemostasis |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=199–208 |year=1999 |pmid=10357087 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-994921 |url=https://digitalhub.northwestern.edu/downloads/tq57nr067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
High cell counts are seen in conditions such as [[polycythemia]] (raised red blood cells) or [[leukemia]] (more [[white blood cell]]s, especially in [[acute leukemic blast crisis|acute leukemic blast crises]]).

May occur with a white blood cell count greater than 100,000/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (100×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L).&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|780258|Hyperviscosity Syndrome Workup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Although elevated whole blood viscosity is a better measure of hyperviscosity and more common and clinically important, serum viscosity and plasma viscosity are more frequently measured.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bekelman |first1=J |last2=Jackson |first2=N |last3=Donehower |first3=R |title=Oncologic emergencies |edition=2nd |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |year=2006}}{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal plasma viscosity is between 1.4 and 1.8 [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]] while symptoms from hyperviscosity typically occur greater than 4 centipoise (about 4 times more viscous than water) and require emergency treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Patients will also have evidence of their underlying disorder. Those with  [[myeloma]] will typically display a [[rouleaux]] formation on a peripheral smear and a large [[globulin]] gap, indicative of a significant [[paraprotein]] load. While viscosity can be directly measured, results can take a few days to return and thus a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in a timely manner. If hyperviscosity is suspected, treatment may need to be started prior to obtaining the official viscosity level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Treatment ==
[[Plasmapheresis]] may be used to decrease viscosity in the case of myeloma, whereas [[leukapheresis]] or [[phlebotomy]] may be employed in a leukemic or polycythemic crisis, respectively. [[Blood transfusion]]s should be used with caution as they can increase serum viscosity. Hydration is a temporizing measure to employ while preparing pheresis. Even after treatment, the condition will recur unless the underlying disorder is treated.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''iConji''' is a free [[pictograph]]ic communication system based on an open, visual vocabulary of characters with built-in translations for most major languages.

In May 2010 '''iConji Messenger''' was released with support for [[Apple iOS]] (iPhone, iPad, iPod) and most web browsers. Messenger enables point-to-point communication in a manner similar to [[SMS]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatti, Kristen (2010) [http://www.ncbr.com/article.asp?id=51714 New iConji language for the symbol-minded], Northern Colorado Business Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, '''iConji Social''' was released as a web application only, with support for Facebook and Twitter as a broadcast medium. The application iConji Social supported delivery of iConji-enhanced messages via email.

iConji debuted with 1183 unique characters, known as the ''lexiConji'' (vocabulary), culled from base words used in common daily communications, word frequency lists,&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, Caroline (2009) [http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/253/ A corpus linguistics study of SMS text messaging], Ph.D. thesis, University of Birmingham&lt;/ref&gt; often-used mathematical and logical symbols, punctuation symbols, and the flags of all nations. The process of assembling a message from iConji characters is called ''iConjisation'' (see screenshot at right).

Since most characters represent an entire word or concept, rather than a single letter or character, iConji has the potential to be a more efficient communication system than SMS.&lt;ref&gt;Pakalski, Ingo (2010) [http://www.golem.de/1005/75137.html Icons for barrier-free communication], IT News for Professionals (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; The usual jumble of text and confusing abbreviations can often be replaced by a short string of colorful icons that convey the identical meaning.

With the iConji Messenger and iConji Social apps, characters are displayed at a resolution of 32 x 32 pixels, using color [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]s with transparency to round the corners. As all iConji characters are developed first as [[vector graphics]], this allows essentially infinite scalability, whether for producing new online or smartphone apps, or full-size posters for printed graphic applications such as signs or electronic displays.

Thus, future iConji applications, from in-house or outside developers, may incorporate larger or smaller versions of the characters using the freely available iConji API.

In December 2012, further development of iConji was brought to a close.

== Overview ==



Kai Staats, founder and former CEO of Terra Soft Solutions, original developer of [[Yellow Dog Linux]] (YDL), was motivated to create a new communications system that combined the speed of SMS with the richness and linguistic depth of a global art project.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jeremy A. (2010) [http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/05/25/iconji-language-cell-phone-hieroglyphics/ Inventor Proposes New Language for Cell Phone Messaging - Using Hieroglyphics], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt; His intent was to provide a means for communication that could bridge cultural divides. Thus, iConji is a pictographic communication system, not a spoken language.

The characters themselves are evocative of their meanings, and designed to be as cross-cultural as possible. It is a difficult task to even attempt to make pictographic symbols universal in their meaning. Further, not all cultures read symbols or text from left to right, which is the standard for iConji. In addition, some linguistic concepts are too abstract to represent graphically. The first row in the image above (The iConji user interface on an iPod.) shows characters for the pronouns (I, you, we, he, she, it, them), and the "tilde" which is defined as "to be" and its numerous conjugations (is, are, was, will be, and so on). These abstract concepts represent a significant barrier to universal pictographic representation, but the ability to read a translation in one's native language (if needed) can help bridge that gap. The character at far right is the "null" and can be used as a space, a placeholder, or a container for [[metadata]].

Unique to iConji is its inclusion of both an inferred meaning, suggested by the pictographs themselves, and the translations that accompany each character. At the close of 2010, these translations included English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, and Toki Pona.&lt;ref&gt;http://app.iconji.com/explore Explore iConji (language menu)&lt;/ref&gt; There is no practical limit to the number of languages that could be translated and included.

Likewise, there is no limit to the number of individual characters that could be incorporated. The iConji vocabulary is open to revision - anyone in the world may design and contribute new characters for use in global communications. Through the Artist Community, users are able to add their own characters to the lexiConji (with approval), or revise existing character icons they feel could be better represented graphically.

== Implementation ==

The screenshot above shows most features and functionality of the iConji application. Starting at top right, the search icon (magnifying glass) opens a text field in the dark blue window that allows a text search for specific characters. Below that is the "To:" field, where the recipient can be inserted from a built-in address book. Below that is another field where selected iConji characters can be assembled into a string to compose the message (iConjisation).

The next section down is a 6x9 matrix of characters from which the user can select specific characters. In the iOS applications this is accomplished by a finger-tap; in the browser application by a point-and-click. In both cases, a hover pops up a small box displaying the definition of the character in the user's declared language.

The bottom-most line consists of what are called ''buckets''. Each user-customizable bucket contains another 54 characters that can be grouped by type or frequency of use. The seventh bucket contains 54 commonly used mathematical and logical symbols. The eighth bucket is "bottomless" and serves as a repository for all other characters, with no limit to the number contained. Selecting that bucket generates a scrollable list of those characters. "It is the user's customization of these buckets that enables iConji to rival or exceed SMS in terms of efficiency and speed."&lt;ref&gt;Staats, Kai. Personal interview by phone. 4 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inflections ==

A few other modern pictographic systems use inflection symbols to expand meanings, for example, [[Blissymbolics]]. iConji includes inflections for present, past, or future tense verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and possessives. The user can also add metadata, if desired, to clarify the meaning or include additional text content. All inflections are indicated as glyphs at standardized positions around the base and top of the iConji character. In most cases the inflection should be apparent from context, but for messages where ambiguity could arise, inflections provide a means to remove that ambiguity.

For example, the gallery below shows four inflected variations of the character defined as "start, to start."

&lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="6"&gt;
File:iConji-start-noun.png|&lt;center&gt;start (noun)&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-start-verb.png|&lt;center&gt;to start (verb)&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-did-start.png|&lt;center&gt;did start (past)&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-will-start.png|&lt;center&gt;will start (future)&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-started.png|&lt;center&gt;started (adjective)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
 
Many iConji characters follow this ''noun'' + ''infinitive verb'' format to enable unambiguous translation from its base English into other languages. Given the widely varying conventions for [[Grammatical conjugation|verb conjugation]] found in other languages, this is arguably the most flexible way to present a base definition.

== Examples ==

The sample iConjisation shown on the screenshot translates as follows:

&lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="5"&gt;
File:iConji-coffee.png|&lt;center&gt;coffee&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-at.png|&lt;center&gt;at&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-4.png|&lt;center&gt;four&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-clock.png|&lt;center&gt;o'clock&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-question.png|&lt;center&gt;question&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This demonstrates clearly how meaning can be conveyed using a minimal number of characters. The fourth character is formally defined as "clock, time" but would be interpreted as "o'clock" when used in this context. If the sender and receiver usually meet for coffee at the same location, no other information is needed. If the intended location is different from the usual, the iConjisation could be changed to:

&lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="5"&gt;
File:iConji-coffee.png|&lt;center&gt;coffee&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-at-metadata.png|&lt;center&gt;at + meta&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-4.png|&lt;center&gt;four&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-clock.png|&lt;center&gt;o'clock&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-question.png|&lt;center&gt;question&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Here, the triangular inflection mark on the second character (at) indicates the presence of ''metadata'' in that character. Metadata can be added or accessed via a text box pop-up by clicking on the character, and could include a business name, address, [[GPS]] coordinates, or other information. Alternatively, the sender can convey more specific location instructions using the characters themselves, for example:

&lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="8"&gt;
File:iConji-coffee.png|&lt;center&gt;coffee&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-at.png|&lt;center&gt;at&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-my.png|&lt;center&gt;my&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-house.png|&lt;center&gt;house&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-4.png|&lt;center&gt;four&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-clock.png|&lt;center&gt;o'clock&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-question.png|&lt;center&gt;question&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In this example, the third character (I, me) has been inflected with the ''possessive'' modifier, changing the meaning to "my." The two instances of the "@" character are included for grammatical clarity, but could likely be excluded without changing the interpreted meaning. In all of these examples, the recipient's response could be similarly concise, as the following three examples show:

{| border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
| &lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="2"&gt;
File:iConji-sound.png|&lt;center&gt;sounds&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-good.png|&lt;center&gt;good&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
| '''or'''
| &lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="2"&gt;
File:iConji-arrive.png|&lt;center&gt;arrive&lt;/center&gt;
File:iConji-early-adverb.png|&lt;center&gt;early&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
| '''or simply'''
| &lt;gallery widths="32px" heights="32px" perrow="1"&gt;
File:iConji-yes.png|&lt;center&gt;yes&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
|}

In the first response, we see the flexibility of the iConji system, as well as some word-play. The first character is formally defined as "sound, audio" and can thus be used in many contexts. The second character is formally defined as "angelic, saintly, good" implying the overall meaning "sounds good."

In the second response, additional information is returned by the recipient requesting the sender to "arrive early" using the adverb modifier on "early." Whether the adverb modifier is really needed is a matter of question since, between frequent users, certain conventions will become established by previous usage.

In the final and most concise response, only a single character (yes) is returned by the recipient.

== Artist Community ==

In February 2011 iConji launched its Artist Community. Anyone who saw the need for a new character, or a better version of an existing character, was encouraged to create and submit a unique design. There were several criteria for acceptance of a submitted character, but the process was made simple using freely available online graphic templates, instructions, and examples.

Character icons were created as vector graphics in tools such as [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[CorelDRAW]], or the free online application [[SVG-edit]]. Alternatively, the proposed character icon could be hand-drawn, scanned as a 300 dpi bitmap, and converted to vector graphics format before being submitted as a potential addition to the iConji vocabulary.

Definitions for the characters also follow a strict format and, where ambiguities could exist, need to follow a format that utilizes ''extended definitions'' to remove those ambiguities, both for users and translators. For example:

* miss [the salutation for an unmarried female]
* miss [the feeling of sorrow resulting from someone or something lost]
* miss, to miss [the act of not connecting with a target or goal]

Note how the last example again defaults to the “noun + infinitive verb” format mentioned above.

The artist also had the opportunity, if desired, to associate metadata with their character explaining the story behind the design, who they are, and their country of residence. Once accepted, the character was made available for use globally, by all iConji users. The artist had the ability to track the use of their character using the iConji Explorer application on the iConji website (no longer maintained).

The first iConji Communications workshop&lt;ref&gt;iConji website [http://www.iconji.com/about/workshop iConji workshop at Colorado State University]&lt;/ref&gt; was held at Colorado State University on April 7, 2011. 40 participants representing a dozen countries convened to discuss the cross-cultural potential of this pictographic system. Over 100 new pictographs were designed and entered into the iConji vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;eSchool News (2011) [http://www.eschoolnews.com/2011/04/22/colorado-state-university-hosts-iconji-language-art-workshop/ Colorado State University Hosts iConji Language, Art Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precedents ==

There has been no shortage of attempts to create a new and “better” universal language. An exhaustive account of these efforts can be found in the book “In the Land of Invented Languages” by [[Arika Okrent]]. According to Okrent, in the last thousand years, more than 900 languages have been invented, often by individuals who believed they had a universal solution for global, cross-cultural communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okrent|first=Arika|title=In the Land of Invented Languages|year=2009|publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau|isbn=0-385-52788-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts at creating a new language failed due to overly-ambitious goals, or eccentricities of their inventor. Many attempts have been based on [[pictograms]] or [[logograms]], including iConji and the following. 

Of all the recently invented pictographic systems, [[Blissymbols|Blissymbolics]] is the most successful to date. It is used to assist communications-challenged individuals, providing them a structured means by which they may convey concepts, and more recently, providing a “point and click” software interface.

The Noun Project&lt;ref&gt;Skyler, John (2011) [http://www.thenounproject.com/ The Noun Project] (website)&lt;/ref&gt; is another effort to establish cross-cultural communication. It purports to be a repository of universal icons, but suffers the same ambiguities as previous "universal language" attempts. The icons therein are primarily from public-domain icon databases, for example, restroom, traffic, mall, and airport icons, not all of which translate across cultures. The collection does include icons designed by individuals, but currently lacks guidelines for design beyond their stated desire for "scale, proportion, and shape."&lt;ref&gt;Skyler, John (2011) [http://www.thenounproject.com/mission/ Mission of the Noun Project] (website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of note is [[Emoji]], based on a vocabulary of 722 [[emoticon]]s, and popular in electronic communications throughout Japan. Emoji icons are heavily slanted toward conveying emotional "punctuation," and more useful in augmenting SMS than in communicating complete stand-alone messages.

Other pictographic systems have been less successful, as described here: [[List of writing systems]]. There have also been many attempts to create universal ''spoken'' languages, the most notable of which is [[Esperanto]]. For more examples, see [[Universal language]].

'''Inflight smoking''' is prohibited by almost all [[airline]]s. Smoking on domestic airliners based in the [[United States]], for instance, was banned on all domestic flights with a duration of two hours or less beginning in 1988, with all domestic and international flights being smoke-free by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://no-smoke.org/document.php?id=334|title=Smokefree Transportation Chronology|author=|date=|website=no-smoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[FAA]] regulations, smoking lit cigarettes or anything else that produces smoke or flame is prohibited onboard most commercial aircraft.&lt;ref name="14-cfr-252"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title14/14cfr252_main_02.tpl |title=14 CFR 252 - Smoking Abort Aircraft |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |location=(United States)|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2015, the [[USDOT]] prohibits the use of [[electronic cigarettes]] on flights, as well as such devices from being transported in checked luggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/10/27/u-s-bans-e-cigarettes-in-chec.html|title=U.S. bans e-cigarettes in checked baggage, and no vaping on the plane either / Boing Boing|author=|date=|website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Advocate [[Ralph Nader]] was among the first to call for a smoking ban on airlines. [[United Airlines]] was the first to implement a nonsmoking section, in 1971.&lt;ref name="Brandt"&gt;[[Allan M. Brandt|Brandt, Allan M]].: ''The Cigarette Century: The Rise, Fall, and Deadly Persistence of the Product that Defined America'', p. 303-304. Basic Books, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurigny Air Services]] became the first airline to ban smoking entirely on its flights, in July 1977. However, both tobacco companies and airlines fought any regulation.&lt;ref name="Brandt"/&gt; Significantly, the [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] banned and then unbanned smoking in 1984, with chairman Dan McKinnon saying, "Philosophically, I think nonsmokers have rights, but it comes into market conflict with practicalities and the realities of life."&lt;ref name=flpflp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&amp;dat=19840601&amp;id=VzUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=laUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6774,51593 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |location=Alabama |agency=''(Washington Post)'' |title=CAB flip-flops on smoking policy |date=June 1, 1984 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of debate over health concerns,&lt;ref name=tb77&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=azVPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZAIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4417%2C4485988 |newspaper=Toledo Blade |location=Ohio |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=CAB votes to ban pipe, cigar smokers |date=November 23, 1977 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ssbbop&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RqkrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IP0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6265%2C3520262 |newspaper=[[Nashua Telegraph]] |location=New Hampshire |agency=Associated Press |title=Should smoking be banned on planes? |date=May 15, 1981 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Congressional action in 1987 led to a ban on inflight smoking.&lt;ref name=latmhse&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-26/news/hd-1151_1_ban-smoking |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=The House: Smoking Ban |date=July 26, 1987 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ljwlaut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GYIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2912%2C6390458 |newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |location=Kansas |agency=Associated Press |title=Senator seeks smoking ban on flights under two hours |date=September 30, 1987 |page=6D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asres&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5pYRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CuoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6826%2C24097 |newspaper=Gainesville Sun |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |last=Fram |first=Alan |title=Airline smoking restrictions approved by Senate panel |date=October 1, 1987 |page=5A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=satblat&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-30/news/mn-11712_1_ban-smoking |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |last=Jehl |first=Douglas |title=Senate acts to ban smoking on 70% of airline flights |date=October 30, 1987 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1990 ban applied to the passengers and the cabin of the aircraft, but not the flight deck; pilots were [[grandfather clause|allowed to continue smoking]] after the 1990 ban due to concerns over potential flight safety issues caused by nicotine withdrawal in chronic smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/10/us/ban-on-smoking-in-airliners-doesn-t-apply-to-the-cockpit.html |newspaper=New York Times |last=Mydans |first=Seth |title=Ban on smoking in airliners doesn't apply to the cockpit |date=March 19, 1990 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Normally, passengers found to be smoking on non-smoking flights will at least face a fine (up to $5,000) and at worst be arrested and detained upon landing. Due to stringent security measures, this often causes disruption; a flight may have to be diverted or a scheduled landing might have to be expedited upon arrival at the destination airport in order to escort the smoker from the plane.

Such regulations have on occasion met with defiance; in 2010 a [[Qatar]]i [[diplomat]] was arrested upon arrival at [[Denver International Airport]] for smoking in the [[Aircraft lavatory|onboard lavatory]] on [[United Airlines Flight 663]] and for making threats; when confronted by airline staff, he jokingly suggested that he was attempting to set his shoes on fire.&lt;ref name=qguar&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/08/qatari-diplomat-smoking-plane-scare |title=Qatari diplomat 'smoking' causes US plane scare |first=James |last=Meikle |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, 2013, a family of four were accused of smoking during a [[Sunwing Airlines]] flight from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] to the [[Dominican Republic]]. They caused the flight to make an emergency landing at Bermuda [[L.F. Wade International Airport]]. The two eldest of the family were arrested by [[Bermuda Police Service]] and subsequently sentenced to a $500 fine or 10 days in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/03/ns-smoking-family-sunwing-bermuda.html |title=Family of smokers on airplane forces costly diversion |publisher=CBC News |location=(Canada)|date=February 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/04/ns-smoking-family-bermuda-sunwing-court.html |title=Unruly Sunwing passengers sentenced in Bermuda court |publisher=[[CBC News]] |location=(Canada)|date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the ubiquitous prohibition of in-flight smoking and the increasingly widespread use of [[electronic devices]], the illuminated no-smoking signs have sometimes been re-purposed to inform passengers to switch devices off for take-off and landing. Where this is the case, the no-smoking sign is permanently printed on the overhead panels.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''International Resources for the Improvement of Sight''' ('''IRIS''') is an International [[NGO]] that specializes in prevention of blindness and restoration of sight.&lt;ref name=usembassy/&gt; It was founded in 1996 by Michele Claudel and John Stewart.&lt;ref name=carla&gt;{{cite web |url=http://givingwomen.ch/content/iris-gw-project-evening-231109 |title=IRIS - GW Project evening of 23.11.09 |publisher=Giving Women |author=Hilber del Pozzo Carla |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially founded to help people in Cambodia without access to eye care, it has since expanded to Nepal, Lao PDR and Sri Lanka. IRIS equips new eye clinics, strengthens existing ones, conducts eye screening, provides cataract surgery for poor people, primary eye care training for staff.&lt;ref name=carla/&gt;

'''Reverend James Cantine''', [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]] (March 3, 1861 – July 1, 1940) was an American [[missionary]], scholar, and traveler. While studying at [[New Brunswick Theological Seminary]] in New Jersey, he co-founded the Arabian Mission with John Lansing and [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer]]. The mission exists today as the [[American Mission Hospital]] of Bahrain.&lt;ref name="AMH" /&gt; He was a missionary for forty years, which included establishing the first mission for the Reformed Church in Arabia, which was also the first mission in eastern Arabia.&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt; Between 1891 and 1929, he established mission posts, medical clinics, and churches in Arabia.

His wife, Elizabeth, was a nurse and the first single woman to become a missionary in Arabia. Together they founded a women's clinic in [[Muscat, Oman]], worked at missionary posts, and when the United Missions was formed, they were both representatives of the Reformed Church in America for the organization. Cantine co-authored the book, ''The Golden Milestone: Reminiscences of Pioneer Days Fifty Years in Arabia'' with Zwemer.

He studied at New Brunswick Theological Seminary in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]], where he met Dr. Lansing and, with Samuel Zwemer, was inspired to perform missionary work in Arabia.{{efn|It was Lansing's dream to establish a mission in Arabia, but his poor health prevented him from doing the work there.

===Basrah and other initial outposts===
[[File:Basra 1913 photo Arne C Waern Sweden.jpg|thumb|left|Canals in Barah with balam, 1913]]
Cantine established a mission at Basrah, and Zwemer joined him&lt;ref name="Obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 216" /&gt; in early 1892.&lt;ref name="Amerding p. 159"&gt;{{cite book|last=Armerding|first=Paul L.|title=Doctors for the Kingdom: The Work of the American Mission Hospitals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 1913-1955|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KXwr4hSnXSEC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2003|publisher=Wm. B.

Their approach was one of direct evangelism, by converting Arabs to Christianity. Prior to that, missionaries used an indirect approach, where they sought to revitalize the faith among people who were already Christians. Direct evangelism by foreigners had been forbidden by the Ottoman government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scudder|first=Lewis R.|title=The Arabian Mission's Story: In Search of Abraham's Other Son|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKBn1AOZUrwC&amp;pg=PA29|year=1998|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-4616-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cantine was primarily interested in spreading Christianity, and so he created relationships with other Christian missions in the area, but he also wanted their Arabian Mission to survive and at times bowed to political pressures to do so. Zwemer was a gifted linguist, writer, and orator and became the voice of the Arabian Mission. "He had an irrepressible and aggressive personality, earnest where Cantine was tender, driving where his colleague was contemplative."&lt;ref name="Scudder p. 139" /&gt;

Their plans to establish a needed [[medical missions|medical mission]] were delayed due to staffing issues and funding, but they carried on with their Bible work, taking over efforts of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]].&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 216" /&gt; In 1893, outposts were established in Bahrain and Muscat, by Zwemer&lt;ref name="Amerding p. 159" /&gt; and his brother, Peter, respectively.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 216" /&gt; Since its beginning, missionaries and physicians came to support the work of the Arabian Mission and staff its posts.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 217" /&gt; They sold about 200 booklets with Scripture within a couple of years.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 216" /&gt;  In 1894, the management of the independent mission was transferred to the Foreign Board of the church.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 216" /&gt;

The missionaries hired Dr. Worrall in 1895, but he was severely ill much of his first summer. Cantine returned to the United States for part of the year and raised interest and funds for the mission. In the meantime, there were wars between local tribes, with looting at Muscat. The Bible shop was closed by the government.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 217" /&gt;{{efn|In Basrah, Zwemer's brother sought shelter at the British Consulate, due to wars between local tribes, the Muscat mission having been looted, and Muscat taken over by bedouins.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 217" /&gt; The Turkish government arrested people that were selling Bibles and closed down the Bible book store in Basrah.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 217" /&gt;}} Another station was opened up at Amara, and Dr. Worrall was well enough to see patients in Basrah and Nasariah, creating a means to build relationships with the local people. They were also selling more Scriptures, about 80% of them to Moslems.&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 217"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corwin|first=Charles Edward|title=A Manual of the Reformed Church in America (formerly Reformed Protestant Dutch Church), 1628-1922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYguAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA275|year=1922|publisher=Board of Publication and Bible-School Work of the Reformed Church in America|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwemer settled in 1895&lt;ref name="Corwin p. 217" /&gt; or 1896 in Bahrain,&lt;ref name="Amerding p. 159" /&gt; which had been judged to have very poor living conditions, like malaria, cholera, dysentery, and smallpox due to significant humidity and high temperatures. In his search for information about living conditions, Cantine found that it was considered "the most unhealthy place in all the area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Onley|first=James|title=The Arabian Frontier of the British Raj: Merchants, Rulers, and the British in the Nineteenth-Century Gulf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qISDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|date=November 22, 2007|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-922810-2|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Cantine urgently left Basrah for Muscat because Samuel Zwemer and another colleague fell sick. Later, Muscat came to be known as "Cantine's station". In 1901, Cantine helped build a two-story building, the [[Mason Memorial Hospital]] after extensive negotiations with the ruler of [[Bahrain]].

Elizabeth DePree, a nurse from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], came to Arabia and was the first single woman to work as a missionary in Arabia.&lt;ref name="Kansfield"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kansfield|first=Mary L.|title=Letters to Hazel: Ministry Within the Woman's Board of Foreign Missions of the Reformed Church in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zF-kVNmn5UcC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2004|publisher=Wm.

Cantine and his wife opened a women's clinic in Muscat, which was staffed by Dr. Sarah Hosman.&lt;ref name="EDC Obituary" /&gt; In 1921, the Cantine's were transferred to Baghdad to the Reform Church Missionary Society to help rebuild following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="EDC Obituary" /&gt;

In [[agriculture]], a '''living mulch''' is a [[cover crop]] interplanted or undersown with a main [[agriculture|crop]], and intended to serve the purposes of a [[mulch]], such as [[weed]] suppression and regulation of [[soil]] [[temperature]]. Living mulches grow for a long time with the main crops, whereas cover crops are incorporated into the soil or killed with herbicides.

Other benefits of mulches are slowing the growth of weeds, and protecting soil from water and wind [[erosion]]. Some living mulches were found to increase populations of the natural enemies of crop pests.&lt;ref name=HartwigAmmon&gt;Hartwig N.L., H.. Ammon 2002 Cover crops and living mulches Weed Sci. 50: 688-699&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legume]]s used as living mulches also provide [[nitrogen fixation]], reducing the need for fertilizer.

== Benefits ==
When cover crops are turned over into the soil, they contribute nutrients to the main crop so that less chemical fertilizer is required.&lt;ref name=Brophy&gt;Brophy L. S., G. H. Heichel and M.P. Russelle. 1987 Nitrogen transfer from forage legumes to grass in a systematic planting design Crop Sci 27: 753-758&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the contribution depends on the biomass, which varies over time and depends on rainfall and other factors. The greater the biomass, the greater the nutrient turnover of land. Legume cover crops turn over nitrogen fixed from the atmosphere. Reports indicate that legumes in general have higher foliar nitrogen contents, from 20 to 45&amp;nbsp;mg g-1.&lt;ref name=Lehmann&gt;Lehmann J, J.P. da Silva, Jr. L. Trujillo, K. Uguen 2000 Legume cover crops and [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] in tropical fruit tree production Acta Horticulturae 531: 35-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bare soil resulting from intensive tillage can lead to soil erosion, nutrient losses, and offsite movement of pesticides. In addition, weeds can germinate and grow without competition. Living mulches can reduce water runoff and erosion, and protect waterways from pollution. Living mulches have also been shown to increase the population of organisms which are natural enemies of some crop pests.&lt;ref name=HartwigAmmon /&gt;

Living mulches control weeds in two ways. When they are seeded before weed establishment, they suppress weeds by competition.&lt;ref name=Hartwig&gt;Hartwig N.L 1977 Nutsedge control in no-tillage corn with and without a crownvetch cover crop. Proc. Northeast. Weed Sci. Society 31: 20-33&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, the [[allelopathic]] properties of living mulches can be used to control weeds. For example, the allelopathic properties of winter rye (''Secale cereale''), ryegrasses (''Lolium spp''), and subterrain clover (''Trifolium subterraneum'') can be used to control weeds in sweet corn (''Zea mays'' var "rugosa") and snap beans (''Phaseolus vulgaris'').&lt;ref name=DeGregorio&gt;De Gregorio R. E. and R.A. Ashley. 1986. Screening living mulches/ cover crops for no-till snap beans. Proc. Northeast. Weed Sci. Soc. 40:87-91&lt;/ref&gt;

Populations of ground-dwelling predators were greater in a corn and soybean rotation with [[alfalfa]] and [[kura clover]] living mulches than without a living mulch.&lt;ref name=Prafiska&gt;Prafiska J. R, N. P Schmidt, and K.A Kohler, 2006 Effects of living mulches on predator abundance and sentinel prey in a corn-soybean-forage rotation Env. Entomology 35: 1423-1431&lt;/ref&gt; This situation was due in part to a change in the composition of vegetation in the agricultural system.&lt;ref name=Andow&gt;Andow 1991. Vegetational diversity and arthropod population response. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 36: 561- 586.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks ==
Unfortunately, living mulches compete for nutrients and water with the main crop,&lt;ref name=Echtenkamp&gt;Echtenkamp, G. W, and R. Moomaw 1989 No-till corn production in a living mulch system Weed technology 3: 261-266&lt;/ref&gt; and this can reduce yields. For example, Elkins et al. (1983) examined the use of tall fescue (''[[Festuca arundinacea]]''), smooth bromegrass (''[[Bromus inermis]]''), and orchargrass (''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'') as living mulches. They found that herbicides killed 50% to 70% of the mulches but corn yield was reduced 5% to 10% at the end of the harvest.&lt;ref name=Elkins&gt;Elkins, D., D. Frederking, R. Marashi, and B. McVay. 1983. Living mulch for no-till corn and soybeans. J. soil Water Conserv, 38: 431-433&lt;/ref&gt;

Although leguminous cover crops have large biomass production and turnover, they are not likely to increase [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=Barber&gt;Barber, R.G., and F. Navarro 1994. The rehabitation of degraded soils in eastern Bolivia by subsoiling and the incorporation of cover crops. Land Degr. Rehab. 5:247-259&lt;/ref&gt; This is because legumes used as living mulches have greater N contents and a low C to N ratio.&lt;ref name=Lehmann /&gt; So when legume residue decomposes, soil microbes have sufficient N available to enhance their breakdown of organic materials in the soil.

==Types==
In the tropics, it is common to seed tree crops with living mulches such as legume covers in [[oil palm]] plantations,&lt;ref name=Broughton&gt;Broughton W.J., 1977. Effects of various covers on soil fertility under Hevea brasiliensis and on growth of the tree. Agro-Ecosys. 3:147-170&lt;/ref&gt; [[coconut]]&lt;ref name=Aldaba&gt;Aldaba F.R., 1995. Coconut production in the Philippines: problems and prospects. Plantatios, Recherche, Developpement Sept-Oct:15-18&lt;/ref&gt; and rubber (Watson 1989).

In [[Mexico]], legumes used traditionally as living mulches were tested as [[nematode]] and weed suppressors.&lt;ref name=Caamal&gt;Caamal-Maldonado J.A.,Jimenez J.J., Torres A., Anaya A. 2001. The use of allelopathic legume cover and mulch species for weed control in cropping systems. Agron J. 93:27-36&lt;/ref&gt; The mulches included velvetbean (''[[Mucuna pruriens]]'') jackbean (''[[Canavalia ensiformis]]''), jumbiebean (''[[Leucaena leucocephala]]'') and wild tamarindo (''[[Lysiloma latisiliquum]]''). [[Aqueous]] extract of Velvetbean reduced the gall index of ''[[Meloidogyne incognita]]'' in the roots of [[tomato]], but suppressed tomato rooting as well. In addition, Velvetbean suppressed the radical growth of the local weeds Alegria (''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]'') by 66% and Barnyardgrass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'') by 26.5%.

Nicholson and Wien (1983) suggested the use of short [[turfgrass]]es and [[clover]]s as living mulches to improve the resistance soil compaction. These authors established Smooth Meadow-grass (''[[Poa pratensis]]'') and white clover (''[[Trifolium repens]]'') as living mulches since they did not cause reduction of yield corn (the accompanying main crop).&lt;ref name=Nicholson&gt;Nicholson, A.G., and H.C. Wein. 1983. Screening of turfgrasses and clovers for use as living mulches in sweet corn and cabbage . J. Am Soc. Hort. Sci. 108:1071-1076&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, chewing fescue or red fescue (''[[Festuca rubra]]'') and ladino clover (''Trifolium repens'') were effective living mulches for controlling weed growth.&lt;ref name=Echtenkamp /&gt; Unfortunately, these cover crops also competed with corn for water which was particularly problematic during a dry period. The possibility of using ladino clover (''Trifolium repens'') as a potential living mulch was also mentioned; however, this clover was difficult to kill with herbicides in winter.&lt;ref name=Echtenkamp /&gt;

== Management ==
Because they compete with the main crop, living mulches may eventually need to be mechanically or chemically killed.&lt;ref name=Brandsaeter&gt;Brandsaeter, L. J. Netland, and R. Meadow 1998 Yields, weeds, pests and soil nitrogen in a white cabbage living mulch system, in Biol. Agric. Hortic. 16: 291-309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tharp&gt;Tharp, B. e., and J. J. Dells. 2001 Delayed burndown in no-tillage glyphosate-resistant corn (Zea mays) planted into soybean (Glycine max) residue and a wheat (Triticum aestivum) cover crop. Weed Technol. 15: 467-473&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to judiciously select the appropriate herbicide rate for burning down a living mulch. In 1989, Echtenkamp and Moomaw found that herbicide rates were inadequate to suppress all the living mulches.&lt;ref name=Echtenkamp /&gt; Therefore, the mulches competed with the main crop for resources. In some cases, the clover could not be killed at the first herbicide application, so a second application was needed. For another treatment, rates that were so high that they caused the cover crop to be killed too rapidly, so that broadleaf weeds invaded the corn. This study suggested that the timing and dosage of herbicide should be carefully considered.

Living mulches were tested in a no-till corn-production systems with two methods for establishing grass and legume living mulches (grass and legume) between corn rows.&lt;ref name=Echtenkamp /&gt; In 1985, there was no difference between drilling and broadcasting seeds by hand in that study. However in 1986, drilling resulted in higher populations (97 plants m-2) than broadcasting (64 plants m-2), likely because of precipitation levels. Precipitation should be considered because farmers have no control over it.

Beard (1973) recommended chewing fescue (red fescue) (''Festuca rubra'' var "commutata" var "shadow FESRU") as a good living mulch because it adapts to the shady conditions under corn and soybean.&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;Beard, J. 1973 Turfgrass: Science and Culture Prentice-Hall Inc. Englewood Cliffs, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; This grass is also well adapted to dry and poor soils.

== Plant nutrition ==
Legume cover crops have important positive effects on the nutrient cycling of tree crops.&lt;ref name=Lehmann /&gt; Leguminous living mulches work in three ways:
* Fixing the atmospheric N2 that is important for the main crop, 
* Recycling soil nutrients, and
* Enhancing soil nutrient availability for the main crop. 
Lehmann et al. (2000) measured the above ground biomass accumulation of ''[[Pueraria phaseoloides]]'', which is a living mulch used in tropical tree crops. They found that ''Pueraria'' accumulated 8.8&amp;nbsp;metric ton of dm (dry matter) ha-1 as compared with  4.4&amp;nbsp;t dm ha&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''[[Theobroma grandiflorum]]'', and 1.4&amp;nbsp;t dm ha-1  for ''[[Bactris gasipaes]]''.&lt;ref name=Lehmann /&gt; These latter two species are native cultivated species from the Amazon.

== Control of erosion ==
Vegetative cover as living mulches protect soil against wind and water erosion. Plants should form a mantle or thick mulch that protect soil from detachment. Living mulches intercept raindrops and reduce runoff. The protection that such vegetation provides against wind is influenced mainly by the amount of biomass that covers the ground (differs with each spp), plant geometry and row orientation.&lt;ref name=Trohen&gt;Trohen F and J.A. Hobbs 1991 Soil and water conservation 1991 4:83-84 and 5: 108-109 Prentice Hall Inc. Englewood Cliffs, NJ&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment, water runoff and soil loss on a 14% slope was compared for rototilled (RT), no-till with corn stover mulch (NTCMS), no-till in CSM+ birdsfoot trefoil living mulch (NT-BFT) and no till in CSM and crownvetch living mulch (NT-CV). The results indicated that the water runoff was 6,350 L ha-1 for NT-BFT, 6,350 L ha-1 NO-CSM, 5,925 L ha-1 for NT-CV, and 145,000 L ha-1 for RT. The soil loss for the RT was 14.22 t ha-1 while with the other treatments it was less than 0.5 tons ha-1. The least soil loss was obtained with NT-CV 0.02 tons ha-1.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall J, L. Hartwing, and L. Hoffman 1984 Cyanazine losses in runoff from no-tillage corn in "living mulch" and dead mulches vs. unmulched conventional tillage. J. Envoron. Qual 13: 105-110&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction of water runoff and erosion is one of the greatest advantages of having a cover crop. Soil can be easily eroded with no vegetative ground cover or plant residue. Ideally soil erosion should be less than 4 to 5 tons/ha/year.&lt;ref name=Pimentel&gt;Pimentel D., C. Harvey, P. Resosudarmo et al., 1995 Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits. Science 267: 1117-1122&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4378">A '''microlife''' is a unit of [[risk]] representing half an hour change of [[life expectancy]].&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

Introduced by [[David Spiegelhalter]] and Alejandro Leiva, microlives are intended as a simple way of communicating the impact of a lifestyle or environmental risk factor, based on the associated daily proportional effect on expected length of life. Similar to the [[micromort]] (one in a million probability of death) the microlife is intended for "rough but fair comparisons between the sizes of chronic risks".&lt;ref name="bmj"&gt;David Spiegelhalter, Using speed of ageing and "microlives" to communicate the effects of lifetime habits and environment, BMJ, 345, December 2012, doi 10.1136/bmj.e8223 [http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8223], as corrected by BMJ 2012;345:e8676 [http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e8676]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to avoid the biasing effects of describing risks in relative hazard ratios, converting them into somewhat tangible units. Similarly they bring long-term future risks into the here-and-now as a gain or loss of time. 

:"A daily loss or gain of 30 minutes can be termed a microlife, because 1 000 000 half hours (57 years) roughly corresponds to a lifetime of adult exposure."&lt;ref name="bmj" /&gt;

The microlife exploits that for small hazard ratios the change in life expectancy is roughly linear.&lt;ref&gt;Haybittle JL. The use of the Gompertz function to relate changes in life expectancy to the standardized mortality ratio. Int J Epidemiol1998;27:885-9. [http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/5/885.short]&lt;/ref&gt; They are by necessity rough estimates, based on averages over population and lifetime. Effects of individual variability, short-term or changing habits, and causal factors are not taken into account.{{cite needed|date=May 2014}}

'''Midwest Teen Sex Show''' was a comedic, semi-educational [[video podcast]] featured monthly at [http://www.MidwestTeenSexShow.com their now defunct website] with host [[Nikol Hasler]], featuring comedian Britney Barber and produced and directed by Guy Clark.

== History ==

The podcast series was created by Guy Clark and Nikol Hasler.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-09-20|url=http://sexuality.about.com/od/eroticentertainment/a/sex_interviews.htm|title= Nikol Hasler - Midwest Sexual Edu-tainment|accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Clark and Hasler attended [[Woodstock High School (Illinois)|Woodstock High School]] together,&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news|date=2008-01-09|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/i_video/main500251.shtml?id=3694425n|title=CBS Evening News report on 'Midwest Teen Sex Show'|accessdate=2008-01-19 | work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; they had not been in contact for years until they reconnected at her birthday party in 2006. Clark asked her to host the show shortly afterwards. Barber didn't meet them until after responding to an ad on [[Craigslist]].&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|date=2007-11-08|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119448733073986026|title=Sex-Ed Podcast Is Frank, Funny and Controversial|accessdate=2008-01-19 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Andrew | last=Lavallee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the show's debut, it has been wildly popular. It has even had feature stories on ''[[The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet]]'', ''[[CBS Evening News with Katie Couric]]'', and ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''.

== Overview ==

The show features tongue-in-cheek humor while providing basics on sex topics such as [[masturbation]], [[homosexuality]] and dating older men. Working on a very low budget, episodes have been filmed at Hasler's former home in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]], Clark's mother's house in [[Woodstock, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; as well as in [[Chicago]].

The episodes are normally three to five minutes long. Hasler usually performs as the sarcastic host or interviewer, while Barber plays various comedic parts, often interacting with herself as the other character. Clark has also appeared in small parts in various episodes. In early 2008, two more regular performers were added, Neil Arsenty and Larissa Zageris, who also help write the show with the trio.

The theme song is by [http://pananthem.com Gordon Tebo] (who also went to high school with Clark and Hasler) and Britney Barber holds the Midwest Teen Sex Show sign in the farm field.

"Fetishes" is the first episode to be sponsored by KoldCast.tv. Late last year, they began adding additional videos to the site besides the podcast, including short [[webisodes]] and live shows.

== Reception ==

In November 2007, more than 50,000 people were subscribing to the podcast through iTunes.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; By January 2008, that number was up to 60,000.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; By February, it was 70,000. Clark has stated the show averages 125,000 viewers an episode.&lt;ref name="nwh"&gt;{{cite web|date=2008-01-31|url=http://www.nwherald.com/articles/2008/01/31/lifestyle/columnists/doc47a14e2063c96176304740.txt|title=Begalka: Podcast hopes to offer better sex-ed lessons|accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show has had its share of controversy, particularly among sex-education teachers and therapists. While some praise it for tapping a hard-to-reach audience, others worry it's too racy for younger teens, and still others say the podcast focuses too much on humor and not enough on the facts kids need.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-11-29|url=http://www.mandjshow.com/videos/sex-ed-podcasts/|title=Clip from 'Fox Morning Show with Mike and Juliet'|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Older Boyfriend" episode, when Hasler says, "If you're in junior high and you're dating someone who's out of high school, he's a [[pedophilia|pedophile]]. And pedophilia's a disease. Would you date someone with [[cancer]]? No." The sarcastic remark (which was meant to be taken as a joke)  drew a large amount of angry responses on the program's Web site as well as emails.&lt;ref name="wsj"/&gt; When the 'Morning Show' episode re-aired in January, complaints about the remark flared up again.&lt;ref name="mtss1"&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-12-27|url=http://midwestteensexshow.com/2007/12/27/mtss-episode-12-parents/#comments|title=Viewer comments section of "Parents" episode|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; More controversy came when they started selling a satirical T-shirt that stated "[[Homosexuality]] is a choice, like cancer." Reaction was so heated and split that the creators decided to discontinue the shirt after only a week.&lt;ref name="shirt"&gt;{{cite web|date=2008-03-10|url=http://midwestteensexshow.com/2007/11/26/were-killing-cancer/|title=We're killing cancer|accessdate=2008-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's Web site has a disclaimer that "all advice given is simply opinion and should not be taken as fact."&lt;ref name="mtss2"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://midwestteensexshow.com/about|title=About at Midwest Teen Sex Show website|accessdate=2008-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television pilot ==
On May 14, 2009, [[Comedy Central]] released its 2009-10 programming slate, announcing "a TV version of the popular web series ''Midwest Teen Sex Show''," in its pilot/presentation phase of development.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-05-14|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/05/comedy-central.html|title=Comedy Central unveils development slate|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark confirmed this news two days later on the website, stating, "We’ll be taking a break from producing new episodes of the podcast as we focus on creating the sexiest most Midwesternest pilot the world has ever seen."&lt;ref name="cc2"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-05-16|url=http://midwestteensexshow.com/2009/05/16/mtss-and-comedy-central-make-sweet-love/|title=MTSS and Comedy Central Make Sweet Love|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasler also stated that the cast and crew will generally be the same "though we will be looking for a few new faces." The show will be longer but the shooting and editing style will be "true to the web show, but with the longer format we’ll be able to add some exciting new elements."&lt;ref name="cc3"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-05-15|url=http://www.tilzy.tv/midwest-teen-sex-show-signs-development-deal-with-comedy-central.htm|title=‘Midwest Teen Sex Show’ Signs Development Deal with Comedy Central|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was filmed in August in Los Angeles. Hasler announced on Facebook that Comedy Central passed on the deal on November 25.&lt;ref name="fb"&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-11-29 |url=http://www.facebook.com/nikol.hasler?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=187400577079 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121214043952/http://www.facebook.com/nikol.hasler?v=feed&amp;story_fbid=187400577079 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-14 |title= Nikol D S Hasler |accessdate=2009-11-29 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; At this time, no future plans for the show have been announced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">An '''Official Medicines Control Laboratory''' ('''OMCL''') is an official laboratory for the investigation and independent [[quality control]] of [[medicinal product]]s and other similarly regulated substances.

The OMCLs examine medicinal products as to whether they meet the conditions of content, purity, etc., as specified in the approval. It is also checked whether the labeling and the usage information are in accordance with the legal requirements. Investigations are also carried out on products suspected of being counterfeits. Another focus of the OMCLs is the product delimitation between medicines on the one hand and other products such as foodstuffs, cosmetics, medical devices, care products, etc., which is often only analytically possible.

In the United Kingdom, the OMCL is the [[National Institute for Biological Standards and Control]].

In Germany, the regional authorities coordinate their work in the [[Central Office of the Länder for Health Protection of Medicinal Products and Medical Devices]] (''Zentralstelle der Länder für Gesundheitsschutz bei Arzneimitteln und Medizinprodukten''; ZLG).

The European OMCLs are joined by the [[European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines]] (EDQM) in the so-called '''OMCL Network'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28246">'''Overscreening''', also called '''unnecessary screening''', is the performance of [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]] without a [[Indication (medicine)|medical indication]] to do so. Screening is a [[medical test]] in a healthy person who is showing no symptoms of a disease and is intended to detect a disease so that a person may prepare to respond to it. Screening is indicated in people who have some threshold risk for getting a disease, but is not indicated in people who are unlikely to develop a disease. Overscreening is a type of [[unnecessary health care]].

Overscreening is problematic because it can lead to risky or harmful additional treatment when a healthy person gets a false positive result for screening which they should not have had. It also causes unnecessary stress for the person receiving the test, and it brings unnecessary financial costs which someone pays.

The general rule is that people should only be screened for a medical condition when there is a reason to believe that they ought to be screened, such a [[medical guideline]] recommendation for screening based on evidence from a person's [[medical history]] or [[physical examination]].

Controversy and debate arises when new medical guidelines change screening recommendations.

==Definition==
[[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] is a type of [[medical test]] which is done on health people who do not show symptoms of a medical condition.&lt;ref name="definitions"&gt;
*{{cite journal|last1=Wald|first1=N J|title=Guidance on terminology|journal=Journal of Medical Screening|volume=15|issue=1|year=2008|pages=50–50|issn=0969-1413|doi=10.1258/jms.2008.008got}}
*{{cite journal|last1=Morabia|first1=A|last2=Zhang|first2=F. F.|title=History of medical screening: from concepts to action|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|volume=80|issue=946|year=2004|pages=463–469|issn=0032-5473|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2003.018226|pmid=15299156|pmc=1743082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenings are correctly performed when done on a person who has significant risk of developing a medical condition, and incorrectly performed when done on a person whose risk is not significant.&lt;ref name="definitions"/&gt;

There can be debate about when risk becomes great enough to become significant and merit a recommendation for screening, but in discussions about overscreening, this is not the cause of the problem. Overscreening almost always happens when a person is screened routinely and without any consideration of their risk for a medical condition.

One early use of the term "overscreening" as "unnecessary screening" was in 1992 in the context of cervical cancer screening.&lt;ref&gt;Please share any example of an earlier use of this term or any claim to coining this term on this article's talk page.

A 1979 paper used the term "overscreening" to mean "false positive result in a screening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knobloch|first1=H|last2=Stevens|first2=F|last3=Malone|first3=A|last4=Ellison|first4=P|last5=Risemberg|first5=H|title=The validity of parental reporting of infant development.|journal=Pediatrics|date=Jun 1979|volume=63|issue=6|pages=872–8|pmid=88036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of overscreening==

===Same causes as unnecessary health care===
{{main|Unnecessary health care}}
Overscreening is a type of unnecessary health care, so the causes of unnecessary health care are also causes of overscreening. Some causes include financial biases for physicians to recommend more treatment in health care systems using [[fee-for-service]] and [[physician self-referral]] practices; and physicians' practice of [[defensive medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/2011/11/07/how-can-we-curb-the-medical-testing-epidemic/ |title=How Can We Curb the Medical-Testing Epidemic?  |first=John |last=Horgan |work=blogs.scientificamerican.com |date=November 7, 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2012/08/12566/has-defensive-medicine-led-overtesting |title=Has 'Defensive Medicine' Led to Overtesting? |first=Leland |last=Kim |work=ucsf.edu |date=16 August 2012 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening creep===
Over time, recommendations to screen are made for populations with less risk in the past.

Clinical practice guidelines advise physicians to screen early to detect diseases.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGregor|first1=MJ|last2=Martin|first2=D|title=Testing 1, 2, 3: is overtesting undermining patient and system health?|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=Nov 2012|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1191–3, e615–7|pmid=23152453|pmc=3498009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been considered that guideline committees might not appropriately do [[cost-effectiveness analysis]], consider [[opportunity cost]], or evaluate risks to patients when they broaden screening recommendations.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt;

===Diagnostic creep===
Over time, the indicators for making a diagnosis are lower so that people with fewer symptoms are diagnosed with a disease sooner. Additionally, new diseases are named and treatment is recommended, including "subclinical diseases", "preclinical diseases", or "pseudodiseases", which are described as early versions of a disease which has not manifested.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herman |first1=CR |last2=Gill |first2=HK |last3=Eng |first3=J |last4=Fajardo |first4=LL |title=Screening for preclinical disease: test and disease characteristics. |journal=AJR. American Journal of Roentgenology |date=Oct 2002 |volume=179 |issue=4 |pages=825–31 |pmid=12239019 |doi=10.2214/ajr.179.4.1790825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient demand===
Patient demand is a sort of [[self-diagnosis]] in which patients request treatment regardless of whether the treatment they request is medically indicated.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt; Causes for patients requesting treatment include increased access to [[health information on the Internet]] and [[direct-to-consumer advertising]].&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkes|first1=MS|last2=Bell|first2=RA|last3=Kravitz|first3=RL|title=Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising: trends, impact, and implications.|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|date=Mar–Apr 2000|volume=19|issue=2|pages=110–28|pmid=10718026|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.19.2.110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical concerns of screening under these circumstances have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=JJ|last2=Deyo|first2=RA|title=Patient self-referral for radiologic screening tests: clinical and ethical concerns.|journal=The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice / American Board of Family Practice|date=Nov–Dec 2003|volume=16|issue=6|pages=494–501|pmid=14963076|doi=10.3122/jabfm.16.6.494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction tricks by physicians===
Physicians sometimes use screening as a [[placebo]] for patients who wish to have some kind of care.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt; The physician may recommend screening to placate the patient's demand for fast recovery in times when the recommended action would be to do nothing except wait.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt; Research suggests that patients are more satisfied with their treatment when it is or seems expensive because patients believe that the more care they get, even if it is not necessary, then at least doing something is better than doing nothing.&lt;ref name="McGregor2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=JJ|last2=Jerant|first2=AF|last3=Bertakis|first3=KD|last4=Franks|first4=P|title=The cost of satisfaction: a national study of patient satisfaction, health care utilization, expenditures, and mortality.|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|date=Mar 12, 2012|volume=172|issue=5|pages=405–11|pmid=22331982|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.1662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against overscreening==
{{main|Unnecessary health care}}

Overscreening is a type of unnecessary health care. One study about unnecessary screening before surgery reported that physicians order unnecessary tests because of tradition in the practice of medicine, anticipation that other physicians will expect the test results when they see the patient, [[defensive medicine]], worries that a surgery may be canceled if the test is not done, and lack of understanding about when a test is actually indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=SR|last2=Brown|first2=J|title=Why do physicians order unnecessary preoperative tests? A qualitative study.|journal=Family medicine|date=May 2011|volume=43|issue=5|pages=338–43|pmid=21557104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False positive medical test results===
A false positive medical test result is a [[false-positive test result]] of [[Screening (medicine)|medical screening]].&lt;ref name="definitions"/&gt; It happens when a test indicates that a person has a [[medical condition]] when actually the person does not.&lt;ref name="definitions"/&gt;

Overscreening can be a problem because it can generate a false positive medical test result in a healthy person who does not have the medical condition which screening is supposed to detect.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref name="false positive replace this source"&gt;Better citations are needed. The following sources describe the consequences of false positive results for certain conditions. No source is identified which says, "In general for many conditions false positive results are problematic." In these sources, it is said that for the conditions described, false positive results lead to undesirable consequences. The sources seem to presume that all health care providers know the concept of a "false positive" and that it is not a desirable outcome without explaining why generally. Perhaps some textbook describes this concept?

In general, people should not have medical screening unless the screening is [[Indication (medicine)|indicated]] by the person's [[medical history]], a [[physical examination]], and a [[medical guideline]].&lt;ref name="false positive replace this source"/&gt; The rationale for this is that in cases in which a person is unlikely to have a medical condition, it can be more likely that a test will give a false positive result than it would be for the test to detect something which is unlikely considering the person's medical history.&lt;ref name="false positive replace this source"/&gt; If a false positive result does occur in a patient unlikely to have that disease, then that patient will be likely to seek treatment.&lt;ref name="false positive replace this source"/&gt;

===Unnecessary costs===
Overscreening tends to happen more in circumstances in which [[medical billing]] happens based on [[fee-for-service]] models rather than [[bundled payment]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;This sort talks about overscreening without using the term and without being an authoritative review article.
*{{cite journal|last1=Fuchs|first1=Victor R.|title=Eliminating "Waste" in Health Care|journal=JAMA|date=9 December 2009|volume=302|issue=22|pages=2481–2|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1821|pmid=19996406}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this is because health care providers have incentive to provide more services to increase their revenue.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"/&gt; Furthermore, when patients are shielded from [[cost sharing]], that also tends to increase rates of overscreening as when patients pay nothing for additional treatment, they tend to request more services even when they are not indicated.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"/&gt;

==Overscreening examples==

===Cancer screening===

====Prostate cancer screening====
{{See also|Prostate cancer screening}}
The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] ([[USPSTF]]) recommended against PSA screening in healthy men finding that the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits.&lt;ref name="GHarris"&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Gardner |title=U.S. Panel Says No to Prostate Screening for Healthy Men |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/health/07prostate.html |date=6 October 2011 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines from the American Urological Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=KL|author2=Albertsen, PC; Babaian, RJ; Carter, HB; Gann, PH; Han, M; Kuban, DA; Sartor, AO; Stanford, JL; Zietman, A; Carroll, P; American Urological, Association|title=Prostate specific antigen best practice statement: 2009 update|journal=The Journal of Urology|date=January 2013|volume=189|issue=1 Suppl|pages=S2–S11|pmid=23234625|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2012.11.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Cancer Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolf|first=AM|author2=Wender, RC; Etzioni, RB; Thompson, IM; D'Amico, AV; Volk, RJ; Brooks, DD; Dash, C; Guessous, I; Andrews, K; DeSantis, C; Smith, RA; American Cancer Society Prostate Cancer Advisory, Committee|title=American Cancer Society guideline for the early detection of prostate cancer: update 2010|journal=CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians|date=Mar–Apr 2010|volume=60|issue=2|pages=70–98|pmid=20200110|doi=10.3322/caac.20066}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommend that men be informed of the risks and benefits of screening.  The [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] recommends screening be discouraged in those who are expected to live less than ten years, while in those with a life expectancy of greater than ten years a decision should be made by the person in question based on the potential risks and benefits.  In general, they conclude that based on recent research, "it is uncertain whether the benefits associated with PSA testing for prostate cancer screening are worth the harms associated with screening and subsequent unnecessary treatment." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basch|first=E|author2=Oliver, TK |author3=Vickers, A |author4=Thompson, I |author5=Kantoff, P |author6=Parnes, H |author7=Loblaw, DA |author8=Roth, B |author9=Williams, J |author10= Nam, RK |title=Screening for Prostate Cancer With Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing: American Society of Clinical Oncology Provisional Clinical Opinion.|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology|date=Jul 16, 2012|pmid=22802323|url=http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2012/07/16/JCO.2012.43.3441.full.pdf|doi=10.1200/JCO.2012.43.3441|volume=30|issue=24|pages=3020–5|pmc=3776923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breast cancer screening====
{{See also|Breast cancer screening}}
Recommendations to attend to mammography screening vary across countries and organizations, with the most common difference being the age at which screening should begin, and how frequently or if it should be performed, among women at typical risk for developing breast cancer. Some other organizations recommend mammograms begin as early as age 40 in normal-risk women, and take place more frequently, up to once each year. Women at higher risk may benefit from earlier or more frequent screening. Women with one or more first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) with premenopausal breast cancer often begin screening at an earlier age, perhaps at an age 10 years younger than the age when the relative was diagnosed with breast cancer.

===Heart related tests===

====Electrocardiography====

====Heart imaging stress tests====
{{See also|Cardiac stress test}}
Cardiac stress tests, including stress [[echocardiography]] and nuclear stress tests, are used to detect a block in blood flow to the heart. They do this by taking pictures of the heart while the heart is exercising. Persons who have symptoms of heart disease or who are high risk for a heart attack may need this test, while people without these symptoms and who are low risk generally do not.&lt;ref name="AAOSfive"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1 = American Society of Nuclear Cardiology |author1-link = American Society of Nuclear Cardiology |date = February 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Society of Nuclear Cardiology |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-society-of-nuclear-cardiology/ |accessdate = 1 July 2014|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====Coronary computed tomography====
Coronary artery calcium scoring is a diagnosic test in the field of cardiovascular [[x-ray computed tomography]]. It is used to screen for [[coronary artery disease]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4113">'''Poems in the Waiting Room''' (PitWR) is a U.K.-based and registered arts in health charity. The main aim of the charity is to supply short collections of poems for patients in [[National Health Service]] [[General practitioner|General Practice]] [[waiting room]]s to read while waiting to see their doctor. The aim is to promote [[poetry]], and to make the paient's wait more pleasant. The service is free to the waiting rooms and general practice managers, and is supported by grants and donations. The poems are presented as A4 sized three-fold cards typically reproducing between six and eight poems. Batches of cards are printed and distributed to waiting rooms four times a year. Patients are invited to take the cards away with them.

An additional service provided by the charity is 'PiTWR for Hospitals'. This provides larger print-runs of the poetry cards for distribution in [[hospitals]]. These are adapted to display the hospitals own message and sponsorship details.

A key consideration for the charity is the selection of poems. Guidelines for the selection of poems have been devised with this in mind, and with help from a consultant psychiatrist as well as from poets.  To quote the Editor "In a patient centred health service, poetry arts in health too needs to be patient centred.  The readers are patients – the worried well and the worried sick. The poems selected draw from the springs of well-being. In time of trouble, a measure of comfort is welcome". The selection of poems is therefore different from, for example, the poetry that patients may themselves write as [[writing therapy]]. Poems selected for inclusion in PiTWR collections are a mix of contemporary work and poems from the canon of English poetry. Translations of poems from other traditions are also included. The essential is that they all contain positive images of hope, home, security, safe journey and arrival, beauty and transcendence, love and loving. The approach is indeed more akin to [[bibliotherapy]] rather than art therapy. Submissions from poets are encouraged, and a set of guidelines is provided to indicate the sort of poetry that meets the need of the charity.

In addition to the selection, production and distribution of the poetry cards the charity also undertakes research into the cost effectiveness of the scheme, and supports related arts in health initiatives. Recent work focusses on the extension of the scheme to support the production of special editions tailored for distribution in hospitals, rather than general practice waiting rooms. Collaborative work with other arts in health or literature based organisations, such as [[The Reader (magazine)]] is actively pursued.

==Organisation==

Poems in the Waiting Room, Registered Charity (No. 1099033), is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee (04836215) and is managed by the trustee body and executive committee, providing professional advice in literary and executive editing, production and distribution of the poetry cards.

The executive committee has been expanded since the retirement and death of the founder, Michael Lee, formerly Executive Chairman. The Chair is now held by [[Serge Lourie]] who took over on the retirement of Wendy French; Edmund Simon Lee is Honorary Chief Executive; Helen Lee is Honorary Secretary and became Editor on the retirement of Isobel Montgomery Campbell; Ciorsdan Glass is Executive Editor; Elizabeth Mary Anne Patience Consultant Analytical Psychologist; Michael Sheridan Stone is Director of PitWR Worldwide.  

The UK-based charity has attracted wider attention, and encourages collaboration with projects set up in other countries, where these projects adopt the same editorial policy. Examples include Poems in the Waiting Room [[New Zealand]] established in 2008, based at [[Dunedin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9121">'''Professional [[social worker]]s''' are generally considered those who hold a professional degree in social work. In a number of countries and jurisdictions, [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers is required and there are mandated qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, the professional association sets academic and experiential requirements for admission to membership.

==United States==
{{main|Council on Social Work Education|Master of Social Work}}

A social worker, practicing in the [[United States]], usually requires a [[doctoral degree]] (Ph.D or DSW), [[master's degree]] ([[Master of Social Work|MSW]]) or a [[bachelor's degree]] (BSW or BASW) in social work from a Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) accredited program to receive a license in most states. In some areas, however, a social worker may be able to receive a license with a bachelor's or even associate degree{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} in any discipline. The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW) is the largest organization of professional social workers in the United States.

Depending on the university, the four-year degree may be structured in different ways and draws upon many fields, including social work theory, psychology, human development, sociology, social policy, research methods, social planning and social administration.

A person with a BSW is considered a "generalist" and the MSW is considered "a specialist or advanced generalist"; a Ph.D. or D.S.W. (Doctor of Social Work) generally conducts research, teaches, or analyzes policy, often in higher education settings.

Various states in the United States "protect" the use of the title social worker by statute.  Use of the title requires licensure or certification in most states. The licensure or certification also requires a prelicensure examination through the ASWB (Association of Social Work Boards), with the exception of the State of California, who creates and administers their own licensing exam. Over half of all states offer licensure at various levels of social work practice, and [[clinical social work]] is regulated by licensure in all states. The pass rate for the Master's level licensing exam is around 74%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aswb.org/SWLE/passrates.asp ASWB : : Social Work Licensing Exams] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416031049/http://www.aswb.org/SWLE/passrates.asp |date=April 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
A four-year Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) is required for entry into the field in most parts of Canada. In Alberta, the entry-level requirement is the diploma in social work practice. A Master's degree in Social Work (MSW) is usually required to provide psychotherapy treatment. Authorized Social Workers with advanced clinical certification in Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan are allowed to independently use the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) in order to make a mental health diagnosis. These provinces hold a clinical registry for this purpose. In the province of Nova Scotia, MSW social workers can make provisional mental health diagnosis'.

In order to legally use the title "social worker", candidates must register with their provincial regulatory body. Some provinces also require an exam prerequisite for certification through the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB).

==United Kingdom==
The main qualification for social work is the [[undergraduate]] Bachelor's degree (BA, BSc or BSW) in social work, offered at [[British universities]] from September 2003 onwards. There is also available a master's degree (MA, MSc or MSW). These have replaced the previous qualifying award, the undergraduate Diploma in Social Work (DipSW), although the postgraduate counterpart, the postgraduate Diploma in Social Work (PGDipSW) is still awarded and allows the holder to register and practice as a social worker.  The DipSW was first awarded in 1991 and phased out across the UK by 2009. Prior to this, the recognised qualification was the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work (CQSW), awarded between 1975 and 1991.

Purporting to be either a social worker or a student social worker without registering with the relevant Social Work Register and holding or undergoing training for the recognised qualifications is now a [[criminal offence]]. Social workers must renew their registration every two years. These regulations offer protection to vulnerable people by guaranteeing the professional regulation of people working as social workers. They also promote workforce development, as all social workers must participate in at least fifteen days of professional training over a two-year period in order to be eligible for renewal of their registration.

Non-registered or non-qualified social care practitioners in the United Kingdom, often referred to as Social Services Assistants, Child and Family Workers or Community Care Assistant or Community Care Workers (not to be confused with domiciliary or care home care workers), are unregistered social care practitioners that often do not hold any formal social work qualification and they must practice under the direct supervision of a registered social worker. This is not the case in Scotland where the scope of [https://web.archive.org/web/20091023204444/http://www.sssc.uk.com/All+about+Registration/What+are+the+timescales+for+registration/What+are+the+timescales+for+registration.htm registration for social service workers] is more advanced.

Within the mental health sector in the United Kingdom, social workers can train as an [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] and [https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Applying%20for%20Approved%20Clinician%20Approval.pdf Approved Clinicians].  With the implementation of the [[Mental Health Act 2007]], this had replaced the previous [[Approved Social Worker]] role and is open to other professionals such as community psychiatric nurses, psychologists and occupational therapists, whilst maintaining a social work ethos. AMHPs are responsible for organising and contributing to assessments under the [[Mental Health Act 1983]], as amended by the Mental Health Act 2007.

After qualifying, social workers can undertake further training under the social work 'Post-Qualifying Framework'. Before 2007, there were four awards available under this framework:
*Post-Qualifying Award - for advanced social work practice and management
*Mental Health - Training to become an [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] or AMHP, which may lead to being appointed as an [https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Applying%20for%20Approved%20Clinician%20Approval.pdf Approved Clinician] with further postgraduate and doctorate training.  
*Child Care Award - qualification to work with children and young people
*Practice Teaching Award - qualification to work as a tutor, supervisor and assessor for social work students on their work placement

In 2007, the [[General Social Care Council]] and UK partners implemented a new framework which unified these awards in a simpler structure allowing broader study to count towards three levels of social work award: specialist, higher specialist, and advanced.

==Australia==
A four-year Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) is required for entry into the occupation of Social Worker in Australia, although some universities also offer a two-year, accelerated, graduate-entry MSW. Graduates of courses recognised by the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW) are eligible for membership. A person with overseas qualifications can apply for consideration of recognition of their qualifications via a formal application for assessment by the AASW. Australia is alone among developed [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]] [[OECD]] countries in having no [[licensure|registration]] requirements for social workers. Most employers stipulate that applicants must be ''eligible'' for membership of the [http://www.aasw.asn.au/membership-information/aasw-membership-eligibility-international-qualified-social-workers  AASW], and only graduates of courses recognised by the AASW are eligible for membership. However AASW membership is not compulsory and only a third of social workers are members.  Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is an ongoing requirement of accredited membership of the AASW and must incorporate accountability, gaining new knowledge and information &amp; skill development (CPD Policy 2011/12, AASW). No such requirement exists for non-members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aasw.asn.au/whatwedo/registration-campaign AASW registration campaign]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandinavia==
{{main|Socionom}}
''Socionom'' is the Swedish and Danish term for a person with a degree in social work and related subjects.  In Sweden the "socionom"/Bachelor of Social Work education is 3.5 years.

{{infobox radon}}
'''Radon''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Rn''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;86. It is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]], colorless, odorless, tasteless&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/radon/citizens-guide-radon-guide-protecting-yourself-and-your-family-radon |title=A Citizen's Guide to Radon: The Guide to Protecting Yourself and Your Family from Radon|publisher=Epa.gov |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[noble gas]]. It occurs naturally in minute quantities as an intermediate step in the normal radioactive [[decay chain]]s through which [[thorium]] and [[uranium]] slowly decay into [[lead]] and various other short-lived radioactive elements; radon itself is the immediate [[decay product]] of [[radium]]. Its most stable [[isotope]], [[Radon-222|&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn]], has a [[half-life]] of only 3.8 days, making radon one of the rarest elements since it decays away so quickly. However, since thorium and uranium are two of the most common radioactive elements on Earth, and they have three isotopes with very long half-lives, on the order of several billions of years, radon will be present on Earth long into the future in spite of its short half-life as it is continually being generated. The decay of radon produces many other short-lived nuclides known as radon daughters, ending at stable isotopes of [[lead]].&lt;ref name=USPHS90&gt;[http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvstox/i/fulltext/toxprofiles/radon.pdf Toxicological profile for radon], [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]], U.S. Public Health Service, In collaboration with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, December 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all the other intermediate elements in the aforementioned decay chains, radon is, under normal conditions, gaseous and easily inhaled. Radon gas is considered a health hazard. It is often the single largest contributor to an individual's [[background radiation]] dose, but due to local differences in geology,&lt;ref name=Kusky&gt;{{cite book |title=Geological Hazards: A Sourcebook |first=Timothy M. |last=Kusky |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZnARN4s-WRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover |pages=236–239|isbn=9781573564694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the level of the radon-gas hazard differs from location to location. Despite its short lifetime, radon gas from natural sources, such as uranium-containing minerals, can accumulate in buildings, especially, due to its high density, in low areas such as basements and crawl spaces. Radon can also occur in ground water – for example, in some [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] waters and hot springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Radon|publisher=Facts about|url=http://www.facts-about.org.uk/science-element-radon.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222004131/http://www.facts-about.org.uk/science-element-radon.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-02-22|accessdate=2008-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epidemiological]] studies have shown a clear link between breathing high concentrations of radon and incidence of [[lung cancer]]. Radon is a contaminant that affects [[indoor air quality]] worldwide. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking, causing 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the [[United States]]. About 2,900 of these deaths occur among people who have never smoked. While radon is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, it is the number one cause among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates.&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; As radon itself decays, it produces decay products, which are other radioactive elements called radon daughters (also known as radon progeny). Unlike the gaseous radon itself, radon daughters are solids and stick to surfaces, such as dust particles in the air. If such contaminated dust is inhaled, these particles can also cause lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/consumer/community-health/environmental-health/exposure-topics/radiation/radon/public-health-fact-sheet-on-radon.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121032816/http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/consumer/community-health/environmental-health/exposure-topics/radiation/radon/public-health-fact-sheet-on-radon.html |archivedate=2011-11-21 |title=Public Health Fact Sheet on Radon&amp;nbsp;— Health and Human Services |publisher=Mass.Gov |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Radon spectrum.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[Emission spectrum]] of radon, photographed by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1908. Numbers at the side of the spectrum are wavelengths. The middle spectrum is of radon, while the outer two are of [[helium]] (added to calibrate the wavelengths).]]

===Physical properties===
Radon is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas and therefore is not detectable by human senses alone. At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], radon forms a [[monatomic gas]] with a density of 9.73&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 8 times the density of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] at sea level, 1.217&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Williams|first=David R.|date=2007-04-19|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|title=Earth Fact Sheet|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon is one of the densest gases at room temperature and is the densest of the noble gases. Although colorless at standard temperature and pressure, when cooled below its [[freezing point]] of {{convert|202|K}}, radon emits a brilliant [[radioluminescence]] that turns from yellow to orange-red as the temperature lowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele086.html|title=Radon |publisher=Jefferson Lab}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon [[condensation]], radon glows because of the intense radiation it produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Noble Gases|first=Jens|last=Thomas |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T0Iiv0BJ1E0C&amp;pg=PA13|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|date=2002|isbn=978-0-7614-1462-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon is sparingly [[soluble]] in water, but more soluble than lighter noble gases. Radon is appreciably more soluble in organic liquids than in water.

===Chemical properties===
Being a noble gas, radon is chemically not very reactive. However, the 3.8-day half-life of radon-222 makes it useful in physical sciences as a natural [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]]. Because radon is a gas at standard conditions, unlike its parents, it can readily be extracted from them for research.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

Radon is a member of the zero-[[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] elements that are called noble gases. It is [[Inert gas|inert]] to most common chemical reactions, such as combustion, because the outer [[valence shell]] contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the outer electrons are tightly bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bader|first=Richard F. W.|url=http://miranda.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/|title=An Introduction to the Electronic Structure of Atoms and Molecules|publisher=[[McMaster University]]|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1037&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol is required to extract one electron from its shells (also known as the [[first ionization energy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David R. Lide |title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition=84th|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|date=2003|chapter=Section 10, Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics; Ionization Potentials of Atoms and Atomic Ions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with [[Periodic table|periodic trends]], radon has a lower [[electronegativity]] than the element one period before it, [[xenon]], and is therefore more reactive.  Early studies concluded that the stability of radon [[hydrate]] should be of the same order as that of the hydrates of [[chlorine]] ({{chem|Cl|2}}) or [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}), and significantly higher than the stability of the hydrate of [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1070/RC1982v051n01ABEH002787|title=The Chemistry of Radon|date=1982|author=Avrorin, V V|journal=[[Russian Chemical Reviews]]|volume=51|issue=1|page=12|last2=Krasikova|first2=R.

If a closed volume is constantly supplied with radon, the concentration of short-lived isotopes will increase until an equilibrium is reached where the rate of decay of each decay product will equal that of the radon itself. The equilibrium factor is 1 when both activities are equal, meaning that the decay products have stayed close to the radon parent long enough for the equilibrium to be reached, within a couple of hours. Under these conditions each additional pCi/L of radon will increase exposure, by 0.01&amp;nbsp;WL ([[Working level|Working Level]] -a measure of radioactivity commonly used in mining. A detailed explanation of WL is given in Concentration Units). These conditions are not always met; in many homes, the equilibrium fraction is typically 40%; that is, there will be 0.004&amp;nbsp;WL of daughters for each pCi/L of radon in air.&lt;ref name="EPA03"/&gt; &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb takes much longer (decades) to come in equilibrium with radon, but, if the environment permits accumulation of dust over extended periods of time, &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb and its decay products may contribute to overall radiation levels as well.

Because of their electrostatic charge, radon progenies adhere to surfaces or dust particles, whereas gaseous radon does not. Attachment removes them from the air, usually causing the equilibrium factor in the atmosphere to be less than one. The equilibrium factor is also lowered by air circulation or air filtration devices, and is increased by airborne dust particles, including cigarette smoke. In high concentrations, airborne radon isotopes contribute significantly to human health risk. The equilibrium factor found in epidemiological studies is 0.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YDRCCNibEqYC&amp;pg=PA179|page=179|title=Health effects of exposure to radon, Volume 6 of BEIR (Series)|publisher=National Academies Press|date=1999|isbn=978-0-309-05645-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The danger of high exposure to radon in mines, where exposures can reach 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, has long been known. In 1530, [[Paracelsus]] described a wasting disease of miners, the ''mala metallorum'', and [[Georg Agricola]] recommended ventilation in mines to avoid this mountain sickness (''Bergsucht'').&lt;ref&gt;Masse, Roland (2002) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009164542/http://www.radon-france.com/pdf/historique.pdf Le radon, aspects historiques et perception du risque]. radon-france.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090116120009/http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/radon/whosat_risk.html Radon Toxicity: Who is at Risk?], Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, this condition was identified as lung cancer by Harting and Hesse in their investigation of miners from Schneeberg, Germany. The first major studies with radon and health occurred in the context of [[uranium mining]] in the [[Joachimsthal]] region of [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref&gt;Proctor, Robert N. ''The Nazi War on Cancer''.

The presence of radon in indoor air was documented as early as 1950. Beginning in the 1970s research was initiated to address sources of indoor radon, determinants of concentration, health effects, and mitigation approaches. In the United States, the problem of indoor radon received widespread publicity and intensified investigation after a widely publicized incident in 1984. During routine monitoring at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant, a worker was found to be contaminated with radioactivity. A high concentration of radon in his home was subsequently identified as responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samet |first=J.

All discussions of radon concentrations in the environment refer to &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn. While the average rate of production of &lt;sup&gt;220&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (from the thorium decay series) is about the same as that of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn, the amount of &lt;sup&gt;220&lt;/sup&gt;Rn in the environment is much less than that of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn because of the short half-life of &lt;sup&gt;220&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (55 seconds, versus 3.8 days respectively).&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

An exposure to 1&amp;nbsp;WL for 1 working month (170 hours) equals 1&amp;nbsp;WLM cumulative exposure. A cumulative exposure of 1&amp;nbsp;WLM is roughly equivalent to living one year in an atmosphere with a radon concentration of 230&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222042407/http://www-carmin.cea.fr/espace-pedagogique/rayonnements-ionisants-et-sante/les-radionucleides/radon-rn Radon (Rn)].

Radon is produced by the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is found in uranium ores, phosphate rock, shales, igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, and schist, and to a lesser degree, in common rocks such as limestone.&lt;ref name=Kusky/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thad.

Radon concentration can differ widely from place to place. In the open air, it ranges from 1 to 100&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, even less (0.1&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) above the ocean. In caves or aerated mines, or ill-aerated houses, its concentration climbs to 20–2,000&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Sperrin, Malcolm| author2=Gillmore, Gavin| author3=Denman, Tony| date=2001| title=Radon concentration variations in a Mendip cave cluster| journal=Environmental Management and Health| volume=12|page=476|doi=10.1108/09566160110404881| issue=5| url=http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/1666/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon concentration can be much higher in mining contexts. Ventilation regulations instruct to maintain radon concentration in uranium mines under the "working level", with 95th percentile levels ranging up to nearly 3&amp;nbsp;WL (546&amp;nbsp;pCi &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn per liter of air; 20.2&amp;nbsp;kBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, measured from 1976 to 1985).&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

Radon mostly appears with the decay chain of the radium and [[uranium]] series (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn), and marginally with the thorium series (&lt;sup&gt;220&lt;/sup&gt;Rn). The element emanates naturally from the ground, and some building materials, all over the world, wherever traces of uranium or [[thorium]] can be found, and particularly in regions with soils containing [[granite]] or [[shale]], which have a higher concentration of uranium. Not all granitic regions are prone to high emissions of radon. Being a rare gas, it usually migrates freely through faults and fragmented soils, and may accumulate in caves or water. Owing to its very short half-life (four days for [[Radon-222|&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn]]), radon concentration decreases very quickly when the distance from the production area increases. Radon concentration varies greatly with season and atmospheric conditions. For instance, it has been shown to accumulate in the air if there is a [[Inversion (meteorology)|meteorological inversion]] and little wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Steck, Daniel J.|author2=Field, R.

Natural radon concentrations in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] are so low that radon-rich water in contact with the atmosphere will continually lose radon by [[volatilization]].

Radon is found in some [[petroleum]]. Because radon has a similar pressure and temperature curve to [[propane]], and [[oil refineries]] separate petrochemicals based on their boiling points, the piping carrying freshly separated propane in oil refineries can become radioactive because of decaying radon and its products.&lt;ref name="neb-one1994"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=National Energy Board|accessdate=2009-07-07|url= http://www.neb-one.gc.ca/clf-nsi/rsftyndthnvrnmnt/sfty/sftydvsr/1994/nbs199401-eng.pdf|title=Potential for Elevated Radiation Levels In Propane|date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residues from the petroleum and [[natural gas]] industry often contain radium and its daughters. The sulfate scale from an [[oil well]] can be radium rich, while the water, oil, and gas from a well often contains radon.

Indoor radon concentration is usually assumed to follow a [[lognormal distribution]] on a given territory.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous references, see for instance [http://www.geology.cz/extranet/vav/geochemie-zp/radon/sympozia/2006/radon-2006-258-265.pdf Analysis And Modelling Of Indoor Radon Distributions Using Extreme Values Theory] or [http://www.geology.cz/extranet/vav/geochemie-zp/radon/sympozia/2006/radon-2006-252-257.pdf Indoor Radon in Hungary (Lognormal Mysticism)] for a discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the [[geometric mean]] is generally used for estimating the "average" radon concentration in an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aprg.utoledo.edu/radon/datacoll.html|title=Data Collection and Statistical Computations |accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mean concentration ranges from less than 10&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to over 100&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in some European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|accessdate=17 August 2013|url=http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2006/09-81160_Report_Annex_E_2006_Web.pdf|publisher=United Nations|date=2008|format=PDF|work=Report of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (2006)|volume=2|pages=209–10|title=Annex E: Sources to effects assessment for radon in homes and workplaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical [[geometric standard deviation]]s found in studies range between 2 and 3, meaning (given the [[68–95–99.7 rule]]) that the radon concentration is expected to be more than a hundred times the mean concentration for 2 to 3% of the cases.

In a few locations, [[uranium tailings]] have been used for [[landfills]] and were subsequently built on, resulting in possible increased exposure to radon.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt;

Since radon is a colorless, odorless gas the only way to know how much is present in the air or water is to perform tests. In the United States radon test kits are available to the public at retail stores, such as hardware stores, for home use and testing is available through licensed professionals, who are often [[home inspector]]s. Efforts to reduce indoor radon levels are called [[radon mitigation]]. In the U.S. the Environmental Protection Agency recommends all houses be tested for radon.

===Industrial production===
Radon is obtained as a by-product of [[Uranium ore deposits|uraniferous ores]] processing after transferring into 1% solutions of [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] or [[hydrobromic acid]]s. The gas mixture extracted from the solutions contains {{chem|H|2}}, {{chem|O|2}}, He, Rn, {{chem|CO|2}}, {{chem|H|2|O}} and [[hydrocarbon]]s. The mixture is purified by passing it over copper at 720&amp;nbsp;°C to remove the {{chem|H|2}} and the {{chem|O|2}}, and then [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]] and [[Phosphorus pentoxide|{{chem|P|2|O|5}}]] are used to remove the acids and moisture by [[sorption]]. Radon is condensed by liquid nitrogen and purified from residue gases by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rn-radon.info/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028133937/http://rn-radon.info/production.html|archivedate=2008-10-28|title=Radon Production |publisher=Rn-radon.info |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon commercialization is regulated, but it is available in small quantities for the calibration of &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn measurement systems, at a price of almost $6,000 per milliliter of radium solution (which only contains about 15 picograms of actual radon at a given moment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=https://www-s.nist.gov/srmors/view_detail.cfm?srm=4972|title= SRM 4972&amp;nbsp;– Radon-222 Emanation Standard |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Radon is produced by a solution of [[radium-226]] (half-life of 1600 years). Radium-226 decays by alpha-particle emission, producing radon that collects over samples of radium-226 at a rate of about 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day per gram of radium; equilibrium is quickly achieved and radon is produced in a steady flow, with an activity equal to that of the radium (50 Bq). Gaseous &lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (half-life of about four days) escapes from the capsule through diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Collé, R.|author2=R.

==Applications==

===Medical===
{{Main|Radioactive quackery}}
An early-20th-century form of [[quackery]] was the treatment of maladies in a [[radiotorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Clinique, Volume 34| publisher=Illinois Homeopathic Medical Association| date=1913| url=https://books.google.com/?id=KM5XAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=%2Bradiotorium| accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a small, sealed room for patients to be exposed to radon for its "medicinal effects". The carcinogenic nature of radon due to its ionizing radiation became apparent later on. Radon's molecule-damaging radioactivity has been used to kill cancerous cells,&lt;ref name="Radon seeds"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.orau.org/ptp/collection/brachytherapy/seeds.htm |title= Radon seeds| accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it does not increase the health of healthy cells. The ionizing radiation causes the formation of [[free radicals]], which results in genetic and other cell damage, resulting in increased rates of illness, including [[cancer]].

Exposure to radon, a process known as [[radiation hormesis]], has been suggested to mitigate [[autoimmune disease]]s such as [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2143|title=Radon Health Mines: Boulder and Basin, Montana|publisher= Roadside America|accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hg&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neda, T|title=Radon concentration levels in dry CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emanations from Harghita Băi, Romania, used for curative purposes |volume=277|issue=3|date=2008|doi=10.1007/s10967-007-7169-0|journal=[[Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry]]|page=685|display-authors=1|last2=Szakács|first2=A.|last3=Mócsy|first3=I.|last4=Cosma|first4=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in the late 20th century and early 21st century, "health mines" established in [[Basin, Montana]] attracted people seeking relief from health problems such as arthritis through limited exposure to radioactive mine water and radon. The practice is discouraged because of the well-documented ill effects of high-doses of radiation on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salak|first1=Kara|last2=Nordeman |first2=Landon|title=59631: Mining for Miracles|journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2004|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0401/feature7/index.html|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radioactive water baths have been applied since 1906 in [[Jáchymov]], Czech Republic, but even before radon discovery they were used in [[Bad Gastein]], Austria. Radium-rich springs are also used in traditional Japanese [[onsen]] in [[Misasa, Tottori|Misasa]], [[Tottori Prefecture]]. Drinking therapy is applied in [[Bad Brambach]], Germany. Inhalation therapy is carried out in [[Gasteiner-Heilstollen]], Austria, in [[Świeradów-Zdrój]], [[Czerniawa-Zdrój]], [[Kowary]], [[Lądek Zdrój]], Poland, in [[Harghita Băi]], Romania, and in [[Boulder, Montana|Boulder]], United States. In the US and Europe there are several "radon [[destination spa|spas]]", where people sit for minutes or hours in a high-radon atmosphere in the belief that low doses of radiation will invigorate or energize them.&lt;ref name=Hg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26 |url=http://www.petros.cz/spa/spa_ja.asp |title=Jáchymov |publisher=Petros |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020107060646/http://www.petros.cz/spa/spa_ja.asp |archivedate=January 7, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon has been produced commercially for use in radiation therapy, but for the most part has been replaced by radionuclides made in &lt;!--Particle?--&gt;accelerators and [[nuclear reactor]]s. Radon has been used in implantable seeds, made of gold or glass, primarily [[Brachytherapy|used to treat cancers]].
The gold seeds were produced by filling a long tube with radon pumped from a radium source, the tube being then divided into short sections by crimping and cutting. The gold layer keeps the radon within, and filters out the alpha and beta radiations, while allowing the [[gamma ray]]s to escape (which kill the diseased tissue). The activities might range from 0.05 to 5 millicuries per seed (2 to 200&amp;nbsp;MBq).&lt;ref name="Radon seeds"/&gt; The gamma rays are produced by radon and the first short-lived elements of its decay chain (&lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Bi, &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Po).

Radon and its first decay products being very short-lived, the seed is left in place. After 12 half-lives (43 days), radon radioactivity is at 1/2000 of its original level. At this stage, the predominant residual activity originates from the radon decay product &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, whose half-life (22.3 years) is 2000 times that of radon (and whose activity is thus 1/2000 of radon's), and its descendants &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Bi and &lt;sup&gt;210&lt;/sup&gt;Po.

===Scientific===
Radon emanation from the soil varies with soil type and with surface uranium content, so outdoor radon concentrations can be used to track air masses to a limited degree. This fact has been put to use by some atmospheric scientists. Because of radon's rapid loss to air and comparatively rapid decay, radon is used in [[hydrology|hydrologic]] research that studies the interaction between groundwater and [[stream]]s. Any significant concentration of radon in a stream is a good indicator that there are local inputs of groundwater.

Radon soil-concentration has been used in an experimental way to map buried close-subsurface geological [[fault (geology)|faults]] because concentrations are generally higher over the faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richon, P.|author2=Y.

For this reason, it has been hypothesized that increases in radon concentration is due to the generation of new cracks underground, which would allow increased ground water circulation, flushing out radon. The generation of new cracks might not unreasonably be assumed to precede major earthquakes. In the 1970s and 1980s, scientific measurements of radon emissions near faults found that earthquakes often occurred with no radon signal, and radon was often detected with no earthquake to follow. It was then dismissed by many as an unreliable indicator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102804333 |title= Expert: Earthquakes Hard To Predict| accessdate= 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, it was under investigation as a possible precursor by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthmagazine.org/earth/article/1fe-7d9-4-7 |title=EARTH Magazine: Earthquake prediction: Gone and back again}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon is a known pollutant emitted from [[Geothermal power|geothermal power stations]] because it is present in the material pumped from deep underground. It disperses rapidly, and no radiological hazard has been demonstrated in various investigations. In addition, typical systems re-inject the material deep underground rather that releasing it at the surface, so its environmental impact is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Radon and Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials  (NORM) associated with Hot Rock Geothermal Systems |publisher= Government of South Australia—Primary Industries and Resources SA |accessdate= 2013-07-16 |url= http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/113341/090107_web.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120402134109/http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/113341/090107_web.pdf |archive-date= 2012-04-02 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and '50s, when safety standards requiring expensive ventilation in mines were not widely implemented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of X-rays and Radioactivity in Medicine|author=Mould, Richard Francis|date=1993|isbn=978-0-7503-0224-1|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; radon exposure was linked to lung cancer among non-smoking miners of uranium and other hard rock materials in what is now the Czech Republic, and later among miners from the Southwestern United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn=0040-781X| title=Uranium Miners' Cancer| work=Time| accessdate=2008-06-26| date=1960-12-26| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895156,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irsn.fr/FR/Larecherche/publications-documentation/Publications_documentation/BDD_publi/DRPH/LEADS/Documents/IRPA10-P2A-56.pdf|author=Tirmarche M|author2=Laurier D|author3=Mitton N|author4=Gelas JM|last-author-amp=yes |work=|title=Lung Cancer Risk Associated with Low Chronic Radon Exposure: Results from the French Uranium Miners Cohort and the European Project|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1001/jama.1989.03430050045024| volume=262| last1=Roscoe| first1=R.

During this period, several entrepreneurs opened former uranium mines in the US to the general public and advertised alleged health benefits from breathing radon gas underground. Health benefits claimed included pain, sinus, asthma and arthritis relief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Radon gas mine health benefits advertisement (1953) - on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3869275/radon_gas_mine_health_benefits/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Clipping from The Montana Standard on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3869277/the_montana_standard/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these were proven to be false and the government banned such ads in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Government bans Boulder mine ads about radon health benefits (1975) - on Newspapers.com|url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3869269/government_bans_boulder_mine_ads_about/|website = Newspapers.com|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, ventilation and other measures have been used to reduce radon levels in most affected mines that continue to operate. In recent years, the average annual exposure of uranium miners has fallen to levels similar to the concentrations inhaled in some homes. This has reduced the risk of occupationally induced cancer from radon, although health issues may persist for those who are currently employed in affected mines and for those who have been employed in them in the past.&lt;ref name="Darby05"/&gt; As the relative risk for miners has decreased, so has the ability to detect excess risks among that population.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR06&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/publications/2006_1.html|title= UNSCEAR 2006 Report Vol. I|publisher= United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation UNSCEAR 2006 Report to the General Assembly, with scientific annexes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residues from processing of uranium ore can also be a source of radon. Radon resulting from the high radium content in uncovered dumps and tailing ponds can be easily released into the atmosphere and affect people living in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In addition to lung cancer, researchers have theorized a possible increased risk of [[leukemia]] due to radon exposure. Empirical support from studies of the general population is inconsistent, and a study of uranium miners found a correlation between radon exposure and [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=16759978| title=Incidence of leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in Czech uranium miners: a case-cohort study| last1=Rericha| first1=V.|last2=Kulich |first2=M. |last3=Rericha |first3=R. |last4=Shore |first4=D.

Miners (as well as milling and ore transportation workers) who worked in the uranium industry in the United States between the 1940s and 1971 may be eligible for compensation under the [[Radiation Exposure Compensation Act]] (RECA). Surviving relatives may also apply in cases where the formerly employed person is deceased.

===Domestic-level exposure===
Radon exposure (mostly radon daughters) has been linked to lung cancer in numerous case-control studies performed in the United States, Europe and China. There are approximately 21,000 deaths per year in the US due to radon-induced lung cancers.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html|title=A Citizen's Guide to Radon|date=October 12, 2010|work=www.epa.gov|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most comprehensive radon studies performed in the United States by Dr. [[R. William Field]] and colleagues found a 50% increased lung cancer risk even at the protracted exposures at the EPA's action level of 4 pCi/L. North American and European Pooled analyses further support these findings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100528010149/http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov//advisory/pcp/pcp08-09rpt/PCP_Report_08-09_508.pdf Reducing Environmental Cancer Risk&amp;nbsp;– What We Can Do Now].

Most models of residential radon exposure are based on studies of miners, and direct estimates of the risks posed to homeowners would be more desirable.&lt;ref name="Darby05"/&gt; Because of the difficulties of measuring the risk of radon relative to smoking, models of their effect have often made use of them.

Radon has been considered the second leading cause of lung cancer and leading environmental cause of cancer mortality by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html|title=Health Risks |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have reached similar conclusions for the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="Darby05"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Darby, S|author2=Hill, D|author3=Doll, R|title=Radon: a likely carcinogen at all exposures|journal=[[Annals of Oncology]]|volume=12| date=2005|pmid=11762803|doi=10.1023/A:1012518223463|issue=10|pages=1341–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref name=Catelinois&gt;{{cite journal |author=Catelinois O |title=Lung cancer attributable to indoor radon exposure in france: impact of the risk models and uncertainty analysis |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=114|date=2006|pmid=16966089 |pmc=1570096|issue=9 |doi=10.1289/ehp.9070 |author2=Rogel A |author3=Laurier D|last4=Billon |first4=Solenne |last5=Hemon |first5=Denis |last6=Verger |first6=Pierre |last7=Tirmarche |first7=Margot |pages=1361–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radon exposure in homes and offices may arise from certain subsurface rock formations, and also from certain building materials (e.g., some granites). The greatest risk of radon exposure arises in buildings that are airtight, insufficiently ventilated, and have foundation leaks that allow air from the soil into basements and dwelling rooms.

===Action and reference level===
WHO presented in 2009 a recommended reference level (the national reference level), 100 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for radon in dwellings. The recommendation also says that where this is not possible, 300 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; should be selected as the highest level. A national reference level should not be a limit, but should represent the maximum acceptable annual average radon concentration in a dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547673_eng.pdf WHO Handbook on Indoor Radon]. World Health Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

The actionable concentration of radon in a home varies depending on the organization doing the recommendation, for example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency encourages that action be taken at concentrations as low as 74&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (2&amp;nbsp;pCi/L),&lt;ref name="EPA radon"&gt;{{cite web|title =Radiation Protection: Radon|publisher =[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=November 2007|url =http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/radon.html|accessdate =2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union]] recommends action be taken when concentrations reach 400&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (11&amp;nbsp;pCi/L) for old houses and 200&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (5&amp;nbsp;pCi/L) for new ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/97053/4.6_-RPG4_Rad_Ex1-ed2010_editedViv_layouted.pdf |title= Radon Levels in Dwellings: Fact Sheet 4.6 |date=December 2009 |publisher= European Environment and Health Information System |accessdate= 2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July 2010 the UK's Health Protection Agency issued new advice setting a "Target Level" of 100&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; whilst retaining an "Action Level" of 200&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="HPA radon"&gt;{{cite web|title =HPA issues new advice on radon|publisher =[[UK Health Protection Agency]]|date=July 2010|url =http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2010PressReleases/100708Newadviceonradon/|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100714170654/http://www.hpa.org.uk/NewsCentre/NationalPressReleases/2010PressReleases/100708Newadviceonradon/|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2010-07-14|accessdate =2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same levels (as UK) apply to Norway from 2010; in all new housings preventative measures should be taken against radon accumulation.

===Relationship to smoking===
Results from epidemiological studies indicate that the risk of lung cancer increases with exposure to residential radon. A well-known example of source of error is smoking, the main risk factor for lung cancer. In the West, tobacco smoke is estimated to cause about 90% of all lung cancers.

According to the EPA, the risk of lung cancer for smokers is significant due to synergistic effects of radon and smoking. For this population about 62 people in a total of 1,000 will die of lung cancer compared to 7 people in a total of 1,000 for people who have never smoked.&lt;ref name="epa"/&gt; It cannot be excluded that the risk of non-smokers should be primarily explained by a combination effect of radon and passive smoking (see below).

Radon, like other known or suspected external risk factors for lung cancer, is a threat for smokers and former smokers. This was demonstrated by the European pooling study.&lt;ref name="bmj38308"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.38308.477650.63 |pmid=15613366 |pmc=546066 |title=Radon in homes and risk of lung cancer: Collaborative analysis of individual data from 13 European case-control studies |journal=BMJ |volume=330 |issue=7485 |pages=223 |year=2005 |last1=Darby |first1=S |last2=Hill |first2=D |last3=Auvinen |first3=A |last4=Barros-Dios |first4=J M |last5=Baysson |first5=H |last6=Bochicchio |first6=F |last7=Deo |first7=H |last8=Falk |first8=R |last9=Forastiere |first9=F |last10=Hakama |first10=M |last11=Heid |first11=I |last12=Kreienbrock |first12=L |last13=Kreuzer |first13=M |last14=Lagarde |first14=F |last15=Mäkeläinen |first15=I |last16=Muirhead |first16=C |last17=Oberaigner |first17=W |last18=Pershagen |first18=G |last19=Ruano-Ravina |first19=A |last20=Ruosteenoja |first20=E |last21=Rosario |first21=A Schaffrath |last22=Tirmarche |first22=M |last23=Tomáscaron;ek |first23=L |last24=Whitley |first24=E |last25=Wichmann |first25=H-E |last26=Doll |first26=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; A commentary&lt;ref name="bmj38308"/&gt; to the pooling study stated: "it is not appropriate to talk simply of a risk from radon in homes. The risk is from smoking, compounded by a synergistic effect of radon for smokers. Without smoking, the effect seems to be so small as to be insignificant."

According to the European pooling study, there is a difference in risk from radon between histological types. Small cell lung carcinoma, which practically only affects smokers have high risk from radon. For other histological types such as adenocarcinoma, the type that primarily affects never smokers, the risk from radon appears to be lower.&lt;ref name="bmj38308" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aarst.org/images/PCPanelRadonTest.pdf President's Cancer Panel, Environmental Factors in Cancer: Radon, December 4, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829005508/http://www.aarst.org/images/PCPanelRadonTest.pdf |date=August 29, 2013 }} The American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST)&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also supported by new discussion about the calculation method, [[Linear no-threshold model|LNT]], which routinely has been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/rpd/ncq141|title=Review and evaluation of updated research on the health effects associated with low-dose ionising radiation|date=2010|last1=Dauer|first1=L.

An important, but unanswered question concerns the possibility that the cancer risk from passive smoking can increase with exposure to residential radon. The basic data for the European pooling study makes it impossible to exclude that such synergy effect is an explanation for the (very limited) increase in the risk from radon that was stated for non-smokers.

A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11416777|jstor=3703373|date=2001|last1=Lagarde|first1=F.|last2=Axelsson|first2=G.|last3=Damber|first3=L.|last4=Mellander|first4=H.|last5=Nyberg|first5=F.|last6=Pershagen|first6=G.|title=Residential radon and lung cancer among never-smokers in Sweden|volume=12|issue=4|pages=396–404|journal=Epidemiology|doi=10.1097/00001648-200107000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2001, which included 436 cases (never smokers who had lung cancer), and a control group (1649 never smokers) showed that exposure to radon increased the risk of lung cancer in never smokers. But the group that had been exposed to passive smoking at home appeared to bear the entire risk increase, while those who were not exposed to passive smoking did not show any increased risk with increasing radon level.

===In drinking water===
The effects of radon if ingested are similarly unknown, although studies have found that its biological half-life ranges from 30–70 minutes, with 90 percent removal at 100 minutes. In 1999 National Research Council investigated the issue of radon in drinking water. The risk associated with ingestion was considered almost negligible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309062926 Risk Assessment of Radon in Drinking Water]. Nap.edu (2003-06-01). Retrieved on 2011-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Water from underground sources may contain significant amounts of radon depending on the surrounding rock and soil conditions, whereas surface sources generally do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/radon/basicinformation.cfm |title=Basic Information about Radon in Drinking Water |accessdate=2013-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being ingested through drinking water, radon is also released from water when temperature is increased, pressure is decreased and when water is aerated. Optimum conditions for radon release and exposure occur during showering. Water with a radon concentration of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;pCi/L can increase the indoor airborne radon concentration by 1 pCi/L under normal conditions.&lt;ref name="Thad. Godish 2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indoor Environmental Quality|author=Godish, Thad|date=2001|isbn=978-1-56670-402-1|publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing and mitigation===
{{Main|Radon mitigation}}
[[File:Radon detector.jpg|alt=radon detector|thumb|A digital radon detector]]
[[Image:Radon test kit.jpg|thumb|A radon test kit]]
There are relatively simple tests for radon gas. In some countries these tests are methodically done in areas of known systematic hazards. Radon detection devices are commercially available. Digital radon detectors provide ongoing measurements giving both daily, weekly, short-term and long-term average readouts via a digital display. Short-term radon test devices used for initial screening purposes are inexpensive, in some cases free. There are important protocols for taking short-term radon tests and it is imperative that they be strictly followed. The kit includes a collector that the user hangs in the lowest habitable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long term kits, taking collections for up to one year or more, are also available. An open-land test kit can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins.&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; Radon concentrations can vary daily, and accurate radon exposure estimates require long-term average radon measurements in the spaces where an individual spends a significant amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q10299.html|title=Answer to Question #10299 Submitted to "Ask the Experts"|last=Baes|first=Fred|website=Health Physics Society|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radon levels fluctuate naturally, due to factors like transient weather conditions, so an initial test might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level. Radon levels are at a maximum during the coolest part of the day when pressure differentials are greatest.&lt;ref name="Thad. Godish 2001"/&gt; Therefore, a high result (over 4&amp;nbsp;pCi/L) justifies repeating the test before undertaking more expensive abatement projects. Measurements between 4 and 10&amp;nbsp;pCi/L warrant a long term radon test. Measurements over 10&amp;nbsp;pCi/L warrant only another short term test so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed. Purchasers of real estate are advised to delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to 4&amp;nbsp;pCi/L or less.&lt;ref name=epa /&gt;

Because the half-life of radon is only 3.8 days, removing or isolating the source will greatly reduce the hazard within a few weeks. Another method of reducing radon levels is to modify the building's ventilation. Generally, the indoor radon concentrations increase as ventilation rates decrease.&lt;ref name=USPHS90/&gt; In a well ventilated place, the radon concentration tends to align with outdoor values (typically 10&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ranging from 1 to 100&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=epa /&gt;

The four principal ways of reducing the amount of radon accumulating in a house are:&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO291"&gt;{{cite web |author=World Health Organization |title=Radon and cancer, fact sheet 291 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs291/en/index.html |authorlink=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sub-slab depressurization (soil suction) by increasing under-floor ventilation;
* Improving the ventilation of the house and avoiding the transport of radon from the basement into living rooms;
* Installing a radon sump system in the basement;
* Installing a positive pressurization or positive supply ventilation system.

According to the EPA&lt;ref name="epa" /&gt; the method to reduce radon "...primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside", which is also called sub-slab depressurization, active soil depressurization, or soil suction. Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings. "EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted" and "EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently".&lt;ref name="epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/consguid.html#reductiontech| title = Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive-pressure ventilation systems can be combined with a heat exchanger to recover energy in the process of exchanging air with the outside, and simply exhausting basement air to the outside is not necessarily a viable solution as this can actually draw radon gas ''into'' a dwelling. Homes built on a crawl space may benefit from a radon collector installed under a "radon barrier" (a sheet of plastic that covers the crawl space).&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bspdQ8H2yUcC&amp;pg=PT46|page=46|title=Building radon out a stepbystep guide on how to build radonresistant homes|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-0070-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For crawlspaces, the EPA states "An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes."&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4357">Until 2013, the '''Shawn Hornbeck Foundation''' was a [[non-profit]] [[charitable organization]] based in [[Richwoods, Missouri]], devoted to the search for and rescue of abducted children. It ran the Shawn Hornbeck Search and Rescue Team.

The rescue team was founded by Pam and Craig Akers following the disappearance of their son Shawn Hornbeck. Hornbeck was eleven years old on October 6, 2002, when he was kidnapped while riding his bicycle near his home in Richwoods, Missouri. Shawn Hornbeck was missing for over four years before being discovered on January 12, 2007. He had been kidnapped by [[Michael J. Devlin]].

The Shawn Hornbeck Search and Rescue Team was a member of NASAR (National Association for Search and Rescue) and a member of SARCOM (Search and Rescue Council of Missouri). It was also involved with the National Search Dog Association.

== History ==

The Akers founded the Shawn Hornbeck Search and Rescue Team following the disappearance of their son Shawn Hornbeck.  Hornbeck was eleven years old when he was kidnapped while riding his bicycle near his [[Richwoods, Missouri]], home on October 6, 2002.

Shortly after Hornbeck's disappearance, his parents appeared on ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', where self-described psychic [[Sylvia Browne]] told the Akers that Hornbeck was dead. Browne also described the [[Kidnapping|abduction]], telling them several things about the abductor that later proved to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://stopsylvia.com/articles/montel_shawnhornbeck2.shtml | title=Follow-up to "Montel: Shawn Hornbeck Reading" | author=Lancaster, Robert | authorlink=Robert S.

Hornbeck was missing for over four years before being discovered on January 12, 2007. Police were searching for 13-year-old Ben Ownby of [[Beaufort, Missouri]], who had recently gone missing.  Aided by a descriptive tip from teenager Mitchell Hults of [[Beaufort, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/16/AR2007011601041.html | accessdate=July 13, 2010 | title=Teen Called Hero for Missing-Boy Tip | date=January 17, 2007 | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | author=Leonard, Christopher }}&lt;/ref&gt; police searched [[Michael J. Devlin]]'s apartment in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]]. Hornbeck and Ownby were both found there.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Missing boy in the open: Child had encounter with police just 10 months after disappearance, January 21, 2007, as found in the ''[[Albany Times-Union]]'', January 21, 2007, p. A7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosecution ==

In June 2007, Devlin was charged with 78 counts in the abductions and [[child molestation|molestations]] of Hornbeck and Ownby. On October 8, 2007, Devlin pleaded guilty to all charges filed against him and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref name= "OCT"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,300836,00.html "Devlin Pleads Guilty to Federal Charges for Photographing, Taping Kidnapped Boy"], FOXNews.com, 10 October 2007, Retrieved June 11, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Akers' involvement ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}

Shortly after the rescue of Shawn Hornbeck, his parents announced their withdrawal from active involvement with the foundation.  Its operation would be headed by family friend and co-founder Chris Diamond. Hornbeck is attending community college and has shown an interest in studying fields where he could work with children, such as psychology or social work. He gave advice to the family of kidnapping victim [[Jaycee Dugard]], saying she needed time alone and that the impact of such events was life-changing and not easily comprehended by those who have not been directly affected by such occurrences.

'''Soroka University Medical Center''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: המרכז הרפואי סורוקה, HaMerkaz HaRefu'i Soroka), part of the [[Clalit Health Services]] Group, is the only hospital in the [[Negev]]. Located in the city of [[Beersheba]], [[Israel]], it serves as the central hospital of the region and provides medical services to approximately one million residents of the South, from [[Kiryat Gat]] and [[Ashkelon]] to [[Eilat]]. Soroka is the third largest hospital in Israel, with 1,087 hospital beds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.il/PublicationsFiles/beds2018.pdf|title=MOH report - hospital beds|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is spread over an area of {{convert|291|dunam}} in the center of Beer-Sheva.  

Soroka provides medical care to members of all populations in the region, including [[Negev Bedouins]] and Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79394172.html Care Across Borders]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[teaching hospital]] affiliated with the faculty of Health Sciences at [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] whose campus is adjacent to the hospital.

==History==

Following the [[Israeli War of Independence|War of Independence]], the Medical Corps established a temporary military hospital in one of the [[Ottoman Government|Ottoman government]] buildings in [[Beersheba|Beersheva]]. A year later, the hospital was transferred to a British government compound, where it was run by the [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America|Hadassah Medical Association]] and named after Dr. [[Chaim Yassky]]. 

In 1949, [[Clalit Health Services|Clalit Health Fund of the Hebrew Workers in Eretz Israel]] opened a clinic in the city to serve citizens who were members of the [[Histadrut Haovdim Haleumit|Histadrut]]. This clinic required hospital services for continued treatment. The nearest hospital was the [[Kaplan Medical Center]] in [[Rehovot]], but it was relatively far away, and patients had to travel and endure the poor road conditions of the time until they received treatment.

In 1950, Beersheva was declared a [[Civil authority|civic authority]], with the result that thousands of immigrants went to settle there. With the increase in the number of residents, the existing small hospital was unable to answer the needs of the population.

[[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America|Hadassah]] expressed willingness to expand its facilities, but due to budgetary constraints caused by the construction of [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem]] they were not able to expand the hospital within a reasonable amount of time. 

[[David Ben-Gurion]], with his national approach, thought that the government should establish a hospital in the [[Negev]] and that it should not be established by Hadassah or the Histadrut, but the Health Ministry had no funds to invest in this effort.

[[David Tuviyahu]], who served as [[mayor]] of the city of Beersheva, joined the effort to establish a larger, more spacious and modern hospital. For this purpose, he met with various individuals, among them [[Moshe Soroka]], chairman of the [[Clalit Health Services]]. Soroka expressed his willingness in principle for the [[Histadrut Health Fund]] to establish a hospital, but Minister of Health [[Yosef Serlin]], who aspired to reduce the activity of the fund and transfer it to the state, objected to this idea. 

In August 1955, Dov Begun, representative of the Histadrut in the [[United States]], convinced the president of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]], [[David Dubinsky]] (1892–1982) to donate 1 million USD (a quarter million every year for four years) toward establishing a hospital in the Negev that would commemorate the organization's name&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jta.org/1955/12/20/archive/dubinsky-announces-1000000-gift-by-ilgwu-to-israel-hospital|title=Dubinsky Announces $1,000,000 Gift by Ilgwu to Israel Hospital|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
According to press reports at the time, Dubinsky had indicated that the ILGWU might make a further $500,000 available to the hospital after the $1,000,000 contribution was completed, as the estimated construction cost was $1,500,000.&lt;sup&gt;[[Soroka Medical Center#cite%20note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;[[Soroka Medical Center#cite%20note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

At the end of that year, a new government was formed and [[Yisrael Barzilai]] was appointed minister of health. He supported the establishment of the hospital and convinced Ben-Gurion to allow Clalit to set up a new hospital in Beersheva, while the Ministry of Health would establish one in [[Ashkelon]] (now [[Barzilai Medical Center]]). One of the things that convinced Ben-Gurion was his fear that the planned [[Sinai War]] would result in a shortage of hospital beds for wounded soldiers.

On July 23, 1956, ground was broken on the new hospital. The hospital building was designed by architects [[Arieh Sharon]] and Benjamin Idelson. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ariehsharon.org/UniversitiesHospitals/Soroka-Health-Centre-Beersheba/16375229_85yjA/2/1252989363_FBqMdhT#1252989363_FBqMdhT Soroka Health Centre, Beersheba 1959 ]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1959, the opening ceremony of the Central Hospital of the Negev was held. At first, the hospital contained several vital departments: the [[General surgery|General Surgery]] Department (in the framework of which were the [[Otolaryngology]] Department, the [[Ophthalmology]] Department, and the [[Urology]] Department), two [[internal medicine]] departments, the [[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopedic]] Department, the [[Cardiology]] Institute, and the [[Radiology]] Institute. Later, additional departments were opened. 

After the death of Moshe Soroka, the director of Clalit Health Organization in the 1950s who played a significant role in establishing the hospital, it was decided to name the hospital in his memory.

[[Image:Negev MC 1959.jpg|thumb|Soroka Hospital, 1959]]
  
In 2018, Shlomi Codish was named director-general of the hospital replacing Ehud Davidson, who held the post for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hospitals.clalit.co.il/hospitals/soroka/en-us/AboutE/Management/Pages/Homepage.aspx Management of the Soroka University Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Campus==

The hospital covers an area of 291 dunams, with a constructed area of more than 200,000 square meters, and includes 30 buildings.

Among the buildings on campus are the following: 

* The [[Internal medicine|Internal Medicine]] Building, located at the center of the campus, houses most of the departments from the field of internal medicine: the internal medicine departments, the [[Neurology]] Department, the [[Nephrology]] Department and the [[Dialysis]] Unit, the [[Oncology]] Department, and the [[Hematology]] Department.
* The Camelia Botnar Surgical Building was inaugurated in 2003. It contains the hospital's state-of-the-art [[Operating theater|operating rooms]], six patient wards, the [[Emergency department|Emergency Room]], the [[Intensive care unit|Intensive Care Unit]], and other units.
* The Saban Center for [[Pediatrics|Pediatric Medicine]], inaugurated in 2008, includes the Pediatric Emergency Room, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, the three pediatric inpatient wards, the Pediatric Surgery Department, the Hemato-Oncology Department, and the Department of [[Eating disorder|Eating Disorders]].
* The Saban Birth and Maternity Center was inaugurated in 2011 and includes 25 spacious and protected individual delivery rooms, the [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|gynecology and obstetrics]] emergency rooms, advanced operating rooms, and five maternity wards.
* The Legacy Heritage Oncology Center and Dr. Larry Norton Institute, inaugurated in 2018, provides all the services in the field of [[cancer treatment]] and [[research]] under one roof.
* In the coming years, additional buildings, among them the [[rehabilitation medicine]] building, will be constructed in the hospital compound. At present, there is a rehabilitation department with 20 beds. The hospital is currently working on the project of constructing a rehabilitation building that will allow the expansion of both hospitalization and ambulatory services.

==Soroka in numbers==

Soroka Medical Center has over 40 inpatient departments and 1,087 hospital beds. In addition to the hospital departments, there are dozens of other units that provide services to hospitalized and ambulatory patients, in the [[Emergency department|Emergency Medicine Department]], institutes, and outpatient clinics.

Soroka's Department of [[Emergency medicine|Emergency Medicine]], with the largest volume of activity in Israel (over 240,000 visits annually), is the leading such department in the country according to a health care survey on service and quality conducted by the Ministry of Health.

Soroka's delivery room has the most births of any in the country – over 17,000 babies are born every year.

In 2017, over 30,000 surgeries were performed at the hospital and 98,000 hospitalizations took place. There were over 590,000 visits to the outpatient clinics.

Soroka has some 4,600 employees, including approximately 900 doctors, 1,600 nurses, 500 health workers and 500 administrative employees.

==Patients at Soroka==
Soroka Medical Center provides medical services to more than one million residents of the [[Negev]] who reside in a vast geographical area that comprises 60% of the country. The population of the Negev is relatively young, culturally diverse, largely of low to middle-level socioeconomic status&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2016n/24_16_330t2.pdf|title=Central Bureau of Statistics report - socio-economic index of local autorities|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and has unique health needs.

Unique populations cared for at Soroka include [[Bedouins]], who make up nearly a third of the population and large groups of immigrants from [[Beta Israel|Ethiopia]] and the [[former Soviet Union]]. 

==Standards of Safety and Quality==

* The [[Joint Commission International]] (JCI)  Quality and Safety Certificate - Soroka Medical Center was one of three Clalit hospitals which were the first in Israel to receive the certificate of accreditation of the JCI in 2008. 

* Standards for [[Environmental management system|Environmental Management Systems]] (ISO 14001) - Soroka is a green hospital. In 2014 the medical center was awarded the Environmental Quality Award.
* Health Information Security Standard ([[Iso 27799|ISO 27799]]).
* Quality Management Standard ([[ISO 9000]]) was granted to the Neonatal Intensive Care unit and the logistics department.

==A University Medical Center==
Soroka Medical Center is a university medical center that maintains close ties with [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] (BGU). In this framework, the hospital staff partners in training the future generation of clinicians and managers in the health system in various fields: [[medicine]], [[nursing]], [[Physical therapy|physiotherapy]], [[emergency medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[Medical laboratory scientist|medical laboratory]], [[public health]], and [[health systems management]]. Approximately 1,000 students study at the hospital annually. The campus of BGU's Faculty of [[Health Sciences]] is located in the hospital compound.

==Research==
Many [[Clinical trial|clinical trials]] approved by the [[Declaration of Helsinki|Helsinki Committee]] are conducted at Soroka. As of 2018, the committee is chaired by Prof. Reli Hershkovitz.

A center for [[clinical research]] operates at Soroka, leading and promoting research with hospital staff and colleagues outside of the hospital in [[Israel]] and abroad, sometimes in cooperation with [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev|BGU]].

Every year, approximately 300 new studies are approved at the hospital, and some 300 articles on research of clinical and managerial significance have been published in the scientific literature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SOROKA%5BAffiliation%5D)%20AND%20(%222008%22%5BDate%20-%20Publication%5D%20%3A%20%222018%22%5BDate%20-%20Publication%5D)|title=Soroka's staff publications over the last decade|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Soroka in Times of Emergency==
Soroka Medical Center has accumulated extensive experience over the years in managing various emergency situations.

* [[Mass-casualty incident|Mass-casualty incidents]] – [[road accidents]], [[Earthquake|earthquakes]], terrorist incidents, and so on. 
* Situations of regional or comprehensive fighting – during times of combat in the South (such as [[Operation Protective Edge]]), Soroka Medical Center, is also subject to rocket fire and remains fully operational while ensuring protection for patients and professional teams and providing continuous service to the hospitalized and injured.

The emergency events are managed by a dedicated staff at the hospital in cooperation with many bodies in accordance with the nature of the event: the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], the [[Israel Police]], [[Magen David Adom]], the [[Home Front Command]], other hospitals, and more.

==Activities for the Community==
Soroka Medical Center is located in the community it serves and works to develop and promote programs aimed at improving quality of life and community health. The staff members of Soroka take part in a wide variety of social activities within and outside of the hospital. The activities are adapted to different target audiences.
Among the activities:
• Soroka at the Bar – a series of lectures by hospital experts on various subjects for the general public 
• Ushpizin – lectures by medical staff from various fields of medicine for high school students and tours of various departments

'''Svenska Federationen''' (Swedish Federation), was the Swedish branch of the British [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]]. It was established in 1878 with the purpose to repeal the so-called reglementation system, which required prostitute women to registration and regular medical examination to prevent [[sexually transmitted infection]]s. It also opposed the sexual [[double standard]], which regarded men as naturally unable to sexual self-control and viewed prostitutes as the sole problem. The ''Svenska Federationen'' was dissolved after the reglementation system was abolished in 1918. Between 1878 and 1905, it published its own paper, ''Sedlighetsvännen'' (Friend of Virtue).

== History ==
In 1812, a new law allowed for forced medical examination of people suspected for suffering of a sexually transmitted infection to prevent the spreading of disease. The law did not specify gender, but it was in practice mostly forced upon women in the capital suspected of prostitution. The reason for this was the contemporary sexual view that men were incapable of sexual self-control, and the focus of the authorities were therefore placed on prostitute women, who were described as the problem in the battle against sexual disease. However, the law was met with rising opposition, as the police harassed women on mere suspicion of being prostitutes, such as for example [[Barmaid|bar waitresses]], and a different method was therefore deemed necessary. E experiment with state licensed brothels, [[London and Stadt Hamburg]], failed in 1838–41. In 1847, the first bureau for registration and regular weekly medical examinations of prostitutes were founded in Stockholm: in 1859, all prostitutes were forced to registration at such a bureau. This was not a national law: it was a question for the local city authorities, and after it was introduced in the capital, some Swedish cities, but not all, followed: the second was [[Gothenburg]] in 1865.

''Svenska Federationen'' was founded by A. Testuz, vicar of the French Reformed Church in Stockholm in February 1878. It was inspired by the British [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]] of [[Josephine Butler]]. It was organized in 1879 and formed its rules in Stockholm 24 November 1880. Known members was [[Ellen Bergman]], a key front figure of the organization, and [[Karolina Widerström]], Sweden's first woman physician and chairperson of the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]].

=== Purpose ===
''Svenska Federationen'' deemed the regulation system as humiliating and socially stigmatizing: after being registered, the prostitutes were made to hand in their passport and exchange it for control books which were stamped after their weekly examination. This branded them as prostitutes which was at the time a social stigma, and prevented them from leaving town. They could only be removed from the registration bureau by a statement that they no longer engaged in prostitution, signed by an employer or a husband.

''Svenska Federationen'' also opposed the justification of this regulation, which was the contemporary sexual double standards that branded men as incapable of sexual self-control and that prostitutes were therefore necessary to protect other women from rape, which resulted in the view that it was the prostitute women who was solely blamed for the spreading of sexual disease: the organisation wished to shift the blame from prostitutes to their male customers. This attempt to change contemporary sexual standard and opposition to double standards were conducted in parallel with the ''[[Sedlighetsdebatten]]''.

=== Methods ===
Since its foundation in 1878, ''Svenska Federationen'' published its own paper, and worked actively on public opinion through meetings, debate and publications. It also founded a Sunday club, a fund, hostels, working homes and employment agencies to help women who engaged in prostitution or were about to become so. It attempted to organize in all of the Swedish cities were the regulation system was in practice, as well as in Denmark and Norway, but most of its activity was to remain restricted to the capital of Stockholm.

=== Results ===
The ''Svenska Federationen'' presented petitions to the governor of Stockholm in 1880 and 1902, and to the monarch in 1883. In 1903, a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)]] was made in the [[Riksdag]] to investigate a method other than the reglementation of prostitutes to stop the spreading of Sexually transmitted infection. A government committee was formed, which presented their suggestion in 1910. The reglementation system was finally abolished in Sweden by the ''Lex Veneris'' Act of 1918. At the time of its abolition, the reglementation was already abolished in all cities where it had occurred except in the capital itself.

Usually referred to as SITA, the '''Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm''' is a method to test for [[visual field loss]], usually in [[glaucoma]] testing or monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Bengtsson B, Olsson J, Heijl A, Rootzén H. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0420.1997.tb00392.x/full A new generation of algorithms for computerized threshold perimetry, SITA]. Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 1997 Aug;75(4):368-75.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is combined with a [[visual field test]] such as standard automated perimetry (SAP) or short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) to determine visual fields in a more efficient manner.

Standard automated perimetry determines how dim of light (the threshold) can be seen at various points in an individual eye's visual field.  Various algorithms have been developed to determine this threshold in the dozens to over a hundred individual points in a single visual field.  The SITA algorithm optimizes the determination of perimetry thresholds by continuously estimating what the expected threshold is based on the patient's age and neighboring thresholds.  In this manner, it can reduce the time necessary to acquire a visual field by up to 50%, and it decreases patient fatigue and increases reliability.  SITA mode is now widely used in many computerized automated perimeters.

The testing mode interrupts testing when [[measurement error]] is reached.  This results in a shorter test time with reportedly equal accuracy as other automated threshold visual fields.

[[File:Ted on Everest Skydive.jpg|thumb]]

'''Ted Atkins''' (11 August 1958 – 20 August 2018)&lt;ref name="N T death"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dixit |first1=Kunda |title=Ted Atkins killed in climb |url=https://www.nepalitimes.com/latest/ted-atkins-killed-in-climb/ |publisher=Nepali Times |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamwanderlust.com/news/climber-ian-ted-atkins-and-mountain-guide-philipp-angelo-killed-in-accidents|title=Climber Ian 'Ted' Atkins and mountain guide Philipp Angelo killed in accidents|date=24 August 2018|work=dreamwanderlust.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English explorer, engineer, mountaineer and inventor.

== Education==

Expelled from school, he later achieved various qualifications required by the RAF, and studied MBA to certificate.

== Career ==

After thirty three years of [[Royal Air Force]] service he left as an Engineering Officer. He worked on Nimrod, Tornado jets and lastly as the Chief Engineer on Sea King Search and Rescue helicopters. Between engineering jobs he was the Staff Officer RAF Mountain Rescue Service in charge of teams in [[Scotland]]. In this position he took the first RAF team to climb Mt. Everest in 2001. This was a success and the first summit of Everest by an RAF team.

Ted has always been an outdoors person. He joined the RAF Mountain Rescue Service as a volunteer in 1979 as a ‘Troop’, and served on several teams before Everest. During Mountain Rescue service he led the first RAF team to climb the North Face of the Eiger. He spent a year exploring in Antarctica where he was a mountain leader, surveyor and cartographer making maps of places no one had ever seen. He made 28 first ascents of mountains there. That was then followed by a period of service with the Royal Navy on HMS Endurance, principally as a marine engineer but also serving with the Royal Marines as their Mountain Leader. In this role he was awarded his coveted ‘Green Beret’ for work with the Marines on an Antarctic rescue mission where he led one of the two detachments. For his Antarctic work, he was invested with the Polar Medal by HM The Queen. His last job with the Service was attached to the SAS as the Project Officer for a 100% successful ascent of Everest.

He has maintained a 44-year link of service to his old Air Training Corps squadron 2425 in [[Nottinghamshire]] throughout and served as a reservist.

In his early career Ted was a boxer and was an RAF champion. Mountaineering in all of its forms was always a part of his life. Ted was an avid rock climber, later in Scotland discovering what would become his passion till he died, winter climbing. He was a BASI and Joint Service ski instructor in Alpine and Nordic disciplines and a hang glider pilot.

== Mountain Resume==

From rock and winter climbing Ted went to the Alps and onto the Himalayas, first in 1983 to Manaslu then onto the West Ridge of Everest in 1988. This is where he became involved with oxygen systems. This expedition was unsuccessful on a number of fronts but did sow the seed for the RAF Everest Expedition in 2001. In 1987 he was the Climbing Leader on the phenomenally successful Gimaghella expedition led by Marine Maj. Pat Parsons. This was a new route and first British ascent in good style.

Ted did not summit with the RAF Everest team because one of the team members got sick on the summit push. Ted and his partner Dr. Brian Kirkpatrick lost their summit making the rescue. He went back to Everest, this time to the south in Nepal in 2004 to climb the mountain on his own. Using his engineering head he deduced that the greatest aid to staying alive, keeping all fingers and toes, and success was to have a good oxygen delivery system. This was not available so he set out to invent one. This he did one day prior to setting off for the summit. The prototype had a condom inside a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle as the core component. People said he would die. One of his cylinders went missing on the mountain. He was left for dead on the summit but was saved by Mingma Sherpa and Andrew Lock. However the speed of his ascent had been noted by other climbers and he was asked by Jagged Globe to make commercial systems (without string or condoms was the condition). One year later and this system became the industry standard.

== Post RAF==

Ted set up business in Nepal and continued to develop and improve the oxygen systems used on Mt Everest and other high mountains. At this time it was considered that 1:10 people attempting Everest would die trying. Some years later he got a letter from the Nepalese Mountaineering Association thanking him for reducing the death rate from 1:10 to less than 1:700 (no typo). The Topout  (Topout, to succeed, to summit a mountain or route) system was firmly established. The demand was such that Ted had to leave the Service early to concentrate on this new business. He went onto produce a new cylinder, cylinder valve, regulator and flow controller. Lastly he has built a plant to produce oxygen in Nepal in order to guarantee the quality of the gas that Topout supplies.
A request to work with the Everest Skydive Team was taken up to give them a better oxygen system for jumps exiting the aircraft level with the summit of Everest. This was an outstanding success. The Topout Aero skydive system went on to become the industry standard some years ago and a number of world records have been set. This continues to evolve and now in the Military guise is MTOS, Military Tactical Oxygen System. As part of this new work Ted trained as a skydiver and earned one world record.  He worked with Red Bull on the Mt Blanc project.
Ted was a Science and Engineering Ambassador with a remit to stimulate and encourage (mainly) young people into science and engineering. He was an acclaimed public and motivational speaker. He has delivered talks in: UK, USA, Nepal, France and Italy where he lived in the Dolomites. In Nepal he was involved with several charity organizations inc: Duke of Edinburgh and was a trustee of an orphanage. He wrote a column in Nepal called Outside In where he told of the visitors' views of Nepal with the aim of making things better. He spoke to, and worked with the industry in Nepal and tried to influence events.

== Mountains==

Continuing work on the evolution of various mountaineering oxygen systems has required big mountains to be climbed. Since Everest in 2004, Ted climbed: [[Makalu]], [[Kangchenjunga]], [[Lhotse]], [[Lobuche]] East, and [[Ama Dablam]]. Ama Dablam was unique in that he parachuted into the Base Camp setting a world record then went onto climb the mountain. He was an avid skier on his home turf in Italy and a passionate mountaineer especially for winter climbing.
He died descending [[Monte Civetta]], one of the highest mountains of the Dolomites in the province of Belluno (Italy), on 20 August 2018.&lt;ref name="N T death" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3082">'''Tele-audiology''' is the utilization of [[telehealth]] to provide [[audiological]] services and may include the full scope of audiological practice.

This term was first used by Dr. Gregg Givens in 1999 in reference to a system being developed at [[East Carolina University]] in North Carolina, USA. The first Internet audiological test was accomplished in 2000 by Givens, Balch and Keller.

The first Transatlantic teleaudiology test was performed in April 2009 when Dr James Hall tested a patient in South Africa from Dallas at the AAA conference. Since that historic event the interest in tele-audiology increased significantly.

'''There are 2 types of teleaudiology tests:'''

'''Store-and-forward (Asynchronous) tests'''
Testing a patient and then transferring the results via emailing or the Internet to a professional that will look at the results

'''Real-time (Synchronous) tests'''
Testing a patient in real-time as if the patient is sitting in front of you. Audiologists are used to testing patients remotely because testing a patient in a sound booth while the audiologist sits outside the booth is virtually the same as testing a patient over the Internet. The window is not a real glass window but a teleconference window. The only real difference is that the physical distance changed.

Private sector participation (also called "[[water privatization]]" or "public-private partnerships", PPP) in water supply and sanitation in [[Colombia]] has been more stable and successful than in some other Latin American countries such as [[Water privatization in Argentina|Argentina]] or [[Water privatization in Bolivia|Bolivia]]. According to the [[World Bank]], between 1996 and 2007, more than 40 water and sanitation service provision contracts have been awarded to private or mixed companies in Colombia, serving a combined population of 7.3 million or more than 20% of the urban population.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt; According to the Colombian water regulator, there were even more public-private partnerships for water and sanitation in Colombia in 2004: 125 private and 48 mixed public-private water companies, including large, medium and small companies.&lt;ref name="SUI"&gt;{{cite web

They relied mainly on public funding, complemented by limited private funding. The design was based on the central government providing grants in the start-up years to rehabilitate deteriorated systems and to expand access, while the contracting municipal governments also made budgetary transfers on an annual basis to complement revenues. Colombia thus departed from the standard concession approach, which requires private concessionaires to finance investments with their own resources. 

According to the World Bank, the key to success of private sector participation in the Colombian water sector has been the development of homegrown solutions, and, at times, skillfully adapting models used elsewhere to the particular circumstances and culture of Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

Private sector involvement in the Colombian water sector began in 1995 in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], with support from the [[World Bank]]. It was followed by a second contract in [[Barranquilla]] in 1996 and more concessions in the next years in [[Santa Marta]], [[Tunja]], [[Montería]], [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]], [[Girardot, Cundinamarca|Girardot]], and [[Riohacha]].&lt;ref name="Inter-American Development Bank IDB 2006"&gt;{{cite web

In a "mixed-capital" company in which the service is jointly controlled by municipal governments and private "operating partners" operating partners must meet ambitious targets ensuring that coverage is extended to low-income areas quickly — sometimes before the current mayor concludes his term in office. In exchange they receive an annual management fee and a percentage of revenues. A second group of contracts started in 2001 with the implementation by the central government of the Enterprise Modernization Program (PME - Programa de Modernización de Empresas), which focused on turning around public water utilities in small cities and towns with high rates of poverty and poor network condition.&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;Philippe Marin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=D7YsorFRVLkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Public-Private+Partnerships+for+Urban+Water+Utilities+Experiences+in+Developing+Countries+marin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AhLLTKBVyS&amp;sig=29wImHvaGysyjkd2Fk5ozb9lqS0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7bsKTNDKI5-g4QbRi-2kAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Water Utilities Experiences in Developing Countries], World Bank, 2009, p. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of private sector participation ==

Studies on the impact of private sector participation in Colombia show that it had a positive impact on service quality. There were also significant increases in access in a short time frame under private contracts. However, there are no conclusive results showing that access increased more rapidly under private contracts than in the case of public utilities. There has been a slight average reduction in water losses in privatized utilities. In at least one city (Cartagena), real tariffs declined substantially, indicating that the operator passed on efficiency gains to consumers. None of the studies showed negative impacts of water privatization on access, service quality, operational efficiency or tariff levels.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gomes-Lobo"&gt;Gomes-Lobo, Andrés, and M. Melendez: Social Policy, Regulation and Private Sector Participation: the Case of Colombia. [[United Nations Research Institute for Social Development]] (UNRISD) Working Paper, April 2007, Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on access ===
According to a study by the World Bank relying on data of Colombia's regulatory agency, private water projects in Colombia have performed well in expanding access. The study notes that progress achieved in Colombia for access to water supply and sewerage services is not due to water privatization per se, but must be credited to good performers in both the public and private sectors, and a national policy that fosters accountability and efficiency.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt; 

Successful public utilities include EAAB in [[Bogotá]], which made strong progress in access over the last decade, reaching universal coverage. The performance of the public utility EPM in [[Medellín]] was comparable for expanding access to that of the largest PPP, that of Barranquilla. Colombia's nine largest and/or oldest PPPs, the two mixed-ownership companies in Barranquilla (serving 1.3 million people) and Cartagena (serving 1 million) also have good records in expanding access. That in Barranquilla made notable progress in both water supply and sewerage services: coverage rose from 86 percent to 96 percent for water and from 70 percent to 93 percent for sewerage (1997&amp;ndash;2006). In Cartagena water supply coverage jumped from 74 percent to almost universal coverage, while sewer coverage went up from 62 percent to 79 percent (1996&amp;ndash;2006). Cartagena achieved full water supply coverage despite a 50 percent jump in the size of its population during the same period, largely due to the arrival of poor rural migrants. Half a million people gained access and 60 percent of the new connections benefited families in the poorest income quintile. To achieve universal coverage, the operator in Cartagena made extensive use of community bulk-supply schemes that provide safe water to the many illegal settlements that were expanding on the city's periphery.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt; 

In [[Santa Marta]], water coverage improved rapidly during the first three years, going from 74 percent to 87 percent, but has stagnated since 2001 (access to sewerage followed the same pattern). In [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]] (220,000) and [[Girardot, Cundinamarca|Girardot]](100,000), full coverage was achieved for both water and sewerage. In the city of [[Tunja]] (120,000 people) both water and sewer coverage went up from 89 percent in 1996 at the start of the concession to 100 percent four years later. The company Conhydra in the department of Antioquia achieved full water coverage within a few years in the towns of [[Marinilla]], Santafe, and [[Puerto Berrio]] (combined population 170,000) starting from levels of 80 – 90 percent.&lt;ref name="Marin"/&gt;

The first contract under the PME program was awarded in 2000 in [[Montería]] (350,000 people). Starting from a low 63 percent, water coverage had increased to 96 percent by 2007, catching up with the national urban average. The population with access to piped water more than doubled. The improvement in sewer coverage was more modest, up from 26 percent to around 40 percent. In [[Soledad, Atlántico|Soledad]] (400,000 people), coverage went up from 65 percent to 84 percent for water, and from 36 percent to 73 percent for sewerage in just five years.

=== Impact on water losses ===

The evolution of the water losses - as measured by [[Non-revenue water]] - for the nine largest and/or oldest PPP projects shows a mixed record. Strong gains were made in Montería, Tunja, Marinilla, and Palmira, but the reduction was modest in Cartagena, Barranquilla, and Santa Marta, and no progress was achieved in Girardot or Soledad. Reductions were achieved while the average network pressure went up significantly as service continuity was reestablished, which would have increased losses if no improvements had been made in the hydraulics of the distribution networks.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on efficiency ===

In the case of Cartagena, the World Bank has estimated efficiency gains by comparing the evolution of the ratio of collected revenues to operational costs (operating ratio) on the one hand to that of the average tariff level on the other hand. The operating ratio is driven essentially by two factors: the evolution of operational costs and collection rates, which are controlled by the private operator, and the evolution of the average tariff, which is exogenous. Whenever the operating ratio increases faster than the tariff, efficiency gains are taking place. The Cartagena privatization achieved significant improvements in efficiency. This is reflected in the doubling over a decade (1995&amp;ndash;2005) in the ratio of collected revenues to operational costs. At the same time, the average tariff was halved in real terms, suggesting that a significant portion of the savings achieved through efficiency gains was passed to customers.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other impacts ===
Water rationing was less frequent in ten cities five years after the private sector became involved in providing services. Studies based on household and public health surveys show that private operators tend to achieve better potability figures than public water utilities.&lt;ref name="Gomes-Lobo"/&gt;

== Local operators ==
The largest private water company in Colombia is Triple A (AAA), a Colombian company serving more than 1.5 million people. It has a strategic partnership with the publicly owned water utility of Madrid (Canal Isabel II). It is in practice managed by nationals and has been branding itself as a Colombian private company. The company was willing to focus on a market segment that other companies tend to avoid: the poorest cities. For example, in [[Barranquilla]], more than 76 percent of AAA's customers are in the three lowest of six income segments used by the Colombian government. In [[Soledad, Atlántico|Soledad]], 98 percent of the population is in the three lowest segments, and poverty levels are similarly high in all the other municipalities where AAA operates. Other Colombian water operators are EIS, Conhydra and Sala.

Colombian construction companies that were active in the water sector were awarded PPP contracts following tenders in which only local investors participated. In all these cases, governments chose to ease prequalification criteria to increase competition, resorting to various mechanisms to ensure the winning bidder would be able to operate the water utility. In Colombia, the winning bidders contracted experienced technical staff (often former managers and engineers from public utilities). Between 2001 and 2004, Colombian investors won almost all the PPP contracts awarded in that country under the PME program.&lt;ref&gt;Marin, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of Barranquilla ==
In 1996, more than 60 percent of Barranquilla's population had no water service at all or had it for only a few hours a day. The private operator was initially met with skepticism. When AAA began to install residential water meters in homes that had never had them, many consumers worried that the devices would result in big water bill increases. Opposition politicians like  Guillermo Hoenisgberg initially opposed the private operator for ideological reasons, but later supported him. AAA earned the trust of its customers and political support by going to the poorest neighborhoods, interviewing thousands of people with the goal of understanding their expectations and assumptions regarding water and sanitation. The company then conducted a massive communications campaign with more than 40 staff, many of them social workers by profession, to work full-time in community outreach. Simultaneously, AAA adopted an aggressive external relations strategy that contrasts sharply with the cautious, low-profile approach preferred by water companies in many other Latin American cities. AAA runs elaborate public information campaigns in radio, television and the press. It also regularly hosts lunches and workshops for local journalists where company officials offer detailed explanations of the company's activities and answer questions.&lt;ref name="Inter-American Development Bank IDB 2006"/&gt;

Instead of installing meters and immediately sending out bills, AAA decided to use a gradual approach. In some cases the company would start by delivering water for free, and then bill new customers for 10 cubic meters of water per month, even if their actual consumption was far higher. After two months the fee would be based on 20 cubic meters, and after six months, it would be based on actual consumption. According to company officials, this approach relieved most consumers’ anxiety about the water meter and encouraged them to start monitoring their own consumption.&lt;ref name="Inter-American Development Bank IDB 2006"/&gt;

AAA also began to disconnect consumers who weren’t paying, a potentially explosive issue. Many wealthy individuals and important companies were in the habit of ignoring water bills. And the notion of cutting off water to people in poor communities was obviously problematic. The company therefore developed a comprehensive system to facilitate and encourage payment among low-income customers, acknowledging the reality that many low-income families in Barranquilla live day-to-day on small amounts of cash earned from informal occupations. As a result, AAA has established partnerships with virtually all of Barranquilla's pawnshops that enable people to pay their water bill while conducting other transactions. Similar partnerships allow customers to pay their water bills at banks, department stores, grocery chains, and sports clubs through the city. Despite these measures, thousands of AAA's low-income customers still miss their payments each month, and thousands more have their water cut off when they go for two months without paying. To ensure that cutoffs are short-lived, every month AAA billing agents set up portable, outdoor "payment stations" in low-income neighborhoods. Local residents approach the stations and work out customized payment plans ("convenios de pago") with the agents. The plans allow customers to catch up on missed payments over several months, so long as they pay the current month's fee—and they result in immediate restoration of water service. AAA also developed a program to reward customers who consistently pay their bill. The program, known as "Supercliente" (super customer) awards modest prizes and certificates to customers who stay on top of their bill. As a result, billing efficiency increased from 66% in 1996 to 87% in 2004.&lt;ref name="Inter-American Development Bank IDB 2006"/&gt;
